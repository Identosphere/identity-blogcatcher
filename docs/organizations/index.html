<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce the launch of the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) Proof of Concept Community Group, which aims to test the technical hypotheses underlying the <a href="https://www.gainforum.org/GAINWhitePaper.pdf">“GAIN Digital Trust” </a>white paper.</p>
<p>Back in September 2021, more than 150 co-authors called for the creation of a globally interoperable network for high-trust identity assurance. It was a “no logo, pro bono, open source” collaboration. Since then, an informal alpha proof of concept (POC) has been connecting Identity Information Providers and Relying Parties, leveraging OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance. Now, under the auspices of the OpenID Foundation, the group will be able to grow and test whether identity information can be shared across a variety of architectures, protocols, and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Community Group will meet each Thursday at 7pm UTC beginning Thursday, March 3, 2022. Further information about the POC, including meeting details, FAQs, events, media, and other resources, can be found on the <a href="https://openid.net/gainpoc/">GAIN Community Group webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Enrollment in the POC is open to the public including organizations and individuals. If you are interested in becoming a member of the POC, please complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/LLG4VYGc4rUrZvXd6">registration form</a>&nbsp;and sign the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId%3Db7fc4075-3d35-44c5-954f-524ad0594cf8%26env%3Dna1%26acct%3Db25f9dff-690e-415a-9695-92ea42395ccd%26v%3D2&amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;ust=1646313761000000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2cz0TPpInTCKBvAcfxnopU">Participation Agreement</a>.

 Energy Web Announces Development of Renewable Energy EV Charging with Vodafone and Mastercard, Part of Vodafone’s New Economy of Things&nbsp;Platform <p>Newbury, England, and Zug, Switzerland, 28 February 2022 — Energy Web, the non-profit building operating systems for energy grids, has announced today a collaboration with Vodafone and Mastercard to develop a new “Economy of Things” (EoT) platform. The platform will allow verified connected devices on Vodafone’s Digital Asset Broker (DAB) to transact seamlessly and securely with full owner control. This includes electric vehicles (EV) transacting directly with charging points, as well as interactions between other vehicles, machines, and IoT assets, unlocking value from billions of&nbsp;devices.</p><p>The service went live in a trial of a connected EV communicating autonomously and securely with a charging point in Newbury, UK. This trial marks the first-ever showcase of a 100% clean energy charging solution for electric vehicles (EVs). The solution, which can be adapted to work with any charging infrastructure and any EV worldwide, including on-street chargers connected to the grid, will allow users to verify and prove that the energy used to charge their EV comes from renewable sources.</p><blockquote>Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web Foundation, said: “Electrification is a major part of global decarbonization efforts. However, there’s currently no way for EV drivers to ensure that all the electricity used to charge their vehicles comes from renewable sources. As access to green energy solutions is democratized, this is sorely needed. Working with any on-street EV charger, our solution can give individuals and companies assurance of clean energy use — a real game changer for EV users and companies with electric&nbsp;fleets.”</blockquote><p>The Green Charging application provides a transparent process for fractionalizing RECs allowing anybody to acquire proof that the energy purchased for charging is certifiably from renewable sources. Using a single application with an integrated mobile wallet, users can also pick the best-priced electricity based on location and charge time, and pay for it automatically. When an EV is plugged in, the car and charging station identify themselves using Vodafone’s network, while payments for the energy are made using Mastercard’s payment gateways. Proof of green charging is sent to the user’s smartphone by Energy Web, including the exact origin and energy&nbsp;type.</p><p>By giving drivers real-time information on the status and compatibility of the nearest available charging point, and carrying out the transaction effortlessly, Vodafone’s EV service will eliminate “range anxiety” — the fear experienced by EV drivers of running out of battery life. It also allows customers to consciously choose renewable electricity providers.</p><blockquote>Johan Wibergh, Vodafone Chief Technology Officer, said: “We are building in-house new, scaled platforms for our customers across Europe and Africa. This, our latest platform, will drive the new Economy of Things where everyday objects and devices can negotiate, buy and sell services on our behalf. We are actively talking with many other companies to rapidly expand partnerships and widen the ecosystem worldwide to include other features and payment schemes.”</blockquote><p>The service goes live today in a market-leading trial in which a connected EV communicates autonomously and securely with a charging point, in Newbury, UK. Working with Mastercard and Energy Web — a not-for-profit organization focused on decarbonizing energy grids — motorists are sent real-time information on the status and compatibility of the nearest available charging point and can authorize their vehicle to recharge effortlessly. Vodafone believes the platform will eliminate ‘range anxiety’ — the fear of running out of battery life — and enable customers to consciously choose renewable electricity providers.</p><p>This green-charging solution is planned to be rolled out at an enterprise level in the coming months — as a growing number of companies adopt new processes aimed at engendering transparency around energy reporting. Applied at scale, this application could service entire vehicular fleets, taxi firms, logistics companies, and haulage firms, with corporate customers integrating the application into their emissions reports as trustworthy proof that EVs used in their operations are powered by renewable energy.</p> Note to&nbsp;Editors <p>Leading Electric Vehicle (EV) trial with Mastercard and&nbsp;Vodafone</p><p>Vodafone DAB has been installed at its UK technology center in Newbury to demonstrate how motorists, using a single App with an integrated mobile wallet, can pick the best-priced electricity based on location and charge time, and pay for it automatically. Initially available on a smartphone or tablet, Vodafone DAB will become integrated into vehicles.</p><p>The service is compatible with any charging network which accepts Mastercard payments, thereby removing the current aggravation of having to install multiple apps depending on the dozen or so EV charging providers a motorist uses. Users are assured of the legitimacy of renewable energy sources since all vehicles or devices powered by Vodafone DAB are automatically entered into Energy Web’s system, which in turn provides an electronic provenance.</p><p>The system is ideal for fleet management companies, taxi firms, and road haulage firms, as it allows them to centralize all their charging requirements and even pass on unused electricity to another employee or road user. EV owners can take their home electricity tariffs with them, and roam onto overseas charging networks.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

 Information about the candidate OASIS Standard and the OSLC PROMCODE TC. 



<p>Managing software delivery can be highly challenging due to the diversity of the development processes, methods, tools and platforms used by different organizations participating in a project. Manual work done in order to exchange proprietary management data is inefficient, error-prone and inflexible. OSLC PROMCODE Version 1.0 is designed to address the need for systematic sharing of project management information within and between organizations.</p>

 What happened Wednesday night and how did we get to this point ? 
<p>Commercio.network on February 23rd at 18:11 reached &nbsp;the 66.66% consensus &nbsp;to &nbsp;migrate &nbsp;the blockchain &nbsp;core software to the 3.0 version. A great operation that involved 70 of the 100 nodes that are part of the network and reached 100% consensus a few minutes later. What a rush ! The absolute migration’s protagonists &nbsp;were &nbsp;Marco, Mario, Nicola, Markus, Daniele, Angelo, Mattia, Dave, Greg, Dilan, Ivar and all the other CTOs of the companies that are part of the network.</p>
<p>These intense minutes in which the chain migrated from version 2.2 to version 3.0 have been preceded by a year of hard work by &nbsp;20 developers coordinated by CTO Marco Ruaro who built from scratch the new release based on the latest version of COSMOS SDK. &nbsp;This release will allow Commercio to join &nbsp;the #IBCGANG and then finally be able to exchange virtual assets from &nbsp;commercio.network to &nbsp;the whole Cøsmos ecosystem &nbsp;via IBC interchange protocol and finally on Ethereum thanks to the new Gravity Bridge.</p>
 What has changed and what will change for users of the Commercio.network blockchain ? 
<p>Commercio.network is the world’s only legally binding blockchain (eIDAS compliant) that can solve 6 fundamental problems:</p>
 1. E-ID Create and manage Self Sovereign Identity SSI. 
<p>EIDAS2 electronic identity by implementing W3C SSI standards to issue DID DDO and external verifiable credentials (VC)</p>
 2. E-SIGNATURE Electronically sign PDF and XML documents 
<p>To electronically sign any digital document with the same legal effect as a paper document.</p>
 3. E-DELIVERY Notarizes the exchange of documents between parties 
<p>To exchange and notarize any digital document with the same legal effect as a paper document.</p>
 4. E-KYC Manage KYC procedures for AML purposes 
<p>To perform Know Your Customer (KYC) and sign the due diligence form in accordance with Anti Money Laundering (AMLD) regulations;</p>
 5. E-PAY Request a Certified SEPA Payment 
<p>To request SEPA payment from a user with a certified IBAN certified on blockchain eliminating most of frauds related to identity theft</p>
 6. E-MINT Issue and exchange NFT Certificate tokens 
<p>To allow users with an identity and electronic signature to issue an NFT to bind any digital, physical or financial asset</p>
 How will Commercio&nbsp;NFT Certificates &nbsp;on commercio.network change the world ? 
<p>An NFT on commercio.network is a digital bearer certificate, simply put it is a negotiable instrument that transfers ownership of any asset (such as certified digital assets, physical assets, receivables, stocks or debts) not to a specific person (assignee) but rather to whoever holds the NFT.</p>
<p>Who holds the NFT in their &nbsp;Wallet (non custodial) is the owner of the underlying asset. But not by virtue of a smart contract, but by a true legally binding contract between the parties. A contract written and signed following the &nbsp;European eIDAS &nbsp; that make any digital contracts legally binding. The scope of this invention is EPIC!</p>
<p>Thanks to &nbsp;version 3.0 soon it will be possible to invoke a function called Mint to create &nbsp;an NFT representing an asset (like a watch, a painting, a car, a house, an invoice that you actually own) you need to legally sign a contract where you legally declare to be &nbsp;the owner of an &nbsp;asset &nbsp;and that you are willing to transfer its title (sale) to whoever owns the NFT. This can only be achieved due to the fact that Commercio.network eIDAS compliant exchange of legally binding documents and for physical goods.</p>
<p>L'articolo <a href="https://commercio.network/welcome-commercio-network-3-0-come-era-legally-binding-nfts/">Welcome to Commercio.network 3.0 the  era of  the legally binding NFTs</a> sembra essere il primo su <a href="https://commercio.network">commercio.network</a>.</p>

 Case Study: Zusammenarbeit von DATEV eG und Lissi für die Ausstellung von verifizierbaren Nachweisen. Case Study: Vereinfachtes Zugangsmanagement für Mitarbeiter:innen durch digitale Nachweise. Einführung Anwendungsfall <p>Ende November 2021 startete <a href="https://www.datev.de/">DATEV eG</a> die Nutzung von verifizierbaren Nachweisen mit der intern entwickelten CovidSHIELD-App, um Covid-19 PCR-Testergebnisse für Mitarbeiter:innen nutzerfreundlich in einem Wallet darzustellen.</p><p>Die PCR-Tests werden in einem internen Testcenter durchgeführt, welches Pooltests verwendet und damit sehr effizient arbeitet. Bei einem Pooltest werden bis zu 35 Personen (in der Regel aus demselben Arbeitsbereich und derselben Schicht) in einem “Pool” zusammengefasst.</p> Testablauf und Verbindungsaufbau <p>Jede Person gibt zwei Proben ab, eine für den gemeinsamen Pooltest und eine B-Probe für einen ggf. notwendigen individuellen Test. Zusätzlich wird von allen am Pooltest teilnehmenden Personen das <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> auf das Handy geladen. Die Pool-Master — das sind diejenigen Personen, die die Koordination eines Pools übernehmen — verfügen zusätzlich über die CovidSHIELD Web&nbsp;App.</p><p>Über den Scan eines QR-Codes mit dem Lissi Wallet wird eine Verbindung zur CovidSHIELD-App des Pool-Masters aufgebaut.</p>Illustration der CovidSHIELD Anwendung sowie des Lissi&nbsp;Wallets. Inhalt der Nachweise <p>Die im Falle eines negativen Testergebnisses ausgestellten Nachweise enthalten den Vor- und Nachnamen der getesteten Person, den Text “…ist negativ” sowie das Datum an dem der Test durchgeführt wurde, um die Gültigkeit überprüfen zu&nbsp;können.</p><p>Ein Nachweis wird immer nur über ein negatives Testergebnis ausgestellt, niemals über ein positives.</p> Ablauf bei negativem Pooltest <p>Zunächst erfolgt der PCR-Test der gemeinsamen Poolprobe. Ist diese negativ, so wird für alle Personen, die am Test teilgenommen haben, ein negativer Testnachweis über die CovidSHIELD-App erstellt.</p><p>Dazu wird durch Klick auf die Schaltfläche “Alle Proben sind negativ” automatisch die Ausstellung an alle getesteten Personen eines Pools gestartet und an das Lissi Wallet gesendet. Nach Annahme des Nachweises im Wallet kann dieser dann in Verbindung mit dem DATEV-Mitarbeitenden-Ausweis bei Bedarf beim Betriebsschutz gezeigt&nbsp;werden.</p>Illustration der CovidSHIELD Anwendung sowie des Lissi&nbsp;Wallets. Ablauf bei positivem Pooltest <p>Alternativ ist im Falle eines positiven Pooltests eine Analyse der abgegebenen B-Proben notwendig, da mindestens eine Person positiv ist. Nachdem diese Ergebnisse vorliegen, wird für jede Person das Ergebnis der B-Probe individuell in der CovidSHIELD-App ausgewählt und im Falle eines negativen Ergebnisses über die anfangs aufgebaute Verbindung an das jeweilige Lissi Wallet bzw. den/die Mitarbeiter:in gesendet.</p>Illustration der CovidSHIELD Anwendung sowie des Lissi&nbsp;Wallets. Zeitlicher Ablauf <p>Die folgende Darstellung zeigt den zeitlichen Ablauf für den Fall eines negativen als auch eines positiven Pooltests mit anschließender Überprüfung der B-Proben.</p>Illustration des Ablaufs des Anwendungsfalls. Technische Integration <p>Der Anwendungsfall wird aktuell von mehr als 700 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern genutzt und es wurden bereits über 5.900 verifizierbare Nachweise ausgestellt. Dabei gab es bisher keinerlei Probleme hinsichtlich der Performance, der Verfügbarkeit oder des Speicherverbrauchs.</p><p>Von technischer Seite aus werden folgende Komponenten verwendet</p>  Keycloak als Zugriffsschutz (nur die Pool-Master können die CovidSHIELD-App nach korrekter Authentifizierung aufrufen)  Die selbstgeschriebene CovidSHIELD-App, um die Verbindungen zu den Lissi Wallets aufzubauen und die Testergebnisse einzupflegen  Der <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Cloud Agent Python </a>(“Aca-Py”) für die Kommunikation mit dem BCGov-Testnetzwerk und das Ausstellen der Nachweise an die Lissi&nbsp;Wallets  Die Backend-Komponente für die Business-Logik  Das BCGov-Testnetzwerk, um den <a href="http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/browse/domain?page=1&amp;query=3V3pcFYx2mXDt9NxjLbG2u&amp;txn_type=1">dezentralen Identifier (DID) der DATEV</a>, das Schema und die darauf aufbauende <a href="http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/browse/domain?page=1&amp;query=3V3pcFYx2mXDt9NxjLbG2u%3A3%3ACL%3A45784%3Astaging&amp;txn_type=102">Credential Definition</a> für die Nachweise zu hinterlegen  Das Lissi&nbsp;Wallet  Technische Komponenten und Rollen im Anwendungsfall Nutzung des Lissi&nbsp;Wallets <p>Zu Beginn wurden mehrere Wallets getestet. Die finale Entscheidung fiel auf das Lissi Wallet, da dieses das größte Maß an Benutzungsfreundlichkeit sowie den stabilsten operativen Betrieb bietet. Zusätzlich ausschlaggebend waren die automatische Auswahl des Netzwerks und die Verfügbarkeit der deutschen Sprache.</p> Implementierung <p>Der Anwendungsfall konnte zügig durch das Blockchain-Team aus dem DATEV eG Inkubator implementiert werden. Das Backend und auch das Frontend der CovidSHIELD-App wurden über TypeScript und Svelte implementiert. Die Kommunikation inklusive Ausstellung der Nachweise zu den Lissi Wallets erfolgt dabei über den&nbsp;Aca-Py.</p><p>Das Schema und die darauf aufbauende Credential Definition (also die Struktur der Daten, die in einem Nachweis enthalten sind) wurden auf dem BCGov-Testnetzwerk hinterlegt. Dazu sind Schreibrechte notwendig, welche über den Endorser-Service beantragt wurden.</p><p>Die anderen Komponenten (Aca-Py sowie das Lissi Wallet) bedürfen keiner expliziten Zustimmung für die&nbsp;Nutzung.</p> Vorteile der Implementierung <p>Die Implementierung des Anwendungsfalls basierend auf der SSI Technologie mit dem Lissi Wallet bringt folgende Vorteile mit&nbsp;sich:</p>  Direkte Ausstellung der Nachweise an Mitarbeiter:innen, die Nachweise liegen nur in dem Wallet der jeweiligen Person  Einfacher Empfang, Verwaltung und Präsentation der Nachweise  Schnelle Implementierung ohne große Genehmigungsverfahren  Kostengünstige Implementierung, mit lediglich Personalkosten und Hosting des Agents der CovidSHIELD-App  Verbindung mit weiteren Anwendungsfällen (DATEV-Mitarbeitenden-Ausweis, Zugangsmanagement etc.)  Vermeidung von Honeypots von personenbezogenen Daten durch dezentrale Speicherung   Weiterer Ausbau des Anwendungsfalls <p>Bisher wird lediglich eine Sichtprüfung des Nachweises durchgeführt. Um die kryptografische Verifizierung des Nachweises zu vereinfachen, wird das Lissi Wallet zukünftig die Funktion anbieten, dass Nutzende ihre Nachweise direkt als QR-Code präsentieren können. Zudem soll das<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0095-basic-message"> Basic Massage Protokoll</a> unterstützt werden, sodass getestete Personen über den aktuellen Stand des Tests informiert werden können (z.B. “Poolprobe positiv, B-Proben werden analysiert”).</p><p>Bei Fragen oder Anliegen der Case Study können Sie sich an <a href="mailto:info@lissi.id">info@lissi.id</a> oder <a href="mailto:blockchain@datev.de">blockchain@datev.de</a> wenden.</p> Herausgeber: <p>Blockchain@DATEV<br>DATEV eG<br>Paumgartnerstr. 6–14<br>90429&nbsp;Nürnberg</p><p>Lissi <br>Main Incubator GmbH<br>F&amp;E Einheit der Commerzbank Gruppe<br>Eschersheimer Landstr. 6<br>60322 Frankfurt</p>

		<p>Newark, NJ, February 22, 2022 – A longtime Edge member, Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU), recently upgraded their connection to the Edge optical fiber network, EdgeNet, from 2x 10 Gbps to 2x 100 Gbps—making them the first institution in New Jersey to connect to EdgeNet at this advanced speed.</p>
<p>With a greater number of students looking to connect multiple devices and video streaming and gaming systems to the network, FDU set out to refresh their technology and create a proactive strategy that would help address future needs. “We wanted to enable our students and staff to use technology, collaborate with other universities, and utilize other external services at higher data rates,” explains Michael Reekie, Director of Networking, FDU. “We also wished to alleviate any of the bottlenecks in our current environment that could potentially slow down the user experience. Along with updating our core, we also upgraded our wireless and Internet edge to meet the upcoming demands of the new wireless capabilities.”</p>
<p>FDU explored different solutions to help manage traffic, including traffic shapers that are installed at the Internet edge. However, as bandwidth increases, the cost and maintenance of these devices can be expensive. “We found that increasing our bandwidth and installing faster Internet edge routers and firewalls would be a more cost-effective investment and could provide a better user experience for our students and faculty,” says Reekie. “Making the jump from 2x 10 Gbps to 2x 100 Gbps will help us meet our bandwidth requirements over the next several years and with Edge as an existing partner, it was a very easy transition to upgrade our existing connections, while still allowing a highly available networking experience. Edge was able to provide bandwidth to us at a better cost and value than installing technologies that would shape the use of Internet traffic.”</p>
<p>Bruce Tyrrell, Associate Vice President Programs &amp; Services, Edge says many institutions across the state are looking to increase their bandwidth capacity to better meet student and staff needs and create an optimal user experience on and off campus. “Not only are student requirements evolving, but the pandemic-related hybrid learning environment has also created a significant demand for internet services. Managing bandwidth demand is becoming increasingly important for institutions and will be a key element of technology strategies going forward.”</p>
<p>Throughout every student’s journey, technology will play an essential role in their learning and living experience. With this in mind, Neal Strum, Vice President and Chief Information Officer, FDU, says the University will continue to look toward the future of network connectivity and ensuring that students and faculty have the resources they need to succeed. “We are committed to providing a superior level of network accessibility and connectivity at FDU and this recent upgrade has not only created a more cost-efficient operating model, but will also help enhance the educational experience and better accommodate incoming students as the University continues to grow in the coming years.”</p>

<p>The Trust over IP Foundation was established to bring trust into the virtual, online world where, all too often, there is low or no trust in data exchanges. In this post, on the topic of how the public sector should consider SSI, we examine the efforts of the US federal government to adopt zero trust architecture (ZTA) and its implications for using decentralized identity.&nbsp; As stated in federal guidance, “The foundational tenet of the Zero Trust Model is that no actor, system, network, or service operating outside or within the security perimeter is trusted. Instead, we must verify anything and everything attempting to establish access.”</p>



<p>The proliferation of cloud computing, mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT), and wireless technology has changed the traditional paradigm of computing, and with it the traditional approach to cyber security leveraging access management and security controls at the network boundaries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing this increasing threat, the US Government, through the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has led the development of a new approach to security and threat management called Zero Trust Architecture, or ZTA. A zero trust cybersecurity approach removes the assumption of trust typically given to devices, subjects (i.e., the people and things that request information from resources), and networks. It focuses on accessing resources in a secure manner, regardless of network location, subject, and asset, and enforcing risk-based access controls while continually inspecting, monitoring, and logging interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two weeks ago, the requirements of the Executive Order were further delineated in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Office of Management and Budget memo M 22-09</a>, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles, and set a deadline of October of 2023 for all federal agencies to implement ZTA standards and objectives in their technology infrastructure. Unfortunately, the opportunity to truly recognize “zero trust”, and by extension the principles of SSI, appear to be left as a gap. The ToIP framework provides an opportunity to implement design choices which help address this gap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The role of Identity in Zero Trust</p>



<p>Identity plays a key role in ZTA. “Users” and “Devices” are two of the seven pillars of Zero Trust in DoD, and one of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA’s) “five pillars” for zero trust maturity (identities, devices, networks, applications and workloads, and data). The DoD implementation guide specifically references the Identity and Credential Access Management (ICAM) Reference Design as the basis for managing the identity of Person and Non Person Entities to support ZTA. The OMB guidance comes up short, only referencing “Using centrally managed systems to provide enterprise identity and access management services” to support an agency ZTA strategy. NIST and DoD have both laid the foundation for serious consideration of SSI and decentralized identity that appear to fail to make it to the guidance at a federal level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zero Trust and SSI</p>



<p>Zero Trust is based on the premise that “that no actor, system, network, or service operating outside or within (emphasis added) the security perimeter is trusted”. In the same respect, SSI ascribes to the principle that identity is retained by the person (entity) and only shared based on pre-agreed terms of trust – a Trust Framework. ZTA requires that “we must verify anything and everything attempting to establish access” while SSI prescribes selective disclosure and zero knowledge proofs that cryptographically confirm an identity without repeated disclosure of identity attributes for both authentication and authorization. ZTA and SSI then become “both sides of the same coin”, protecting both the entity (which must trust the verifier in sharing their information) and the network (which must verify the entity to trust it with access).</p>



<p>The President’s Executive Order makes one thing clear – “…the Federal Government needs to make bold changes and significant investments in order to defend the vital institutions that underpin the American way of life.” This bold change means moving from the traditional thinking of centralized, or even federated, identity structures and methods and recognizing “trust must go both ways” or&nbsp; expect no trust at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the ToIP Framework has yet to be demonstrated at the scale of full&nbsp; ZTA interoperability needed by the U.S. government—or other world governments—it is indeed the architecture they should be investing in to reach that level of interoperability at scale. It will also enable governments to do so without vendor lock-in, support “digital sovereignty” and—even better—it will enable peer-to-peer trust between any governments, their agents, and citizens based on their own governance frameworks and trust policies.</p>



 If You Are a Government… 



<p>Efforts are underway around the globe to promote new trust models between governments and citizens that promotes privacy and improves how trust is established between entities sharing information. Now is the time for the US government to consider and adopt the ToIP Framework as a starting point to not only support ZTA but promote greater privacy in information sharing within its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

 Staffing changes at DIF 
 
 
<p>Balázs' time at DIF coming to an end: both the team here at DIF and all of our members would like to thank Balázs for his tireless work in building up and supporting a vibrant community over the past few years.</p>
 
 We wish him all the best in his future endeavors at multi-chain KYC verification platform <a>kycDAO</a>. We also expect him to still come back and visit! 
 Balázs: Thank you. Seriously, the DIF community was my home for the past 2,5 years. Getting involved with such an exciting and ever-growing group was a life-changing experience. I had the chance to help hundreds of companies take their first steps on their decentralized identity journey. With the help of our membership, the foundation grew from ~70 members to 300+ members spanning the globe. From the original 4 working groups, we have formed 10 WGs, including multiple joint groups with some of the most established players in the industry.<br>
My role as the head of operations offered extensive exposure to concepts and ideas that were challenging the status quo of digital identity management. With the help of members, we explored different work items and models that sometimes never reached the market.<br>
I look forward to leveraging my understanding of decentralized identity and open source IPR protected work. I will still be available on DIF slack and around the community! 
 
 
 
<p>DIF would like to welcome Paul Grehan to DIF as Program Manager: A warm welcome from the entire community; we are excited to work together and see how was can engage, delight and surpass in 2022 and beyond!</p>
 
 Paul: Firstly, I would like to acknowledge all the hard work and effort that Balázs has put into this community to date, amazing! I feel privileged to be a part of such a strong and committed cohort of like-minded people and organizations, driven by a need to develop such a crucial element missing in today's digital environment - decentralized identity.<br>
To say it's an exciting time in this field would be the understatement of the decade and I am thrilled (and a bit nervous!) to help the foundation support and grow the community to deliver on its incredible potential. There is a long list of individuals that help make this community a success, my promise is to ensure we, at DIF, continue to enable you all to do so.<br>
Please feel free to contact me via any of our platforms (incl. Slack &amp; Discord) or directly - I would love to hear your story and how DIF plays a role in that.

 A headline theme of our Digital Nation campaign&nbsp;is the inspiring story of E-Estonia, and how Scotland may emulate their success. 
 Lesley Riddoch and filmmaker Charlie Stuart traveled to Estonia in late February 2020 to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqLJA7sXD-c">a film about this story</a>, about one of the most recent small north European states to become independent. 
<p>Tiny Estonia (pop similar to Wales) sees itself as a forgotten Nordic nation, sharing its language, forest and bog-covered topography and Baltic location with Finland.</p>
<p>And it’s widely regarded as Europe’s Digital Tiger economy, performing an incredible transformation from terrible poverty in the wake of reestablishing independence just 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, Estonia became the latest small European nation to declare independence. Faced with terrible winters, they struggled to even find petrol for ambulances and the supermarket shelves were empty. But today, Estonia is one of the most successful small countries in the EU. How did they do it?</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence all their lives, and they actually planned a lot of this transformation ahead since they had a firm belief that they would become independent.</p>
<p>A wave of young people took over dismantling everything. So they said those people who have been working for the Soviet Union and have been supporting this kind of things have to leave now. They need to clean the entire state.</p>
<p>And by cleaning the state, it means everything. The first years were tough for this new Baltic nation. They literally had nothing on the shelves of grocery stores in Tallinn or elsewhere in Estonia. They were in a very difficult situation. But Estonia embraced the new digital world, and in just 20 years, its GDP has increased fivefold. It’s nothing short of extraordinary. This transition happened within a generation. The Estonians have adopted their independence day as the 24th of February. It’s a holiday, everyone gathers together on this day.</p>
<p>Estonia first proclaimed independence in 1918 after two centuries of Russian rule, but soon the country was occupied, first by the Soviets, then the Nazis, then the Soviets again, who ruled for almost 50 years. In March 1949, 20000 people were deported, most to Siberia by the KGB. Two thirds were women and children under the age of 16.</p>
<p>In 1986, there was a seismic shift at the Kremlin. President Gorbachev introduced Glasnost to modernize and refresh the communist bloc. But in the Baltic states, the newfound political freedom gave the chance for dreams of nationhood to be rekindled. The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence, all their lives through whole time in Soviet Union and then especially, intensely, during those three years they had the singing revolution, they were prepared.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of repression, huge singing events continued, the choirs were a symbol of Estonia’s unique culture. As freedom can’t be achieved by only movements, they not only were singing and shouting and streets, but they were undertaking hard legislative work too. In August 1989, the movements of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania combined to form a 400 mile chain of two million people demonstrating their unity for freedom. This was to catch media’s attention to pressurize Gorbachev. After all this, Estonia got its independence.</p>
<p>Estonia set up its own currency pegged to the Deutschmark, but the country had traded almost exclusively with Russia and so the economy collapsed. It was a government in crisis from the start. In 1993, in the midst of a Baltic winter with daytime temperatures below minus 10, the state coffers are empty, businesses face bankruptcy, pensions might not be paid.</p>
<p>There was a struggle to find petrol for ambulances and the shops were empty. Mart Laar became the first formally elected prime minister at the age of just 32. The unemployment rate was 40-50%. No countries were buying anything from Estonia as their production was really bad. The changes were really very, very harsh because they didn’t have money. People were patient, expecting that the country will grow up, will improve. And after this harsh time, there will be better times. The Estonians people had hope that Estonia will again flourish someday.</p>
<p>Very soon help and investment came from Nordic neighbors. There was were even food and clothing parcels from abroad. Very quickly, Estonia began to grow as Europe’s newest democracy. It was a society shaped by a new generation without baggage from the communist era, with new ideas and a blank canvas.</p>
 E-Estonia 
<p>Estonia’s main claim to fame today is the Digital Economy. Estonian education has fueled 20 years of digital innovation, 90 percent of schools deliver subjects using digital technology by choice, not compulsion, and 70 percent of kindergartens have access to robotics. Scottish education was once the envy of the world. Now a different small country is turning educational heads.</p>
<p>The education system has spawned a nation of digital entrepreneurs and innovators. Three Estonian engineers have built Skype with almost 700 million worldwide users.</p>
<p>In Estonia, everyone must have a digital ID. This is a compulsary document for absolutely every person who lives in Estonia. The citizens of Estonia use this smart electronical id card as their driving license also. They also get discounts from various shops by using this id card. This card is also essential for medical care because they need this card at hospitals and health care centre for their medical prescriptions.</p>
<p>This card is also used by the citizens for tax payment system. With the aid of this card it takes only one minute in order to declare citizens’ taxes. The citizens of Estonia have a great faith on their state law authority as they provide their all information of themselves to one institution. Only one percent of entire state budget is used in order to keep up the system. The citizens’ get back two percent of their GDP by using this one single solution.</p>
<p>It took three years after independence for the last Russian military to leave. Now, Estonia has an army of its own and an international peacekeeping role. It has 3000 full time soldiers with 20000 in reserve and the support of its Nato Family since it joined in 2004. Joining the NATO has cultural, economic, social and mostly political consequences on Estonia.</p>
<p>In Estonia 2/3 of the population live in the traditional country. They tried to keep alive their cultural heritage even when they were part of the Soviet Union. The country celebrates its traditions and identity big time.</p>
<p>The country has been criticized for a flat tax regime that leaves the well off paying the same as the lowest earners, just 20 percent. And corporations can skip tax altogether if they reinvest. One man well-placed to make international comparisons is the Estonian TV journalist Johannes Tralla, he is a former EU correspondent.</p>
<p>According to him oligarchy does not exist in the Estonia every taxi driver here is an entrepreneur and the low tax system is really beneficial for the citizens. In Estonia there is no dramatic class gap in society. The taxation framework in Estonia is really appreciable in the whole Europe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPJ7IVFNEhI">Another video</a> shares a short case study of E-Estonia from Freethink, interviewing Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of Estonia from 2006 – 2016, telling the compelling story of the global success of Estonia as a digital nation leader, boasting the most advanced digital government in the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ilves recalls how Estonia faced massive economic challenges upon achieving the restoration of independence in 1991, a time that soon saw the emergence of the Internet.</p>
<p>Toomas realized the opportunity was that Estonia was no further behind than any other country in this field, and so began pioneering their adoption, with all schools being online by 1998 and the framework for E-Estonia in place by the early 2000’s.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and Estonia now enjoys an entirely digital society – Via a single digital identity everything except weddings and real estate can be transacted online, including voting.</p>
<p>Not only is it a convenience but it’s also the foundation for a prosperous and healthy society. Being entirely digital has meant Estonia has continued uninterrupted during Covid-19, and their ‘E-Residency’ program has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninaangelovska/2019/04/25/estonias-e-residency-contributed-e14m-to-its-economy-e-residency-2-0-will-be-a-true-forerunner/#5cef94179da5">contributed €14m to its economy</a>.</p>
<p>A keynote theme is that size and money isn’t the essential ingredient for success.</p>
<p>Toomas now lives in the heart of Silicon Valley in the USA, and despite their vast wealth and being surrounded by the behemoth tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook, American digital government is surprisingly poor. Processes are still paper-based, requiring photocopies be taken to government offices, whereas Estonians can file&nbsp;taxes in only six clicks in two or three minutes.</p>
<p>Scotland, a similarly sized small nation and with an unparalleled history of invention, absolutely could emulate Estonia and achieve and enjoy an equally advanced digital nation.</p>
<p>As SNP leaders like <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/18554995.scots-must-seize-future-build-strong-digital-nation/">Martin Docherty</a>, <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18515370.agenda-follow-estonias-lead-digital-revolution/">Doug Chapman</a> and <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/17353185.angus-robertson-we-should-introduce-a-scottish-digital-citizenship/">Angus Robertson</a> have written for The National, Scotland’s opportunity is to emulate the Baltic nation one fifth the size of Scotland but that has achieved the staggering accomplishment of becoming the world’s leading digital nation, following their own independence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18515370.agenda-follow-estonias-lead-digital-revolution/">Writing for The Herald</a> the SNP’s Spokesperson for SME and Innovation Douglas Chapman issues a rallying cry for Scotland to emulate the similarly sized digital nation exemplar, highlighting how their entirely online society has meant they could adapt easily to the challenges of Covid-19.</p>

 <a href="http://scottishblockchain.net"></a>In a <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/19747502.snp-back-motion-speed-independent-scotland-adopting-currency/">National article</a> it’s reported how a motion has been passed at the SNP conference to speed the process of setting up Scotland’s own currency, the Scottish Pound, following our achieving independence. 
<p>This <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/snp-must-rethink-its-economic-model-independent-scotland/">OpenDemocracy article</a> sets the scene through a critical analysis of the SNP’s Growth Commission plans, being especially harsh of their currency strategy.</p>
<p>Thought leaders pioneering alternative ideas in Scotland include Tim Rideout, heading up the <a href="https://www.reservebank.scot/">ReserveBank.scot initiative</a>, Common Weal who have published <a href="https://sourcenews.scot/how-to-launch-a-scottish-currency/">this paper</a> on how to make a Scottish currency, <a href="https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2020/12/04/why-is-scotland-still-debating-whether-it-will-need-its-own-currency-when-independent-when-the-answer-is-so-glaringly-obviously-that-it-will/">Richard Murphy</a> and <a href="https://www.modernmoney.scot/">Modern Money Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>See all of them together discussing the topic on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lzxjVs810Y">this panel discussion webinar</a>.</p>
 El Salvador 
<p>As we also have an ambition to become a world leading digital nation it also seems to beg the question what role a cryptocurrency could play in this scenario, and for a taste of what this might look like we can look to El Salvador.</p>
<p>Led by ‘CEO’ President Nayib Bukele the small south american country is currently setting the global crypto community ablaze with their breathtaking pioneering of the role Bitcoin will play in advancing and growing their nation.</p>
<p>This includes buying up large volumes as an investment, recently&nbsp;‘<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-26/el-salvador-bought-the-dip-acquiring-100-more-bitcoin">buying the dip</a>‘, adopting <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-58473260">Bitcoin as legal tender</a>, setting up Bitcoin mining facilities <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/10/29/volcanic-energy-is-creating-bitcoin-in-el-salvador">powered by volcanoes</a>, and announcing plans to build ‘<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/el-salvador-plans-first-bitcoin-city-backed-by-bitcoin-bonds-2021-11-21/">Bitcoin City</a>‘.</p>
<p>There are of course <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/24/el-salvador-adoption-of-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-is-pure-folly">doom mongers</a> predicting it will end in disaster for El Salvador and would say the same for Scotland, but there will be equal naysayers for whatever currency plan we decide upon and for our independence in general, describing it is a foolhardy risk that will undoubtably result in our economic ruin.</p>
<p>So if we are to leap into the unknown, why not try and leap as high as we can?? Why not aspire to also set the world ablaze with just how daring and groundbreaking our new independent country is setting out to be.</p>
 Blockchain and FinTech Innovation 
<p>As far back as 2014 <a href="https://qz.com/267137/could-scotlands-currency-be-bitcoin/">Quartz explored</a> the idea, suggesting that rather than using Bitcoin the country could instead leverage the underlying Blockchain technology to create their own digital currency.</p>
 “Scotland could use the underlying technology behind bitcoin to suit its needs and possibly create its own, more flexible digital currency. The move would be almost as radical as the one to break up the UK’s 307-year-old union.” 
<p>Bitcoin Magazine <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/economists-propose-a-digital-currency-for-scotland-backed-by-scottish-parliament-and-banks-1473428758">reported</a> on a 2016 presentation given by Dr. Daniel Broby of Strathclyde University where this potential is contextualized within an overall goal of Scotland advancing it’s role as a global FinTech leader, with an associated <a href="https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/57867/">research paper</a> exploring this in detail.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Daniel set the scene on our webinar series, explaining the required regulatory system for the Blockchain to underpin these types of innovations.</p>
<p></p>
 Pioneering the Future of Money 
<p>This insight from Daniel is key. It’s not simply a matter of answering the currency question but of a deeper investment into Scotland’s technological capability, with a special emphasis on the most significant of the trends of the sector, the evolution of money itself and how this will impact across the world.</p>
<p>Rather than this being a weak point for the Independence argument, the smart move is to seize it as the moment for global technology leadership it represents, an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone – One being the need for a currency, the second being the aspiration to become a world leading digital nation.</p>
<p>A key trend to highlight are “CBDCs” –&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a>, the full blown digitization of national currencies, which is the grand prize of this space and given Scotland’s history of pioneering financial innovations including founding banks et al, presents us with a unique window to lead the trend globally.</p>
<p>It’s a behemoth of a worldwide opportunity now taking shape – In the USA former CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/35528/digital-dollar-project-names-advisory-group">set up a not-for-profit</a>&nbsp;called the Digital Dollar Foundation, to pioneer the creation of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC).&nbsp;In his presidency campaign Michael Bloomberg&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-presidential-contender-michael-bloomberg-proposes-clear-regulatory-framework-for-crypto">proposed creating a regulatory framework</a>&nbsp;for cryptocurrencies in a new financial regulation plan.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum says it’s time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/why-its-time-to-take-central-banks-digital-currencies-seriously/">take them seriously</a>, CNBC explores&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/central-banks-lay-out-a-framework-for-digital-currencies.html">what they would look like</a>, the US Federal Reserve published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/central-bank-digital-currency-a-literature-review-20201109.htm">a literature review</a>, the IMF a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/11/20/Legal-Aspects-of-Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-Central-Bank-and-Monetary-Law-Considerations-49827">set of considerations</a>&nbsp;for their use and Brookings a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/23/design-choices-for-central-bank-digital-currency/">set of design options</a>. The Bank of England offers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2020/central-bank-digital-currency-opportunities-challenges-and-design-discussion-paper">this discussion paper</a>&nbsp;to explore the topic in detail and HSBC comments on them&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hsbc.com/insight/topics/central-banks-develop-digital-currencies">here</a>.</p>
<p>Early pioneers include&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-swiss-snb-currency-digital/swiss-central-bank-says-wholesale-digital-currency-trial-a-success-idUKKBN28D1N5">Switzerland</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ghanas-central-bank-confirms-its-still-looking-to-pilot-a-digital-currency">Ghana</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/marshall-islands-seeks-to-establish-a-self-sovereign-identity-with-new-blockchain-based-currency">Marshall Islands</a>&nbsp;seeking to blaze the trail, and China has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-12-01/in-depth-chinas-digital-currency-ambitions-lead-the-world-101634550.html">ambitions to lead the world</a>&nbsp;in this field.</p>
<p>There are concerns and critics of course. Coin Telegraph writes that they have the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-have-the-power-to-upend-global-finance">potential to upend global finance</a>, and also that they are&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-are-dead-in-the-water">dead in the water</a>, and the Economist asks if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/05/will-central-bank-digital-currencies-break-the-banking-system">they will break the banking system</a>.</p>
 “Programmable Money” 
<p>Furthermore the real magic lies in the concept of ‘Smart Money’ aka Programmable Money.&nbsp;This is not just about the straight digitization of money as we understand it, but an entire transformation of how money ‘works’.</p>
<p>As the term suggests it refers to creating an intrinsic intelligence for money.&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/09/16/programmable-money-crypto-tokens">Reporting on IBM</a>&nbsp;being awarded a patent for a “bespoke programmable crypto token,” Cointelegraph explores how specific functionality can be programmed into the behaviour of digital monies.</p>
<p>The LSE explores the idea, asking ‘<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2020/09/14/do-we-need-programmable-money/">Do we need programmable money</a>?’, where they define it in terms of both Open Banking and crypto:</p>
<p>“In non-crypto fintech, ‘programmable money’ seems to refer to leveraging open banking APIs to build new, automated use-cases over legacy bank payment infrastructure but in our crypto world, the ‘programmable money’ refers to digital cash hosted on a blockchain, where cash can be placed under the control of a smart contract.”</p>
<p>A key standard that could make it possible is ‘DAML’, a programming language for creating Blockchain smart contracts that run across multiple infrastructure options. DigitalAsset is the world’s expert on this and explore the trend in more detail in <a href="https://daml.com/daml-driven/why-daml-is-great-to-represent-digital-currency/">this series of blogs</a>.</p>
<p>Not only does this provide the technology to digitally enable currencies as they behave now, but to make possible a future of Programmable Money, where a variety of behaviours and actions can be coded into the flow of money not possible with physical currency.</p>
<p>A Canadian visionary in this field is Alex Tapscott.&nbsp;Indeed he defines it as the wholesale reinvention of capital, a journey he foresees in his 2016 presentation ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=WnEYakUxsHU">Blockchain is Eating Wall Street</a>‘.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Digital assets are smart and programmable. Let’s say you’re sending money to your kid studying in college. You can now program the money to only work at certain retailers like Walmart and Whole Foods, rather than the Ontario Cannabis Store or LCBO.</p>
<p>By rethinking capital, we can reimagine markets, money and finance. Entire swaths of the financial services industry currently worth trillions of dollars — banking, payments and even money itself — will be questioned, challenged and upended in the years to come.”</p>

<p></p>
 The most powerful way Scotland can advance their ambition to become a world leading digital nation is to identify where key objectives intersect and a single strategy would yield multiple benefits and the achieving of multiple goals. 
<p>For example as this article explains, leveraging technologies like the Blockchain could transform Scottish education AND simultaneously progress our ambition to become <a href="https://digitalnation.scot/scotland-europes-blockchain-capital/">Europe’s Blockchain capital</a>. It’s a technology capability that could be similarly used across multiple industries.</p>
<p>There are of course many different technologies that have great potential for Scottish learning. The Cloud makes powerful new teaching tools more easily available, Virtual Reality provides an immersive experience, and so on, but these are at the level of individual teaching. To define the wholesale transformation of education we need to look at technologies operating at that systemic level.</p>
<p>Writing for TES James McEnaney sets the scene for the types of changes needed, describing <a href="https://www.tes.com/magazine/archived/4-ways-transform-scottish-education">4 Ways to Transform Scottish Education</a>, most notably a reformation of the exam system:</p>
<p>“Our current approach, the one that grinds students through a needless annual exam cycle and ties so much of their future to performance in just a few hours of a single day, has failed far too many people for far too long. The richest pupils are more likely to leave school with five Highers than the poorest are to leave with one. Those from the most deprived backgrounds are also more likely to fail their courses than achieve an A grade.”</p>
<p>This of course is the backbone of the education system, how grades are assessed and rewarded, and it is here therefore where the biggest levers for change are possible, and in this article we’ll explain the role new technologies can play in underpinning and enabling such a transformation.</p>
 Blockchain Certs 
<p>The purpose of introducing the Blockchain into the mix is to ensure the authenticity of awarded certificates.</p>
<p>Our school diplomas and university degrees are credentials that every one can easily relate to and understand the societal value of, and with the rise in fake certificate fraud an obvious demonstrator of the need for the assured integrity of these documents.&nbsp;Countries like<a href="https://www.finder.com.au/good-clean-use-case-bahamian-students-graduate-on-the-blockchain"> the Bahamas</a> are now issuing Blockchain-based academic certificates.</p>
<p>The types of innovation that seem to be focusing on this type of use case include ‘<a href="https://www.learningmachine.com/badges-and-blockcerts/">Blockcerts</a>‘, an open source blockchain project for enabling a Universal Verifier that will verify any Blockcert issued by any institution, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Via their Medium article UniversaBlockchain explore the scenario of <a href="https://medium.com/universablockchain/blockchain-in-education-49ad413b9e12">Blockchain in Education</a>.</p>
<p>They highlight keynote problems like the high rates of medical school diploma falsification as pain points a technology like Blockchain is ideal for tackling in some form, among a wave of other transformative benefits for the sector as it ripples through all workflow areas related to HR, resume checking, et al.</p>
<p>Athena<a href="https://blog.athenagt.com/blockchain-in-education-and-5-use-cases-to-observe/"> builds on this</a> some, notably detailing the core signature process that underpins the integrity of the record, as a comparison to traditional paper-based approaches:</p>
 
 Blockchain-enabled digital certificates are immutable and cannot be forged. 
 The records are stored on a distributed ledger, hence certificates can be only evaluated by anyone who has access to the blockchain. 
 Since the records are stored in a shared distributed ledger, the certificate can still be validated even if the organization that had issued it no longer exists. 
 The digital certificates stored in the ledger can only be destroyed if all the copies in every system are destroyed. 
 
 Digital Badges 
<p>This capability would ideally go hand in hand with ‘Digital Badges’, which can also be authenticated via the Blockchain the same way.&nbsp;LearningMachine provides <a href="https://www.learningmachine.com/badges-and-blockcerts/">this thorough introduction</a> and <a href="https://www.hastac.org/initiatives/digital-badges">Hastac explains</a> :</p>
<p>“A digital badge is a validated indicator of accomplishment, skill, quality, or interest that can be earned in many learning environments. Open digital badging makes it easy for anyone to issue, earn, and display badges across the web—through an infrastructure that uses shared and open technical technical standards.”</p>
<p>Educational organizations like WES are <a href="https://thepienews.com/news/wes-plots-digital-revolution-of-badges/">pioneering their adoption</a>, and the role and value of digital certification in today’s modern world can most simply be described visually:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This example highlights their immediate value to employment, how they can be modular and very specific to workplace roles – an AWS Solution Architect is a very well defined function, and not only does the digital certificate validate the required skills have been achieved but they can also be used to socially promote the fact we have them, increasing our chances of securing such a job.</p>
<p><a href="https://openbadges.org/"></a><a href="http://openbadges.org">Open digital badging</a> makes it easy for anyone to issue, earn, and display badges across the web—through an infrastructure that uses shared and open technical technical standards. </p>
<p>Organizations like <a href="https://credly.com/">Credly</a> facilitate their universality across industries and their CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbarthur/2021/07/19/an-innovators-views-on-digital-credentials---from-credlys-jonathan-finkelstein/">describes</a> how they help foster a more diverse and inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>Educause Review&nbsp;<a href="https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2016/9/digital-badges-and-academic-transformation">covers some examples</a> of universities now blending digital badge schemes into their awards programs, and a pertinent example of how this can be applied in the corporate world is this example of the <a href="https://www.badges.sssc.uk.com/getting-started/what-you-need-to-know-about-open-badges/">Scottish Social Services Council using them</a> to underpin workforce learning. The BCS describes this as the <a href="https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/digital-badging-the-future-of-professional-development/">future of professional development</a>, with many organizations like <a href="https://new.siemens.com/uk/en/company/education/teachers/siemens-digital-badges.html">Siemens</a> using them this way.</p>

 Verified Credentials and Digital Recognition Networks 
<p>The other core technology used in conjunction with the Blockchain in this scenario is Digital Identity, the systems we use to log in to web sites and services.</p>
<p>The building block of how these are work&nbsp;are ‘<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SSIMeetup/verifiable-credentials-101-for-ssi-and-decentralized-digital-identity-tyler-ruff">Verifiable Credentials</a>‘, the mechanism for different digital services to recognize those login details provided by another.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/10/25/building-shared-digital-identity/">his blog</a> Amit Jasuja explains the core mechanics of this and how multiple organizations can share digital identity services, an ecosystem of ‘relying’ and ‘issuing’ parties.</p>
<p>Academic certificates are a great example of a digital credential, and how they will be shared and recognized by other academic organizations can be facilitated by this core Digital Identity capability. Hence another great way of describing this ecosystem is “Digital Recognition Networks” – The ecosystem will be formed through organizations establishing agreements to share data and recognize the digital credentials of partners they work with to fulfill these processes.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2017/2/endorsement-2-taking-open-badges-and-ecredentials-to-the-next-level">Endorsements 2.0</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Taking Open Badges and E-Credentials to the Next Level&nbsp;the author explores this scenario, looking at how a student uses their HIPAA certifications and as a way of explaining the The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html">Open Badge specification</a>, and its purpose to provide this type of assurance network.</p>
<p>“New features in the Open Badges Specification&nbsp;will soon make it possible for third parties to add&nbsp;verifiable endorsements to these e-credentials — a necessary step for their credibility in many settings.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cphrab.ca/how-use-recognition-networks-your-talent-strategy">Writing for the CPHR</a> Terrahub explains the principle through exploring an excellent use case of how this will take shape and the economic benefits it will bring: Education and Employment.</p>
<p>“In a recognition network, skills and credentials are represented by digital badges that organizations use for achievement and an employee can us for permanent external branding during or post-employment.</p>
<p>As brands move global and geographical boundaries dissolve, these recognition networks enable talent to shift and move without having to re-qualify their competency, eliminating frustration for the employee, and inefficiency for the employer by getting the right people to work fast.”</p>
<p>Education and Employment is a great scenario as the core components are easily understood: The credential – Your academic qualification in certificate form, and the recognition – How employers seek that qualification as a requirement for employment.</p>
 Digital Wallets – MyCreds 
<p>The method for storing these digital badges and certificates will be digital wallets, aka “Learner Wallets”.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Medium blog</a> Timothy Ruff provides an excellent, detailed summary of this interconnected ecosystem will begin to take shape and the role these wallets will play.</p>
<p>He explains how:</p>
 
 Organizations like the&nbsp;T3 Innovation Network, within the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are developing Learning and Employment Records, powered by the same VC standards and technologies that enable self-sovereign student ID, with the same issue, hold, verify model to/from an SSI wallet, which they call a “learner wallet” for simplicity. 
 This will help reduce and eliminate student fraud. Once organizations realize they can receive cryptographic proof directly from the student, they can lessen their reliance on passwords, social security numbers, and other personal information. 
 
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://e54b1a5c-a1c1-4de5-92be-372a9479ac65.filesusr.com/ugd/5bcc07_25aca1d75ef040708d1e87318cef59d9.pdf">this news</a> highlights one of the first customers to harness this capability is the Association of the Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC), choosing Digitary as the solution provider for the Made for Canada National Network.</p>
<p>This has been followed by launching ‘<a href="https://e54b1a5c-a1c1-4de5-92be-372a9479ac65.filesusr.com/ugd/5bcc07_b96a19aa6e6c46dd9d1d697089a306e1.pdf">MyCreds</a>‘, a national, bilingual credential wallet supported by a comprehensive website for Canada’s post-secondary community and learners.</p>
<p>This initiative means the Canadian higher education community is creating the very first online platform and national credential wallet for post-secondary learners. Once fully operational, the Network will enable 3 million learners across the country to access and share their official digitized post-secondary transcripts and credentials online – anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>As Digitary CTO <a href="https://www.digitary.net/power-to-the-people/">Takis Diakoumis writes</a>:</p>
<p>“Portable learner credentials and the ability to securely assert claims to knowledge is the key enabler in ensuring this freedom of movement across places of learning and work. In exploring the next sustainable ecosystem for learners, we begin to note the technological evolution of self-sovereignty and the broader reimagination of our digital identity.”</p>
<p>“SSI enables the sharing of data in a new, controlled and trusted way, a way where no one can take it away or switch it off. A new foundational connection between institutions and learners is formed where we can completely reimagine the learner relationship, for life. The enormous impact is beyond any one sector. It is about human connections and digital trust; about how we relate to the world around us and where learners become the cornerstone of the next digital revolution.”</p>
 Scottish Case Study: City of Glasgow College 
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://myskills.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/My-Skills-Project-Generic-Model-Final.pdf">this white paper</a>&nbsp;the authors document the&nbsp;<a href="https://myskills.org.uk/">MySkills</a> project, a collaboration between the City of Glasgow College, The Scottish Qualifications Authority and APPII, to define a generic model of digital certification to be used and adapted by other awarding bodies throughout the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>This explores in specific detail the concepts described in this article, applying them to the Scottish Education and Employment market, demonstrating walk-throughs and process models for how it would work in practice and defining how the pilot project can be scaled to a nationwide roll-out.</p>
<p>Most notably it highlights the core challenge that really stands in the way of modernizing Scottish Education:</p>
<p>“Government policy can be driver. In Scotland, where this project is based, the adoption of digital certificates for vocational education qualifications is a good fit with the Scottish government ambitions for digital services and a digital economy.”</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>“Adopting digital certificates is not a very technically demanding challenge, it’s more an issue of cultural change. The challenge in going digital with certificates of learning is symptomatic of the wider challenge of adopting technology generally in education. We are dealing with a complex social, legal and economic system that is resistant to change – despite all the hype (and worse) about the ability of technology to transform education.”</p>
 Conclusion: Decentralizing Education 
<p>Digital Badges provide the building block for modernizing how assessment is conducted and how the associated academic certification is awarded, setting the foundation for transforming education – Think of the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides, and how progress accomplishment is not one final cram exam but an ongoing journey of building a portfolio of modular skills achievements.</p>
<p>The impact of this technology will go far beyond simply securing the integrity of the issued certificates, it will provide a foundation for the wholesale transformation of how education is provided. This <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-can-disrupt-higher-education-today-global-labor-market-tomorrow">Cointelegraph article</a> explores the nature and details of this transformation.</p>
<p>Blockchain and Digital Credential experts Christopher Allen and Kim Hamilton Duffy explain how a key trend is ‘personal data agency’ – To date academic credentials like degrees and transcripts are held centrally, and individuals must navigate a number of challenges and approvals to obtain access to and share them for employment purposes.</p>
<p>They can also be changed, deleted and shared without consent or knowledge of the individuals, and so the advent of the Blockchain era will see users take direct control and ownership of their records, and via technologies that ensure their integrity. This would be hugely impactful in scenarios like immigration, where an increasing number of migrants that either have lost their credentials or for whom it is impossible to tell if their documents are valid.</p>
<p>This will enable a “peer to peer” approach to learning. Christopher Allen highlights:</p>
<p>“This makes it possible for there to be P2P [peer-to-peer] competency credentials, from fellow students, teachers, co-workers, clients, contractors, employers — not just educational institutions.”</p>
<p>In other words not only can a single individual be the teacher providing the education but also the ‘institution’ certifying the student has learned the skill accordingly. Their own reputation as an expert in the field would underpin its’ legitimacy.</p>
<p>Ultimately this reflects education modernizing for the 21st century ‘Web 3.0’ world we now live in. The antiquated, top down authoritarian models of recognizing academic achievement are no longer fit for purpose and this approach would enable Scotland to pioneer the future that will replace it.</p>

 <a href="http://scottishblockchain.net"></a>[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he Blockchain has many applications far beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin – Most notably it offers the profound potential to entirely transform democracy itself. 
<p>In <a href="https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/the-blockchain-democracy-daos-a-new-organizational-structure-f734ddb0f44">this Cryptocurrency Hub article</a> the authors set the scene through explaining the building block foundations, notably DAOs, that this new paradigm could be built upon.</p>
<p>In his 2019 article <a href="https://qz.com/1706221/don-tapscott-on-using-blockchain-to-take-back-your-digital-identity/">published to Quartz</a>, digital economy luminary Don Tapscott paints the big picture, defining the next major evolutionary leap for the Internet and how it could entirely transform business models and society.</p>
<p>Describing the current Internet model, where the big platforms own and control our data, as ‘digital feudalism’, Don suggests this inequity will act as the catalyst for a wholesale evolution and revolution of the Internet.</p>
<p>“What we need is a wholesale shift in how we define and assign ownership of data assets and how we establish, manage, and protect our identities in a digital world. Change those&nbsp;rules, and we end up changing&nbsp;everything. It is a revolution to be sure. We’ve called it the blockchain revolution.”</p>
<p>The impact of this transformation will reach far further than simply technological change; it offers the potential to entirely modernize the very foundations of our societies – How our democracies work.</p>
<p>Writing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alextapscott/2016/08/16/blockchain-democracy-government-of-the-people-by-the-people-for-the-people/#64d5d3654434">on Forbes</a> Don’s son Alex Tapscott describes “Blockchain Democracy”, how the technology will not only better secure digital voting but provide the foundations for new, 21st century models for truly participative democracy.</p>
<p>“Using the Internet, citizens became more involved, learned from one another. With the blockchain, the system can cost-effectively engage all citizens and provide equal access to public services (e.g., health care, transportation, education) and social security.</p>
<p>Technology is a powerful tool but it alone cannot achieve the change we need. In the spirit of the saying “The future is not something to be predicted, it’s something to be achieved,” let’s reinvent government for a new era of legitimacy and trust. It’s time to stop the tinkering.”</p>
 Scotland’s Blockchain Democracy 
<p>Scotland’s dynamic opportunity is that their ambition for independence intersects powerfully with their ambition to become a world leading digital nation, indeed each accelerates the other.</p>
<p>Pioneering Blockchain Democracy will both provide the building block tools for forming a new nation and propel them to the forefront of countries embracing digital technologies. The associated economic growth opportunities are boundless.</p>
<p>A handful of Scottish visionaries have shone a light on this potential for Scotland and blazed the initial trail for others to follow.&nbsp;In a <a href="https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/05/10/scotlands-blockchain-democracy/">Bella Caledonia article</a>, Nicholas Russell aka <a href="https://twitter.com/YesDayScotland">YesDayScotland</a>, lays out the idea for a Scottish Blockchain Democracy, and the profound transformation it would bring about for the nation.</p>
<p>“Digital revolution and radical change is about the need to re-evolve political, economic and social justice back into the hands of Scots, preferably through legislation and policies that make human sense.</p>
<p>New digital democracy platforms, could therefore become the biggest thing to happen in Scotland, for a very, very long time.”</p>
<p>Writing <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/17002473.blockchain-help-scotland-win-independence/">for The National</a> Martin Hannan reports on the pioneering prototype work led by Nicholas, utilizing a Blockchain-based polling app to begin setting the terms for how the technology could help Scotland win independence.</p>
<p>This vision is supported by the practical government policy work required by the SNP notably Martin Docherty-Hughes, who chairs the <a href="https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/APPG/blockchain">All Parliamentary Group on Blockchain</a>, and is seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lposb23ygkw">here</a> announcing their 2021 landscape report.</p>
<p>There is international support for Scotland’s efforts too.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLv5r3R0kOQ">Speaking on our webinar series</a> earlier in the year&nbsp;Evgeny Barkov of Polys explores the role Blockchain-based digital voting can play in transforming our democracies, and how this might be pioneered in Scotland.</p>

<p></p>
 Scotland is facing a population crisis. 
<p>As the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-rural-communities-to-lose-quarter-of-their-population-1-4709834">Scotsman reported</a> in 2018 Scotland’s rural communities face losing up to a third of their working age population by 2046, losing more than a quarter of their population within the next thirty years, with Western Isles, Argyll and the Southern Uplands among the worst affected.</p>
<p>“A report by the James Hutton Institute found that “sparsely populated areas” – defined as those where fewer than 10,000 people can be reached within 30 minutes of travel – account for almost half of Scotland, but just 2.6 per cent of the population live there.”</p>
<p>It’s not unique to Scotland. In Spain they are selling off whole ‘<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-29/ghost-villages-for-sale-as-spain-fights-rural-desertification">ghost villages</a>‘.</p>
 Workers on Tap – Tapping into the Gig Economy 
<p>The answer is the ‘<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/gig-economy">Gig Economy</a>‘.</p>
<p>These refers to the overall trend of employment shifting more to contracting self-employed freelancers, a trend that the Economist described as <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2014/12/30/workers-on-tap">Workers on Tap</a>.</p>
<p>The Cloud is enabling the ‘<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-on-demand-economy-2014-7">On Demand Economy</a>‘, exemplified by ventures like Uber taxis and Airbnb. These ventures disrupt traditional industries by overlaying a ‘digital mesh’ across cities to better harness their idling resources, like available accommodation for rent or freelance taxi drivers looking for work.</p>
<p>“Every week, new services launch that aggregate and organizes freelancer labor (those with excess time) to help those who have money but not time.”</p>
<p>On Forbes.com <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdullahimuhammed/2018/06/28/4-reasons-why-the-gig-economy-will-only-keep-growing-in-numbers/#495a263811eb">Abdullahi Muhammed writes</a> how by 2020 half of all American workers will be freelancers. NACo provides a <a href="https://www.naco.org/featured-resources/future-work-rise-gig-economy">detailed report</a> on the same trend.</p>
<p>Sites like <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer.com</a>, <a href="https://www.abodoo.com/">Abodoo</a>, <a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/">Peopleperhour</a> and <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a>, among many others, all offer marketplaces where you can hire workers on tap.</p>
<p>For some sectors like tech it’s increasingly becoming seen as the norm for an employed engagement; many leaders recognizing simple ideals like how <a href="https://www.inc.com/brian-de-haaff/3-ways-remote-workers-outperform-office-workers.html?cid=sf01001">remote workers outperform office workers</a>.</p>
 The Future of Work 
<p>It’s not a new idea, also back in 2004 Thomas Malone wrote about the coming <a href="http://ccs.mit.edu/futureofwork/">Future of Work</a>, and long before that the original visionary Charles Handy described how our employment will evolve to become ‘<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/nov/10/economicdispatch.money">portfolio working</a>‘. Malone said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Imagine organizations where most workers aren’t employees at all, but electronically connected freelancers living wherever they want to.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Handy offers a blueprint for how to practically structure such a virtual team that we will implement, describing a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_organization">Shamrock organization</a>‘.</p>
<p></p>
 Digital Enterprise Centres 
<p>Interestingly the trend does not dictate entirely individualized, work-from-home scenarios, indeed the key point for rural communities looking to attract this work force is that it works best with some office facilities, provided very locally.</p>
<p>Digital Enterprise Centres are ‘Co-working’ places of work, simply offices rented in small units to one person or more at a time, so that they can enjoy the benefits of those facilities but without having to pay for the entire place.</p>
<p>Their role as economy enabling hubs is key – While the Gig Economy is inherently about individuals working alone as freelancers, often via online virtual tools and booking methods, there is still considerable value in facilitating physical collaboration.</p>
<p>This is one of the key recommendations made by the Scottish Rural College, to unlock £2.5 billion in growth for the nation through better digitally enabling our rural communities, where they describe them as “Digital Enterprise Centres“, with the recommended action being:</p>
<p>“Establishing hubs in rural towns which businesses can use or visit for better connectivity, start-up workspace, hot-desk space and training.”</p>
<p>A key dynamic is of course connecting to the Digital Economy – These work spaces provide the ‘tools of the trade’, enabling new micro-businesses to participate in a variety of online digital markets.</p>
<p>We can see them as essential foundations for the Gig Economy, when you consider factors such as the challenges for employers looking to utilize them on a large scale, challenges such as <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-create-belonging-for-remote-workers/">helping to create belonging</a>, through a better program of support for how managers can <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-managers-can-best-support-a-gig-workforce/">best support a gig economy workforce</a> remote workers.</p>
<p>Coworking centres can contribute towards these goals as shared office environments are ideal for cultivating mentorship and support environments, and is also a sound business model in it’s own right – The gig economy has been driving an explosion in <a href="https://angel.co/newsletters/cash-is-pouring-into-co-working-100418">demand for coworking office space</a>.</p>
 Conclusion – Quality of Life 
<p>For towns seeking to retain and attract young workers and their families this is how to do it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sharemyoffice.com/blog/item/38-are-rural-coworking-hubs-the-future-of-the-rural-economy">This Sharemyoffice article</a> suggests Rural Coworking hubs are the future of the rural economy, and they’re right, and in her <a href="https://medium.com/remote-office/rural-coworking-is-a-thing-2251e720f943">Medium article</a> describes why:</p>
<p>“Also if you work in a small team, the bonds made in rural coworking spaces tend to be stronger, since in these situations you normally live and work from the same place. Whether that includes, hikes and bike rides, swimming or surfing, skiing or rock climbing, living outside of the cites allows us to reconnect with the nature — which is what most of us need from time to time.”</p>
<p>Thousands are moving out of the cities to <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/how-get-by-800-month-london-netherlands/">enjoy a better quality of life</a>, and with Scotland’s rural areas like <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/scotland/orkney-islanders-best-quality-life-uk/">Orkney offering the very best of this</a> across the entire UK, there is a uniquely powerful perfect storm of opportunity to promote Scotland as the best nation in the world for digital living and working.</p>
<p>Chris Herd captures this perfectly:</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Most people don’t know I’m from – and still live in – a small city in Scotland </p>
<p>I’ve never stepped foot in SF</p>
<p>You no longer have to in order to build a global tech company</p>
<p>That’s the power of remote work</p>

 <a href="http://scottishblockchain.net"></a>A guest blog from Douglas Drummond, CTO of the <a href="https://scotcoinproject.com/">ScotCoin Project</a>. 
 It has barely been a decade since the initial release of Bitcoin and the world’s premier cryptocurrency has gone from strength to strength. 
 Secured by the power of discrete mathematics, Bitcoin provided truly novel solutions to classical problems with digital money systems (such as the Double Spend) and managed to do so in an environment that is highly resistant to hostile actors that might seek to corrupt the system. 
<p>The blockchain is a ledger distributed in its entirety to every node on the network and Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm ensures that significant computing resources must be expended by a nodes to propose adding a block of transactions. Only when the majority of the participants on the network agree that the work performed by the node is valid is the block added to the chain and distributed amongst all other nodes.</p>
<p>This “mining” process emits new Bitcoins to the node that provides the first valid solution. This ensures a truly decentralised database of transactions with no single point of failure that is capable of having entries added to it without a central body (i.e. a Bank) directly updating that ledger. Bitcoin does all of this whilst being completely open to the public allowing anybody to participate in maintaining the ledger.</p>
 The History of ScotCoin 
<p>Around the time of 2013, Scotcoin was created as a potential answer to the currency problem posed by the impending Scottish Independence referendum of 2014. As a hard fork of Bitcoin codebase, a handful of engineers worked together modifying the code to create a new blockchain and distributed Scotcointo network participants.</p>
<p>Whilst the blockchain itself was secure, it would prove that the team trying to maintain the network would be unable to fight off hostile actors denying service to the crucial end-points exposed to the public. The team then sought to migrate to the Bitcoin blockchain using a suite of tools known as Counterparty which extended Bitcoin by “writing in the margin” of standard Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p></p>
 The Evolution of Cryptocurrencies 
<p>Fast forwarding a couple of years since these developments, this nascent blockchain technology would see rapid development and evolve into other new crypocurrencies seeking to explore the possibilities of this new digital frontier. Ethereum emerged in 2015 as a Turing complete programmable blockchain upon which users could publish their own code in the form of smart contracts with Ether (ETH) being the “gas” fuelling the execution of the code.</p>
<p>This innovation would lead to the development of new types of crypto assets such as limited issue non-fungible tokens and artwork. It also led to the development of standards which would ultimately power stablecoins (see: Tether, DAI and others) and what would become known as ERC-20 tokens: deflationary, limited supply crypto assets running as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that implement a specific set of functions (for example: balanceOf, transfer, approve amongst others).</p>
<p>This would truly open the floodgates for projects all over the world to issue their own tokens in a manner that could very easily be integrated with existing crypto exchanges since they all implemented that common ERC-20 interface.</p>
<p>Another couple of years would pass and the price of Bitcoin would prove to only be going in one direction: up. The average fee for a Counterparty transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain would approach $5 making it very expensive to transact with Scotcoin version 2.0. This led to the Scotcoin team looking for alternatives since it was always intended to be a practical crypto asset, usable for day-to-day purchases.</p>
<p>However, the team were very aware of the dangers of “switching out one blockchain for another”: what would happen if the price of ETH made it just as unusable? It was only relatively recently in 2019/2020 with the latest development of Ethereum that the team behind Scotcoin took the decision to move to the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. Moving away from a Proof of Work algorithm to a novel Proof of Stake model and other improvements such as sharding meant that Ethereum represented a mature, competent and arguably the best overall long-term platform whilst staying true to the decentralised nature of crypto.</p>
<p>This brings us up to date in late 2020 where the Counterparty verison of Scotcoin has now been deprecated in favour of the new ERC-20 solution and the Scotcoin Project team has been busy migrating holders to the new environment. At the same time research and development has already begun on sharded side-chains which may be verified and “rolled up” into the main chain.</p>
 Social Transformation 
<p>With further improvements to the fee structure required by the public blockchain means that previously impractical applications can now be fleshed out such as a Universal Basic Income whereby small quantities of Scotcoin can be airdropped to community members on a regular basis without having to spend thousands of ETH on the associated transaction fees. This represents a means of introducing a new money supply directly into the hands of the populace without the need for a large institution to oversee the process. A mere handful of adminstrators would be more than capable of verifying the correct operation of the smart contracts.</p>
<p>Another potential application of Scotcoin is to create a microcosm of useful spending. For example it is feasible that a network of charities and food banks could begin accepting Scotcoin for their goods. Those in direct receipt via UBI or even by donations such as promissory notes containing the private keys to a pre-funded wallet would be able to exchange their Scotcoin for food, clothing and other vital supplies.</p>
<p>Ideally, a government level agency would enable a “buyback” of this Scotcoin at 100% of market value from these authorised retailers. This ensures that Scotcoin can easily be spent and redeemed with these whitelisted retailers whilst simultaneously discouraging use for illegal or criminal purposes.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it may even be that the future of Scotcoin lies directly in the hands of the Scottish Government and the team still stand by to offer this IP for free. With Government level intervention it would be possible to create a nationwide blockchain that is maintained in a distributed manner using spare computing cycles in council offices across the land: the blockchain would be maintained for the benefit of the Scottish population.</p>
<p>Users of the network would have their identities shielded yet each would be able to prove their uniqueness and identity using zero knowledge proofs. Additionally, given that we know that all users and nodes participating in the network are honest, we entirely do away with the need for transaction fees, making the coin useful for everyday purchases.</p>
<p>All of these aspects combine to open up applications such as acccessing public services anywhere identity must be verified: Council Tax, the NHS, even voting.</p>
<p>With adequate support and investment, this author firmly believes blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionise our society, making it a fairer and more equitable place with value making its way directly into the hands of the people, especially those most in need.</p>

 <a href="http://scottishblockchain.net"></a>Guest article from Don and Alex Tapscott 
<p>While the UK and the world grapple with the implications of Brexit, a technological revolution is quietly unfolding that offers a glimmer of hope to Scotland, regarding if it votes to stay in the UK or not.</p>
<p>We’re not talking about the social web, cloud computing, or artificial intelligence. We’re talking about the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin.</p>
<p>This technology represents nothing less than the second era of the Internet and it holds far-reaching opportunities for Europe.</p>
<p>If wielded correctly, it could provide the foundation for a more prosperous Europe. It is also the Scotland’s best hope at fulfilling the “Leavers” lofty promises of a more global and dynamic Britain.</p>
<p>The blockchain is a global distributed ledger or a vast database running on millions of devices, a third of them in Europe, where anyone can move, store, and manage anything of value—money, deeds, patents, clinical trials, academic degrees, and even votes—with unprecedented security, privacy, and inclusion. Trust derives not from powerful intermediaries like banks or governments, but from clever code and mass collaboration. For 40 years, Scotland has had the Internet of information. Now, it has the Internet of value within reach to transform the socioeconomic power grid for the better.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are three big opportunities for the Scotland. The first is to rewire the European economy for innovation. The blockchain will not simply disrupt every industry – it will dramatically lower the barriers to business creation. Anyone can build value in the global economy. The second is to reconfigure government for greater transparency and accountability. The European Union should do far more at less cost, and hand more autonomy to its members. The third is to design the preconditions for everyone to succeed. Rather than re-distributing wealth, we could pre-distribute wealth, democratizing the means by which citizens generate wealth in the first place.</p>
<p>Let’s fix the firm by replacing centralized models with open networked enterprises that leverage peer-to-peer payment mechanisms and reputation systems, global blockchain IPOs and digital smart contracts. The democratization of value creation (through entrepreneurship) and value participation (through distributed ownership) could kick-start growth across Europe.</p>
<p>London has already been bold. The Bank of England, the city’s biggest banks, and many entrepreneurs have shown global leadership on blockchain. Now, more than ever, they must innovate to ensure London’s preeminence as a global financial hub. Business leaders on the continent should also take note at the city’s success to date. But leadership is also anyone’s opportunity.</p>
<p>Let’s reinvent government for a new era of legitimacy. First, elected officials must rekindle the public’s trust in political institutions. With blockchain, voters could know with 100% certainty who contributed to a campaign or supported it. Second, everyone has a right to participate in government. With the blockchain, citizens could advocate for sealing government action in a public, unalterable and searchable record, using that data as a platform for greater engagement.</p>
<p>Third, everyone must have equal protection under the law, including refugees fleeing violence and persecution. Finally, a blockchain system could cost-effectively engage all residents and provide equal access to public services and social security. These four principles are already enshrined in the United Nation universal declaration of human rights. Blockchain provides the tools to make these aspirations reality. The survival of Scotland is at stake.</p>
<p>What better time to fix a broken monetary system than in the midst of currency crisis? Already the Bank of Canada, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England have begun experimentation with digital currencies. The benefits are numerous: killing cash would reduce crime and improve regulation, because digital money is more traceable and harder to forge than printed versions. Further, central bankers could manage monetary policy and monitor risk in the financial system. Imagine international commerce with less fraud, friction, and leakage. It’s time to stop the tinkering and start the transformation.</p>
<p>It’s time for Digital Sterling and Euro-COIN.</p>
<p>All Europeans ought to have an equal shot at prosperity. But how? First, European leaders must understand that prosperity requires universal financial inclusion. In Romania, over a third of the population lacks a bank account. Shockingly, 1.5 million people in Britain are unbanked today. Inaccurate and incomplete land titles similarly erode confidence and impede upward mobility. With blockchain technologies, we can register property rights and provide broad access to basic financial services.</p>
<p>Second, Europe should be a leader in reinventing digital rights management systems to ensure content creators get paid first, fast, and fairly. Imogen Heap’s London-based Mycelia is a good model. Artists post their music containing a smart contract on the blockchain and the software protects their rights and collects royalties, ensuring that everyone is fairly compensated. Finally, Europe can be a pioneer in enabling individuals, rather than corporations, to collect, control, and monetize their own personal data on the blockchain.</p>
<p>None of this will be easy. The European Union urgently needs a new social contract with its member states. The United Kingdom and Scotland must do the same with its citizens. Only then can they chart a new economic path for the digital age. As with the major paradigm shifts that preceded it, the blockchain will create winners and losers. But if we do this right, a more inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous Scotland, Europe and world are within reach.</p>

<p>18 February 2022 — OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced today that <a href="https://www.emqx.com/">EMQ</a>, an open-source Internet of Things data infrastructure software provider, is its newest Foundational Sponsor.  EMQ joins IBM at the Foundational Sponsor level supporting the mission of OASIS at the highest level.</p>



<p>A leading provider of open source software for IoT, EMQ, joined OASIS in 2020 to help advance the OASIS standard for the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) Protocol, the most commonly used messaging protocol for IoT. EMQ’s support is critical in advancing the development and adoption of open standards and helps enable OASIS to fulfill its mission. To learn more about EMQ’s work, please read this <a href="https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/emq-is-now-the-foundational-member-of-oasis">blog post</a> on EMQ’s website.</p>



<p>“We are very pleased to welcome EMQ as a Foundational Sponsor,” said OASIS Open Executive Director Guy Martin. “Since EMQ joined OASIS, they have been leading the cutting edge research using MQTT over QUIC and aiming to standardize it with the MQTT Technical Committee.

 The challenge of dealing with unknowns 
<p>How to move forward when expectations are high whilst divers and many open questions seem to lure on the way? How to demonstrate value of a constantly developing technology before all open issues are clarified? These uncertainties seemingly dominated the recent participation conference organized by the federal project team as the start of a series of similar events to accompany in the most transparent way the development and legislation of the newly proposed E-ID-Ecosystem for Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DIDAS (Digital Identity and Data Sovereignty Association), a not-for-profit organization uniting leading experts on Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) from academia, public and private entities in Switzerland, proposes a two streams approach to tackle this great endeavour.&nbsp;</p>
 Stream 1&nbsp; – Exploring the Foundations 
<p>The main goal of stream 1 is to show, not to tell.&nbsp; In a sandbox-type test environment practical uses cases of all sorts and sectors shall be developed and demonstrated to the general population not yet familiar to the concepts of an E-ID-Ecosystem.&nbsp; Here the main effort is to develop prototypes of the tools and applications for verifiers, holders and issuers of digital credentials, which will be made easier by leveraging readily available tools and frameworks for the underlying decentralized trust network . This is a standard procedure in modern product management known as MVP (minimum viable product). These applications will never go in production directly but serve to demonstrate the interactions of all players in such an ecosystem with all its different sectors. The key goal here is&nbsp; to demonstrate user interactions and raise all necessary questions upfront to enable the construction of a secure and efficient future E-ID-Ecosystem for real life in Stream 2.&nbsp;</p>
 Stream 2 – Building the Extended SSI Ecosystem 
<p>Stream 2 takes up all important tasks which are necessary to design and build the infrastructure, tools and governance required to provide the solid, secure and internationally interoperable basis for a Swiss E-ID as well as digital credentials from all other sectors. Key questions such as security, privacy, efficiency and resilience as well as necessary business models will be carefully evaluated, discussed and implemented.&nbsp;</p>
 Moving Fast Towards Production 
<p>Both streams will run in parallel. They will nurture each other by sharing experiences, identifying and raising new questions and finding new answers.&nbsp; The key is to iterate on the implementation in an agile way until the moment when the system, tools and governance will be safe enough to be put into production. We expect the first pilot implementation not to be the E-ID itself but rather verifiable credentials in need of lower assurance levels such as membership cards, tickets or other credentials which will be used , potentially, on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In such pilot applications, critical questions of user experience and acceptance can be validated in real life. The findings and results will feedback into further development of the systems and hardening of security and privacy. This is also a great practical way to identify legal aspects that need clarification or even potential changes in the relevant laws. Since we expect strong further development in all aspects of SSI, this approach allows for agile and continuous improvement until the stage where it will be safe enough to broadly launch the Swiss E-ID with great user experience and many questions answered.&nbsp;</p>

 Make decisions and share early and&nbsp;often <p>At the end of last year, we delivered <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-and-creative-climate-platform-116640a62132">a robust digital strategy</a> to <a href="https://juliebicycle.com/">Julie’s Bicycle</a> (JB), an organisation working at the forefront of the climate emergency and its intersection with the arts and culture industry. Together with our friends at <a href="http://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a>, we are at the beginning of a journey&nbsp;to:</p><blockquote>“grow a welcoming Open Source platform and experience that gives the international cultural community the shared knowledge and tools they need to take creative climate action with measurable impact, inspiration, confidence, and solidarity.”</blockquote> What is the Creative Climate Platform? a diagram of the various communities and components of the CC Digital&nbsp;Platform<p>Well it isn’t one single thing, it is a series of technical and social solutions that will help JB have the impact it wants to have in the world. Each piece of the puzzle is complex. There are multiple communities in play, multiple sets of tools and resources. There are a variety of ambitions and pre-existing partnerships.</p><p>We know that setting up an open project can help JB. An open project can help them receive creative input to its product(s). We can establish some sustainable processes that will help JB staff, partners and community members get involved. We will showcase solidarity and understanding with what JB’s audience needs and&nbsp;wants.</p> Another Architecture of Participation (AoP)!? <p>We’ve applied our AoP framework often enough that we have <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">a special page</a> on our website to explain it. We’ve mentioned before that <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/howto-create-an-architecture-of-participation-for-your-open-source-project-a38386c69fa5">an AoP is a contextual exercise</a> and with Julie’s Bicycle we have a blank canvas. The Creative Climate Platform is in its infancy, and we’ll be kicking off the Discovery phase of the project while maintaining the various components as separate projects and relationships. Because the work is to bring things together in the best possible way, we have an opportunity to ensure that our set up is tested and robust, using the best practices of open&nbsp;source.</p> Establishing the System Ecosystem the tools we’ll&nbsp;use<p>As we set up the project out there in the wild of the Internet, it’s important to establish and document a system to run the pieces we need. A “system ecosystem” is simply a map of exactly which tools your project is using. These maps can be more or less complex depending on what the project is. For example, a highly technical system ecosystem may have notes about the kind of tech involved (e.g. middleware, database, front-end). For our purposes, we just need a simple map of our&nbsp;systems.</p><p>We’re well aware that this won’t cover everything, but if we’re going to build a minimum viable product, we’re going to need a minimum viable set-up. Broadly, there are three categories of tools we know we’ll need right from the&nbsp;get-go:</p>  Code Repo &amp; Issue Trackers — We intend to use a public Trello board for project management tasks and actions. We will use Github for code repositories and utilize Github’s issue tracker for development tasks.  Communications &amp; Feedback — The Digital team has a Slack channel hosted by Outlandish. We will use this for team coordination. We will publish regularly about the project to a bespoke Medium publication (TBD!). We will tie in with JB’s marketing team (e.g. Twitter) for sharing of outputs from the project. Another mechanism is an email list where the team can share&nbsp;outputs.  Documentation &amp; Project Overview — We will continue to use Google docs for project documentation, planning and notetaking. We will spin up a site / wiki (TBD) at project.juliesbicycle.com (TBD) to house an overview of the project, evergreen project documentation, contribution content, and other public facing resources about the&nbsp;project.  <p><a href="https://ambiguiti.es/sitting-with-ambiguity/">We haven’t made all the decisions yet</a>! The TBDs above are things we, as a team, need to discuss.&nbsp;However…</p> Release Early and Often:&nbsp;Comms <p>One of the biggest problems in the world of open source is the flow of information from maintainers and/or paid staff to the wider community. It takes transparency and translation to take what is said at a meeting and turn it into documentation that everyone can refer back to. For products, this can be quite an easy translation — things end up on a product roadmap and in an issue tracker. When a project is a bit more complex, involving community engagement, storytelling, partnerships and more inter-personal relationships, it can be easy to lose track of where and how decisions were&nbsp;made.</p>How we will document the&nbsp;project<p>The work of engagement is essential to this sort of project. So, in an effort to be fully transparent with JB staff, community and partners, we’ve created a communication ecosystem and workflow. This will help people understand how we move information from “inside” the project to become community engagement resources.</p>A workflow for moving information around Open Licensing <p>For our engagement content as well as eventual resources in the Creative Climate platform’s E-Learning Library, we’ve recommended Julie’s Bicycle use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA license</a>. This allows people and organisations to use and remix the resources, but crucially requires them to also share any derivative works under the same&nbsp;license.</p>Popular copyleft&nbsp;licenses<p>Software licenses are a bit more complicated than permissive licenses such as Creative Commons. In this area, where almost every codebase includes code from elsewhere, instead of the default ‘All Rights Reserved’ approach of copyright we use copyleft licenses. We recommended the GNU Affero General Public v3 (in green). This closes some loopholes and adds SaaS competitor protection — other organisations providing a service based on the codebase would have to release any modifications to the source&nbsp;code.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DpKPD96yMaAKsp0PlwsWwMkz-n4YT767KlNjWXlmrfY/edit#heading=h.9i2x0xg0s4h1">You can read our full licensing recommendation here</a>.</p> Get involved <p>We’ve found that specifically establishing and publishing the open standards your project will adhere to is a good way to make sure that typical problems around communication are mitigated. We, obviously, have more to do in this arena, but we are setting our intentions for the Creative Climate platform out&nbsp;loud!</p><p>We see contributing to climate-related open source projects as a way to use tech, design and collaboration skills to help impact-focused organisations respond to the climate emergency. There’s plenty to do, no matter what your experience or skill level — leave us comments or <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">send us a note</a> to get involved!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/howto-set-open-standards-for-your-project-3e4aa1f57e1b">HOWTO: Set Open Standards for your project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Milan, 17 February. INAZ is moving another step on the ground of innovation and expands the portfolio of IT-HR solutions with the Blockchain.</p>
<p>From today, in fact, the Validator Node of DDocuments, digital transformation company controlled by INAZ, is active on the Blockchain of Commercio.network.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be part of Commercio.network. It is the first time we are actively participating as validators in a decentralised network like Blockchain. It is a technology in which we believe and which, we are sure, will bring benefits to the entire Italian production apparatus,” explains Diego Dal Ben, president of DDocuments.</p>
<p>“The partnership with Commercio.network will allow us to advance the Italian technological leadership in the Self Sovereign Identity space in Europe” comments Valerio Busnach, Business Relationship manager of INAZ.</p>
<p>The blockchain project of Commercio.network was conceived in January 2018, saw the light with the launch of the network on 4 July 2020 and today, with its nodes, among the largest European Blockchain oriented to the corporate sector.</p>
<p>“Having on board an innovative company like DDocuments, which is part of one of the most important IT groups in Europe like INAZ, increases the resilience of our Blockchain. As a network we are ready to face new challenges and seize the opportunities that the market presents us” says Enrico Talin, co-founder of Commercio.network.</p>
<p>Inaz Srl is one of the most important Italian companies in the production of software and services for the administration and management of human resources. Founded in 1948, it is a family-run business, today led by Linda Gilli, Cavaliere del Lavoro. With a sales network throughout Italy, Inaz offers innovative digital solutions to thousands of customers, including companies, public administration, professional firms, employment consultants and trade associations. Inaz, with its Study Centre and the Osservatorio Imprese Lavoro, is also a point of reference for companies and professionals in terms of updating, consultancy and training. Its headquarters are in Viale Monza 268 in Milan. <a href="https://www.inaz.it/">www.inaz.it</a></p>
<p>DDocuments srl is a specialised company that has been operating for over thirty years in the dynamic international panorama of document digitisation. The expression of this know-how is DDocuments, the extremely high-performance proprietary platform of the same name, which provides high added-value services in digital document management: standard digital storage, document transmission, PEC, digital signatures, electronic invoicing to B2B and PA, graphometric signatures to completely dematerialise digital processes such as the issue of delivery notes, contracts, approval cycles, etc. For further information <a href="http://www.d-documents.it">www.d-documents.it</a></p>
<p>Commercio.network spa is the company that has conceived, realised and is further developing the blockchain Commercio.Network. It is an open-source project that gives companies the possibility to sign and exchange documents using blockchain technology. It enables its member companies to create digital identities, electronically sign and exchange digital business documents with a guarantee of authorship (i.e. that the document was created by the stated sender), validity (i.e. that the sender cannot disavow having electronically signed the document) and integrity (i.e. that the document has not been altered in transit/exchange). The Commercio.Network blockchain provides a simple, fast and profitable way to create value for them and their end customers.<a href="http://www.commercio.network.it"> www.commercio.network.it</a></p>

<p>Kia ora koutou,</p>



<p>Thank you for reading DINZ’s first newsletter for 2022! 2021 finished in a whirl of activity as we delivered both our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116015/tab/submissionsandadvice?Criteria.PageNumber=1">written</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/EDSISCNZ/videos/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill-hearing-of-evidence-part-i-16-dec/327200735683899/?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZXlJ6Y0dsStyhjLQKyvi8cFT4VI8VHhROWJ01y02rZGAybkXBJ-BSTKkgUcUPFF28LSJVsErpLlHZpptZlZ8H46FFiJYH3lkIpvED_iLewMazIMEfe1YCgvPl0y_JRjHigl_ovvg0e-JQxRVWyohu_vGg9ncpdeyUs3O3PSkS22ywx8CZhDsq84R87Kqe6XlDoM5qnOHUXgfW7G03DGimvK">oral</a>&nbsp;submissions to the Select Committee regarding the draft&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/whole.html#whole">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bill</a> and held our annual meeting and elections for the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council for 2022</a>. We welcomed Angela Gill and Paul Platen (as Chair) and farewelled Janelle Riki-Waaka, Jane Retimana, John Evans and invited-independent Tamāra Al-Salim, thanking them for their outstanding service. Further announcements will be made regarding those filling the three seats that became vacant after the annual election cycle.</p>



<p>2022 looks set to be even busier than 2021 as DINZ embarks on further keystone research and two additional working groups. One working group examines digital identity challenges in marginalised communities, the other is seeking feedback on and finalising DINZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/09tfy4m4e6jbq6l/DINZ%20Te%20Tiriti%20o%20Waitangi%20SOI%20%26%20Action%20Plan%20%28V2%29.pdf?dl=0&amp;utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=b09c67927a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-b09c67927a-118150165">Statement of Intent regarding Te Tiriti o Waitangi</a>&nbsp;with its associated action plan. We are also growing the existing working group that supports its identity service provider members on the operational rules aspects of the Trust Framework. And it goes without saying that we remain closely involved with making the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;simply the best digital identity event in Australasia. More details of DINZ’s plans for 2022 will be released as they are confirmed by the Executive Council.</p>

<p>We're excited to share that 3Box Labs, core developers of Ceramic, has raised a $30,000,000 Series A co-led by Multicoin Capital and Union Square Ventures to accelerate development of Ceramic and unlock data composability in the Web3 ecosystem. Ceramic's decentralized data network makes it easy for developers to build powerful applications on top of an open ecosystem of composable data.</p>  3Box Labs is 15 employees today and we're growing quickly. If you want to have a massive impact on the next foundational Web3 infrastructure, join us at <a href="https://careers.3boxlabs.com">careers.3boxlabs.com</a>!&nbsp;  <p></p> The Composable Web3 Data Network <p>At its core, the internet is a bunch of applications running on stateful data. Every time we post, follow, like, share, edit and otherwise use any of our favorite apps like Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, or TikTok, we're generating data – hundreds of millions of data events every second – data that is quickly becoming society's most valuable resource. On today's web, this value is locked away on centralized application database servers like MongoDB, mySQL, and Confluent that weren't designed to be open and collaborative. The architecture of these databases, and the incentives they create, prevent us from collectively realizing the true potential of data and the original vision for the internet.</p><p>Decentralized networks provide alternative incentive structures that allow data to be unbundled from applications. However, not all networks are equal. Ethereum, Solana, and similar blockchains decentralize state for financial use cases like tokens and NFTs. Because they're made for finance, they aren't designed to support the scale and transaction volumes required by non-financial use cases for data. Most Web3 developers building dapps today use a blockchain as their financial backend, but store application data and other user-generated content on a centralized database, drastically limiting the types of applications that can be built on Web3. &nbsp;</p><p>This is why we created Ceramic, a decentralized network for composable Web3 data. The network consists of three core components:</p>  Scalable, decentralized data infrastructure   Open APIs for storing, modifying, and retrieving data   Community-created marketplace of reusable data models  <p>With this design, Ceramic makes it possible for developers to build applications by on a global network of composable data. For example on Ceramic, Twitter-like apps would run on a few shared data models: one for each user’s tweets, one for their social graph, and one for their DMs. By simply adopting the same data models, applications automatically share data and developers no longer need to worry about bootstrapping their database from scratch. </p><p>Ceramic's community-driven approach to creating and sharing data models provides developers with a rich set of standards and tools to use when building their apps. Today there are thousands of developers who’ve already built over 400 applications on Ceramic. As more data models are created by the community, the variety of use cases for Ceramic will continue to expand, creating compounding innovation across applications in Web3.</p> Growing the community <p>This $30M Series A funding round gives us the opportunity to welcome some of the brightest minds in Web3 to the Ceramic community. </p><p>We're thrilled to welcome the following funds and ecosystem partners: Multicoin, USV, Placeholder, Reciprocal Ventures, CoinFund, Jump Crypto, Figment, Hashed, Metacartel Ventures, Edge &amp; Node, Digital Currency Group, Variant Fund, Dapper Labs, Animoca Brands, Protocol Labs, Coinbase Ventures, ConsenSys, The LAO, Dialectic, Zee Prime, StreamingFast, BlockScience, P2P Capital, DaoSquare, Polymorphic Capital, Redbeard Ventures, Collab+Currency, Not Boring Capital, Gaingels, Distributed Global, Bitscale, Northzone, Venrock, Fenbushi, Amplify Partners, Page One, The Fintech Fund, Warburg Serres, 6th Man Ventures, and Underscore.</p><p>And angels: Aditi Sriram, Alan Curtis, Alessio Fanelli, Alex Salnikov, Alisha.eth, Annika Lewis, Billy Luedke, Blake Jennelle, Brian Flynn, Calvin Liu, Chase Chapman, Chris Hamm, Dan Heyman, Dan Romero, David Phelps, DeFi Dad, Derek Yoo, Ele Diakomichalis, Florian Hagenbuch, Illia Polosukhin, Jad Esber, Jeremy Sklaroff, Joe Lallouz, Julia Lipton, Julia Rosenberg, Ken Gunter, Kerman Kohli, Mason Nystrom, Meltem Demirors, Nima Ashgari, Oaksprout, Robert Toews, Roham Gharegozlou, Ryan Selkis, Sari Azout, Sean Li, Stefan George, Suji Yan, Tegan Kline, Vadim Koleoshkin, Yannick Folla, and Zach Frankel.</p><p>Here's what Multicoin and USV had to say:</p>  <a href="https://multicoin.capital/2022/02/16/the-composable-web3-data-network/">The Composable Web3 Data Network</a>, by Kyle Samani @ Multicoin  <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2022/02/ceramic/">Ceramic</a>, by Nick Grossman @ USV   What's next? <p>In the coming weeks, we will be launching Ceramic 2.0, the next major version of the protocol.

<p>In October 2021, The Engine Room launched a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/digital-rights-and-environmental-justice-intersections-and-funder-strategies-for-better-futures/">new research project</a> exploring intersections between digital rights and environmental/climate justice. Responding to a mounting sense of urgency around the intensifying climate crisis, our research, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/upcoming-research-how-digital-rights-and-climate-justice-intersect/">in partnership with the Ford Foundation, Mozilla and Ariadne</a>, seeks to identify shared concerns and synergies between diverse movements and communities working on these issues, with the goal of strengthening funding and other support for work at their intersection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our report will be published alongside a set of research deep dives exploring different issue areas related to digital rights and climate/environmental justice, forthcoming from the <a href="https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/">Open Environmental Data Project</a>, <a href="https://www.bsr.org">BSR</a>, and the <a href="https://www.apc.org/">Association for Progressive Communications</a> – so keep an eye out for those, too!</p>



<p>We’ll be publishing our findings within the next few months but in the meantime we’d like to share some of what we have learned so far through our initial desk research, community calls, and interviews with practitioners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those we’ve spoken to come from a diverse set of movements and communities, and work in different regions of the world, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Digital rights activists and technologists looking to pay closer attention to the needs of climate struggles as they’re being articulated by those closest to the problem&nbsp;  Engineers creating more sustainable internet infrastructure and web services&nbsp;  Youth climate organizers pushing for internet access so their communities can participate in international climate debates&nbsp;  Environmental lawyers supporting communities collecting data on environmental harm  Fossil fuel divestment specialists concerned with the digital safety of climate defenders.  



<p>We’ve learned that among this diverse group of people, there are number of important shared concerns, including:&nbsp;</p>



  Sustainable internet and green technologies. Technologists and sustainability experts are working to increase the efficiency of technological infrastructure and transition this infrastructure to renewable energy sources. As more energy-efficient infrastructure is developed in both the corporate and nonprofit sphere, digital rights practitioners are raising concerns around the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jun/24/smart-meters-spying-collecting-private-data-french-british#:~:text=Personal%20details%20like%20your%20name,them%20permission%20to%20do%20so.%E2%80%9D">data-intensive nature of some of these infrastructures</a>, and are looking to ensure that more sustainable tech doesn’t also lead to potential digital rights infringements.  Climate-related disinformation. A long-standing problem <a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Change-and-Digital-Advertising-86222daed29c6f49ab2da76b0df15f76#4">perpetuated by fossil fuel companies and other corporate actors</a>, digital rights and environmental/climate justice practitioners are now exploring how algorithmic techniques and big tech business models contribute to the spread of this disinformation online. Those we’ve interviewed are asking if it’s possible to disrupt the incentives behind climate disinformation spread on social media platforms like Facebook and twitter.&nbsp;  Environmental data and pollution monitoring. A number of community-led initiatives around the world have been collecting and sharing data in order to defend local communities against extractive companies and to monitor biodiversity loss. This field has grappled with how to ethically steward collected data and best use it to push for accountability. Practitioners focused on this intersection of digital/data and climate/environmental issues are exploring <a href="https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/research-type/data-governance-models-and-the-environmental-context">alternative data governance models</a> which can respect digital rights and <a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care">indigenous data sovereignty</a> while using this data to build a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eZL_pHlr876xe7PTaMfqePe9WQ3Y3IQI/view">data commons</a><a href="https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/research-series/issue-brief-cj-knowledge-commons">.</a>  



  Threats to safety. With new laws banning protest and intensified surveillance against climate movements around the world, the climate and environmental justice practitioners we’ve spoken to have expressed deep concern about the ability of their communities and movements to protest and push back against powerful harm-doers.They argue that safety and digital security should be understood as a precondition for being able to continue to fight for climate/environmental justice. While the digital rights field has spent the last decade plus increasing digital security capacity within civil society, those working directly with climate movements identify an enormous need for more support.  Migration justice. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html">An intensifying climate crisis is already pushing vulnerable populations to militarised international borders</a>, with surveillance-intensive border technologies being used to preempt migration. The climate/environmental and digital rights practitioners we’ve spoken to argue that both digital rights and environmental/climate justice movements have a responsibility to address injustices around migration, and anticipate how these issues may intensify in coming decades.&nbsp;  



<p>Along with such shared concerns, we also see what we call ‘productive frictions’ – differences in worldview, which affect the kinds of collaborations that are possible across movements and communities. We outline a couple here:</p>



  The first is around how sustainability is defined by different groups. While a lot of work is happening in the corporate tech space to move towards sustainability, both the environmental/climate and digital rights practitioners we have spoken to disagree on what meaningful sustainability actually means in the context of a ‘<a href="https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/vol22-1/agua-es-vida-solidarity-science-against-false-climate-change-solutions/">just transition’</a>. As big tech companies promise to transition to renewable energy sources, some are happy to see any progress on this front, while others argue for a more critical lens on climate pledges and net zero promises.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies"> ‘Greenwashing’</a> is one concern. Furthermore, some of those we’ve spoken to argue that ‘net zero’ is not a meaningful sustainability goal on its own. Instead, the environmental impacts of technologies must be considered more broadly in light of the many <a href="https://giswatch.org/node/6245">continued forms of extraction</a> and injustice that come with a transition to ‘renewable’ energy sources.  Relatedly, we observe differing views on the potential of technologies to serve as tools to mitigate the climate crisis. &nbsp;For example, some environmental/climate justice practitioners and technologists are optimistic about the use of AI and machine learning to <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/">advance sustainability goals</a>, while others <a href="https://medium.com/@AINowInstitute/ai-and-climate-change-how-theyre-connected-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-6aa8d0f5b32c">highlight</a> that these technologies can actually increase fossil fuel use and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">exacerbate </a><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-021-00043-6#:~:text=Sustainability%20of%20AI%20is%20focused,of%20AI%20for%20the%20environment.">sustainability issues</a>. The debate around the role of AI in sustainability is part of a broader concern both digital rights and environmental/climate justice practitioners express about <a href="https://giswatch.org/node/6254">‘techno-solutionist’ thinking</a> around how to ‘solve’ the climate crisis. They argue that tech-centric discourse about solutions diverts energy and resources away from already well-established and community-led interventions.&nbsp;  Finally, we see that practitioners working on both environmental/climate justice and digital rights have differing perspectives on the role of corporations and governments in coming up with solutions. Some push for a focus on government responsibility and corporate accountability, while others argue that movements shouldn’t wait for institutional change and should instead focus on autonomous and local efforts. These differences inform where energy is placed in pushing for progress.  



<p>The points we’ve shared here offer just a glimpse of the issues we’ve encountered so far, and we’re excited to learn more as we continue our research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As mentioned, we’ll be publishing a report with our full findings in the next few months, which will also include a set of recommendations for funders for how to support work at these intersections forward.</p>



<p>For now, we invite you to reach out to us if you have any thoughts on these issues you’d like to share! Please feel free to email us at becky[at]theengineroom.org.</p>

   A news item caught the attention of the ToIP Foundation in the past week where there was a lot of controversy.

<p>The Trust Over IP Foundation was established to bring trust into the virtual, online world where, all too often, there is low or no trust in data exchanges. To overcome this challenge, the 100s of public and private sector members of ToIP promote open standards-based, interoperable solutions where the individual is in possession and control of their cryptographically verifiable identity attributes. In this context, a news item caught the attention of the ToIP Foundation in the past week where there was a lot of controversy over an exclusive contract between the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and identity provider ID.Me. We base this post on publicly available information and begin with a quote from a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/27/irs-face-scans/">Washington Post article</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Millions of Americans could soon have to scan their faces to access their Internal Revenue Service tax accounts, one of the government’s biggest expansions yet of facial recognition software into people’s everyday lives. For now, taxpayers can still file their returns the old-fashioned way; the IRS began accepting returns for 2021 earnings on Monday, encouraging electronic filing. But by this summer, anyone wanting to access their records — including details about child tax credits, payment plans or tax transcripts — on <a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/your-online-account#alternatives">the IRS website</a> could be required to record a video of their face with their computer or smartphone, and send it to the private contractor <a href="https://www.id.me/">ID.me</a> to confirm their identity.</p></blockquote>



<p>Background</p>



<p>On November 17, 2021 the IRS announced the launch of an improved <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-unveils-new-online-identity-verification-process-for-accessing-self-help-tools">identity verification and sign-in process</a> that enables more people to securely access and use IRS online tools and applications. And we agree with IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig that, “Identity verification is critical to protect taxpayers and their information.”</p>



<p>To access certain IRS online tools and applications, the IRS decided to mandate that citizens provide extremely sensitive personal information, both biometric and biographic, to a single, private-sector entity. This entity would centrally store it, perform probabilistic analysis (biometric matching) with little or no transparency of how the solution was certified, how often it will be recertified, by whom, and what accuracy, security, or privacy criteria will be utilized.</p>



<p>While it is not clear why the IRS would relinquish this extremely sensitive capability in its entirety to a single, private-sector entity using a proprietary solution, there are clues. In the associated <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pia/id-me-pia.pdf">Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)</a> under PRIVACY TESTING, for example, the response to “Does the system require a System Test Plan?” is NO and the follow-on response to “Please explain why:” is “This [is] a[n] ID.me owned and operated system and not subject to IRS System Test Plan at this time.”&nbsp; The fact that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/us/politics/irs-idme-facial-recognition.html">IRS removed the mandate</a> for the Facial Recognition component of the proprietary ID.me solution several days after the story was broadly publized does not resolve the underlying challenges of this approach to achieve trusted, remote authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Challenge 1 – Ethical Use of Biometrics</p>



<p>Strong authentication can benefit from the use of biometric technologies but there are no policies in place for their ethical use which should include measures to ensure that accuracy, security, and privacy criteria commensurate with the specific use case(s) are certified and monitored.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To this end, the Office of Science and Technology Policy recently published a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/08/2021-21975/notice-of-request-for-information-rfi-on-public-and-private-sector-uses-of-biometric-technologies">Notice of Request For Information (RFI) on Public and Private Sector Uses of Biometric Technologies</a>. To meet the Ethical Use of Biometrics challenge, our policy makers must provide guard rails for the use of biometrics technologies in both the public- and private-sectors which are use-case specific. That is, similar to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/82381/download">FDA’s 12-step approval process for drugs</a> to be considered safe and effective, before any drug can be released to the market for a specific, on-label use, it must go through a process that includes rigorous testing, with independent review, to demonstrate safety and efficacy, as well as post-approval monitoring.</p>



<p>Challenge 2 – Trusted, Remote Authentication</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation was established to simplify and standardize <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">how trust is established over a digital network [PDF]</a> or using digital tools (whether online or disconnected) by expanding the opportunities of digital trust by bringing a unified stack of standards for technical interoperability—the same approach that has been successful with the Internet and the Web— together with a unified model for expressing the rules and policies (“governance”) by which people and organizations can cooperate to achieve trust.</p>



<p>ToIP provides guidance, frameworks, and other assets to obviate the need for entities such as the IRS to rely on a single, private-industry contractor’s centralized solution to enable U.S. citizens to strongly prove their digital identities—any more than they would need to rely on a single company to provide them access to the Internet. Instead, like the Internet, the open standards-based ToIP stack (depicted below from the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">interactive model</a>) would enable citizens to use any digital wallet, any verifiable credentials, and any privacy-respecting biometric verification technologies that meet the requirements of the IRS (as published in their governance framework) to prove a citizen’s identity and give them safe access to their tax records.</p>







<p>There are experts within the US Government that are familiar with, supporting, and promoting the standards associated with decentralized digital identity.&nbsp; They, along with many others internationally, support related ecosystems that enable entities to establish verifiable trust to issue cryptographically verifiable identity attributes that remain in the possession and control of the individual who may then selectively disclose cryptographically verifiable proofs (with or without the underlying identity attributes) through secure channels to verifiers that have established trust.</p>



<p>Where a citizen has a Foundational Identity through a government sanctioned identity proofing process – where the sanctioned entity, as per this <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">NIST Special Publication</a>, was able to “Resolve a claimed identity to a single, unique identity within the context of the population…”, e.g., passport, REALID driver’s license, that Foundational Identity should be used to authenticate an identity claim for each Functional Identity activity like paying taxes, voting, opening a bank account, receiving COVID-19 vaccination, or receiving a COVID-19 vaccination credential.</p>



<p>The ToIP trust ecosystem enables individuals to authenticate themselves using their trusted, cryptographically verifiable Foundational Identity and share cryptographically verifiable Functional Identity proofs without intermediation.</p>



<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of pushing proprietary, privacy-diminishing, honey-pot creating solutions, the IRS should strive for open standards-based, interoperable solutions where the individual is in possession and control of their cryptographically verifiable identity attributes (versus a single, private-sector vendor) as are the members of the ToIP Foundation.</p>

  <p>Public users of LEI data are reminded that from March 1, 2022, all GLEIF services will accept and display data in updated Common Data File (CDF) formats, requiring users to implement these new file formats ahead of that deadline for uninterrupted access to LEI data. The updated file formats will increase the level of open, standardized, and high-quality legal entity reference data available within the Global LEI Index. </p>
<p>The CDF formats define how LEI issuing organizations report their LEI and reference data. GLEIF published updates to the formats in 2021 to align with the following new ROC policies: </p>
 
 <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20181030-1.pdf">Legal Entity Events (formerly referred to as ‘Corporate Actions’) and Data History in the Global LEI System Policy.</a> CDF revision: Specifies events that alter the entity, the relationship data of a legal entity, or result in the retirement and/or creation of LEIs. 
 <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20190520-1.pdf">Policy on Fund Relationships and Guidelines for the registration of Investment Funds in the Global LEI System.</a> CDF revision: Introduces three new distinct relationship types that can be collected for funds. 
 <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20201229.pdf">LEI Eligibility for General Government Entities Guidance Document</a>. CDF revision: Allows certain legal entities to be classified as Government Entities or International Organizations. 
 
<p>Throughout the month of March, all LEI issuing organizations will migrate to the new formats and undergo testing to ensure a smooth transition. Users of the Global LEI System should therefore be prepared to support content following the existing and new business rules throughout March when performing LEI data analysis. This applies to users of the following LEI data: </p>
 
 GLEIF Concatenated files 
 Golden Copy and Delta files 
 Golden Copy files accessed via the GLEIF API 
 
<p>Data consumers can make their updates to the new format versions in advance of March 1, 2022 as files in the older formats are compatible with the new ones. To support data consumers who are unable to update their data processing by March 1, 2022, GLEIF provides ‘Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations’ (XSLT) which allow these data consumers to transform the newer versions, from a technical format perspective, into the previous versions.</p>
<p>GLEIF has made many supporting resources available on its website, including technical details, example files and a guiding document for the transition period from March 1 to 31, 2022. </p>
<p>After March 31, 2022, GLEIF anticipates a period of up to one year before the Global LEI System will be fully populated with information on Legal Entity Events, Fund Relationships and Government Entities. Data is generally collected at the time of new LEI issuance or existing LEI renewal.</p>
<p>Continuous Access to GLEIF Data in RDF on data.world </p>
<p>In advance of the impending deadline, GLEIF can confirm that a successful collaboration with data.world has ensured that all GLEIF data in RDF (Resource Description Framework) hosted by data.world – which includes the entire Golden Copy XML dataset – has been updated to the new file formats. This will ensure seamless access to LEI linked open data for the global LEI community by data.world, the world’s largest open data community. data.world hosts an Saas-based enterprise data catalog comprising nearly 500,000 open datasets. </p>
<p>Additional support</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional support ahead of the March 1 deadline, please email GLEIF: <a href="mailto:info@gleif.org">info@gleif.org</a>.</p>

<p>Last week, we ran the first Keep Badges Weird community call, and it was even more energising than <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/join-the-keep-badges-weird-community-call-9da6f9b08048">we expected it to be</a>. We were so pleased to see so many people interested in the current and future status of badges and open recognition. We were elated to begin to have a deep conversation about counteracting the top-down focus of institutions and large organisations using badges for corporate stuff. There’s an outstanding question, for us, around how this community explores and thinks about the theoretical underpinnings of a Community of Practice (CoP), but one thing is for sure, Keep Badges Weird is a&nbsp;CoP.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers of&nbsp;WAO<p>When we started this project in the middle of last year, we knew that we wanted to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/participation-thats-what-s-gonna-save-the-human-race-pete-seeger-ae57ba8370a5">bring together people who are motivated and who are influential</a> in getting an organisation to start thinking about upskilling in a non-traditional way. We also wanted to make sure curious folks had a place to learn and&nbsp;engage.</p><blockquote>“It was an interesting start to an important topic. I was thinking afterwards, pulling from the need of having metaphors and analogies, that #keepbadgesweird needs to come couple with #keepbadgessustainable, #keepbadgesviable, and #keepsbadgesuseful” (<a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/kbw-s-first-community-call/8307d32c-6a34-44cc-a498-9b815a4a00b2">Stella&nbsp;Porto</a>)</blockquote> Community values? <p>We’re pleased that curious badge advocates as well as badge champions showed up to the KBW call. The call definitely had a positive(?) vibe about it — the community is truly interested in keeping badges WEIRD. We also acknowledged, however, that metaphors and analogies are required. Our shared language is contextual.</p><blockquote>“How can we convey the usefulness of badges to recognise all different kinds of learning, participation and professional development?” — <a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/kbw-s-first-community-call/8307d32c-6a34-44cc-a498-9b815a4a00b2">Esther&nbsp;Grieder</a></blockquote><p>There are other things, though, that the community seemed to value as evidenced through the sorts of discussions we had about badging and co-creation. This community is interested in:</p><p>• Trust — We are using and building a shared language, but trying to ensure that diverse voices can be heard. Our call was for everyone, and we had people show up and contribute from a wide variety of backgrounds.</p><p>• Integrity — Based on the vibe at the community call, this community is a place where we can practice what we preach. There was honest discussion and admirable dissent. There was an obvious adherence to the idea that badging is about the learner, not about the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>• Advocacy — There seemed to be a thread about the community’s job to advocate for that learner. Contributors spoke about the “true” value of badging within a community and balancing badges as community connectors vs personal certificates or&nbsp;markers.</p><p>These values indicate that we need some sort of a manifesto, a way to align the work the community does together. Community badges could start to signal what <a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/kbw-s-first-community-call/8307d32c-6a34-44cc-a498-9b815a4a00b2">Serge Ravet and Julie Keane</a> were really talking about — that badging can build a collective identity.</p><p>Community members pointed out that context matters and that trying to generalise may make it hard to be helpful to all participants. Co-creating a manifesto for the community might make a great frame for a future&nbsp;call.</p> Co-creating the “Moderator” badge images cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers from&nbsp;WAO<p>One of the things we intended to do on the community call was to define the metadata for the ‘CoP Coach’ badge. We envisioned that this would recognise moderation duties within the community, so we had in mind talking about benefits and responsibilities.</p><p>However, during the call, we split into two virtual rooms, with one focusing on this element of the discussion. This group started off, quite rightly, by questioning the name of the badge. Given we only had an hour together in total, we had interesting meta discussions but didn’t get into the metadata&nbsp;itself!</p><p>In our next community call, we would hope to take this further and perhaps pin down some of the criteria for this badge, so we can get on with deputising active community members and growing the KBW community</p> Next steps Open Peeps from https://openpeeps.com<p>Since the first KBW community call there have been useful suggestions and discussion, including ideas around building badges in sprints, creating a gallery of ‘weird’ badges, and potentially creating a website at a level above KBW which is for all different kinds of community projects related to badges and open recognition.</p><p>If you would like to be part of the discussion, <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">join the community</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/emergent-community-building-a35f9431d8a">Emergent community building</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 11 February 2022 — Today, Energy Web announced that Power &amp; Mobility Ltd., the company behind bloXmove.com, has joined as Energy Web’s newest member and Validator of the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>Power &amp; Mobility is a pioneering solutions provider working to create a worldwide decentralized and collaborative urban mobility alliance alongside an efficient green energy reality using blockchain technology. Their bloXmove.com platform offers a business-to-business Mobility Blockchain Platform (MBP) that seamlessly connects micromobility providers, fleet operators, public transportation, and corporate mobility managers with CPOs, EMSPs. With its decentralized platform-as-a-service approach, bloXmove.com provides the transactional capabilities required to conduct end-to-end business in real-time, without the need for a centralized party. Thereby taking care of identification, verification, smart contracting, and payment transactions.</p><p>As the company name, “Power and Mobility”, clearly signals, bloXmove.com is also applying its core ledger technology to couple both sectors.

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 10 February 2022 — Blockdaemon is proud to announce a partnership with <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a>, a global nonprofit organization building operating systems for energy grids using open-source decentralized technologies. We at Blockdaemon are no strangers to <a href="https://blockdaemon.com/blog/how-you-can-help-blockchain-go-green/">adopting clean, green-energy blockchain infrastructure</a>. Our partnership with Energy Web furthers our commitment to helping make the world more sustainable.</p><p>Blockdaemon is a certified Energy Web validator node operator, working to support the success of the Energy Web Foundation and ecosystem.</p><p>Energy Web’s digital operating systems for energy are a promising application of blockchain. It makes it easy for clean energy assets to support the grid of the future. This mission is guided by the founding principle of decarbonizing the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The realization of Energy Web’s vision will help result in a secure transition to sustainable energy, by making it seamless and easy for clean energy assets like batteries and electric vehicles to connect to energy markets around the world. It represents one of the largest and most ambitious uses of a decentralized, open-access, consumer-facing blockchain that the world has seen to&nbsp;date.</p><p>Quote Blockdaemon<br>“We are excited to help with the energy transition of the world by supporting the Energy Web Chain and its ecosystem participants. Anyblock has been a validator and active participant from day 1. Now, as part of the Blockdaemon team, we happily continue this collaboration and are looking forward to helping expand to the Polkadot universe and offering staking opportunities.” says Freddy Zwanzger, Ethereum Ecosystem Lead at Blockdaemon.</p><p>“Companies like Blockdaemon are essential to bringing enterprise-grade versions of the Energy Web stack to life,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “Infrastructure services for decentralized applications are common outside the energy sector in the world of Web3. Blockdaemon is helping to bridge the gap by providing Web3 services to the Energy Web community of grid operators and energy&nbsp;majors.”</p> Blockdaemon: Supporting Blockchain Sustainability <p>At Blockdaemon, we support a <a href="https://blockdaemon.com/marketplace/">suite of blockchain</a> networks, each serving a unique role in the industry. The future global landscape will consist of a constellation of interoperable protocols all working together to serve different purposes, interfaced with billions on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>Each protocol will bring its own unique values and benefits. This web of technology will include permissionless networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) and permissioned networks. Energy Web’s network has onboarded major institutions, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/shell-subsidiary-builds-dlt-based-virtual-power-plant-in-germany">such as Shell</a>, to accelerate sustainability.</p><p>As robust transaction ledgers, all of these different types of systems can satisfy the criteria of being a blockchain, yet the DNA of each will be fundamentally different. Bitcoin was the first truly permissionless payment network, with a dynamic and decentralized set of actors all working to keep the network alive. In simple terms, anyone who met the requirements could and still can operate a node, as well as transact on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Today, ledgers such as Energy Web Chain are alternatives to permissionless ledgers such as Bitcoin. These chains often comprise a static and federated set of trusted actors to maintain the integrity of the system while still allowing any developers or users to access the network. Blockdaemon runs a validator node on the Energy Web Chain. Networks like Energy Web’s bring their own unique set of features and functionality.</p><p>Because the Energy Web Chain is managed by known entities in the energy sector, upgrades to the network can be rolled out seamlessly. This avoids contentious hard forks, which split many blockchains in governance disputes over the future of the protocol.</p><p>Another advantage is custody and maintenance. The Energy Web Foundation is building sophisticated tooling on top of the blockchain to help its many partners and its users. This gives a great deal of material support to the Energy Web ecosystem and paves the way for future success. It differs from other Web 3 communities systems, which are often open-source and rely purely on volunteers.</p><p>By having a system focused on enterprise adoption of decentralized technologies, Energy Web Chain is best placed to achieve its vision of a sustainable network, reaching entities who want to use Energy Web’s dApps, SDKs, and utility packages.</p> Energy Web Token’s&nbsp;Staking <p>Energy Web Token (EWT) will soon expand its <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-staking-roadmap-54d6fd227eff">staking</a> mechanism. Staking will be key to operating the new energy grid. This energy grid comprises green energy assets, such as solar panels and wind turbines. By staking, enterprises and even clean energy asset owners can commit to delivering the load (or battery for storage) or supply of electricity. The protocol can slash companies or users who do not deliver on commitments. Those who successfully deliver can earn extra&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Staking is open to verified individuals only. All staking operators must create a Decentralized Identifier (DID) that is authorized to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>As the world’s leading staking-as-a-service provider, Blockdaemon delivers industry-leading staking solutions across all major proof-of-stake chains. We commend Energy Web for their embracing of this new staking&nbsp;model.</p> Energy Web &amp; Parity Technologies <p>Energy Web has partnered with Parity Technologies to launch <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/parity-technologies-and-energy-web-partner-to-launch-new-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-205e66529441">Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain</a>. Parity Technologies are a leading Web3 software development company. They have built the core technology that supports Polkadot and Kusama, underpinned by Substrate. Energy Web will leverage Substrate to allow energy sector institutions to deploy their own sovereign, customizable blockchains of their own or in partnership with other energy market participants. This grants enterprises the unrivaled ability to customize their own bespoke chain, with governance and economics built-in.</p><p>Currently, Energy Web runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The launch of the Consortia Relay Chain represents an integration into one of the largest and fastest-growing Web3 ecosystems.</p> Tackling Climate Change with Blockchain <p>In the broad landscape of blockchain technology, Energy Web shows the strongest potential to help achieve a zero-carbon economy.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable of Energy Web’s advantages is its well-established <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/workwithus/our-ecosystem/">institutional partners</a>. These partners include companies such as E.ON, Siemens, Vodafone, and Volkswagen, among many&nbsp;others.</p><p>Energy Web’s commitment to energy sustainability and accessibility to green tech is one with which we at Blockdaemon are strongly aligned. By using blockchain technology, Energy Web is positioned to radically advance one of the major problems facing the world today. This is why we are proud to support Energy Web, as a certified node operator.</p><p>We look forward to continuing our support of Energy Web into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

 memoresa testet Login ohne Passwort mit&nbsp;Lissi memoresa bietet einen einfachen Login ohne Passwort mit dem Lissi Wallet&nbsp;an.<p><a href="https://memoresa.de/de/">memoresa </a>ist der digitale Wegbegleiter für das ganze Leben. Im memoresa-Portal können Nutzerinnen und Nutzer digital vorsorgen, ihren Nachlass planen und Ordnung schaffen — und das alles unter der Prämisse von höchstem Datenschutz und höchster Datensicherheit. Über den Desktop oder das Smartphone können Angelegenheiten aus verschiedensten Lebensbereichen geregelt, geordnet und aktualisiert werden, angefangen bei Versicherungsunterlagen und Immobilien über Online-Zugänge und Mietverträge bis hin zu Patientenverfügungen, Testamenten und Impfnachweisen.</p><p>Zum Authentifizieren bzw. Einloggen in Online-Portale und Apps wird üblicherweise eine Kombination aus E-Mail-Adresse und selbst gewähltem Passwort oder ein von großen Technologieanbietern bereitgestellter Login-Dienst genutzt. Der Login mit Facebook, Google und Co. ist dabei zwar sehr einfach und nutzerzentriert, macht Nutzende jedoch gleichzeitig noch abhängiger von großen Konzernen, die Daten über das Nutzerverhalten häufig an Werbetreibende verkaufen.</p> Login mit dem Lissi Wallet: nutzerzentriert und selbstbestimmt <p>Beim Thema digitale Identität sind sich die europäischen Mitgliedstaaten insofern einig, dass diese in Zukunft mit einem digitalen Wallet verwaltet werden soll. Dies ist eine Anwendung (App) auf dem Endgerät der Nutzenden, welche die Verwaltung von Kontakten und Nachweisen erleichtert. Zwar ist ein sogenannter Social Login über große Technologieanbieter (auch Single Sign-On genannt) genauso nutzerfreundlich wie der Login mit dem Lissi Wallet, zweiterer basiert jedoch auf einer selbstbestimmten Identitätsverwaltung. Damit gehen folgende Vorteile&nbsp;einher:</p><p>Privatsphäre: Daten zum Nutzerverhalten können durch den Login-Anbieter, in diesem Fall Lissi, nicht ausgelesen werden.</p><p>Datenportabilität: Nutzende sind nicht von einem Anbieter abhängig und können den Wallet durch ein kompatibles Wallet ersetzen.</p><p>Einfachheit: Die Login-Nachweise können zusammen mit anderen Identitätsnachweisen in einem Wallet aufbewahrt werden.</p> Der Login-Prozess: 3 Schritte zum selbstbestimmten Login <p>1) Registrierung: Nutzende registrieren sich per E-Mail auf der Seite des Anbieters (in diesem Fall memoresa).</p><p>2) Ausstellung: Im zweiten Schritt wird ein digitaler Nachweis, welcher für den Login genutzt wird, über die <a href="https://portal.memoresa.de/mem/user/account">Einstellungen</a> in memoresa in das <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> ausgestellt.</p><p>3) Login: Für den Login können Nutzende dann das Lissi-Logo anklicken, um die Authentifizierung mit dem Wallet durchzuführen. Dies funktioniert sowohl auf einem Computer als auch auf dem Smartphone.</p> Zusammenarbeit: Mit memoresa und Lissi zum selbstbestimmten Login <p>Für memoresa stehen Datenschutz und Selbstbestimmtheit der Nutzerinnen und Nutzer an erster Stelle. Die Sicherheit der Daten, die im memoresa-Portal eingetragen und hochgeladen werden, wird durch verschiedenste Maßnahmen gewährleistet, und soll auch beim Login ins Portal gegeben sein. Aus diesem Grund möchte memoresa eine Login-Möglichkeit anbieten, die die Nutzenden nicht abhängig von großen Technologiekonzern wie Apple, Google und Facebook macht. Für das Lissi-Team ging es bei der Zusammenarbeit primär darum, den Prozess und die Software außerhalb der eigenen Domäne zu testen und Nutzerinnen und Nutzern einen digitalen Dienst mit gesellschaftlichem Mehrwert anzubieten.</p> Integration mit Lissi&nbsp;Connect: <p>Die Option, sich ohne Passwort bei Plattformen einzuloggen, wird heutzutage von Nutzenden erwartet. Serviceanbieter suchen nach Integrationen, welche von Nutzenden angenommen werden und einfach zu integrieren sind. Zusätzlich zur Authentifizierung der Nutzer bietet Lissi Connect als Software-as-a-Service-Lösung (SaaS) die Möglichkeit, digitale Nachweise auszustellen und abzufragen.</p> Ausblick: <p>Bei der Integration handelt es sich um einen Test, welcher allen Beteiligten mehr Erfahrung in der Praxis liefert. Wir sind mit der Funktionsweise und der bisherigen Integration sehr zufrieden, wissen aber auch, dass noch weitere Aspekte notwendig sind. Dazu zählt, dass die Registrierung direkt mit dem Wallet möglich ist, und nicht erst ein klassischer Account mit Passwort angelegt werden muss. Auch die Exportfunktion des Lissi Wallet soll künftig verfügbar gemacht&nbsp;werden.</p><p>Das Thema digitale Vorsorge ist ein wichtiger Aspekt unserer zunehmend digitalen Gesellschaft, welches aktuell noch zu wenig Aufmerksamkeit erhält. Wir freuen uns, zusammen einfache Lösungen zu schaffen und dabei die Werte und Prinzipien unserer Gesellschaft zu&nbsp;leben.</p><p>Das Lissi Team<br>Main Incubator GmbH</p><p>memoresa GmbH</p>

<p>If you're a developer building decentralized applications, you have been faced with uncomfortable tradeoffs in choosing how to manage data. The two available options available have held back Web3 apps:</p><p>Option 1 has been to use a smart contract (blockchain-based) backend and a static frontend. The downside of this option is that these apps are not very feature-rich, since putting a bunch of data on a smart contract blockchain is expensive. As a result, these applications are often minimalist and have limited customization and optionality for users. Even putting content on IPFS and managing mutations through a smart contract is prohibitively slow and expensive. This path is for the decentralization idealists.</p><p>Option 2 has been to sacrifice sovereignty and spin up a traditional backend for any data that doesn't strictly need to be in a smart contract. For example, token balances and yields are on-chain while chats and settings are on a centralized server.</p> <p>What if there was a way to give users full sovereign control over their data while getting access to not just the data from your application but many other compatible ones? What if you could promise users that their information would live in a decentralized network where no individual application developer or company could choose to take it down or tamper with, that they own their data in the truest sense? What if you could build your application with rich data features, and without a backend or expensive smart contracts?</p><p>Now you can.</p> A sovereign datastore <p>With <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/did-datastore/">DID Datastore</a> on top of Ceramic, you can create a datastore for each of your users’ blockchain accounts. Or even let them link multiple accounts (like various wallets from different blockchains) to the same datastore. And with that datastore, you can structure, store, and update any kind of information required in your application — without a backend or smart contract. This is enabled by 3 concepts: DIDs, Data Models, and the DID Datastore itself.</p><p>DIDs are <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/authentication/3id-did/method/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>, an emerging technical standard that enables verifiable, decentralized, interoperable digital identities. A DID can refer to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.). By using DIDs to manage datastores, data can traverse platforms and blockchains and be associated with any entity, including NFTs.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels">DataModels</a> describe the data linked to the DID that will be stored in the datastore. The DataModel defines the shape (or schema) of your data, which can then be referenced by every datastore for every user that interacts with that data model. Developers can define the DataModel for their app, then give users full sovereign control over all their data records.</p><p>The DID Datastore itself is the table of datastores that a DID controls, each of which points to the relevant data model. This creates a way to structure and associate data to any Web3 identity, all without a backend or smart contract. Since the data lives on a decentralized network (Ceramic) controlled by each user (DID), data from app A is not locked into app A. App B can also read and modify the same data if granted permission to do so.</p> The Internet’s User Table <p>With each user managing their own DID Datastore, and apps free to discover and create the Data Models they require, something new and powerful emerges: a shared, distributed user table for Web3.</p><p>In this table, each row represents a user (DID) and each column is a DataModel (created by an app). Both can be discovered by any user or application and expanded infinitely.</p><p>Each user has full sovereign control over their row(s) and can bring that data with them to each app they visit. If an app wants to know what data is available and how to use it, they can reference the data model which will contain a name, description, and other metadata. The data in your columns may be public or encrypted depending on the application and use case.</p> What next? <p>Want to start building with DID Datastore?

<p>by Stephan Wolf, CEO, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF)</p>



<p>In May 2020 the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), the not-for-profit body established by the G20 and the Financial Stability Board to oversee the Global LEI System, became a founding contributing member of the Trust over IP Foundation. Its vision? That every legal entity should have one global identity, and this should include a digital identity.</p>



<p>Since 2014, under GLEIF’s stewardship, the Global LEI System has been providing open and reliable data enabling the unambiguous identification of organizations (‘legal entities’) around the world. With almost two million unique identifiers (LEIs) now in use, the system has already delivered much needed transparency to financial markets, for both regulators and participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GLEIF is now broadening its horizons to drive LEI adoption across all sectors and industries, with the goal of establishing the LEI as the de-facto choice for organizational identity globally.</p>



<p>Enabling digitized trust is central to GLEIF’s proposition. Particularly so considering the huge and sustained surge in legal entities engaging in digital transactions. The pace of digital transformation shows no sign of abating, and the business of manually performing background checks on legal entities already inflates costs and causes huge unnecessary delays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GLEIF and ToIP agree that there is an urgent, unmet need&nbsp;for greater security, convenience, and ease-of-use in digital identity for organizations and the persons that represent them in either official or functional roles. To address this need, in late 2020,&nbsp;GLEIF launched a global cross-industry development program designed to create&nbsp;a fully digitized, cryptographically verifiable LEI (vLEI) service. Since then, GLEIF together with stakeholders across a wide range of sectors has been working in full accordance with the standards of the Trust over IP Foundation to develop the vLEI’s technical underpinnings and its Ecosystem Governance Framework, which was published for ToIP Foundation member review.</p>



<p>To date, the Framework is the most comprehensive ever developed based on the ToIP Governance Metamodel and is a great, early-stage example of how the potential of the ToIP Stack can be realized to digitally enhance an already established global system. It shows how a secure, interoperable, and massively scalable decentralized trust layer can enable existing services to get ahead of the critical issues relating to authentication and verification that otherwise threaten a smooth transition to the digital realm and all the benefits that delivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once established, vLEI system will be capable of establishing digital trust between all legal entities, everywhere.&nbsp;It will give government organizations, companies, and other legal entities worldwide the capacity to use non-repudiable identification data pertaining to their legal status, ownership structure and authorized representatives in a growing multitude of digital business activities,&nbsp;such as approving business transactions and contracts, onboarding customers, transacting within import/export and supply chain business networks, and submitting regulatory filings and reports.</p>



<p>The vLEI has a bright future. It has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world because it is the hallmark of authenticity for a legal entity of any kind. The family of digital credentials in the GLEIF vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework can serve as a chain of trust for anyone needing to verify the legal identity of an organization or of a person legally acting on that organization’s behalf. The demand this will create for LEIs — and the impact it will have on adoption of self-sovereign identity — cannot be overestimated. It will be a sea change for digital trust infrastructure that will benefit every country, company, and citizen in the world.</p>

  <p>For businesses the world over, confidence in digital authenticity is in short supply. Can you be sure that your bank’s website is not an elaborate phishing recreation? Did that e-invoice really come from your business partner? How can you tell?</p>
<p>As businesses increasingly cooperate and transact remotely and across borders, the systems they use to establish trust also need to evolve. </p>
<p>GLEIF has been working to address this requirement directly, by extending the Global LEI System to incorporate a ‘verifiable LEI’ (vLEI) a standardized, digitized version of the LEI capable of enabling instant, automated trust between legal entities and their authorized representatives, and the counterparty legal entities and representatives with which they interact. </p>
<p>Keen for more detail on the vLEI? Read our free <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei/gleif-ebook-the-vlei-introducing-digital-i-d-for-legal-entities-everywhere">eBook: ‘The vLEI: Introducing Digital I.D. for Legal Entities Everywhere’</a></p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/the-birth-of-the-vlei-a-new-dawn-in-digital-id-for-legal-entities-everywhere/gleif_vlei-ebook-750x530.jpg"></a>
<p>To trust in the future, the business world needs the LEI</p>
<p>Under GLEIF’s stewardship, the Global LEI System has, for years, been providing open and reliable data enabling the unambiguous identification of legal entities around the world. With over two million LEIs now in use, GLEIF is now taking steps to build on its success by driving voluntary LEI adoption among legal entities across all industries globally, to establish the LEI as the world’s de-facto system of organizational identity.</p>
<p>Helping legal entities to participate efficiently in the world’s digital economy is central to this goal. But it’s a dangerous world out there, and things are moving fast. In 2021 alone, cybercrime cost the global economy an estimated $6 trillion.  New business models and newly automated processes are springing up all the time, fueled by myriad advances in technology, from APIs, to blockchain, to IoT. </p>
<p>Against this backdrop it’s easy to see why digital trust between legal entities is scarce. Yet this is precisely what is needed: when legal entities digitally engage with their customers, partners, and suppliers, they must be able to trust that these organizations are, indeed, who they claim to be. </p>
<p>The creation of digitized trust, therefore, is central to GLEIF’s ongoing work. We believe that each legal entity worldwide should have just one global identity, capable of supporting its participation in the digital economy. Only then can everyone work together in ways that will unlock the true potential of digitalization: enabling innovation and collaboration to thrive unlimited by geography, and money, goods, and services to flow securely around the world faster, more efficiently, and at a lower cost than ever before. </p>
<p>A new digital trust ecosystem for legal entities everywhere</p>
<p>GLEIF has been working to extend the Global LEI System to address this requirement directly. Our work began by engaging with existing systems that enable digital trust by, for example, standardizing the way in which a legal entity’s LEI code could be <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/the-lei-the-missing-ingredient-in-digital-certificate-management">embedded in digital certificates</a>. </p>
<p>In parallel, we also sought out next-gen technologies that could be developed to create a new system. </p>
<p>In early 2020, the idea to create a digitally verifiable version of the LEI - the vLEI - was born. Its concept was simple: to enable a legal entity to leverage its LEI to establish instant, digitized trust with counterparty organizations and their representatives. </p>
<p>Move fast and create things</p>
<p>By December 2020, a series of research initiatives had confirmed demand from the pharmaceutical, healthcare, telecom, financial services and automotive sectors, and prompted GLEIF to <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-advances-digital-trust-and-identity-for-legal-entities-globally">launch an international, cross-industry development program</a>. The program’s objective was to create an ecosystem and credential governance framework, together with a technical supporting infrastructure, for the vLEI. </p>
<p>Three months later, in February 2021, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-unveils-issuance-and-infrastructure-models-for-verifiable-lei">GLEIF unveiled its models for the vLEI’s technical infrastructure and issuance process</a>, outlining how a legal entity’s LEI code would be wrapped in Verifiable Credentials and issued by GLEIF, via a network of qualified vLEI issuers, to legal entities. The infrastructure establishes GLEIF as the digital ‘root of trust’ that safeguards the integrity of the vLEI trust chain. This means all vLEIs are traceable, through a cryptographically protected chain of credentials, back to their source LEI record in the Global LEI Index.</p>
<p>GLEIF also recognized that universal adoption by legal entities required the vLEI system to interoperate seamlessly and securely with all technology models, including blockchains, cloud services and APIs. To accomplish this, GLEIF adopted a ‘network of networks’ approach enabled by the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol. </p>
<p>Using KERI, vLEIs can be created and utilized independently of any specific organization, with the highest levels of security, privacy, and ease of use. KERI also enables GLEIF and the vLEI trust ecosystem to operate under GLEIF’s governance framework, unencumbered by the governance of external systems, including those of blockchains and distributed ledger consortia. </p>
<p>Curious about KERI? Check out our explainer video below. </p>

<p>A busy year ahead: Software, governance, standardization, and field trials</p>
<p>2022 is already alive with vLEI activity. </p>
<p>In February, GLEIF has <a href="https://content5.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-and-trust-over-ip-foundation-publish-ecosystem-governance-framework-for-digitally-verifiable-lei">published the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework</a>, in full accordance with the standards and recommendations of the Trust Over IP Foundation (hosted by the Linux Foundation). The Framework, which has been designed from the ground up to complement GLEIF’s existing LEI governance, defines the vLEI operational model and describes how the new ecosystem’s range of vLEI issuing stakeholders will qualify for and perform their roles in the Global LEI System. It provides essential detail on the governance structures and processes that will shape the development of the vLEI ecosystem together with the services that GLEIF will provide.</p>
<p>Also in in 2022, after a year in development and sandbox testing, the open-source vLEI beta software will enter field trials in a variety of vertical industry applications. The software will deliver functionality supporting the issuance, presentation, and revocation of the vLEI’s Verifiable Credentials, and provides secure key management using the KERI protocol. </p>
<p>Lastly, GLEIF’s standardization work with the ISO/TC 68/SC 8 Committee is also approaching completion, with an international standard (ISO 5009) for defining official organizational roles in financial services reference data currently ‘under publication’.  Once launched, the ISO 5009 standard will permit global uniformity of the listing of official organizational roles in a structured way, so they may be specified by a legal entity and incorporated into its vLEI official organizational role credentials. Similarly, the standard will also enable organizational roles to be referenced uniformly and embedded in other digital assets leveraging the LEI, such as digital certificates, now and in the future.</p>
<p>A bright future</p>
<p>The vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world; it is designed to become the hallmark of authenticity for any legal entity, anywhere. This new family of digital credentials can serve as a chain of trust for anyone needing to verify the legal identity of an organization or of a person legally acting on that organization’s behalf. It changes the game in digital organizational identity and will represent a sea change in digital trust that will benefit every country, company, and, ultimately, citizen in the world.</p>

 <p><a href="https://daohaus.club">DAOhaus</a>’ mission is to unlock the next tier of community coordination by facilitating the transition from traditional organizations to DAOs.</p><p>DAOs are the most powerful way for communities to achieve their shared purpose and live their shared values, and DAOhaus strives to be the best platform for communities to do just that. DAOhaus is home to an ecosystem of hundreds of purpose-driven community DAOs. From giving grants, to building products, bringing together guilds of professionals, and even investing, DAOs using the DAOhaus platform are all focused on one core thing: empowering the humans in their community to achieve their shared purpose and values.</p><p>Do you belong to a community with those goals? <a href="http://daohaus.club/summon">Summon a DAO today on DAOhaus</a>! Or, if you're looking to find a community that resonates with you, explore <a href="http://daohaus.club/explore">the hundreds of DAOs already using DAOhaus</a>. </p> What is DAOhaus? <p>The DAOhaus platform is the easiest way for anyone to start a DAO. DAOs are a framework to help communities coordinate and achieve their shared goals.</p>No clue what a DAO is? Check out this 2 min explainer.<p>At its core, DAOhaus is a human-friendly way for DAO members to engage in the activities that allow them to collectively manage common resources in service of a shared purpose, without relying on trusted executives. With DAOhaus, you can:</p>  Form (“summon”) a new DAO  Issue members "Shares" representing voting power and economic exit rights &nbsp;(aka “<a href="https://daohaus.substack.com/p/rage-quit-exit-rights-and-real-skin">ragequit</a>”)  Set up a shared Treasury that is controlled collectively by all members  Make and vote on proposals with Shares   Extending the functionality of DAO tooling <p>DAOhaus also empowers DAOs beyond these foundational activities. For example, using a feature called Minions, DAOs can interact with any external smart contract, for example to make a deposit into another DeFi protocol, buy an NFT, or disperse tokens to multiple recipients. Minions can also have more narrowly-scoped functionality, such as with our <a href="https://www.superfluid.finance/home">Superfluid</a> Minion that allows a DAO to send and receive token streams (think sending contributors a continuous stream of payment rather than a lump sump after all work has been delivered).</p><p>These Minions are one kind of DAOhaus Boost, which are add-ons that DAOs can optionally install to expand their capabilities. Some Boosts are built by the DAOhaus core contributors, though many are built by community developers. All Boosts are discoverable, installable and configurable through the DAOhaus Boost Marketplace. Some examples of Boosts include Rarible Boost (which helps you buy &amp; sell NFTs on <a href="https://daohaus.club/market">Rarible</a>) and Disperse Boost (which allows you to transfer tokens to other addresses).</p><p>DAOhaus aims to support purpose-driven community DAOs wherever they may be, and as such the platform is available on Ethereum Mainnet, xDai Polygon, Arbitrum, and Celo, with support for more EVM-compatible networks on the way!</p> The need for context around DAO member identity <p>DAOs are human-centric communities. With DAOhaus, DAO members make decisions and take collective action by coordinating explicitly with each other. It is imperative that DAO members are able to identify one another (whether with real names or pseudonymously) and have a shared understanding of who is involved in their community - whether that be leading a working group or submitting, sponsoring or voting on a given proposal. Without easy access to that context, members have difficulty navigating the social landscape of their DAO, which magnifies coordination overhead and stunts the community’s cultural evolution.</p>Account-based DAO member identities create friction in coordination<p>Identity in web3, as is the case in most DAOs today, is typically address based. Users represent themselves as their wallet or account address, but long hex strings are not sufficient. While ENS names are great for Ethereum mainnet, they don’t currently work across all the networks DAOhaus supports. Users need a human-readable identity solution that works across networks and the many tools DAOs commonly use.</p><p>Additionally, today DAOhaus relies on several centralized storage and API endpoints for things like DAO metadata (e.g., names, tags, descriptions, social media links, etc.) and Boost settings. As the team moves towards a more modular and open architecture to allow developers to further extend the platform and more easily build Boosts, they've begun migrating towards more decentralized storage and data solutions.</p><blockquote>"We needed a performant, decentralized storage solution to store user data, and Ceramic was the obvious choice," - Keating, DAOhaus core contributor</blockquote> Embedding identity as a coordination mechanism <p>To help DAOs better understand who is participating in thier communities, DAOhaus is using Ceramic to create rich and robust member profiles. Using Ceramic’s <a>Self.ID</a> to collect and display member names, avatars and emojis, members can now add clarity and a touch of personalization to their DAOhaus identity.</p><p>DAOhaus users can edit their Self.Id identity in the Profile section of any DAO they are involved in.</p>Create once, replicate many Interoperability across web3 <p>Since Self.ID is built on Ceramic's permissionless data network, all user data stored in their profiles are:</p>  User-controlled: users own their own data and decide how and when applications can access it  Composable &amp; portable: application developers can access data from this shared data layer (if users already have a Self.Id created, the data will be displayed automatically within the DAOhaus app, and displayed in every other web3 app that uses Ceramic for profiles)  Decentralized: data is stored in a decentralized manner, so no single application can censor, shut down or delete your data  Multi-chain: with Ceramic, users can connect multiple accounts and wallets to a single DID to create a unified identity   Unified, human-readable identities create more robust communities &amp; reputation systems<p>Member profiles are available today on DAOhaus. Looking ahead, the team is exploring using Ceramic to power decentralized data for DAO organizational profiles, as well as metadata, Boost configuration, rich marketplace metadata, and more.</p><p>Having an identity controlled by a DAO framework enables a DAO to represent itself within web3 protocols and applications. The DAO identity would be represented as a decentralized identifier (DID) created on Ceramic, which could be linked to a multi-signature account (such as a Gnosis Safe) or Moloch DAO, ensuring multiple participants would need to sign off before any changes are made to any data. In this way, DAOs would be able to write and store data directly to the Ceramic network. </p> What's next for DAOhaus? <p>Core contributors of DAOhaus have released a new version of Minion that uses the Gnosis Zodiac protocol to allow a DAO to control a Gnosis Safe, adding new capabilities such as expedited execution of proposals and the ability to pull funds from the DAO Treasury in Minion proposals.</p><p>The DAOhaus community has been busy too, adding, among other things, two new Boosts in the Boost Marketplace: the <a href="https://daohaus.club/docs/users/boosts/rarible-boost">Rarible Boost</a>, which enables DAOs to to buy and sell NFTs, and the <a href="https://daohaus.club/docs/users/boosts/disperse-boost">Disperse Boost</a>, which enables DAOs to distribute tokens to multiple recipients in a single proposal.</p><p>Beyond these product releases, the team has been busy launching other community initiatives and onboarding more DAOs! If you want to see what else the team has accomplished in 2021, check out their <a href="http://daohaus.club/review">Year in Review</a>. </p><p>Looking forward, the team is preparing to support the new <a href="https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/Baal/">MolochV3 (Baal) DAO framework</a>, which will add even more flexibility for DAOs. The new framework would give DAOs more support throughout the entire lifecycle, from additional options for summoning a new DAO, to vote delegation, embedded Minion functionality, and the ability to make Shares transferable. The team is also working on expanding support for additional L2 networks and sidechains, such as Optimism and potentially Fantom.</p><p>If you’re a member of an existing community looking to level up its coordination powers, or interested in starting a new community yourself, you can <a href="http://app.daohaus.club/summon">summon a DAO today</a> with DAOhaus!</p><p>If you’re a developer or builder looking to contribute, hop into the <a href="https://discord.gg/daohaus">DAOhaus Discord</a> &amp; let the community know! The community is actively looking for contributors to help build more Boosts to give DAOs even better tooling to pursue their purpose. </p><p>If you just want to learn more about DAOs, follow the team on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/nowdaoit">@nowdaoit</a>) and <a href="https://daohaus.substack.com/">Substack</a>, or head to <a href="https://daohaus.club">daohaus.club</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Documentation</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

 Count Calories Better, Diet Healthier — Guide Of All What You Need To&nbsp;Know  The Dos and Don’ts of Counting&nbsp;Calories  Do: <p>When it comes to counting calories, there are a few dos that will help you stay on track and achieve your weight loss&nbsp;goals.</p>  Use a <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator/">diet calories calculator</a> app or website to track your intake. This will ensure accuracy and make it easier to stay on&nbsp;track.  Read the nutrition labels of all foods you eat. This will help you know how many calories are in each&nbsp;serving.  Create a calorie budget for yourself, and try to stick to it. This will help you lose weight gradually and&nbsp;safely.  Do make sure to include all foods and beverages in your calorie count. This includes those pesky little extras like condiments and sugar-free beverages.  Do be honest with yourself about how many calories you need to lose weight. If you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, then aim to consume 500–1000 fewer calories than you burn each&nbsp;day.  Do adjust your calorie intake as needed. If you hit a plateau or if you start gaining weight, then adjust your calorie intake accordingly. A good rule of thumb is to reduce your intake by 100–200 calories per day until you start seeing results&nbsp;again.  Do focus on healthy foods that are low in calories but high in nutrients. This will help ensure that you are getting the most out of your diet while still losing weight. Some great options include vegetables, fruits, lean protein, and whole&nbsp;grains.”  <p>Check also: <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/benefits-of-red-beans/">Red bean&nbsp;benefits</a></p> Don’t: <p>If you’re trying to lose weight, counting calories is a great way to do it. But there are a few things you should avoid if you want to see results. Here are four don’ts of counting calories:</p>  Count calories without also considering other factors such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat. All of these nutrients play important roles in your health and should be taken into account when counting calories.  Skip meals or go too long between meals. This can cause you to become ravenous and overeat later&nbsp;on.  Obsess over every little calorie that you consume. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and obsessing over every calorie will only lead to stress and unhealthy eating&nbsp;habits.  Don’t forget about fiber. Fiber is another important nutrient, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough fiber each day to help keep you full and support your weight loss&nbsp;goals  Don’t forget about carbs. Carbs are also an important part of a healthy diet, and they’re especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough carbs each day to help burn fat and fuel your workouts.  Don’t forget about protein. Protein is an important part of a healthy diet, and it’s especially important when dieting. Make sure you’re getting enough protein each day to help burn fat and build&nbsp;muscle.  Don’t overdo it. It’s important not to eat too few calories, as this can actually slow down your metabolism and make it more difficult to lose weight. Try to find the right balance for you, and don’t cut more than 500–750 calories per&nbsp;day.   The Pros and Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting <p>Calorie counting is a popular way to keep track of the number of calories you eat each&nbsp;day.</p><p>This can be an effective way to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. However, there are some pros and cons to calorie counting. The Pros of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p>  You are in control of your food choices. When you are calorie counting, you are able to choose the foods that fit within your daily calorie budget. This can help you make healthier food choices and avoid unhealthy foods.  <p>2. It is an easy way to track progress. By keeping track of the number of calories you consume each day, you can see how your diet changes over time. This can be helpful in monitoring your progress and seeing if your current diet is working for&nbsp;you.</p><p>3. It helps you become more aware of portion sizes. Often when we don’t count calories, we tend to underestimate how much we are actually eating. Calorie counting can help teach you about proper portion sizes and how much food constitutes a serving&nbsp;size.</p><p>4. It may increase your metabolism&nbsp;. Some research has shown that people who calorie count may have a higher metabolic rate than those who do not count calories&nbsp;. This could lead to more successful weight loss in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>The Cons of Calorie&nbsp;Counting</p><p>1&nbsp;. It can be time consuming&nbsp;. Keeping track of every calorie that goes into your mouth can be a tedious process&nbsp;.</p><p>2&nbsp;. You may become obsessed with numbers&nbsp;. Focusing too much on numbers can lead to eating disorders and unhealthy relationships with food&nbsp;.</p><p>3&nbsp;. You might develop restrictive eating habits&nbsp;. Restricting yourself from certain foods can cause negative thoughts about food and body image&nbsp;issues</p> How to make Calorie counting effective   Make sure you’re accurately counting your calories. A lot of people make mistakes when counting, either by underestimating or overestimating the number of calories in their food. Use a calorie tracking app or website to get an accurate estimate of the calories in your&nbsp;meals.  <p>2. Don’t obsess over every little thing. If you eat a cookie or have a slice of pizza, don’t worry — just adjust your calorie intake for the rest of the day to make up for it. Trying to be perfect can be counterproductive and lead to feelings of guilt and frustration.</p><p>3. Find a method that works for you. Some people prefer to track their calories manually, while others find it more helpful to use an app or online calculator. Figure out what works best for you and stick with&nbsp;it.</p><p>4. Be patient. Losing weight takes time, so don’t expect results overnight. Stick with it for several weeks before deciding if calorie counting is right for&nbsp;you.</p><p>5. Make a list of foods that you enjoy and that are healthy. This will help you stay on track with your diet and make it more enjoyable.</p><p>6.

<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation today announced the release of its first two official specifications for ToIP-compliant <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/gswg/glossary#governance-framework">governance frameworks</a> (aka trust frameworks):</p>



  The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Architecture Specification V1.0</a> (PDF).  The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification V1.0</a> (PDF).  



<p>Produced by the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">ToIP Governance Stack Working Group</a> (GSWG), these two specifications together with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification Companion Guide V1.0</a> are tools that CIOs, CISOs, Chief Privacy Officers, trust architects, and other policymakers can begin using immediately to construct a governance framework for any of <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">the four ToIP layers</a> of decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



<p>“In our first 18 months the GSWG has produced 11 deliverables,” said GSWG co-chair <a href="https://www.schellman.com/scott-perry">Scott Perry</a>, Principal of the <a href="https://www.schellman.com/crypto-digital-trust-services">Crypto and Digital Trust Services practice at Schellman</a>, a leading global provider of attestation, compliance, and certification services. “These are the first two official ToIP specifications that define what a governance framework must include to comply with the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">ToIP model</a>.”</p>



<p>These specifications and the Companion Guide have already been used to craft the first governance frameworks for ToIP-based digital trust ecosystems. “When the <a href="https://www.yoma.foundation/">Yoma&nbsp; (Youth Agency Marketplace) project</a> needed decentralized governance, starting with the ToIP governance model saved us months of time,” said Lohan Spies, CTO of Yoma. “It also helped us produce a governance framework in which all the major stakeholders—Yoma, Generation Unlimited, GIZ, youth, service providers, donors, developers—had confidence.”</p>



<p>These three deliverables are also the first from ToIP to incorporate terms from the ToIP Foundation’s cross-industry glossary development project. “The subjects of digital identity and trust are extremely challenging to discuss with great clarity,” said Drummond Reed, who co-chairs both the GSWG and the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700">ToIP Concepts and Terminology Working Group</a> (CTWG). “These deliverables use the CTWG <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Terms+Wikis">terms wiki</a> and glossary development tools to link together terms curated by experts in each relevant domain.”</p>



 About the Governance Half of the ToIP Stack 



<p>The mission of the ToIP Foundation is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layer with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers. This four-layer architecture is referred to as the ToIP stack, summarized in this diagram (and in <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">this interactive model</a>):</p>







<p>This diagram highlights that the ToIP stack is fundamentally composed of two halves:</p>



  The technology stack defines the technical standards and protocols needed to establish interoperable technical trust (aka cryptographic trust) at each of the four layers.  The governance stack defines the requirements for governance frameworks (aka trust frameworks) to specify the policies and rules the members of a community need to follow to achieve institutional trust (aka human trust) at each of the four layers.  



<p>The central premise of the ToIP model is that neither half alone is sufficient to achieve interoperable decentralized digital trust infrastructure. You must have both halves working together.</p>



 About the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Architecture Specification V1.0</a> 



<p>A specific governance framework is designed for a specific layer of the ToIP stack (public utility, agent/wallet, credential, or ecosystem). However, certain interoperability requirements apply to all ToIP-compliant governance frameworks regardless of layer. The purpose of this relatively short (10 page) specification is to specify those overall requirements. It consists of five sections:</p>



  Identification—the requirements for ToIP governance framework documents—and the parties they govern—to be identified by persistent, verifiable, globally unique <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</a>.  Verification—the requirements for ToIP governance framework documents to be digitally signed by their <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary#governing-authority">governing authorities</a>—and for all <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary#governed-party">governed parties</a> to have a means of cryptographically verifying the GF role in which they are serving using either a <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary#verifiable-credential">verifiable credential</a>, a <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary#trust-registry">trust registry</a>, or both.  Transparency—the requirements for any publicly-available ToIP governance framework document to be published on the Web and discoverable via its DID. It also covers localization and accessibility.  Technical Interoperability—the requirements for a ToIP governance framework to specify technical interop using the ToIP Technology Stack.  ToIP Governance Metamodel—the requirement to comply with the ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification (below).  



 About the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification V1.0</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">Companion Guide</a> 



<p>The standard structure of a ToIP-compliant governance framework—the documents it should include, and the content required or recommended in each document—were extensive enough that these were broken into a separate 13-page specification that is divided into two parts:</p>



  Primary Document. This is the “master document” or “home page” of a ToIP governance framework. The specification covers the following 13 sections of this document:  Introduction  Terminology and Notation  Localization  Governing Authority  Administering Authority  Purpose  Scope  Objectives  Principles  General Requirements  Revisions  Extensions  Schedule of Controlled Documents    Controlled Documents. These are subdocuments that form component “modules” of a ToIP-compliant governance framework. This modular architecture is recommended to simplify revisions and delegate policymaking to the most appropriate parties.  Glossary  Risk Assessment  Trust Assurance and Certification  Governance Requirements  Business Requirements  Technical Requirements  Information Trust Requirements (security, privacy, confidentiality, etc.)  Inclusion, Equitability, and Accessibility Requirements  Legal Agreements    



<p>The GSWG also produced the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification Companion Guide V1.0</a> to serve as 28-page “users manual” intended to give governance framework authors the background, context, and guidelines they need in the drafting process. It also suggests the policy areas for which the authors may want to consult subject matter experts (SMEs) within their own community and/or external professionals.</p>



 Future Specifications Coming from the GSWG 



<p>With this milestone accomplished, the next goal of the GSWG is to produce layer-specific templates for ToIP-compliant governance frameworks. These templates will specify the roles and processes, and governance best practices recommended for each of the four layers of the ToIP stack. Look for future announcements coming from the ToIP Foundation about these templates.If you have a particular interest in decentralized digital trust governance, we invite you to join the work of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">ToIP Governance Stack Working Group</a>.

<p>New XACML system component is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the approval and publication of a new Committee Specification by the members of the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC [1]:</p>



<p>XACML v3.0 Dynamic Attribute Authority Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 01<br>25 January 2022</p>



 Overview 



<p>This specification defines a new XACML system component, the Dynamic Attribute Authority, which augments the request context of an XACML authorization request with additional attributes and attribute values that are generated on demand according to a set of rules. The rules are expressed as XACML policies, use obligations to specify the additional attributes and values, and are processed in the normal manner of a Policy Decision Point. This means that a Dynamic Attribute Authority can be readily constructed from existing XACML system components.</p>



<p>A primary use case for the Dynamic Attribute Authority is role enablement, where the dynamic attribute in question is the subject role.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>

<p>Finally, back together again. The 3Box Labs team will be arriving at the Sports Castle in full force this year, elated to see the community reconvening after the 2021 hiatus. We’re thrilled to announce that we’ll be joining this developer-first event as a Sponsor again this year. We exist to empower web3 builders and are excited to support more developers than ever during both the live and virtual hackathons. If you’re heading to Denver, make sure to stop by our booth to chat sovereign data, composable apps, and all things Web3 -- and to grab a limited edition Ceramic beanie!</p><p>If you’re interested in getting involved, it’s not too late to join! <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">Submit your application here.</a></p> What’s Ceramic? <p>For those not yet familiar, Ceramic’s decentralized data protocol and identity system gives developers a complete solution for managing user and application data on the open web. With Ceramic, Developers can build decentralized applications that easily store, update and retrieve data from a shared network. Think IPFS, but mutable. </p><p>Additionally, this data is written and managed by users themselves, as compared to application developers. On Ceramic, data is controlled by decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that allow users to create a unified digital self by linking data and accounts from various wallets, chains and platforms. Developers can leverage Ceramic’s shared infrastructure to easily reuse data across applications. With Ceramic, users can create a single profile that multiple apps can read and present uniquely on their respective front-ends, instead of tirelessly replicating their data for the application’s benefit. </p><p>If you want to dig deeper, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX49K3BL-U8">this short workshop</a> for an overview of Ceramic.</p> Updates from the 3Box Labs team <p>We've been blown away by the amount of progress made across the Ceramic ecosystem over the last 12 months. Ceramic mainnet was launched in a private preview for Early Launch Partners, dozens of projects have onboarded and are running their own nodes on the network, and 3Box Labs has launched our new Glaze tooling which offers improvements on the former IDX protocol, now referred to as <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/did-datastore/#definitions">DID Datastore</a>. We’ve also launched v1 of <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/datamodel/">Datamodels</a>, which is a key step towards the long-term vision of Ceramic. As we start enabling developers to publish, share and eventually curate Datamodels on Ceramic, we move closer towards the vision of an interoperable, highly composable data ecosystem that enables a sovereign web. </p><p>We’ll be announcing a major milestone for the 3Box Labs team at EthDenver, that will allow us to continue executing on our roadmap, including improving network performance and reliability, building out new capability systems for more advanced permissioning, and launching new streamtypes and features for social use cases. We’re thrilled to be working alongside so many amazing web3 developers interested in building a more open and inclusive web, together. </p> How we’re showing up at EthDenver <p>Ceramic’s core protocol and surrounding tooling are more advanced than ever before. The sovereign web is just within reach, and it will require a motivated and coordinated community to build the applications, datamodels and tooling needed to make it a reality. The core primitives of Ceramic itself were developed right here at EthDenver, so we believe in the caliber of ideas and projects that can originate out of the Sports Castle. We can’t wait to experiment together this year, with our three co-founders offering live support to hackers and awarding over $15,000 to the best hacks at the end of the weekend. Full bounty details will be released soon, so stay tuned!</p> Come find us <p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> for the latest team updates, or for real-time updates during the event follow:</p>  Co-Founder &amp; CEO Michael Sena (@somemikesena)  Co-Foundeer &amp; COO Danny Zuckerman (@dazuck)  Co-Founder &amp; CTO Joel Thorstensson (​​@joelthorst)  Head of Business Development Lauren Feld (@web3lauren)  Partner Engineer Rohan Dasika (@rohandasika)  <p>Whether you’re a returning EthDenver hacker, transitioning web2 engineer, NFT artist, or just simply crypto curious - we’d love to chat with you IRL. We’ll be announcing our BUIDL Week workshops, conference panels and side events soon!</p> Resources <p>Looking to get a jump on the competition?

 What Is Really Matters to Make Diet Calories Calculators Work <p>To use a <a href="https://bit.ly/3HgH1uz">calories calculator</a>, you need to know how many calories you need per day and how many calories are in the food you’re&nbsp;eating.</p><p>While it’s important to know how many calories are in the food you’re eating, it’s even more important to make healthy choices when it comes to what you’re eating. A calories calculator can be a helpful tool, but it’s not everything. Here we will cover what really&nbsp;matters.</p> How many calories do I need each&nbsp;day? <p>This is a difficult question to answer without knowing more about your lifestyle and activity&nbsp;level.</p><p>The recommended calorie intake for the average, sedentary person is about 1200–2000 per day. If you are moderately active, you may need closer to 2000–2500 per&nbsp;day.</p><p>And if you are very active, you may need upwards of 2500–3000 or more. To calculate your specific calorie needs, use an online calculator or speak with a registered dietitian. Also we are going to cover the topic in&nbsp;depth.</p><p>In general, your daily caloric intake should include: 45–65% carbohydrates, 20–35% protein, and 10–30%&nbsp;fat.</p> What are macros and why do they&nbsp;matter? <p>Macronutrients are the three main nutrients that our body needs in order to function: carbohydrates, protein, and&nbsp;fat.</p><p>Each of these nutrients play different roles in our health and metabolism, so it’s important to make sure we are getting enough of all of them. Tracking your macros can be a helpful way to make sure you’re hitting your nutrient goals for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>There are many online calculators and apps that can help you track your macros. A good starting point is calculating what percentage of each nutrient you should aim for each day (see question #1). From there, you can adjust as needed depending on your specific goals and preferences.</p> (USDA) guidelines: <p>Calorie and macronutrient guidelines can be helpful in determining how many of each nutrient to eat each day. However, it is important to remember that everyone’s body is different and what works for one person may not work for another. It is also important to listen to your own body and make adjustments as needed. A good place to start when calculating calorie and macronutrient intake is to use the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines. The USDA recommends that adult women consume 2,000 calories per day, adult men consume 2,500 calories per day, and children between the ages of 4 and 8 years consume 1,400–1,600 calories per day. Regarding macronutrients, the USDA recommends that 45–65% of daily caloric intake come from carbohydrates, 20–35% from protein, and 10–35% from&nbsp;fat.</p> Formulas diet calories calculator uses (exposing the back end&nbsp;algos) <p>The Harris Benedict&nbsp;formula:</p><p>The Harris Benedict Formula is a mathematical equation that calculates someone’s basal metabolic rate&nbsp;(BMR).</p><p>This is the number of calories a person needs to consume each day to maintain their current weight. It takes into account a person’s sex, height, weight, and&nbsp;age.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>There are a number of ways to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), but the Harris Benedict Formula is one of the most&nbsp;common.</p><p>To use the Harris Benedict Formula, you’ll need to know your weight in pounds and your height in&nbsp;inches.</p>  multiply your weight by&nbsp;703  divide that number by your height in&nbsp;inches  add 655 4. if you’re a woman, subtract 456 5. if you’re a man, add 68&nbsp;Your  BMR is then the result of this calculation.  <p>Mifflin-St Jeor&nbsp;formula:</p><p>The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is a formula used to calculate the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its current weight. The equation takes into account your sex, age, and&nbsp;weight.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>To calculate BMR, you use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which takes into account your sex, age, weight and&nbsp;height.</p><p>To use the equation, you first need to determine your basal metabolic rate factor (BMRF), which is a number that reflects how many calories your body burns at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>You can find BMRF by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters&nbsp;squared.</p><p>Once you have your BMRF, you can use the following equation to calculate BMR:</p><p>BMR = 10 x BMRF +&nbsp;665</p><p>For example, if you weigh 60 kg and are 1.7 meters tall (68 inches), your BMR would be: 10 x 0.924 + 665 =&nbsp;1,608</p><p>Owen formula:</p><p>The Owen equation is a mathematical formula used to calculate the cardiac output, or the amount of blood pumped by the heart each&nbsp;minute.</p><p>The equation is named for Dr. John H. Owen, who developed it in the early 1900s. The equation takes into account a number of factors, including the heart rate, the stroke volume (the amount of blood ejected from the heart with each beat), and the resistance to blood flow throughout the&nbsp;body.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>Owen equation to calculate your&nbsp;BRM:</p><p>BRM = 370 + (9.8 x weight in kg) + (6.8 x height in cm) — (4.7 x age in&nbsp;years)</p><p>For example, a 30-year-old woman who weighs 70 kg and is 170 cm tall would have a basal metabolic rate of 1,537 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>Katch-McArdle formula:</p><p>You can use the Katch-McArdle formulas to calculate your BMR if you know your lean body&nbsp;mass.</p><p>Equations:</p><p>The Katch-McArdle formulas are: BMR = 370 + (21.6 x lean body mass) or BMR = (9.8 x weight in kilograms) + (4.7 x height in centimeters) — (4.7 x age in&nbsp;years)</p><p>Now what?!</p><p>After you find your BMR use one of these multipliers to find the amount of calories you need to stay at the same&nbsp;weight</p><p>The American Council on Exercise (ACE) has developed the following activity factor multipliers:</p><p>sedentary lifestyle =&nbsp;1.2</p><p>light activity =&nbsp;1.375</p><p>moderate activity =&nbsp;1.55</p><p>heavy activity =&nbsp;1.725</p><p>A sedentary lifestyle means you lead a relatively inactive lifestyle, with light physical activity only a few times a&nbsp;week.</p><p>If you have a light activity level, that means you engage in some exercise or physical activity on most days of the week but it’s not very&nbsp;intense.</p><p>Moderate activity means you are regularly active and heavy activity means you are very active — you probably have a physically demanding job or workout intensely several times a&nbsp;week.</p> The Key To Make It&nbsp;Work: <p>Now a note, all Calorie Counts Are Wrong as scientific american explained <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-reveals-why-calorie-counts-are-all-wrong/">Why</a>. But its not wrong to relay on them in the condition of you now they are just guessing efforts by great scientists.

<p>There are a few problems with online calorie calculators. First, they can be inaccurate. Second, they can be difficult to use. And third, they can be expensive.</p><p>If you don’t get enough calories, your body will start breaking down muscle tissue to use as&nbsp;energy.</p><p>This can lead to a loss of muscle mass, which can make it harder to stay active and healthy. Additionally, if you don’t eat enough calories, you may not have enough energy to do the things you enjoy or to work hard at your&nbsp;job.</p> Where did the humble calorie come&nbsp;from: <p>The calorie is a unit of energy that was first defined by the French scientist Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree&nbsp;Celsius.</p><p>The calorie calculator can help you determine how many calories you should eat each day to reach your weight loss goals. It takes into account your basal metabolic rate (the number of calories your body burns at rest), as well as the number of calories you burn through physical activity. If you use application doing so then be sure that you are getting right information about your calorie&nbsp;needs.</p> How do you figure out how much calorie you need per&nbsp;day <p>To figure out <a href="https://bit.ly/3AKhFmi">how many calories you need per day</a>, you’ll need to first calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its current weight at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>You can use an online BMR calculator to estimate this number. Once you have your BMR, you’ll need to multiply it by an activity&nbsp;factor.</p><p>This number accounts for the amount of activity you do on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>If you’re sedentary, use a multiplier of 1.2; if you’re moderately active, use 1.3–1.4; if you’re very active, use 1.5–1.7; and if you’re extremely active, use 1.8 or&nbsp;higher.</p><p>Now add in any extra calories you burn from exercise or other activities throughout the day. The resulting number is your approximate calorie intake for the&nbsp;day.</p><p>Basal metabolic rate:</p><p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to maintain its basic functions while you are at rest. This includes functions like breathing, circulating blood and keeping your heart&nbsp;beating.</p><p>How to Calculate Your Basal Metabolic Rate:</p><p>To calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR), you’ll need to know your weight, height, and&nbsp;age.</p><p>You can use this online <a href="https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html">BMR calculator</a> to do the math for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Once you have your BMR, you can use that number to help you determine how many calories you need each day to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to eat fewer calories than your BMR; to gain weight, you’ll need to eat&nbsp;more.</p><p>Remember that these are general guidelines, and everyone’s needs vary. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, for example, you’ll likely need more than 2,000 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you’re very active, you may need even more. Talk with a healthcare professional if you’re unsure about how many calories you should be&nbsp;eating.</p> How to Use the Diet Calories Calculator <p>The <a href="https://www.beautyvigour.com/diet-calories-calculator">diet calories calculator</a> is a handy tool for figuring out how many calories you need to eat each day in order to lose weight or maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To use the calculator, simply enter your sex, weight, height, and age into the corresponding fields.</p><p>The calculator will then provide you with your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories you need to maintain your current&nbsp;weight.</p><p>To lose weight, you’ll need to consume fewer than this number of calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>To maintain your current weight, you’ll need to consume the same number of calories as your&nbsp;BMR.</p> General Tips: <p>The number of calories in food is determined by the amount of energy that the food provides.</p><p>When you eat, your body breaks down the food into tiny pieces that it can use for energy. This process is called digestion.</p><p>The number of calories in a particular type of food is determined by how many nutrients it contains and how easily your body can digest it. Some foods are high in calories because they contain a lot of nutrients, such as protein, fat, or carbohydrates.</p><p>Other foods are high in calories because they are not very nutritious and are easy to digest, such as candy or processed snacks. If you eat something and then poop it out, the number of calories in that food would not be counted. However, if you ate something and it was absorbed into your body and used for energy, then the number of calories in that food would be&nbsp;counted.</p><p>If you throw up do you still count the calories?</p><p>Yes, you still count the calories! Throwing up does not get rid of the calories you consumed.</p><p>In fact, it can actually make you gain weight because you might eat more later to try to make up for what you threw&nbsp;up.</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain&nbsp;weight</p><p>How many calories you need to eat to gain weight depends on your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and how much you want to&nbsp;weigh.</p><p>To find out your BMR, use this calculator: <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.">www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/.</a></p><p>Once you know your BMR, multiply it by the amount of activity you do in a day. If you are sedentary, multiply by 1.2. If you are lightly active, multiply by 1.375. If you are moderately active, multiply by 1.55. If you are very active, multiply by 1.725. And if you are extremely active, multiply by 1.9. This will give you the number of calories you need to eat each day to maintain your current weight (not including exercise).</p><p>To gain weight, add 500–1000 calories per day to this number (again not including exercise).</p><p>So if your BMR is 2000 and you are moderately active, you would need to eat 2500–3000 calories per day to gain&nbsp;weight.</p><p>How many calories should i eat for breakfast</p><p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the number of calories you need for breakfast will vary depending on your age, sex, activity level, and&nbsp;weight.</p><p>However, a good rule of thumb is to aim for around 400–600 calories for breakfast. This should provide enough energy to start your day without leaving you feeling too full or sluggish.</p><p>Some healthy breakfast options that are within this calorie range include: oatmeal with honey and banana; eggs with whole grain toast; yogurt with fruit and granola; a smoothie made with protein powder, almond milk, and frozen&nbsp;fruit.</p><p>How many calories do i need to maintain my&nbsp;weight</p><p>Maintaining weight is all about balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories you&nbsp;burn.</p><p>To maintain your weight, you need to eat the same number of calories that your body burns each day. This means that if you eat more than your body burns, you will gain weight; and if you eat less than your body burns, you will lose weight. There is no single magic number for how many calories everyone needs to maintain their&nbsp;weight.</p><p>It depends on factors such as age, sex, activity level, and muscle mass. However, general guidelines suggest that women need around 1,500–2,000 calories per day to maintain their weight, while men need around 2,000–2,500 calories per&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are trying to maintain your current weight, aim to consume the same number of calories each day. To do this, keep track of the foods you eat and make sure that your calorie intake stays within your recommended range. You can use a calorie calculator or app to help monitor your intake, or simply keep a food journal to track what you ate throughout the&nbsp;day.</p><p>If you are looking to gain or lose weight, it’s important to adjust your caloric intake accordingly. For example, if you want to lose 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 fewer calories than your body needs each day. Conversely, if you want to gain 1–2 pounds per week, aim to consume 500–1,000 more calories than your body needs each&nbsp;day.</p> Conclusion <p>One of the most important aspects of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is controlling your calorie intake. It can be tricky, because you want to make sure you’re eating enough to fuel your body, but not so much that you’re packing on the&nbsp;pounds.</p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of ways to do this. One key is to make sure you’re eating nutrient-rich foods. These are foods that provide your body with the vitamins and minerals it needs to function properly. They’ll also help keep you feeling full longer, so you won’t be as tempted to snack between meals. Some good options include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources like chicken or&nbsp;fish.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is portion size. When dining out, for example, order an appetizer instead of an entree, or split a main course with a friend. At home, use smaller plates and measuring spoons to help control your portions. Finally, it’s important to get regular exercise.</p><p>This doesn’t mean hours at the gym every day; even moderate activity like walking or biking can help burn calories and keep your metabolism going strong. Just be sure to stick to a routine that works for you and fits into your schedule.</p>

 Elia Successfully Demonstrates TSO-visible EV Charging in Collaboration With Energy Web and BMW&nbsp;Group <p>Berlin, Germany, and Zug, Switzerland, 27 January 2022 — Elia Group, the Belgian and German Transmission Service Operator (TSO), in collaboration with Energy Web, the non-profit building operating systems for energy grids, and BMW Group, has successfully demonstrated a TSO-visible EV charging session, laying the groundwork for improved EV charging, including renewable energy-only charging and fast supplier switching. In a demonstration at a public, fast-charging charge point from <a href="https://www.lama.zone/">LamA</a> in Berlin, Felix Kohlbrenner, research project manager at BMW Group, charged a BMW EV using this new solution, where the vehicle’s digital identity was securely shared with Elia. He also spoke with Helen Burgess from Elia about the solution and what it means for the future of EV charging. You can watch the full demonstration here:</p><p>The successful demonstration builds on Elia’s ongoing work with Energy Web on the E-Mobility Dashboard, an open platform designed to simplify the identification of EVs and charge points which enables all parties to receive trustworthy, secure data through Energy Web e-roaming hub, the Open Charging Network. This dramatically simplifies the process of data exchange between EV owners and participants of the energy sector, such as TSOs, energy suppliers, and flexible service providers. Typically, when an EV is charged, the local grid operator receives aggregated data on charging without receiving specifics on the individual vehicle. The same identities can be used to facilitate seamless payments with other market players, eliminating inefficiencies and oversharing of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Energy Web’s operating system enables digital identities to be assigned to EVs and stored on the vehicles’ digital wallets. This enables the vehicle to securely share its identity with the TSO without having to share the driver’s identity. The demonstration showcases how more comprehensive and secure visibility can be achieved between participants in the charging process, as increasing the visibility of different assets in the system is fundamental to improving EV charging and enables future solutions including charging using 100% renewable energy.</p><blockquote>“By assigning digital identities to EVs using Energy Web’s blockchain-based operating system, TSOs can finally benefit from visibility at the device level which they have never had before”, said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “EV users benefit too — in the future, drivers will have their vehicle recognized automatically wherever they are charging and whichever operator they charge with, and will be able to receive a guarantee that they charged using energy generated exclusively from renewable sources.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Thanks to BMW Group for being involved with this exciting demonstration, a world-first for TSO-visible electric vehicle charging”, said Kai Schmied from Elia. “We’re looking forward to furthering our work with Energy Web on these cutting-edge charging solutions. Today, EV charging processes are not individually captured which prevents an active management of charging processes. Only with visibility on individual charging processes as well as a secure identification of involved participants, grid operators can enable flexibility use cases or offer new services such as supplier switching at the charging station’’.</blockquote><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. Our Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) enables any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market.

  <p>ESG data and reporting offers companies a useful tool for increasing transparency around issues of resource dependency, operational efficiency, and social and environmental sustainability and consequently many stakeholders globally use ESG data output as the foundation for critical strategic business decisions. Investors, for example, seek to assess the sustainability track record of companies in which they invest; and financial institutions may need to check eligibility for sustainability-linked finance initiatives. ESG data use cases are many and varied. </p>
<p>Standardized entity identification: A critical need in ESG reporting </p>
<p>Yet a key challenge in ESG reporting, data collection and data exchanges today is the lack of standardization for entity identification. This makes it difficult to find, compare and consume ESG data globally – leading to a lack of transparency and inefficiencies. Without machine readable, interoperable, and globally relevant data, ESG reports lose value as a means of evaluating performance indicators and promoting sustainable investment, since without a clear and standardized entity identification system, it is impossible to understand a company’s overall activities. There are innumerable national and regional standards for entity identification across the world and while different identifiers serve national needs, they can create significant conflicts and inefficiencies when reconciling data across geographical borders. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/regulatory-use-of-the-lei/gleif-and-data-foundation-comprehensive-entity-id-for-u-s-federal-government">Research</a> conducted by GLEIF and the Data Foundation, indicates that the U.S. federal government alone uses 50 distinct and incompatible entity identification systems. When this fragmentation is amplified, taking into account the volume of different identifiers globally, it is easy to understand the challenges. Users of ESG data will need to engage in name matching and dealing in differences in standards for translation, transliteration and abbreviation – and all of that that can be costly, time consuming and prone to error. Let’s consider how easy it would be for an investor to obtain a clear view of a corporation’s ownership structure or governance framework in the case, for example, of a multinational company with subsidiaries across the globe, each completing regulatory filings in different formats. I would say, not very easy at all.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the lack of globally mandated standards in entity identification and reporting can create opportunity for greenwashing and other misleading practices such as the misallocation of assets. It can also render reported information useless. So for example, a large multi-national corporate could be requested to provide information on its supplier network. Without an consistent, global identification scheme for the supplier network, authorities abilities to do even the most basic analysis would be limited.</p>
<p>How the LEI can help </p>
<p>The LEI on the other hand avoids the negative impact of a siloed approach by responding to the critical need for a universal system of identifying entities across markets, products and regions. Machine readable and relevant across borders – thanks to its utilization in over 200 jurisdictions - it is a powerful tool for those conducting research on an entity’s global strategies, assets, corporate structure and values. Entities are unable to conceal greenwashing activities via subsidiaries, thanks to the 360-degree view afforded by an LEI.  </p>
<p>As an international standard and a code which connects entities to key reference information including ownership structure – which is easily accessed via the online Global LEI Index – the LEI tackles data reconciliation problems across borders and promotes an interoperable identity standard. It is also a data connector that allows analysis of corporate information across multiple data sources describing a legal entity and other mapped identifiers such as the Business Identification Number Code (BIC) and International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). The LEI as a connector permits stakeholders, such as investors and financial institutions, to access richer data regarding the entity. </p>
<p>All of these qualities position the LEI perfectly to deliver some critical yet missing components of a robust, efficient and effective global ESG discovery and reporting framework – transparency, consistency and compatibility. </p>
<p>And the LEI can further instill trust in ESG reporting if it is embedded within the digital certificate signing a report and / or the digital signatures of its signing officers. This capability has been demonstrated by GLEIF on multiple occasions in recent years and in the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/as-organizations-prepare-to-comply-with-european-single-electronic-format-esef-requirements-gleif-urges-them-to-go-beyond-include-leis-in-financial-report-digital-signatures-as-best-practice">publication of GLEIF’s 2020 annual report</a>. </p>
<p>Growing support for the LEI in non-financial reporting: A significant step forward </p>
<p>In an encouraging development in Q3 2021, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) released its Standards XBRL Taxonomy for companies which have reporting obligations under the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) reporting guidelines. This included the recommendation to use the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in its XBRL Taxonomy – despite the Taxonomy remaining identifier agnostic overall. While not binding, the recommendation to use the LEI in XBRL reporting is a vitally important step toward bringing standardization and compatibility to global ESG reporting. Use of the LEI in XBRL reports will enhance machine readability as well as the comparability and useability of the collected data. It also provides a digital solution for tagging company information at a global level to help build a smooth and efficient ESG taxonomy value chain.  </p>
<p>Other supervisors have also already recognized the LEI's value in non-financial reporting. For example, the Eurosystem highlighted the importance of the LEI for linking financial and non-financial information and other data sources in its response to the European Commission public consultations on the Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive review. Eurosystem also emphasized that the LEI would enable digital-age innovation and thus foster potential growth in new markets and reduce costs and operational risks of the reporting entities. </p>
<p>Considering existing support for the LEI, GLEIF suggests that the LEI can also help to streamline data collection, aggregation and analysis of ESG risks for private unlisted companies, where there is less systematic coverage compared to publicly listed companies. Inclusion of the LEI in the due diligence checklist by ESG ratings and data products providers can help to assess the information and screen inconsistencies during the pre-validation phase and contribute to investors, informing their investment decisions. </p>
<p>In conclusion, GLEIF suggests that current challenges in accessing reliable, comparable and relevant data that inform on sustainable risks, opportunities and impacts can be greatly reduced by ensuring that ESG data collection and submission starts with the mandatory unique and unambiguous identification of legal entities by the LEI. This is the first foundational step for a consistent, comparable, and transparent ESG reporting and data exchange system that is globally interoperable.</p>

 About this research 



<p>During the course of our research, we hosted five community calls with participants from Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, western Europe and the United States, and held 58 interviews with social justice and digital rights advocates from a variety of movements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We saw that despite strong evidence that stronger collaboration between social justice groups and digital rights groups was urgently needed, inequitable funding and power imbalances between different regions and sectors have produced an uneven landscape where <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/">this kind of collaboration has been lacking.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research surfaced a number of grounds for working towards stronger collaboration between the two communities:&nbsp;</p>



  Digital inequities have deepened during the pandemic and the digital divide has only widened. This is especially true in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, where digital literacy and access was already a concern prior to the pandemic.  Activists are facing a digital emergency. Forced to rapidly recalibrate their work and services in online spaces, many organisations are balancing existing work with the new DDR issues created by the pandemic.  Intersectional collaboration is critical, given how Covid-19 has unevenly impacted communities, often replicating existing patterns of oppression. An intersectional approach could more effectively address compounding inequities, as compared to a single-issue approach.&nbsp;  Cross-sector collaboration can yield benefits, such as rooting DDR issues in the realities of social justice communities, strengthening the message of DDR work and making it easier for organisations to achieve their objectives. In particular, we found that making DDR knowledge more accessible to a wider, more diverse group of civil society organisations makes it more actionable for a broader set of groups.

<p>The intersection of identity and authentication is set to be very busy in 2022.</p>



<p>Over the course of two days from Jan. 24 – 25, the <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/">Better Identity Coalition</a>, the FIDO Alliance, and the<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/"> ID Theft Resource Center</a> (ITRC) co-hosted the Identity, Authentication, and the Road Ahead Cybersecurity Policy Forum with representatives from government and industry providing insight into the policies, challenges and opportunities for identity and authentication in 2022 and beyond.</p>



  



<p>Identity has always been important, and during the pandemic the gaps in identity verification capabilities were dramatically exposed in a number of ways. The challenges of identity in the pandemic were detailed in a keynote fireside chat with Susan Gibson, chair of the U.S. Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) Identity Fraud Reduction &amp; Redress Working Group, and Jeremy Grant, coordinator of the Better Identity Coalition. Gibson explained that the PRAC was formed by the U.S. Government with the goal of promoting transparency and facilitating coordinated oversight of the federal government’s pandemic response, which totaled some $5 trillion in aid.</p>



<p>Gibson noted that there have been many instances of pandemic aid fraud, due in no small part to weaknesses in identity verification and coordination. For example, she noted that a single social security number was used to claim unemployment insurance in 29 different states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While identity fraud, with social security numbers and other means is common, Gibson emphasized that trying to stop identity thieves isn’t the only answer to the problem as the volume of personally identifiable information that is already out in the public domain is large.</p>



<p>“Really, we need to focus less on trying to fix the problem by stopping identity theft and focus more on: how do you get to the strong authentication, with a realization that the identity theft has already happened,” Gibson said.</p>



<p>Data breaches continue to happen</p>



<p>Identities are often at the root of data breaches, both as a root cause, as well as a consequence.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>In a morning session, James Lee, Chief Operating Officer of the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC), outlined some of the key data points from his organization’s <a href="https://notified.idtheftcenter.org/s/resource#annualReportSection">2021 End-of-Year Data Breach Report</a>. Among the highlights is the fact that 2021 was the worst year ever for data breaches, with 1,862 incidents impacting 294 million victims.</p>



<p>Lee said that the top data attribute that is stolen in data breaches are names of users, followed by social security numbers. That said he noted that in fraud forums, stolen social security numbers are sold for $2 each. In contrast, logins and passwords associated with email accounts and in particular Gmail accounts are worth $80 each.</p>



  



<p>The first day of the event concluded with a pair of panels on different aspects of identities and authentication. In a panel on things the government is doing to co-ordinate and improve identity, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/jason_lim.23fvgdjh">Jason Lim</a>, Branch Manager for Screening Technology Integration Program (STIP), TSA, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/phil_lam.23fvgifl">Phil Lam</a> Executive Director for Identity, U.S. General Services Administration, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/tim_weiler.23fvgkym">Tim Weiler</a> Economic Policy Advisor &amp; Legislative Counsel, U.S. Rep. Bill Foster, and <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/kate_weschler.23gko5us">Kate Wechsler</a>, Executive Director, Consumer First Coalition, each detailed their views on what different agencies are doing.</p>



  



<p>Identity is also about access, which isn’t the same for all members of society. That was a key theme in the final panel of the day hosted by <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/moderator/eva_velasquez.23gkw81l">Eva Velasquez</a> President and CEO, Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), alongside panelists <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/birdell_lewis.23gkoj76">Birdell Lewis</a>, Senior Vice President, Centralized Shared Services, Synchrony; <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/pastor_ben_roberts.23fvhbsl">Pastor Ben Roberts</a>, Foundry United Methodist Church; and <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/chris_peterson.23fvhdn6">Chris Peterson</a>, Penny Forward and Community Member.</p>



 Day Two: The Future of Strong Authentication 



<p>In an opening keynote on the second day of the event, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/eric_mill.23gkp02z">Eric Mill</a> Senior Advisor, White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delivered a keynote that outlined the direction of strong authentication in the government.</p>



  



<p>Mill noted that in the fall of 2021, the OMB published a draft of its <a href="https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/federal-zero-trust-strategy/">federal zero trust strategy</a>, which defines having a defense against phishing as a key priority. Mills said that phishing is one of the most common ways that adversaries gain a foothold in an enterprise and the government wants to focus on having an order of magnitude better defense against that kind of attack.</p>



<p>“We are trying to create a clear baseline for civilian federal agencies around not using multifactor authentication methods that don’t resist phishing,” Mills said.</p>



<p>Mills noted that PIV, or Personal Identity Verification cards are commonly used in the government and they can be an effective phishing deterrent. He added that there is a need to have a broader approach with FIDO WebAuthn platform authenticators as well.</p>



<p>“We really expect to see PIV, FIDO and web based authenticators in commingled use throughout the federal government and other weaker methods in the context&nbsp; of phishing,&nbsp; discontinued,” Mills said.</p>



<p>The zero trust strategy was officially published the day following the conference and requires the use of phishing-resistant MFA, like FIDO Authentication.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance’s efforts for strong authentication and identity</p>



<p>In a keynote, Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance, outlined the progress and initiatives that his organization has underway to help improve the state of strong authentication.</p>



  



<p>Shikiar emphasized that the imperative that FIDO is seeking to address is not just to be a checkbox item for multi-factor authentication (MFA), but rather to truly be a foundation to secure connected services that are critical to today’s networked society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar predicted that 2022 will be the year that MFA attacks become mainstream. Having a phishing-resistant approach, which is what FIDO provides, is critical. The need for phishing-resistant MFA and strong authentication has been cited by multiple governments as a best practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Passwords are part of our lives because they’re ubiquitous and they’re part of the web’s DNA,” Shikiar said. “Simply put, we need to supplant them, keep them out of that role and take their place.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Barriers to MFA and the need for improved identity proofing</p>



<p>In a panel on how the government and industry are rethinking authentication, panelists provided insight into what holds adoption back and what needs to happen next.</p>



  



<p><a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/pam_dingle.23fvirob">Pam DIngle</a>, Director of Identity Standards at Microsoft, commented that while there is awareness about the need for strong authentication and MFA there are several reasons why it isn’t always implemented. One type of organization that doesn’t deploy is where there are some sort of organization barriers to MFA.</p>



<p>“So customers come to us and say they know they need to do it right, but they have legacy technology or they have other reasons why they can’t adopt,” Dingle said. “For everyone else, I believe it’s on people’s lists.”</p>



<p><a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/christine_owen.23fvj2lj">Christine Owen</a> Director, Advanced Solutions, Cybersecurity at Guidehouse, commented that a challenge she sees with MFA deployment is on service accounts. Owen noted that adding MFA to those types of accounts is not always as easy as it should be. <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/grant_dasher.23fviyti">Grant Dasher</a> from CISA noted in his organization’s view, identity is clearly the foundation of a zero trust architecture. Dasher added that the President’s Executive Order has committed the government on both civilian and national security sides to go in that direction.In fact CISA has referred to FIDO as the gold standard for authentication in its recent <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/mfa">guidance</a>.</p>



  



<p>Helping to ensure that a given identity is in fact authentic is the domain of identity proofing, that also helps with the initial verification of identity documentations and attributes. In an afternoon panel, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/rae_rivera.7jl5jmh">Rae Rivera</a>, Director of Certification Programs at the FIDO Alliance, outlined the ongoing efforts to create certification programs for identity proofing.</p>



<p>Brighton Haslett, Counsel in the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Financial Services, noted that it’s important that any new regulations in the identity proofing space need to be based on real information.</p>



<p>“I think the biggest threat in this space is any kind of legislation or regulation born out of misunderstanding and fear,” Haslett said. “I think when we see a rush to regulate a new technology, it’s usually an attempt to mitigate bad outcomes whether those are real or not.”</p>



<p>Strong Authentication, Identity and the Banking System</p>



<p>The need for strong authentication to help secure identity is of critical importance to the financial sector and its government regulators.</p>



<p>“If you look at so many of the things that bring risk to the financial sector in the United States they are all anchored on identity, ” commented <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/sultan_meghji.23fvjmzk">Sultan Meghji</a>, Chief Innovation Officer, FDIC.</p>



  



<p>Meghji’s views were echoed by <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/kay_turner.23fvjpga">Kay Turner</a>, Senior Counselor to the Director, FinCEN Digital Identity, Inclusion, and Digital Payment Infrastructure. She noted that FinCEN’s role in the financial sector as the primary administrator of the Bank Secrecy Act and the U.S. financial intelligence unit, is to help prevent illicit finance, money laundering and related crimes like countering the financing of terrorism.</p>



<p>“Identity is at the heart of all financial services, and it’s core to trust,” Turner said. “So we recognize that the ability to assess risk is only as good as your ability to figure out with whom you’re engaging.”</p>



<p>Much of Turner’s sentiment were echoed in a keynote by <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/elizabeth_rosenberg.23gkpgye">Elizabeth Rosenberg</a> Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, at U.S. Treasury.</p>



  



<p>Rosenberg said that many of the critical problems plaguing the financial system stem from an inability to readily and reliably know who is dealing with whom.</p>



<p>“As a policy matter, digital ID has the potential to immediately and dramatically improve how we protect our national security and financial security,” Rosenberg said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking beyond just being aware of the importance of strong authentication for identity, Rosenberg said that the U.S. Treasury is approaching 2022 as a year of action for digital ID.</p>



<p>“I don’t want us to be addressing the same problems when next year’s identity forum convenes,” Rosenberg said. “At least I don’t want to see the same problems happening as frequently to the same degree as they are right now and the Treasury is committed to making that happen.”</p>



  



<p>In the closing keynote, <a href="https://idforum.sched.com/speaker/carole_house.23heudke">Carole House</a> Director for Cybersecurity and Secure Digital Innovation, White House National Security Council (NSC), also noted that she sees identity as being critical to national security.</p>



<p>“Many cyber incidents that we’ve seen involve vectors of compromise that could have been thwarted through stronger identity and access management solutions, including implementation of multifactor authentication solutions,” House said.</p>



<p>Recordings of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x6Wzc_VGCU">Day 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-fVpSUUvGs">Day 2</a> are now available.</p>

 The case of the O.G.&nbsp;Badger The O.G. Badger badge issued to members of the KBW Community who were part of the Open Badges scene before 2017. Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> of <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op</a>.<p>In our work with Participate in creating and sustaining <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">Keep Badges Weird community</a> (KBW) we’re using stealth badges. These have a long history in the world of <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> — and in fact were used in the proof-of-concept School of Webcraft course run in 2011. While there are badges that the individual knows about and can work towards, there are also some badges that are ‘unlocked’ by completing criteria that they don’t know&nbsp;about.</p><p>These stealth badges were based on some work being done around stealth assessment at the time which was informed by research in games-based learning.</p><blockquote>Achievements can be awarded where there are clear public criteria for achieving the badge or could be stealth badges that the awardee knows nothing about until they have met the criteria. Between these extremes badges might be public, but could have cryptic hints as to how the badge might be achieved, to encourage curiosity and inquiry. Where criteria are uncertain this can be an active source of community debate, although this enthusiasm is quelled once the secrets are discovered and included in game FAQ guides. Nevertheless there is social capital to be earned in being the first to uncover these secrets.&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.hastac.org/blogs/scott-beattie/2014/06/30/types-digital-learning-badges-drawing-xbox-achievement-experience">Source</a>)</blockquote><p>In a community like KBW, the idea is to reward pro-social behaviours that keep the atmosphere welcoming and friendly. There is no peer review, but rather whoever has the necessary privileges to issue the badge can do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Stealth badges are unexpected and come with an element of surprise for the earner. Hopefully, earning them leads to a positive feeling or a warm fuzzy flow that makes the individual want to keep on contributing.</p> Logistics <p>Making a stealth badge is as easy as creating any other kind of Open Badge using one of the <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Badge_platforms">plethora of platforms available</a>. The difficulty is in making sure it remains ‘stealthy’.</p><p>There are broadly three ways of doing&nbsp;this:</p>  Keep the criteria&nbsp;secret  Don’t tell anyone how to earn&nbsp;it  Provide no links to&nbsp;evidence  <p>If you do all three of these then you end up with a badge such as this one issued by Nate Otto, himself an “O.G. Badger”, to&nbsp;me:</p>Screenshot of a ‘Recognition Punk’ badge with the description: “You don’t have to give in to the forces of formality when it comes to badges. Express recognition without rules from the&nbsp;man.”<p>This means something coming from Nate, someone who I respect and have worked with before. It probably doesn’t mean a whole lot else to other people, but that’s not the&nbsp;point!</p><p>The more you want your badge to make sense to the participant, the less stealthy it will end up being. For example, we’ve issued a bunch of “O.G. Badger” badges in the KBW community. Anyone clicking through from the profile page of someone who has earned it would see&nbsp;this:</p>Screenshot of “The O.G.”&nbsp;badge Equity and&nbsp;fairness <p>As you can see from the above image, there is a description: “This badge is issued to people who have been members of the community since before IMS Global took over stewardship of the Open Badges specification on 1st January 2017.” There is also criteria: “To earn this badge, the recipient must have demonstrated engagement with the Open Badges community on or before 31st December&nbsp;2016.”</p><p>This information means that this particular badge, which is manually issued, can be given out in fair and equitable ways. It also means that someone else who engaged with the Open Badges community before 2017 could lay claim to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Stealth badges at scale require an automated system that issues badges depending on particular criteria. This is why they are very common in games-based environments. For example, I unlock some most weeks playing new and existing games on my PlayStation and Google&nbsp;Stadia.</p> Final thoughts <p>Open Badges are a great way to not only recognise learning and achievement, but participation, engagement, and pro-social behaviours. These three are particularly important in community learning scenarios as they engage our emotions as well as our brain&nbsp;cells.</p><p>There are other stealth badges that we’ve created for the <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">KBW community</a> — and to find them, you’ll have to come and try and find how to unlock&nbsp;them!</p><p>WAO’s members are 11-year veterans of the badges and digital credentialing landscape.

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, January 26, 2022 – To continue to meet the ever-changing needs of the education community and provide member institutions with the tools they need for powerful teaching and learning experiences, Edge has expanded their Digital Learning and Collaboration solution, EdgeLearn.</p>
<p>Driven by a rapid growth in digital learning in 2020, Edge looked for new ways to help institutions accelerate their online learning capabilities that integrated instructional design best practices and addressed the unique needs of their students, faculty, and staff. “At the beginning of the pandemic, many institutions were seeking assistance with faculty and student development in digital learning and needed to move online quickly at a very unexpected time,” explains Josh Gaul, Edge’s Associate Vice President and Chief Digital Learning Officer. “To help ease this transition, we expanded our suite of technology solutions, and now have integrated these professional services into our EdgeLearn solution. Institutions can partner with our seasoned experts to gain guidance on instructional design, course evaluation, learning space design, or creating a plan to achieve their digital transformation goals.”</p>
<p>Edge’s team of highly skilled instructional designers are based throughout the U.S., and bring a unique perspective to the online learning experience. “Often by building programs remotely, you gain important insight into how to create an optimal student experience,” says Gaul. “Additionally, our experts can augment an organization’s existing team in a valuable and cost-effective way, eliminating the need to hire a full-time staff member. With diverse skills and experience, our team can expand the reach of an institution and help bring their digital learning initiatives to life.”</p>
<p>Edge can also provide organizations with a Virtual Chief Digital Learning Officer (vCDLO) who can help unite the educational mission across online and traditional programs. “An Edge vCDLO acts as a bridge between technology infrastructure and academics,” shares Gaul. “By partnering with leadership, a vCDLO helps create a digital learning strategy that supports your institutional mission, drives student success, and creates a roadmap for future growth.

<p>We have come to the conclusion of our first Fairdrop. We would like to thank all the partners, community, contributors and everyone for their participation.</p><p>Here we drill down into the details and the&nbsp;ending:</p><p>The Fairdrop was a portion of the quarter of 100 Million $BRIGHT that made up the initial minted supply (25 million). High level composition of the Initial minted supply consists of allocations for Bright DAO, Past actions, and Initial Incentives.</p><p>The Fairdrop consisted particularly of the Past actions allocation (6.85 million).</p><p>Starting on September 16, 2021, Fairdrop took place in 8 rounds. Claims could be made on either of the two networks — Main-net or Gnosis Chain (formerly xDAI).</p><p>89.4% was successfully claimed. Of the remaining 10.6%, most were allocations to Gitcoin projects(non-individuals) that benefited in trust bonus matching due to BrightID enabled donors. Some of the remaining were those who missed linking their BrightID with the fairdrop DApp in&nbsp;time.</p><p>These missed claims will be swept to BrightDAO common pool and will be spent on funding future tasks and projects proposed and passed by the community.</p><p>Considering the size of successful claims, the fairdrop was a great success. This is just the beginning and we hope to achieve similar or better success in the&nbsp;future.</p> Fairdrop DApp <p>The Fairdrop DApp used in the fairdrop is one of the many strong use cases of BrightID. It had been in development on the side for some time prior to the fairdrop as a generic product for any individual, project, or community to use for their&nbsp;airdrop.</p><p>The term fairdrop simply means that an airdrop is per individual rather than per&nbsp;address.</p><p>We learnt a lot about improving it through the BrightDAO fairdrop experience and it has been very encouraging to see how well it performed as intended in its earliest&nbsp;form.</p><p>Further development of the product will now be in the hands of the BrightDAO community. We heartily welcome any individuals, projects and communities that wish to further develop and utilize&nbsp;it.</p><p>Among the possibilities, it would be wonderful if we could make it the portal for perpetual airdrops, and it would be a game changer especially in terms of fair and wide distribution for onboarding new users to&nbsp;web3.</p><p>The project is open source on&nbsp;Github:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/BrightID/fairdrop">https://github.com/BrightID/fairdrop</a>  <a href="https://github.com/BrightID/fairdrop-backend">https://github.com/BrightID/fairdrop-backend</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/brightdao-fairdrop-1-retrospective-d31576fe2a2c">BrightDAO Fairdrop 1 Retrospective</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Any visit to a website, app download, purchase of a digital service, or use of new software involves legal policies. People typically encounter both a privacy policy and Terms of Use or Terms of Service (TOS/TOU) policy. But do they understand what functions these two types of policies serve?&nbsp;It seems they don't.

<p>Any visit to a website, app download, purchase of a digital service, or use of new software involves legal policies. People typically encounter both a privacy policy and Terms of Use or Terms of Service (TOS/TOU) policy. But do they understand what functions these two types of policies serve?&nbsp;It seems they don’t.</p>
<p>In a recent study, we found that consumers, “Me-s” in our parlance, have wrong ideas about the purpose of the two different types of policies. Alarmingly, the majority of Me-s surveyed do not understand that a TOS/TOU document is a contract—i.e., a legal agreement.</p>
<p>Our research, led by Noreen Whysel, our Director of Validation Research, consisted of ethnographic interviews, focus groups, and an online survey of 566 individuals. We were initially tipped off by the surprisingly strong reactions of a few participants in our early-stage interviews and focus groups who vehemently denied that Terms of Use were contracts. Wanting to explore how pervasive this sentiment was, we surveyed 566 individuals through an online survey.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
 
 Consumers are aware that legal policies exist on connected technologies and that they should read them, but they continue to choose to largely ignore them. 
 55% of survey participants did not understand that a TOS/TOU agreement is a legal contract. This has significant implications because a key requirement for legally binding contracts is mutual assent, which means that both parties have a “meeting of the minds” and must understand they’re entering into a contract. 
 None of the interview participants were aware of tools that explain or rate privacy policies and TOS/TOU documents, and&nbsp;half said that a score would not change their behavior. 
 66% of survey respondents believe that privacy policies protect the business, while 50% say they protect the consumer. It’s questionable that privacy policies protect either the individual or the business, as they are primarily legal notices, disclosures of how data is used by the technology and the companies behind it. Moreover, 39% of respondents erroneously thought that the privacy policy was a contract [between them and the company]. 
 
<p>Read the results in our latest Spotlight Report:&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-5-me2b-alliance-validation-testing-report-consumer-perception-of-legal-policies-in-digital-technology/">“Spotlight Report # 5: Consumer Perception of Legal Policies in Digital Technology.”</a></p>
<p>This research is one of several&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/library/">M2B Alliance validation studies</a>&nbsp;to confirm and quantify the public’s desire for a safer, more respectful digital world.

<p>When it was launched in May 2020, the ToIP Foundation summarized its mission in a single 20-page white paper called “Introduction to Trust Over IP”. This paper was based on an article called <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031548">The Trust Over IP Stack</a> published in the December 2019 special issue of IEEE Communications Standards Magazine called <a href="https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-communications-standards-magazine/cfp/dawn-internet-identity-layer-and">The Dawn of the Internet Identity Layer and the Role of Decentralized Identity</a>.</p>



<p>Two years later, with ten times more members and double the original number of working groups, the Foundation is a much more mature organization. Despite this growth, we are very pleased that the original vision of <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">the ToIP stack</a> has stood the test of time.</p>



<p>In summer of 2021, we put out a call to all ToIP members to participate in a series of “community writing workshops” to collaboratively produce two new Foundation-wide deliverables:</p>



  <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">Introduction to ToIP V2.0</a> (PDF)<br>This is the second-generation version of our original introductory white paper that would go more deeply into the origin and purpose of the ToIP stack and how it addresses the key challenges of decentralized digital trust infrastructure.  <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack V1.0</a> (PDF)<br>This is an articulation of the key <a href="https://principles.design/">design principles</a> we must follow in the design and development of all aspects of the ToIP stack.  



<p>We were thrilled that over two dozen members took us up on this challenge to participate over four months to produce these two documents, both of which have just been approved by the ToIP Steering Committee.</p>



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">Introduction to ToIP V2.0</a> 



<p>Our primary goal with this second-generation white paper was to make the vision and mission of ToIP accessible to a general audience—literally anyone who cares about the future of the Internet and how we can deal with the myriad security, privacy, data protection, and data sovereignty issues that have emerged as “the world’s greatest information utility” passes its first half-century of growth.</p>



<p>Our second goal was a “plain English” explanation of the overall structure of the four-layer, two-half sided ToIP stack using new graphics based on <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">the wonderful interactive version</a> developed by Peter Stoyko of <a href="http://www.elanica.com/">Elanica</a>. Here is the new static version of the diagram:</p>







<p>Our third goal was to provide a more complete introduction to the ToIP Foundation as a collaborative organization devoted to the design, development, adoption, and promotion of the ToIP stack—a guide to helping prospective members understand how and why to engage.</p>



<p>The resulting document is divided into the following sections:</p>



  ToIP in a Nutshell  Why Has Digital Trust Become Such a Major Problem?  The ToIP Model for Digital Trust  Applying This Model to the Digital World  The ToIP Stack  The ToIP Foundation  How to Engage with the ToIP Foundation  The Road Ahead  



<p>It is available as a PDF document <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">here</a> and on <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">the homepage of the ToIP Foundation website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack V1.0</a> 



<p>To establish a truly interoperable decentralized digital trust layer for the Internet as a whole, meticulous attention must be paid to the design of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/">ToIP stack</a>. Given the tremendous growth of the ToIP Foundation—from 27 original founding member organizations to over ten times as many&nbsp;today—it was critical to form a strong consensus among the new members about the principles governing this design.</p>



<p>Another key reason to establish design principles for the development of a system is summarized in this quote from the start of the document:</p>



<p>The goal of any design principle is to provide guidance to the designers of a product, service, or system so they can take advantage of lessons learned from the success or failure of previous designs. Design principles represent accumulated wisdom that falls in between the generality of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law"> scientific laws</a> and the specialization of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"> best practices</a>.</p>



<p>When it comes to a layered architecture for both technology and governance of decentralized digital trust infrastructure, the “lessons learned from the success or failure of previous designs” is prodigious. Thus the writing workshops for this document continued for four months in order to bring all the relevant design principles together.</p>



<p>To organize the final set of 17 principles into a logical progression, we followed a rubric suggested by co-editor Victor Syntez based on a <a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html">2006 blog post by cryptography pioneer Nick Szabo</a>. Szabo distinguished between two types of “code”:</p>



  Code written in a computer language expected to be executed by a machine (“dry code”), and  Code written in a human language, i.e., laws, regulations, rules, policies and other forms of governance expected to be followed by humans (“wet code”).  



<p>Accordingly, we divided the principles into three categories:</p>



  Principles of computer network architecture—these “dry code” principles represent fundamental lessons learned about the design of large-scale computer networked systems, especially the Internet:  



<p>#1: The End-to-End Principle</p>



<p>#2: Connectivity Is Its Own Reward</p>



<p>#3: The Hourglass Model</p>



<p>#4: Decentralization by Design and Default</p>



<p>#5: Cryptographic Verifiability</p>



<p>#6: Confidentiality by Design and Default</p>



<p>#7: Keys at the Edge</p>



  Principles of human network architecture—these “wet code” principles represent fundamental truths about how trust relationships operate between humans—either individually or in groups:  



<p>#8: Trust is Human</p>



<p>#9: Trust is Relational</p>



<p>#10: Trust is Directional</p>



<p>#11: Trust is Contextual</p>



<p>#12: Trust has Limits</p>



<p>#13: Trust can be Transitive</p>



<p>#14: Trust and Technology have a Reciprocal Relationship</p>



  Overall design principles—these three remaining principles apply to the overall design of the ToIP stack, “wet or dry”:  



<p>#15: Design for Ethical Values</p>



<p>#16: Design for Simplicity</p>



<p>#17: Design for Constant Change</p>



<p>Care was taken to not only explain each principle in plain English, but to analyze how it applies to the design of the ToIP stack at each layer. We summarized those recommendations using this table format:</p>



LayerRelevanceExplanation&nbsp;The ecosystem symbol represents the purpose of Layer 4 to support the applications needed to develop and sustain entire digital trust ecosystems.&nbsp;The triangle symbol represents the Layer 3 verifiable credential “trust triangle” of issuer, holder, and verifier that enables parties using the ToIP stack to establish transitive trust.&nbsp;The symbol of two connected mobile phones represents the purpose of Layer 2 as a universal peer-to-peer secure privacy-routing DID-to-DID communications protocol.&nbsp;The anchor symbol represents the purpose of Layer 1 public key utilities to provide strong anchors for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and their associated public keys.



<p>For each principle, in the “Relevance” column we assigned star ratings for each layer as follows:</p>



★★★★★Highly relevant to the design of this layer★★★★Very relevant to the design of this layer★★★Moderately relevant to the design of this layer★★Somewhat relevant to the design of this layer★Only slightly relevant to the design of this layer



<p>Once all 17 principles had been compiled into a document with this format, the contributors felt that we had identified the “center of gravity” of the design of the ToIP stack that could now guide our work in completing it.</p>



<p>We strongly recommend this document for anyone who wants to deeply understand the rationale for our work at the ToIP Foundation. It is available as a PDF document <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">here</a> and on <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">the homepage of the ToIP Foundation website</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Titelbild Lissi&nbsp;Connect<p>Lissi Connect erleichtert die Nutzerauthentifizierung und den Austausch von digitalen Nachweisen</p><p>Es ist an der Zeit das Passwort in Rente zu schicken<br>Die Option, sich ohne Passwort bei Plattformen einzuloggen, wird heutzutage von Nutzenden erwartet. Serviceanbieter suchen nach Integrationen, welche von Nutzenden angenommen werden und einfach zu integrieren sind. Dabei haben sich vor allem große Technologiekonzerne als Anbieter von Single-sign on Lösungen etabliert. Diese Login Optionen sind zwar einfach für Nutzer, bringen diese jedoch in große Abhängigkeit von zentralen Dienstleistern, welche häufig das Nutzerverhalten analysieren und an Werbetreibende verkaufen.</p><p>Der Login ist nur der Start der gemeinsamen Kundenbeziehung</p><p>Nutzende möchten nicht dutzende von Kommunikationsschnittstellen überwachen und pflegen, sondern bevorzugen eine Lösung, welche diese Aspekte zusammenführt. Dies beinhaltet nicht nur Login Dienste, sondern auch Newsletter, Informationsschreiben von der Bank, digitale Nachweise jeglicher Art und sonstige relevante persönliche Informationen. Der Medienbruch und die Zersplitterung der aktuellen Systeme stellt Nutzende sowie Organisationen vor eine große Herausforderung. Einmal in dem Wallet der Nutzenden abgelegt, können diese Informationen jedoch einfach verwaltet, sortiert und nach Bedarf präsentiert werden. Dies verbessert die Datenhaltung für Nutzende und bietet komplett neue Möglichkeiten der Kommunikation zwischen Organisationen und Endanwender.</p><p>Die direkte Verbindung — mit Lissi&nbsp;Connect</p><p>Lissi Connect ermöglicht die Authentifizierung von Nutzenden ohne Passwort. Zusätzlich zur Authentifizierung der Nutzer bietet Lissi Connect die Möglichkeit, digitale Nachweise auszustellen und abzufragen. Es handelt sich dabei um eine Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Lösung, welche einfach in bestehende Systeme integriert werden kann. Die Kontrolle über die Kundenschnittstelle liegt dabei stets bei den zwei Parteien, welche den Kommunikationskanal initial erstellt&nbsp;haben.</p> Unsere Lissi Connect&nbsp;Demo Startbildschirm der Lissi Connect&nbsp;Demo.<p>Um ein Gefühl für das Nutzererlebnis zu erhalten haben wir euch eine <a href="https://demo.lissi.id/">Login Demo </a>bereitgestellt in der ihr die passwortlose Registrierung und Anmeldung testen könnt.

  <p>The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) is proud of its ongoing transparency initiatives. Namely its open approach to providing unrestricted access to the latest LEI data from around the world with the Quarterly LEI System Business Reports, which are made publicly available free of charge. Through this ‘LEI in Numbers’ blog series, GLEIF aims to highlight key data from the latest report, explaining trends and profiling successes from the global LEI rollout. </p>
<p>2021 demonstrated continued positive momentum for LEI issuance, concluding with a total LEI population of 1.95 million. With over 261,000 LEIs issued throughout the year, representing an annual growth rate of 15.3%, the LEI system is growing at an impressive rate. </p>
<p>The latest report, covering Q4 2021, shows that more than 80,000 new LEIs were issued globally during this time period – a strong increase from the 60,000 issued in Q3. This represents a quarterly growth rate of 4.3%, up from 3.3% noted in the previous quarter. </p>
<p>For a summary of the past quarter’s data, the below infographic contains the key statistics from Q4 2021, in addition to data summarizing the progress made in 2021 overall. </p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/the-lei-in-numbers-reviewing-2021-and-the-q4-adoption-boom/gleif_q4-infographic-750x2187.jpg"></a>
<p>So called ‘competitive markets’ refer to those with over 1,000 LEIs, based on the number of LEI issuers providing services in the jurisdiction. The most competitive markets are those with the most LEI issuers per jurisdiction, with similar market share, and vice versa for the least competitive markets.</p>
<p>In Q4, China overtook Iceland as the jurisdiction with the highest LEI growth rate of the quarter, with an impressive 36.5% increase – the largest seen this year. It was followed by Estonia (22.9%), Iceland (19.3%), India (14.6%) and Turkey (10.1%). The rise of LEIs in China and India can be directly linked to the increase of regulatory requirements, whereas the growth seen in Estonia and Iceland has been driven by strong competition among LEI issuers.</p>
<p>In this same quarter, the overall renewal rate settled at 62.5%. While slightly lower than the previous quarter (64.6%), this decrease can be attributed to a lower number of renewals in December – a trend typical for this time of year. </p>
<p>Japan demonstrated the highest renewal rate (91.8%) in the quarter and has consistently ranked in the top two jurisdictions for renewals throughout 2021. Other jurisdictions in the Q4 top five are China (89.3%), Finland (87.6%), Liechtenstein (83.1%) and Germany (82.6%). </p>
<p>Proactive LEI renewal on an annual basis ensures that the Global LEI Index continues to provide the most accurate and up-to-date data as possible. The high figures for LEI issuance and renewals seen across a range of regions once again this quarter provides further evidence of the maturity and value of the Global LEI System. This brings tremendous benefits to both the ecosystem and all users of LEI data who rely on its accuracy to make informed business decisions with confidence.</p>
<p>For the full report which includes further detail on the status of LEI issuance and growth potential, the level of competition between LEI issuing organizations in the Global LEI System and Level 1 and 2 reference data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Reports page. </p>
<p>If you are interested in reviewing the latest daily LEI data, our Global LEI System Statistics Dashboard contains daily statistics on the total and active number of LEIs issued. This feature now enables any user to review historical data by geography, increasing transparency on the overall progress of the LEI.</p>

<p>Martin Chapman, Frederick Hirsch, and Duncan Sparrell Named OASIS Distinguished Contributors</p> 


<p>19 January 2022 — OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the winners of the 2021 Open Cup, which recognizes exceptional advancements within the OASIS technical community. The Cup for Outstanding New Initiative was awarded to <a href="https://originbx-oasis.org/">OriginBX</a>, an international alliance of organizations that are defining global standards for digital trade. The Open Cup for Outstanding Approved Standard was awarded to <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti">STIX v2.1 &amp; TAXII v2.1</a>, two widely used cybersecurity standards that enable the automated exchange of cyber threat intelligence. In addition, the consortium named Martin Chapman, Frederick Hirsch, and Duncan Sparrell as <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/member-roster/distinguished-contributors/">OASIS Distinguished Contributors</a>.</p>



<p>Open Cup Recipients</p>



<p>The 2021 Outstanding New Initiative, the OriginBX OASIS Open Project, is a global alliance to advance open source product and trade data standards for facilitating digital tax and trade attestations. By reducing complexity and the cost of complying with preferential and non-preferential country of origin determinations, OriginBX OASIS seeks to increase the utilization of free trade agreements to achieve desired public policy outcomes.</p>



<p>“Launched in June, OriginBX has attracted organizations representing diverse stakeholders in the technology, ecommerce, and customs brokerage sectors. The OriginBX community’s vision is to help build common standards to allow for greater automation in identifying countries of origin for manufactured goods and their components,” said OASIS Executive Director Guy Martin. “We’re proud to support this innovative new project as it aims to streamline global trade.”</p>



<p>OriginBX was chosen as the winner in the New Initiative category that includes finalist <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=esat">Electronic Secure Authentication (ESAT) Technical Committee</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Named the Outstanding Approved Standard was STIX v2.1 &amp; TAXII v2.1. STIX defines a JSON-based language for sharing structured threat intelligence in a consistent, machine-readable manner, allowing organizations to better protect against, detect, and respond to cyber threats. STIX v2.1 adds new objects and capabilities, enabling it to better describe the cyber threats we confront today, as well as future-proofing STIX via STIX Extensions. As a result, STIX v2.1 creates a solid and stable foundation for vendors and consumers alike to exchange actionable CTI.</p>



<p>TAXII defines a transport protocol which supports the exchange of STIX data over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). TAXII enables machine-to-machine sharing of CTI by defining an API that supports common sharing models used by industry and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs).</p>



<p>“The revamped version 2.1 of STIX and TAXII are fast becoming the foundation for automating information sharing to provide cybersecurity professionals with situational awareness, sophisticated threat analysis, and real-time network defense,” said Chet Ensign, OASIS Chief Technical Community Steward.</p>



<p>STIX v2.1 &amp; TAXII v2.1 were chosen from a group of finalists that included:</p>



  <a href="https://open-services.net/">OSLC</a> (Core v3.0, Change Mgmt v3.0, Requirements Mgmt v2.1, &amp; Query v3.0)  <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legalruleml">LegalRuleML</a> Core Specification v1.0  <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=bdxr">BDXR</a> (Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) v2.0 &amp; Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) v1.0

The two-fold rights this gives them includes primarily an economic right to derive financial reward for reproduction of their work, along with an ancillary moral right to prevent distorted reproductions of their work. Of late, however, there has been a shift in the use of copyright laws by copyright holders. Instead of fulfilment of economic objectives with the interest to protect original work, copyright holders weaponize copyright law as a tool to fulfil of non-economic objectives to vindicate non-copyright interests. This is often done to censor legitimate content, capitalizing on the fact that the copyright holders intellectual property was a part of the content itself, even though it may be insignificant to the final essence of the subject matter, or it may even qualify for fair use due to the purpose for which it was used. This article will discuss the motivation for individuals and business entities to shoehorn non-copyright claims within copyright law as opposed to any other speech regulation laws, share some examples of such copyright abuse for reputation management, and conclude by highlighting takedown transparency as a potentially useful next step in finding a way to rectify such complexities.</p><p>As early as in 2003, in the case of <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/342/191/515519/">Video Pipeline v Buena Vista Home Entertainment</a>, the United States Court of Appeals had acknowledged and predicted that the <a href="https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2011/11/18/patent-misuse-exploring-the-basics/id=20460/">patent misuse doctrine</a> (whereby patent holders abuse the exclusive right granted to them for purposes other than those provided lawfully through patent ownership) can also be extended to copyright and that this may subvert copyright’s goal to encourage creation and dissemination to the public of creative activity. ‘Reputation management’ of individuals and business entities by silencing criticism and other forms of legitimate speech has grown to become a significant motivation for misuse of copyright. This may be done to erase facts, skew the public narrative, and make information disappear that may be, as the Court of Appeal noted in the Video Pipeline case mentioned above, “critical of the copyright holder, their copyrighted good, or the industry in which they operate.”</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/primers/libellaw/">defamation laws</a> in place in most countries that serve to protect unwarranted reputation damage of individuals or corporations, where the damage is based on the publication of false claims as facts. Despite this, abuse of copyright law for reputation management is more prominent than the abuse of other speech regulation laws such as those regulating the press, privacy or defamation. This may primarily be for three reasons: first, that copyright law bypasses the defense of first amendment, because this defense is already accounted for within copyright law. As the US Supreme Court had noted in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-545.pdf">Golan v Holder</a> in 2012, this is because copyright protects expression of facts and ideas but not the facts and ideas themselves. In this manner, protection of first amendment was already accounted for in drafting copyright law. Meanwhile for other speech regulation laws, such as defamation or privacy laws, first amendment is a defense and a balance of interests between both rights is carried out before a determination of legality is made. The lack of this in determination of copyright infringement makes copyright law an easier mode of enabling unlawful restriction of&nbsp;speech.</p><p>For example, Ares Rights, a reputation management company based out of Spain, has a history of sending false copyright claims to Google on behalf of Ecuadorian politicians, state owned televisions and even an ex-president. Between 2014 and 2016, various stories reported how anything remotely critical of the Ecuadorian government was faced with a copyright claim. For instance, a documentary critical of ex-president Rafael Correa was also met with a copyright notice sent by Ares Rights to Google on behalf of SECOM &amp; ECTV, Ecuador’s state owner television network, which can be viewed in the lumen database <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/10363404?access_token=Iheuc9TWyrBuUYZsUwZqFw">here</a>. The Lumen Database also revealed an interesting <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/1923877?access_token=wLR07e4jLEcbm0Ztq-cJQA">counter-notice</a> filed by an Ecuadorian citizen from 2014 disputing the then-ruling political party’s allegation of copyright infringement for a critical tweet along with an image of an open letter that the party itself had made public. The original takedown notice sent by Ares Rights on behalf of the political party, available in the lumen database <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/1902150?access_token=742QPGYvkXjZyzxa7rC3Cw">here</a>, claimed that the reproduction infringed their copyright since it held the political party’s logo. This form of political commentary would almost certainly not withstand a defamation or other forms of speech regulation complaints by political and public figures, and thus reputation management companies tend to fall back on exploitation of copyright law to facilitate such takedowns, that cause chilling&nbsp;effect.</p><p>The second reason that copyright law is used as a tool for censorship more than any other speech regulation laws is that, copyright law does not have an actual malice standard, unlike most other speech regulation laws, <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1247&amp;context=hlr">including defamation</a>. This makes it easier to use copyrighted work that is irrelevant or ancillary to the final output as a basis for a content removal request. In US defamation law, for example, the plaintiff must prove actual malice, i.e., that the defendant published false statement knowing that it was false or with reckless disregard to the truth, a standard first laid out in the Supreme Court’s landmark 1964 case of <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/supreme-court-landmarks/new-york-times-v-sullivan-podcast">New York Times v Sullivan</a>. The burden of proof for actual malice is on the plaintiff, hence making the defamation claim harder to bear to fruition. In the case of copyright law however, there is no such standard. In fact, the burden of proof for fair use is on the defense, and therefore perfectly legitimate content that uses copyrightable content for purposes that would likely qualify for fair use may be taken down upon the receipt of a copyright claim, without prior-consideration of whether the subject matter would qualify for the&nbsp;same.</p><p>For example, in early 2020, Dr. Drew, a celebrity doctor made various claims publicly about the apparent lack of severity of COVID-2019 such as it being a ‘press induced panic’ or that one was ‘more likely to die by hit by an asteroid than by COVID-19’. As seriousness of the virus grew, a YouTube channel by the name of Dr Droops made a video ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsVRA485Go0">Compilation</a> of all the inaccurate contradictory things that Dr. Drew said about coronavirus’. Shortly after this, Dr Drew sent a copyright claim to YouTube, and the video was taken down. Along with this, Dr Drew commented on some of the tweets linking to the video that, ‘infringing copyright laws is a crime, hang on to your retweets or erase to be safe’. The aftermath of the legal action and takedown saw the Streisand effect in play, with the takedown leading to increased attention to Dr. Drew’s past comments. This led to YouTube reinstating the video and Dr. Drew’s&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/dr-drew-coronavirus-supercut-restored-to-youtube-after-copyright-takedown/">apology</a>.</p><p>It is likely that a video compilation of his comments made in public would qualify for fair use, but it was easier for him to weaponize copyright as a tool for removing the video, that was harming his public image and reputation, than to institute a legal defamation complaint, which would be much harder to establish. Even though the video in question was reinstated after publicity of the takedown, as per <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/access-all-balanced-ecosystem-and-powerful-tools/">YouTube’s copyright transparency report</a> published in December 2021, only 1% of all copyright-based removal requests (on ContentID) were disputed, and 60% of the disputed content was reinstated, and so it is likely that some legitimate content which did not violate copyright or likely qualifies for fair use, remains taken down. YouTube does not share content removal requests with third party research databases such as Lumen yet, and so unlike in the other takedown mentioned in this post sent to Google and Twitter, which could be verified through the takedown notices present the Lumen database, the same exercise could unfortunately not be carried out for&nbsp;YouTube.</p><p>Finally, the creation of safe harbor under section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which certainly holds significant benefits for copyright holders and free speech online, also makes abuse of copyright claims easier. The safe harbor provision in the DMCA grants immunity to online platforms for third party content so long as the platform removes any copyright infringing content expeditiously upon receiving notice of its illegality. This standard, known as ‘notice and takedown’ is used by most online platforms, to remain immune from liability for third party content. Abusers of copyright law take advantage of these provisions by sending unfounded DMCA takedown requests to platforms, that platforms (especially the ones that receive more notices than it is possible to manually review and verify) comply with so that they may retain their safe harbor immunity. Moreover, as Eric Goldman and Jessica Sibley mentioned in their paper on <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3229&amp;context=lawreview">Copyright’s Memory Hole</a>, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides carte blanche immunity to online service providers for third party content, also creates an exception for intellectual property claims, including copyright infringement claims. This makes copyright law a softer target for vindicating non-copyright claims.</p><p>For example, in 2016, Annabelle Narey, the head of a programme at an international children’s charity, posted a negative review of a building firm’s construction work on Mumsnet, a popular website for parents in the United Kingdom. Shortly after, an individual by the name of ‘Douglas Bush’ sent a DMCA notice to Google for delisting this review on Mumsnet since it was allegedly ‘copied’ from Bush’s original review on a different website. The DMCA by Bush is available in the lumen database here. However, Narey countered this claim and stated that hers was the original review. Since Bush’s review is no longer available online, it is probable that the review was backdated and the following DMCA notice was likely a tactic to remove legitimate content from Google since it was a negative review. Her counternotice is also available in the lumen database <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/12159803?access_token=5fT1i7lk50kes83DkW9OlQ">here</a>. While Narey countered the infringement claim, very few DMCA takedown notices are met with counterclaims, even though seminal work by scholars Jennifer Urban, Joe Karaganis and Brianna Schofield in their paper on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2755628">Notice and Takedown in Everyday Practice</a> notes that at least 4% of DMCA notices, in their study of a sample size of DMCA takedown notices sent to Google Images, were completely unfounded and 28.4% raised some questions of validity. Thus, the relative simplicity with which DCMA can be abused for takedown of legitimate content, including bad reviews, is a major factor why it is weaponized as a tool for censorship.</p><p>From the examples stated above, it seems to be clear that the intended effect of abusive copyright takedown is unlawful censorship and this leads to over-blocking of content, which in turn results in a considerable chilling effect in the society. Goldman and Silbey argue in their paper on Copyright Memory holes mentioned above, that censorship through copyright or copyright abuse causes memory holes in the collective memory of people, like the one in George Orwell’s 1984, by “relegating the facts and ideas those works contain to persisting only in people’s memories” and making them “fade out of circulation” at first, and then eventually “fading away altogether”. Jeanne Fromer, in her paper titled, ‘<a href="https://houstonlawreview.org/article/3946-should-the-law-care-why-intellectual-property-rights-have-been-asserted">Should the Law Care Why Intellectual Property Rights Have Been Asserted</a>’ notes that the use of copyright to protect non-economic and non-market interests can “distort the intellectual property system and cause harm to the society”.</p><p>While copyright is being used as a tool to manage business and personal reputation on one hand, and this may frustrate the original intent of copyright law, on the other hand it has also <a href="https://jipel.law.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NYU_JIPEL_Vol-3-No-2_6_Levendowski_RevengePorn.pdf">been used</a> by victims of non-consensual sharing of intimate images because of the promptness of takedown, and this is intuitively a more satisfactory outcome of copyright abuse. Even so, at the root of this phenomenon is an important question about whether the copyright framework being shoehorned to protect the reputation and dignity of the copyright owner in unlawful ways is causing chilling effect and if there is a way in which this abuse can be minimized, if not resolved.</p><p>An important and useful next step to minimize copyright abuse and to build data-informed policy on this issue may be to encourage online takedown transparency and increased disclosure mandates of takedown notices. While several major tech companies such as Google, Twitter, Wikipedia do share copies of the copyright-based removal requests that they receive with third party research platforms like the Lumen Project, YouTube, Facebook and TikTok are examples of some online platforms that do not yet share takedown notices. Availability of copyright removal requests for research, scholarship and journalism by services such as the Lumen Project has <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/Perfect10_v_Google/2010-12-21p10vgoogle_amicus.pdf">enabled critical research</a> on notice and takedown in the past, and has shed light on the unlawful motivations for the abuse of DMCA. More useful data on takedown will certainly make way for better analysis, and is likely to be useful in creating better policies to regulate copyright infringement, prevent <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3697578">copyright silencing</a>, and minimize abusive takedown.</p><p>Note: We are taking part in <a href="https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek">Copyright Week</a>, a series of actions and discussions supporting key principles that should govern copyright law.</p><p>About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is a Research Fellow at the Lumen&nbsp;Project.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/copyright-laws-ab-use-as-the-tool-of-choice-for-censorship-and-reputation-management-e78c9129f6f1">(Ab)use of Copyright law as the tool of choice for censorship and reputation management</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  This is a story of a politician who cried “hacker” after a reporter informed a state agency that sensitive information was embedded in their website’s HTML source code. While we wish this was a joke or fictional story it, unfortunately, is not. This real-world example underscores the notion that there is a real need for Policymakers to understand how technology works and behaves.

<p>This is a story of a politician who cried “hacker” after a reporter informed a state agency that sensitive information was embedded in their website’s HTML source code1. While we wish this was a joke or fictional story it, unfortunately, is not. If the state of Missouri does move forward with the prosecution this state action would sound the alarm for researchers and reporters resulting in a chilling effect on the practice of responsible reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Josh Renaud, a reporter from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch was researching the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s website for an upcoming story when he realized that <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agencys-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html">“Teachers’ Social Security numbers were embedded in the websites HTML source code”</a> (meaning anyone could have easily viewed the page source code and obtained the SSNs). The concerned reporter communicated his findings to the state agency and delayed his report to allow enough time for the state to remove the affected portions of the website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-officials-planned-to-thank-post-dispatch-before-threatening-newspaper-emails-show/article_0f6c5288-cd11-569c-804e-9b280e9c1e68.html">instead of thanking the reporter</a> for discovering a security vulnerability, the Governor of Missouri held a news conference labeling the reporter as a “hacker” and threatened prosecution, even though the State’s Department of Public Safety Director had received confirmation from the FBI that “this incident is not an actual network intrusion.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We couldn’t agree more with the following statements made by House Representatives Crystal Wade and Tony Lovasco.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rep. Tony Lovasco <a href="https://twitter.com/tonylovasco/status/1448672694065668105">tweeted</a> on October 14, 2021:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;“It’s clear the Governor’s office has a fundamental misunderstanding of both web technology and industry-standard procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities. Journalists responsibly sounding an alarm on data privacy is not criminal hacking.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rep. Crystal Wade <a href="https://twitter.com/crystal_quade/status/1448689099498532867?s=20">asserted</a> in a public statement made on October 14, 2021 that:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The governor should direct his anger towards the failure of state government to keep its technology secure and up to date and work to fix the problem, not threaten journalists with prosecution for uncovering those failures.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This recent example underscores the notion that there is a real need for Policymakers to understand how technology works and behaves. Earlier this year, past congressional hearings also showed us that many Policymakers do not understand basic internet functions. We urge Policymakers to do their homework so that they can make educated and informed decisions on technology issues. Me2BA offers itself as a resource for Policymakers to navigate opaque and complex technology issues, so that researchers and journalists can continue to safely perform responsible reporting, which is a crucial function to keep everyone safe online.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, January 19, 2022 – Edge is pleased to be the recipient of the Verizon New Jersey Public, Educational or Government (PEG) Training and Equipment Program funds for 2022. The PEG program provides resources and education for developing creative media literacy in the community. Through this program fund, video production, editing equipment, and training programs are available for use in the development of local programming content that can be shown on local public, educational and governmental (PEG) access channels.</p>
<p>Through the PEG Program, any municipal-authorized representative or resident can take a free Basic Video Production training course at a participating County or Community College and then be eligible to borrow a complete location video production system to record a community event or program. Once the video shoot is complete, the authorized representative or resident can edit the footage at the participating County or Community College in order to produce a complete video program, ready for broadcast on the local PEG channels. An Advanced Video Production training course is also available, once the Basic Training has been successfully completed.</p>
<p>As the program implementation coordinator, Edge helps to manage the program and act as an interface for participating County and Community colleges. In addition to program management, the Verizon PEG Program provides equipment, technical support, application development, training resources, and maintenance.</p>
<p>Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Edge’s Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, explains, “Edge has developed software for tracking course enrollment information, inventory, and equipment loans, as well as an inventory management program to track usage of the PEG equipment and its necessary maintenance.” Further elaborates Dr. Ghahramani, “The inventory management service provides a secure web program interface with locally segregated data entry so institutions can provide periodic information on the website including dates when PEG equipment is borrowed and returned, a description of the PEG equipment that is borrowed, and the attendance of students in PEG training courses.” The number of people who participate in PEG training and use the program to develop local programming content can be easily tracked through the use of a registration application.</p>
<p>Participating institutions also have access to customized editing software and licensing of off-the-shelf programming pieces to be used to enhance local programming and its content by individuals and municipalities. To bring the various colleges together and create a forum for information sharing and collaboration, Edge is leveraging the <a href="https://edgexchange.njedge.net/home">EdgeXchange</a> platform to create a “Creative Media” community where institutions can share their experiences and best practices.</p>
<p>Municipalities are encouraged to take advantage of this free program in order to increase the amount of locally produced programs on the PEG channels. For additional information, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:PEG@NJEdge.net">PEG@NJEdge.net</a>&nbsp;or refer to&nbsp;<a href="http://peg.njedge.net/">peg.njedge.net</a>&nbsp;for contacts at participating community colleges.</p>

	 <a></a>1 Abstract 
<p>Our relationship with technology involves legal agreements that we either review or enter into when using a technology, namely privacy policies and terms of service or terms of use (“TOS/TOU”). We initiated this research to understand if providing a formal rating of the legal policies (privacy policies and TOS/TOUs) would be valuable to consumers (or “Me-s” in our parlance). From our early qualitative discussions, we noticed that people were unclear on whether these policies were legally binding contracts or not. Thus, a secondary objective emerged to quantitatively explore whether people knew who these policies protected (if anyone), and if the policies were perceived to be contracts with the provider of the digital technology (or “B”).</p>
<p>The purpose of a privacy policy is notification and disclosure, not protection.&nbsp; Privacy policies are not designed to protect anyone, they’re designed to inform. The TOS/TOU, on the other hand, is an agreement relating to the use of the technology or service and is typically designed to protect the business. Do Me-s understand this?</p>
<p>We conducted ethnographic interviews with six participants living in the United States, during a two-week period from February to March 2021. We followed these interviews with a focus group session of five participants in July 2021 and an online survey of 566 individuals in August 2021. In these studies, we asked participants and survey respondents who they think the privacy policy and TOS/TOU protect and whether they perceived these policies to be enforceable contracts.</p>
<p>The following are the key findings from this research:</p>
 
 People don’t understand that the Terms of Service is a contract. 55% of survey participants did not understand that a TOS/TOU is a contract (based on only 45% saying it is one). This has significant legal implications. In particular, a key requirement for legally binding contracts is mutual assent, which means that both parties have a “meeting of the minds”<a>1</a> and understand they’re entering into a contract. Our research makes clear that is not the case in Terms of Service agreements.<a>2</a> 
 
 
 Consumers are aware of the existence of legal policies on connected technologies. Focus group participants said that they know that legal policies exist for connected technologies and that they should read them, but that they largely ignore them in favor of getting to use the app or website as quickly as possible. The majority recognize cookie consent requests on websites and have some understanding that it relates to data privacy, but doesn’t necessarily connect them to a privacy policy. They are aware of TOS/TOU agreements when signing up for a service but often will accept the terms without reading them thoroughly. 
 
 
 People have a weak understanding of what the legal policies of digital technologies are or whom they protect. 66% of survey respondents say that privacy policies protect the business, while only 50% say they protect the consumer. The difference was starker for TOS/TOU, where 68% say they protect the business and only 35% say they protect the consumer. All interview participants say both documents are there largely to protect the digital technology company (the “B”) and to enforce “rules” around what a consumer can and cannot do with the technology. 
 
 
 None of the interview participants were aware of the existence of tools they can use to evaluate legal policies. They were aware of review sites that evaluate digital products from a consumer perspective, and some of the participants understood what a browser plugin was, and said they use them to block cookies, for example. They were not aware, specifically, of tools that help them understand privacy policies or TOU/TOS documents. 
 
 
 Half of the interview participants said that a score wouldn’t change their behavior. Even after we demonstrated rating tools such as TOS;DR and Privacy Badger, participants told us they did not expect to change their behavior, particularly if they were already using a particular digital service. Some said that seeing these ratings would potentially give them pause before using a new (to them) service. 
 
<p>As a result of this collection of research, the Me2B Alliance has decided not to pursue a formal legal policy audit service. Instead, we expect to evaluate and perhaps recommend existing services like Privacy Badger, TOS;DR, Mozilla’s “Privacy Not Included” program and others.</p>
<p>We hope, however, that the findings in this research can help illuminate and eventually eliminate the pervasive asymmetry in Me2B relationships and be a concrete resource to lawyers supporting Me-s in legal cases relating to digital agreements. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@me2ba.org">admin@me2ba.org</a> if you’d like access to the quantitative data.</p>
 <a></a>2 Introduction 
<p>The Me2B Alliance, a nonprofit organization, conducted a qualitative study of consumers’ awareness and understanding of the legal policies of online businesses, services and products, namely the Privacy policy and Terms of Service/Terms of Use (“TOS/TOU”) agreements. The study explored participants’ understanding what these legal documents are, whose interests they protect and whether knowing if these policies are respectful or not would change their online behaviors. The objective was to understand if a legal policy rating would be of use to consumers when deciding whether to enter into a commitment with a technology provider—or even use technology.</p>
 <a></a>2.1 Background 
<p>The Me2B Alliance (“Me2BA”) is a nonprofit creating a safe and just digital world through standards development and independent technology testing. At the core of our work is our Respectful Technology Specification<a>3</a> currently in development, which provides an objective standard for measuring safe and ethical technology behavior. The Specification consists of a series of tests that evaluate how a connected product or service is behaving towards the people that use it. This helps individuals understand how technology is treating them, and helps businesses build technology that is safe for and respectful to the people that use it.</p>
<p>In particular, the Respectful Tech Specification tests each Me2B Commitment,<a>4</a> including whether the notice of the agreement to each commitment is easy for technology users to find and access. Among other things, the set of tests for the each Commitment addresses whether or not the individual has the opportunity to provide permission prior to the sharing, or derivation, of personal and tracking data with a website or mobile app. Viable permission is a core attribute of respectful commitments.<a>5</a> Websites typically notify users by asking for permission (often through the browser); mobile apps often reference an individual’s existing permission settings, activating a device pop up if permission is needed.</p>
<p>Who are these policies designed to protect?</p>
<p>Most legal policies are written by corporate lawyers, and are therefore designed to protect the corporations who paid for them. We as individual Me-s usually don’t have lawyers who specialize in this area, and we aren’t writing these kinds of policies for ourselves. And even if we did, we don’t have the technological capability to send them to the business at the time of using a service or creating an account. Note, however, that IEEE P7012 “Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms”<a>6</a> is developing a technical interoperability standard that will allow people to have software agents that can send legally binding privacy agreements to the provider (or B)—kind of like a reverse terms of service from the user, asserting specifically what permissions are granted to the business.</p>
<p>Privacy policies are notices provided to users of technology. The practice of privacy policies can be linked to Fair Information Practices Principles (FIPPS) such as these from the FTC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTC_fair_information_practice">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTC_fair_information_practice</a>) which expressly includes the practice of notice/notification. The purpose of a privacy policy is notification and disclosure, not protection.&nbsp; Privacy policies are not designed to protect anyone, they’re designed to inform.</p>
<p>The TOS/TOU, on the other hand, is an agreement relating to the use of the technology or service and is typically designed to protect the business.</p>
 <a></a>2.2 Literature Review 
<p>For a person to have agency in entering into an agreement with a technology product or service, they must be able to find, access and understand these agreements and the policies that explain them. We did a literature review of consumer perceptions of legal policies and evaluated tools like the Privacy Badger<a>7</a> and ToS;DR<a>8</a> browser extensions to understand if scoring these policies would make any difference in consumer behavior.</p>
<p>In a review of existing research, we found no studies that directly answer whether or not people will change their web activity knowing that legal terms are unfavorable to them. Most studies investigate what extent people will attempt to access a website’s legal terms or that people don’t read these policies to begin with.<a>9</a> Some studies evaluate whether people understand what they have consented to by agreeing to a website’s legal terms. However, some reasonable inferences can be drawn based on certain surveys and reports.</p>
<p>The closest study that might shed light on this question is a study conducted by Lior Strahilevitz and Matthew B. Kugler in which they look into the relevancy of reading privacy policies and what people take away from reading such privacy policies.<a>10</a> This study concluded that when people are exposed to varying degrees of specificity and clarity of a website’s privacy policy, there was no significant effect on consumers’ judgment about what they authorized the website to do. Similarly, exposure to a website’s privacy policy did not lead to any significant effects on the individual’s perception of the website’s intrusiveness. Strahilevitz and Kugler point to the rational thinking of people doing a cost-benefit analysis where privacy sacrifices inherent in their use of certain websites outweigh the costs. One inference that can be made is even if people read a website’s privacy policy, they might not have the appropriate knowledge to determine whether the website’s data practices are reasonable. Taking this inference one step further, unless a website explicitly says it engages in poor data practices that do not even remotely take into consideration the privacy of the user, people will unlikely know the difference between privacy friendly terms and non-privacy friendly terms.</p>
<p>A Cisco report from 2019 sheds light on people increasingly becoming more aware of their privacy.<a>11</a> According to Cisco’s report, 32% of all survey respondents across several different countries care about data privacy, are willing to act, and have already taken action to protect their privacy. The most telling result is 87% of responding businesses experienced sales delays to existing or prospective customers caused by their customers’ privacy concerns. The report attributes this privacy mindset likely to customers making sure their vendors and business partners have adequate answers to their privacy concerns before doing business together. However, these appear to be business-to-business transactions where customers have stronger negotiating power to encourage their vendors to adopt better data practices, which is quite different from the dynamics involved between an average Internet user and a website/business.</p>
<p>We can conclude from this review that, although privacy is becoming an increasing concern for people, there is little visibility into how or if people are modifying their behaviors when faced with knowledge of a website’s poor data practices.</p>
 <a></a>3 Research Design 
 <a></a>3.1 Study Objectives 
<p>The objective of this study was to conduct qualitative research to understand whether people change their behavior when they understand the legal policies governing their interactions with digital technologies. This was a mixed method (qualitative and quantitative) study, utilizing one-on-one interviews and an online survey. Open-ended interviews were conducted with six adult participants to examine their awareness, understanding and use of the legal policies that govern their interaction with Internet-enabled businesses they interact with on a regular basis, namely privacy policies and TOS/TOU. The online survey was a simple, 3-question survey clarifying online technology consumers’ understanding of the impact of these policies on them and the business.</p>
 <a></a>3.2 Research Questions 
<p>Three primary research questions guided the development of the research methods:</p>
<p>Part One – Qualitative Study:</p>
 
 Do people change how they interact with a website when they are familiar with the legal terms (Privacy policy and/or TOS/TOU) of the website. 
 Does a score grading the Privacy policy and TOS/TOU have value to Me-s (consumers). 
 
<p>Part Two — Quantitative Study:</p>
 
 Do people know whether these documents are contracts, whether they are enforceable and who these policies protect? 
 
 <a></a>3.3 Participants 
<p>For the survey, We created a survey on Surveymonkey and ran it on August 5, 2021. 566 people responded, all in the United States. While we did not select for gender balance, 297 female (52.5%) and 269 male (47.5%) respondents completed the survey.</p>
<p>Age ranges included 21.9% aged 18-29, 24.6% aged 30-44, 37.3% aged 45-60 and 16.3% over age 60.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Income Brackets of Survey Participants</p>
<p>Six interview participants from various areas of the United States were selected for interviews, five women and one man ranging in age from late twenties to mid-fifties. Two of the participants interviewed were African American, one was Latinx and three, including the male participant, were White.</p>
<p>The Participant Snapshots in <a>Appendix A</a> give a sense of each participant’s technology use in terms of quantity of products used, the way the products were used, how the participants felt about their technology use, as well as their general comfort level with technology.</p>
<p>Participant recruitment was conducted using&nbsp;an&nbsp;online platform, UserInterviews.com, for the interviews and Surveymonkey.com for the online survey. The UserInterviews platform&nbsp;allows for the creation of a screening survey to find eligible participants. Participants were sought who had a home broadband connection, who regularly used at least two Internet-enabled devices, who did not work in the technology or legal sectors, and who did not live in a large urban center. See&nbsp;<a>Appendix B</a>&nbsp;for the complete screening survey.</p>
<p>Interview participants who qualified after completing the screening survey were then hand-selected by the researcher for participation. The researcher invited participants to maximize diversity&nbsp;of the&nbsp;interviewees&nbsp;along the dimensions of age, ethnic/racial background, and geographical location.&nbsp;Unfortunately, few males responded to the call in the short time that recruiting took place, so there is a gender imbalance, skewing female, with this study.</p>
 <a></a>3.4 Informed Consent 
<p>Each participant (interviewee) gave verbal consent to participate in this study. Prior to the start of the interview, Noreen Whysel, the interviewer, emailed a copy of the Me2B Alliance consent form. Then at the time of the interview, via&nbsp;videoconferencing, she showed the participant a written consent form (see&nbsp;<a>Appendix C</a>).</p>
<p>Participant indicated verbally that they had read the entire consent form, then the interviewer asked if they had any questions and if they agreed to participate in the study. If the interviewee consented, the audio-recording was initiated, and the interviewee was asked to state his or her name and to state, “I agree to participate in this study.”</p>
<p>These audio recordings of participants’ verbal consent were saved as separate audio files and are retained by study personnel.&nbsp;We offered to email a PDF of the conenst form following the survey to all participants.</p>
 <a></a>4 Methods 
 <a></a>4.1 Qualitative Research – Interviews and Sentiment Analysis 
<p>We conducted the interviews via videoconferencing using Zoom software. Noreen Whysel conducted the interviews. Two additional Me2B volunteers, Lisa LeVasseur and Jeff Orgel, observed an interview on two separate occasions and asked questions of participants at the end of the formal series of questions.&nbsp;Interviews were audio-recorded using Zoom.&nbsp;Each interview lasted approximately&nbsp;60 minutes.</p>
<p>The purpose of open-ended interviewing was to understand participants’ awareness, understanding and use of legal policies such as privacy policies and TOS/TOU. The Interview Guide (see <a>Appendix D</a>) was used to direct the conversation, though open-ended questions were not necessarily asked verbatim or in the order they appear in the guide. The interviewer(s) also improvised questions as necessary in order to follow up with topics introduced by the participants.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.2 Quantitative Research – Online Survey 
<p>The survey had two questions, each listing five statements about these online technologies with checkboxes and one open-ended comment box asking participants to explain why they chose the options they did. The respondents selected the statements they agreed with and filled in the open ended comment field to expand on their selections. We also performed a cluster analysis on the open ended responses.</p>
 <a></a>5 Data Analysis 
<p>Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim. In addition, the interviewer took extensive notes during each interview. The interview responses and recorded conversations are unstructured data comprised of factual statements, as well as opinions and other statements of sentiment or comparison. Indications of positive, neutral and negative sentiment orientation were noted as well as the degree of confidence of the answers by analyzing response time (subjectively), statements such as “I think”, “I’m not sure”, “I don’t know”, etc. and incidents of wavering assertion.</p>
<p>Survey data from the SurveyMonkey projects were downloaded to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed to determine if there were any significant patterns around legal policy awareness and understanding. We further analyzed this data by gender, age, income bracket and U.S. region.</p>
<p>In addition, we used Carrot2 Clustering Workbench (<a href="https://search.carrot2.org/">https://search.carrot2.org/#/workbench</a>) using the LINGO algorithm to examine open-ended comments from the survey responses. The Lingo algorithm creates well-described flat clusters and is available as part of the open source Carrot2 framework. Clustering Workbench processed text content from local files that was uploaded In Excel format.</p>
 <a></a>6 Findings 
 <a></a>6.1 Interview Findings 
<p>As noted in Section 4 Method, we invited six participants to discuss their awareness and understanding of legal documents including privacy policies and TOS/TOU agreements, We then asked survey participants to select statements from a randomized list to describe the privacy policies and TOS/TOU documents for websites and mobile apps and related evaluation tools.</p>
<p>Participants differed only very slightly in their concern for online privacy or other online treatment. Most were generally accepting of most policy clauses or had one or two they would look for before accepting them. When it came to financial or personal identity information, two described taking extra steps to secure their credit card or other information online, one going as far as to say they might delete their account and open a new one if they were concerned it may have been compromised. Participant 3, who seemed to be the most comfortable with technology among the study particpants, was also the most cynical about how technologies treat consumers and whether legal policies make a difference.</p>
<p>Below are our detailed findings.</p>
 6.1.1 General Questions About Technology Use 
<p>General questions were introduced to assess the types of digital technologies each participant used on a regular basis and their level of comfort in discussing their online activity.</p>
 6.1.1.1 Interviewer: “How many digital technologies do you use on a regular basis?” 
<p>We asked participants to guess how many online accounts they had. Most could not guess a specific number. One said ten to fifteen accounts, but the rest either couldn’t guess, said, ”a lot”, “too many” or thought it could be at least 50 or even a hundred or more.</p>
<p>We introduced a few categories of accounts including email accounts, retail and banking sites, insurance, social media and other publishers, cloud storage, and streaming services and asked participants to list out products and companies in each category. We provided categories both to elicit categories of technologies they had not thought of but also to elicit specific websites and apps to discuss later in the interview. Most discussed online accounts that are primarily for personal use, but some also mentioned software accounts and email they use for work.</p>
<p>Email (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo!, AOL,&nbsp;etc): Participants have at least one personal email account and one work account. Only one specifically mentioned one personal and one work account, but through later discussions we confirmed that most of the participants also have work accounts.</p>
<p>Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;etc): Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were the most noted social media accounts. One said they only used Instagram. One said that they use Twitter occasionally but was on Reddit the most. Two have Pinterest accounts. One manages social media for their employer.</p>
<p>Financial Services (bank, investment account, etc.): Four indicated that they have online accounts at a bank or credit card company. Two did not report a financial services account. Insurance Company (medical, dental, auto, home,&nbsp;etc) Four indicated that they have online insurance accounts. Two did not report having an online insurance account.</p>
<p>Cloud storage (iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive,&nbsp;etc): Five reported that they have cloud storage accounts such as Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud or that they had files on their carrier account (Verizon) or associated with their device (Samsung Cloud). The Dropbox user noted that they use it for work.</p>
<p>Conferencing (Zoom,&nbsp;Webex,&nbsp;GotoMeeting, MS Teams,&nbsp;etc): Three discussed conferencing system accounts, mentioning Zoom, Google Meet, Adobe Connect, Group.Me, Slack and Rodeo. While all were accessing Zoom for the interview, one participant does not have a Zoom account and one indicated that they use “whatever everyone is using” and said they don’t really notice anymore.</p>
<p>Retail Store (Amazon, Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Nike,&nbsp;etc): All mentioned Amazon, which is not surprising since the testing service, UserInterviews.com pays participants in Amazon credits.&nbsp; Retail sites mentioned include Amazon, Target, Instacart (for grocery delivery from Aldi and Shoprite), Walmart, CVS, Etsy, Lululemon, Poshmark, eBay, Stitchfix, Nine West, Rockbox, Wayfair, Nordstrom, Hay Needle and Michaels. Amazon Prime and Amazon Fresh were also mentioned. “It’s surprising how few times I’ve walked into a store [since 2020]”</p>
<p>Streaming Service (Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Pandora,&nbsp;etc): Four participants noted they hold accounts with online streaming services, three of whom noted specific video services, including Netflix, Hulu, HBOMax, Disney, and Kanopy, which streams video content to users with a public library card. One participant uses Sirius and Pandora music streaming services did not mention any video services or subscriptions. Two participants did not mention streaming services.</p>
<p>Publications (newspaper, magazine,&nbsp;etc.): Three participants said that they had an account with news or magazine publishers. Services noted include the Pittsburgh Post Gazette’s online newspaper, Associated Press and Amazon News and comic book accounts. One said they did not subscribe to online news, and generally does not pay for news. This participant used to get news related magazines and books if they had a promotional code (e.g., frequent flier miles). The comic book subscriber does not have a paid news account.</p>
<p>“[N]ormally, I don’t don’t sign up for anything news related if I have to pay for it.“</p>
<p>Online Work Accounts: Five participants indicated that they had email or other online and software accounts for work.</p>
<p>Other Accounts: No responses for “Other”</p>
<p>After discussing account categories, we asked again to estimate how many online accounts they had. Three said they had 51-100 accounts, one said 101-500 and one said they had less than 20. One did not answer. People seem to know that they have a lot of accounts and listing accounts by category allowed them to think about their online accounts in more concrete numbers. Participant 1, an apparel business owner from Washington, DC, identfied less than 15 accounts. We asked this participant to list the accounts and they were able to name thirteen, including two work emails. They said that they normally don’t create accounts and will use “guest checkout” on most retail sites. Five of the six participants perceive that they hold a lot of accounts that are saved on company websites or apps.</p>
 6.1.1.2 Interviewer: “If you had to guess, about how many digital accounts do you have in total, including the ones you use regularly and those you use infrequently?” 
<p>Most of the participants say that they have more than 50 online accounts. One thought it was likley more than 100. One only has about 10-15 accounts and named 13, confident that that is all they had.</p>
 6.1.2 Understanding of Legal Policies 
<p>None of the participants were in the habit of reading legal policies on websites or apps, considering them to be too long, legalese or a chore sitting in the way of using the app. One participant, Participant 2, a graphic designer from Kansas City, reads the policies when the technology is for work, but not always when it is for personal use. Generally, the participants consider these policies to be “rules” governing how a company can use their data and how they may use the product.</p>
<p>There was some confusion among one of the participants, Participant 1, about exactly how Privacy policy and a Terms of Use or Service document differ, but this participant ultimately agreed with the others that the Privacy policy governs the technology’s use and sharing of personal data and that the TOS/TOU governed the users’ behavior. They were in fact very curious about how the privacy policy covers third-party sharing. Participant 2 and Participant 6 were most interested in information about pricing and fees, while Participant 3 was most interested in Android permission settings. One participant said, cynically that the Privacy policy is there so the company can’t be sued for not having a privacy policy, alluding to privacy laws like California and GDPR.</p>
<p>Participants were unlikely to cancel an account if there was bad news in the press about a technology they use. In the case of a data breach, they felt the damage was already done (a concept that came up frequently in the interivews). They said they might be safer afterwards given a new focus on security. One participant said they might close their account if the news was particularly bad, but then possibly open a new one with a different email if the product or service was unique or hard to duplicate elsewhere. On the other hand, good news about a company or product was not necessarily a draw, as one said, it could be a PR ploy.</p>
 6.1.2.1 Interviewer: “Do you read the privacy policies or terms of service for online, digital products or services?” 
<p>Four of the six participants said they don’t read legal policies. One didn’t answer. Participant 2 occasionally reviews legal policies for work accounts. When reviewing these policies, this participant said, “When I sign up, I definitely want to know what the company had access to.”</p>
<p>“They are long and legalese and…set up where you have to say you agree, because you can’t go to the next step to get your grilled cheese sandwich.”</p>
<p>“Do I feel safe?… I do reviews of a company that I’m signing up for…outside of the website to make sure it’s not a scam.”<br>
</p>
 6.1.2.2 Interviewer: “Can you explain the difference is between these documents?” 
<p>Privacy policy: Five of the participants defined a Privacy policy as the document stating what user data the technology will save or share. One participant said that a privacy policy is the company’s “actual policy for using their site,” conflating it with the Terms of Use. This participant continued to assume the privacy policy governed the consumer’s use of the product or service rather than how the company will use their data.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: All but one participant noted that the TOS/TOU (and in one case the EULA) relates to the rules for using the product or service. In all these responses, the participants were clear that an asymmetry between the Me and the B exists: the company makes the rules, and the user must follow them. One described it as a contract saying that the company has the right to drop you as a user at any time. One participant said that a TOS is associated with payment and includes terms such as 12/months of use “for the term of the account,” as well as policies covering free trials and cancelation. Participant 3 was particularly negative, saying that EULA’s are “documents you have to stroll to the end to use the product”</p>
<p>On TOS/TOU: “If you violate the terms..incite violent revolution…we can ban you.”</p>
<p>On EULAs: “…companies have just thrown random clauses … to see if anybody challenges them.”</p>
 6.1.2.3 Interviewer: “Off the top of your head, what are some things you think you might find in a … “ 
<p>Privacy policy: Two participants said they would expect to find information about what you can and cannot do on the site and what the site does or does not do. One participant mentioned cookies and said that the privacy policy would indicate if they use third-parties cookies or share data with third parties.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: Only two participants answered specifically for TOS/TOU. Participant 1 expected to find return/exchange policies and other information about how the vendor conducts business. Participant 4, a university coordinator from Philadelphia, expected to find contact information in the TOS/TOU. In addition to contact information, Participant 2 would expect to find a way to report something that violates the agreement. Participant 5 described entering a radio contest, and noticing that they had a number of “consent to share” checkboxes that were already checked. This participant had to manually uncheck the boxes, but appreciated that it was an option. In a previous contest, this participant ended up having to unsubscribe from a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>“I’d rather not have my info shared if not required, if I had a choice.”</p>
<p>“[I] just entered a local radio station contest…. It has all&nbsp; {of the] ‘consent to share’ [buttons] checked and I had to uncheck all of them. I’m glad they gave me that option. [Another company did that] with another contest and I ended up having to unsubscribe from a lot of stuff.”</p>
 6.1.2.4 Interviewer: “Are there any specific paragraphs in a privacy policy or terms of service that you tend to look for or read?” 
<p>We asked if there are any specific paragraphs that the participant tends to look for and read in a privacy policy or TOU/TOS. Participant 1 is curious about third party sites and whether data is stored by third parties. Participant 2 and Participant 6 look for pricing information. Participant 6 called it the “money aspect.” Participant 2 also looks for copyright information since it is a concern at their work. Participant 5 doesn’t really read the legal documents, noting that they are more confusing to read than the paper contract you get for car insurance, saying “It’s easier to read [the paper document]. It’s like bullet points.”</p>
<p>Privacy policy: Participant 4 looks for information about protecting credit card information and that they aren’t sharing or selling their email. Participant 3 relies on the app level permissions breakdown that Android provides, because it is less difficult to process than the legal forms. This suggests that this participant might be inclined to seek out trusted sources to provide guidance on privacy protections.</p>
<p>“No one has time to read that much drivel, legalese.”</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: No Comments</p>
 6.1.2.5 Interviewer: “Have you ever tried researching information about a company’s terms of use and privacy policy? Did you find what you need?” 
<p>Participant 6 and Participant 1 discussed their experiences with retail websites. Participant 6 had an unfortunate incident with a company that offered to send a free blender but reneged on the offer. They looked up the company information after they had been “wronged.”&nbsp; Participant 1 had an account at AliBaba but “does read policies on Chinese websites” and will create an account if the merchandise is good. This participant said some sites will allow guest checkout and will use that if&nbsp; they won’t be making future purchases there.</p>
 6.1.2.6 Interviewer: “Let’s say one of your services was featured in the news. Would reading news about a company that shows they care about privacy make you feel more secure using them?” 
<p>Participants were mixed on this question. While two said it would make a positive impression if the news were good, two said a definitive no, and one hesitant no. Participant 2 said it depends on where the report appeared, citing news media bias. This participant would look at other sources, before changing their behavior. Participant 6, who was hesitant admitted that this kind of news “goes in one ear and out the other.” Participant 5 discussed the hacking of Target as an example of bad news about a company. Participant 3 was the most cynical, stating that companies have PR agencies to manipulate the news, and mentioned confirmation bias and zero day exploits. They concluded that “you have to accept that nothing is perfect.”</p>
<p>“Not to be a conspiracy theory, crazy-hat [person], but…paid advertising can say anything.”</p>
 6.1.2.7 Interviewer: “Would reading negative news make you want to stop using it?” 
<p>The general feeling was that if there was negative news it would really depend on the source and whether it was a serious breach of data security. Then, they would consider closing their account. While Participant 4 might remove credit card info and keep using the site, Participant 5 was fatalistic. In that case, “the damage was already done” and “[the business] would probably be more secure afterward.” Participant 3 said if it were “hysterical headlines in your news feed” they would ignore it, but if there was a technical document describing the issue, they might cancel the account.</p>
<p>Only Participant 5 would probably cancel their account and could describe situations where they did act on it. Participant 2 said that if it was a breach, they might cancel an existing account and open a new one.</p>
<p>“There are some things you can only get on Etsy.”</p>
<p>Three participants expressed negative sentiment about privacy policies terms. Participant 5 and Participant 6 suggested that the terms can be misleading. Participant 6 said the terms for canceling their daughter’s Kindle Fire were vague and that the fine print put around the free trial was misleading. Participant 5 said that Geico asks for seemingly irrelevant information on its insurance quote form. Participant 5 went as far as to say that you have no choice if you want to use the service, which was a common response. Participant 3 complained that a music app wanted 24/7 access to the camera and microphone, even though they do not use voice activation. They thought it was “weird” that larger, well-known apps would do that. Participant 1 answered this question, not about legal policies, but about FAQs on a site that they described as “sketchy.”</p>
<p>“I googled something, I think for some type of DSLR. I went on one of these sketchy [Google links]. Clicked on it and read the FAQ, researched reviews on the company. In the reviews I found not only is it a third-party site, it’s not a real company.”</p>
<p>“When you install a music app and it wanted access to camera or 24/7 microphone and I don’t plan to use voice activation. It would be weird on larger well-known apps.”</p>
<p>Two participants said no, reading news about a company would not necessarily make them stop using it, or that they could not think of any services that whose privacy policy made them decide not to use it.</p>
 6.1.2.8 Interviewer: “Have you ever received a notification about an update to a privacy policy (or TOS) that made you consider changing the service? Did you delete your account?“ 
<p>Four participants said they have received policy update notices.</p>
 6.1.3 Awareness of Legal Policy Protections 
<p>Participants were asked to describe in their own words what a privacy policy and TOS/TOU are for. Five responded. There was general agreement that both documents protect the B more than the user. Most said that these policies are primarily to inform the Me and protect the B. The general sense is that they are rules the user must abide by.</p>
 6.1.3.1 Interviewer: “What do you think the privacy policy is for?” 
<p>Two participants were negative about both documents. Participant 3 called a privacy policy “legal cover” for the company. These responses may indicate a sense of a power imbalance.</p>
<p>“I have no choice but to agree.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t protect me. I can’t select the parts I agree with.”</p>
 6.1.3.2 Interviewer: “What do you think the TOS/TOU is for?” 
<p>Participant 2 said the TOS/TOU were “for” the user in the sense that agreeing to the terms gets you access. What rights do you have? Are they protecting your rights/giving you rights/protecting you? Two participants suggested that they are protected by privacy policies if it allows them to change their settings.</p>
<p>“I feel protected if I can change/edit settings.”</p>
<p>“You agree to these policies or you have the right to not use the platform.”</p>
 6.1.3.3 Interviewer: “Do legal policies protect you as the consumer? How?” 
<p>Four participants gave a qualified Yes to this answer. Participant 1 said they do protect the consumer but “it’s on me to read them and absorb them and figure it out.” Participant 5 said they protect consumers “maybe a little bit.” This participant also had doubts, saying, “They all do share your information.” Participant 3 was the most negative and did not think people really had a chance against companies like Google, even if their policies are clear.</p>
<p>Participant 2 was much more willing to accept that the companies are collecting data to make the experience better for users, saying that the act of accepting these policies is “kind of an intimate experience.” They appreciate when their personal and financial information are protected.</p>
<p>Participant 3 on whether privacy policies protect them (as a Me):</p>
<p>“Ostensibly, yes. In reality, good luck.”</p>
<p>“Do you have the time and money and army of lawyers to go against Google?”</p>
<p>Privacy policy: Participant 1’s answer to this question clarifies some earlier confusion about what these policies cover. This participant explained, erroneously, that a privacy policy outlines what you can and cannot do on the site and TOS/TOU was how to use the site. After hearing how the Me2B Alliance defines these documents in the next section, Participant 1 said it was clearer.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: None of the comments to this question were specifically about the TOS/TOU.</p>
 6.1.3.4 Interviewer: “Do legal policies protect&nbsp;the organization? How?” 
<p>Privacy policy: All participants answered this question in the affirmative. Companies are protected by the privacy policy. Participant 2 mentioned GDPR (though didn’t recall the name of the regulation) as the reason we are seeing cookie notices. This participant said that their understanding is a company can get sued if they don’t have a privacy policy. Participant 3 called it “legal cover for what they track and sell,” saying that while it does allow a better experience it “allows them to sell and monetize whatever they want.” Participant 1 continued to suggest that a privacy policy allows a company to sue a user who uses the content without permission.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: Three participants said that the organization is protected by the TOS/TOU because they can ban or delete an account of a user who isn’t following the rules. This protects the integrity of the service and builds the trust of the user population. Participant 1 was unclear if the TOS/TOU protects the company, since their understanding was that the terms document was more “how to” than rules. They made more sense later when we defined the documents.</p>
<p>Participant 3 felt that the TOS/TOU protects the company in extreme cases where a bad actor can be banned. They described services where users are banned for promoting violence or hate speech. They said that sometimes these companies may be accused of censorship but that terms may be written so that they can remove a user for any reason, which further protects the company from lawsuits.</p>
<p>Participant 6 was also negative, mentioning a situation where a company may force you into paying for a service and make it difficult to get out of the agreement, including terms that are written such that, “you have to keep paying them” and cannot tell your bank to stop payment. This is described as <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/forced-continuity">Forced Continuity</a> in Harry Brignull’s website <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/">DarkPatterns.org</a>. “If someone is using the platform for malicious activities and making the org or platform look bad, they should have the right to delete their account if that person is doing bad things.”</p>
 6.1.3.5 Interviewer: “Have you seen cookie notices?” 
<p>Five participants answered this question. They all have seen cookie notices.</p>
<p>“I do see them. When they pop up, it says ‘Accept all cookies.’”</p>
 6.1.3.6 Interviewer: “Do you know what they are?” 
<p>Participant 2 found them particularly irritating, saying that, “It would be better if all of them were by default. I wouldn’t have to do more work.”</p>
 6.1.3.7 Interviewer: “Are these [cookie notices] legally binding?” 
<p>Responses to whether these policies are legally binding were mixed. Four participants were unsure and of the two participants who answered confidently, one said yes, and the other said No. Participant 1 says that if you click OK to consent to a policy it is now binding.</p>
<p>Participant 3 did not think they could be prosecuted.</p>
<p>“I haven’t read a court case…where a cookie was used as evidence.”</p>
 6.1.3.8 Interviewer: “Are they related to the privacy policy?” 
<p>Five participants said that cookies are related to the privacy policy and were confident in their response. The sixth, Participant 5, said that they are probably not related to the privacy policy “because they are stored on my computer, not at Amazon.” Participant 6 seemed to abstract the privacy policy and the cookies from each other saying that the policy is related to “something I signed up for” while cookies are a “generalization”.</p>
 6.1.4 Understandability of Me2BA Definitions&nbsp;for Privacy policy and Terms of Service/Use 
<p>The interviewer read the following working definitions of Privacy policy and Terms of Service/Tems of Use to get the participants reactions.</p>
<p>Privacy policy: Public promise of how the technology and the company will treat you and your data. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security">Enforceable by the FTC</a> in the US.<a>12</a></p>
<p>Terms of Service/Terms of Use: The two-party contract that you are signing that both parties will abide by. Enforceable by the court of law.</p>
 6.1.4.1 Interviewer: Does this change your understanding of either of these documents at all? 
<p>Privacy policy: Four participants reacted positively to the Privacy policy definition. They found it simple, understandable, but Participant 3, who was favorable of the definition and Participant 5 who was unfavorable both wondered if it would be enforceable. Participant 5 said that “If I start getting emails from a company I never did business with, I won’t know who they got [my data] from” and wouldn’t know if it is possible to sue. Participant 2 and Participant 6 found the definition protective of the consumer. Participant 2 called it a “promise”.</p>
<p>TOS/TOU: Four participants reacted to the Me2BA definition for TOS/TOU, three negatively. The concern was that the Me2BA definition was idealistic on one hand and scary on the other. Participant 3 and Participant 6 found the idea of a binding agreement frightening. Participant 3 called it a “hostage situation” and thought it would be difficult for a new service to open their customer relationship with such an agreement. They also said that TOSs and EULAs have been challenged in court and “have been found to be unenforceable in Europe”. At best, they said they are “idealistic.”</p>
<p>On enforceability, Participant 5 didn’t think the company would ever enforce the TOS/TOU and that it would be difficult to prove it was violated.</p>
 6.1.4.2 Interviewer: Does any of this change your understanding of these policies? 
<p>Five participants responded. Two said that it did not change their understanding. Participant 1 was not aware of the limited enforceability of the policies and assumed that both were enforceable agreements. Participant 2 said that the Me2BA definition of the TOS/TOU made it seem two-sided, but felt it was one-sided from the consumer’s point of view, ie. covering actions by the consumer that could affect their ability to use a product. Participant 3 objected to the Me2BA definition stating that there are “no two parties”.</p>
 6.1.5 Importance&nbsp;of Reading Legal Policies 
 6.1.5.1 Interviewer: “Do you think it is important to read legal policies before signing up for an account?” 
<p>Five participants think it is important to read legal policies before signing up for an account. Participant 1 said it is important “but not mandatory” and Participant 2 said it is important but “I know a lot of people don’t look through it because it is very lengthy.” Participant 5 called them “legalese” and “vague” and felt it would be better if it were written in a “common language”.</p>
<p>Participant 3 bluntly stated that you don’t have to read the policy, “If you have to use the platform, if it’s mandatory,” or “if you want to do modern banking.” Their nearest Bank of America ATM is 15 miles away, so they would have to use the website or app to manage their account.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to live in a food desert. I live in a Bank of America desert.”</p>
 6.1.5.2 Interviewer: “Why? Or Why not? Could they be important to you?” 
<p>Participant 6 noted that popular culture provides examples of why it is important to read legal policies. They described an episode of South Park where one of the kids “…didn’t read it and ended up in a kind of hell.” Some examples of why it is important to read legal policies are,</p>
<p>“If you abuse how you use Amazon and vice versa, you can go to court.”</p>
<p>“If something goes wrong, you want to be protected.”</p>
<p>“So that I know what I’m getting into, what I’m going to be charged, and if they are going to sell my data.”</p>
<p>Participant 6 offered examples of why people don’t read legal policies: instant gratification, living in a consumer society, and being in a hurry.</p>
 6.1.6 Awareness of Privacy/TOU Management Tools 
 6.1.6.1 Interviewer: “Did you know there are plugins that read privacy policies?&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, do you use them? Which ones?” 
<p>Five participants have heard of browser plugins, generally as tools that improve your internet experience or as Participant 1 said “make it better to do anything in regard to the internet or a specific [site or task], but none had heard of plugins that specifically address the content of legal policies.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t you just block cookies on your browser?”</p>
 6.1.6.2 Interviewer: “If you are aware of plugins and don’t use them, why don’t you use them?” 
<p>We offered to do a walkthrough&nbsp;for each participant of <a href="https://tosdr.org">ToS;DR&nbsp;</a>(“Terms of Service; Didn’t Read” is a play on “TL;DR: Too Long Didn’t Read” in internet parlance) to see if it would be possible to filter for people who use privacy browser extensions and plugins. All participants agreed to view these services. We were hoping to create a control group of people who don’t use legal policy extensions, but while Participant 3 uses script blockers and other chrome extensions, neither they nor any other participants had heard of browser-based privacy or other legal policy tools. It could be interesting to do a larger survey of people who use these extensions and those who do not.</p>
<p>All participants were curious about browser extensions that address legal policies and agreed to do walkthroughs of TOS;DR and Privacy Badger. Participant 1’s reaction was the strongest: “That is amazing!” Yet, they weren’t sure it would stop them from shopping on a site. Participant 4 wouldn’t necessarily stop using the service (mentioning YouTube) but that “it might make me more careful.”</p>
<p>Participant 2 would want to look at other rating sites. Their concern is who is doing the reports since some can be biased. “Knowledge is power,” and knowing what you are getting into yourself into is important but was doubtful to this participant that it would make a difference overall.</p>
<p>“I would wonder if the trackers it is blocking disrupts my experience on the website. If it doesn’t, I would definitely use the plug-in. I’d disable it one time and then renew it later. “</p>
<p>Of the six participants, Participant 2, the graphic designer, was the most curious about the interface on TOS;DR and Privacy Badger. The color coding made sense for TOS;DR, but the Privacy Badger stop icon and cookie icon were hard to distinguish.</p>
<p>“Red means bad. Green means ‘I want.’ If I have these [cookies] blocked, I only see red: It looks bad.”</p>
 6.1.6.3 Interviewer: “Are you comfortable using a site that uses trackers?” 
<p>Participant 1 doesn’t like trackers. They see ads following them around various sites and called it disturbing. “It can freak you out a little bit. I don’t like it, but I don’t stop using them.”</p>
 6.1.7 Scoring Legal Policies 
<p>In lieu of asking about independent scoring, such as the ratings provided by the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Privacy Badger or Consumer Reports, we asked participants if knowing that a policy is good or bad would change behavior and if so whose opinion would you trust to make that decision. The interviewer allowed questions and responses to arise organically and where relevant suggested discussing concepts such as independent agency, rating service, friends, certification, etc.</p>
<p>From prior responses it seems like it would be very unlikely if users would change their behavior if presented with these scores. Some already have a personal policy of not signing onto a service at first and mentioned behavior like blocking trackers on unfamiliar sites and unblocking trackers as they gained comfort. The scores are seen as “nice to know” and useful in combination with other rating services like consumer ratings or other reviews.</p>
<p>Participant 5 answered this question directly and would trust a rating service, but wouldn’t stop using the service even if the score was bad. They noted that “Amazon got an E [TOS;DR’s lowest rating] and I’m still going to use it.” They said they would only change their behavior if the government enforced a minimum score.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it [a score] would influence my behavior. It would be nice to know.”</p>
 6.1.7.1 Interviewer: “Do you ever talk to people about these policies?” 
<p>Five participants said that they don’t talk to people about legal policies. Participant 1 said it is not a natural conversation. Participant 6 said they probably should have that conversation with their spouse. Participant 2 would talk about it at work because it was something they had to include on their own website, and said they might talk to people about the plugins we demonstrated. Participant 3 is usually the person that people go to to ask about these kind of things, but their former supervisor was “more into this than I am.”</p>
 6.1.7.2 Interviewer: “If you knew that a policy was good or bad, would it affect your decision to use the digital technology?” 
<p>Three participants said that knowing there was a legal rating would change their behavior and three said it would not. Participant 4 said it would make them more aware when using a site and already uses service without logging in if login isn’t necesary. Participant 1 said it would probably be more useful to have a rating for a site they never used before. While Participant 6 said that there are certain things [sites] they wouldn’t give up and that having something like a rating would be “super beneficial.” Participant 4 and Participant 2 mentioned practical changes like not having a credit card saved to the account or changing privacy settings. Participant 5 was the most negative. They’ve already bought things from Amazon for years, which means the damage and privacy violations are already done.</p>
<p>“Having a list like this would be helpful. I can think of scenarios where it would stop me from using the site or give me the the go ahead and go.”</p>
 6.1.7.3 Interviewer: “Whose opinion about whether a&nbsp;policy is good or bad would you trust?” 
<p>Participants indicated that they would trust an independent rating, particularly if it was objective and had no ulterior motive, such as a not-for-profit organization. Participant 4 mentioned Better Business Bureau and Consumer Reports, followed by their own family. Participant 6 trusts restaurant scores, indicating that they would be open to government involvement. Participant 5 from previous questions seemed to want to look to government regulation to solve the problem rather than trust a score.</p>
<p>“I would trust TOS;DR or Privacy Badger more than a friend. That’s their job, what they are actually built to do.”</p>
 <a></a>6.2 Survey Findings 
 6.2.1 June 2021 Study 
<p>We conducted an online survey in June 2021 asking the following questions:</p>
 
 Which of the following are true about a privacy policy on a website or mobile app? 
 Which of the following are true about the terms of service or terms of use on a website or mobile app? 
 
<p>Each question had eight options including both positively and negatively stated phrases, as well as two options that offered combinations:</p>
 
 “It protects me” 
 “It protects the business” 
 “It does not protect me” 
 “It does not protect the business” 
 “It is a contract” 
 “It is not a contract” 
 “It is enforceable” 
 “It is not enforceable” 
 “It protects me and the business” 
 “It does not protect me or the business” 
 “None of these” 
 
<p>This study was found to be flawed with just over 6.1% of responses including contradicting phrases, for example, where a participant selected both “It protects me and the business” and “It does not protect me.” Also, because we included a “None of These“ option on both questions, there was a risk that it could be selected along with a positive phrase. In drafting the survey, we felt this was acceptable as long as an answer was required. If we did not require an answer, it would be difficult to know if a question with no options selected was inadvertantly skipped or if the participant felt that none of the answers were true. However, on reviewing the results, we decided to run a new survey that eliminated potentially contradictory selections.</p>
 6.2.2 August 2021 Study 
<p>In our August study, we dropped the negatively stated options. Instead, we asked participants to indicate whether the policy protects them, protects the business, whether it is a contract and whether it is enforceable. A fifth answer “None of these” was provided in case the respondent believed none of these to be true. (<a>Appendix E</a>)</p>
<p>1. Which of the following are true about a privacy policy on a website or mobile app?</p>
 
 It is legally binding 
 It protects me 
 It protects the business 
 It is a contract 
 None of these 
 
<p>Please describe why you answered this question the way you did.</p>
<p>2. Which of the following are true about a terms of service or terms of use on a website or mobile app?</p>
 
 It is legally binding 
 It protects me 
 It protects the business 
 It is a contract 
 None of these 
 
<p>Please describe why you answered this question the way you did.</p>
<p>This shorter survey offered clearer insights. The following table shows response rates for each option.</p>
<p>Table 3: Response rate for each option in the survey</p>

<p>Just under 40% understood the privacy policy to be a contract (39%), and just under a half said that a TOS/TOU is a contract (45%). This is a huge finding considering that the TOS/TOU is indeed a contract. Fewer indicated that these documents are enforceable with 29% for Privacy policies and 34% for TOS/TOU selecting “It is enforceable.”</p>
<p>On privacy policies:</p>
<p>“I can leave it any time. It is not a contract.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if it is a contract because I’m not sure if it’s signed by both parties.”</p>
<p>“It is a contract part of the EULA that guarantees certain actions that the business may do with one’s content, which may release them from certain responsibilities, but does not necessarily assure protection for end users.”</p>
<p>On TOS/TOUs:</p>
<p>“[Not a contract] Because it doesn’t have my signature.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it is a contract and I don’t really think it is legally binding and it’s just something businesses put in place.”</p>
<p>“Good lawyers can get around the excessive verbiage, so I don’t know if it’s really legally binding.”</p>
<p>More than two thirds of the respondents selected “It protects the business” for both the privacy policy and the TOS/TOU, while less than half selected “It protects me” for either policy. More people selected “It protects me” (about 50%) in regard to privacy policy than TOS/TOUs (35%). This data indicates that the Privacy policies and TOS/TOUs are thought to favor business interests with more perceived protection to the consumer by privacy policies.</p>
<p>“It provides limited protection for both sides.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t believe they would have our best interest in mind.”</p>
<p>“[T]he only thing I know for sure is that I’m not protected.”</p>
<p>Female respondents were more likely than males to indicate that a Privacy policy “Protects me” (56% of females and 43% of males), and that “It is a contract” (41% of females and 36% of males) and that “It is enforceable” (31% females and 28% of males). Other responses were similar across genders</p>
<p>8% selected “None of these” for Privacy policies and 10% selected “None of These” for TOS/TOU, indicating they do not believe it protects them or the business and that it is neither a contract nor enforceable.</p>
<p>We also looked at combinations to see if there are any patterns.</p>

<p>We looked at combinations of examples to see if there is a correlation between any of the statements. For example, if respondents believed that a document is a contract, do they also believe it provides protection to both parties? Below are some of the more interesting combinations; however, none showed a particularly strong correlation.</p>
<p>38.5% selected “It is a Contract” only 20.7% selected both “It is a Contract” and “It is enforceable.” Overall, only 29.3% selected “It is Enforceable”, which is 9.2% fewer than those who selected “It is a contract.”</p>
<p>Less than one third (29.7%) selected both “It protects me” and “It protects the business.” Only a fifth or responses (20.0%) selected “it protects me” but did not select “It protects the business.” 36.0% selected “It protects the business” but did not select “It protects me.”</p>

<p>More people (45.2%) selected “It is a Contract” for TOS/TOU than for Privacy policies. Slightly fewer (33.7%) said “It is Enforceable”.</p>
<p>Those who felt it protected the business were divided over whether it also protects them (29.7% for privacy policies and 22.3% for TOS/TOU) and whether it was a contract (29.2% for privacy policies and 32.9% for TOS/TOU) or enforceable (24.6% for privacy policies and 27.2% for TOS/TOU).</p>
<p>Fewer participants (38.4%) selected “it protects me” for the TOU/TOS than for a privacy policy. Roughly the same number selected “It protects the business” (65.7% for privacy policies and 67.7% for TOU/TOS). For TOS/TOU, 12.5% selected “it protects me” but did not select “It protects the business”, nearly half the number for privacy policies (45.3% selected “It protects the business” but did not select “It protects me” for TOS/TOU.</p>
<p>For a deeper look, we used the Carrot2&nbsp; Clustering Workbench program to identify word clusters for each question.&nbsp; And highlighted common themes in the responses.</p>
<p>The following image&nbsp;indicates the prevalence of various terms and phrases for privacy policies:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The top clusters were Policies (37), Company (28), Privacy Policies (23) and Protects the Business (22), which is logical since the question was to describe why the participant answered the way they did about privacy policies. Using the term “privacy” or references to protecting the business/company or the individual would be expected. It is interesting that the phrase&nbsp; Protects the Business (22) appears more frequently than Protects Consumers (13).</p>
<p>Several clusters indicate uncertainty: While 14 of the comments that contained the term “Understand” or “understanding” were positive, as in “This is what I understand,” and clusters containing “feel” (9), “guess” (8), “supposed” (6), and variations on “not sure” or “unsure” (11).</p>
<p>For TOS/TOU, we found the following clusters:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The top clusters were Protects (40), Business (36) and Legally (21), Company (15), Protects the Business (13) and Legally Binding (10) which is again logical since the question was to describe why the participant answered the way they did about TOS/TOUs and whom they protect and whether they were enforcable. Again Protects the Business (13) appears more frequently than phrases indicating protection of the individual consumer. In fact “protects consumers” did not appear in the responses, while “protects me” appeared only once. There were six instances indicating that both parties were protected by TOS/TOU, but “Both” was not one of the clusters.</p>
<p>Like with the privacy policy cluster analysis, many responses for the TOS/TOU indicate uncertainty: Eleven of 17 instances of “know” contained variations of the phrase “don’t know,” such as “don’t really know.”</p>
 7 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 7.1 Key Findings 
<p>Are consumers aware of legal documents on connected technologies?</p>
<p>Consumers are aware of the legal policies on connected technologies but see them as things they should read and understand but that are ignored in favor of getting to the app or website as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Do consumers understand accurately what these documents are for and whom they protect?</p>
<p>Not all participants that we interviewed had a good understanding of what privacy policies and TOS/TOU agreements are or whom they protect. Some attributed policies of use, which they called “rules” to the privacy policy as well as the terms of use. Both those with a good and poor understandings of these policies say that the policies are there largely to protect the digital technology company and to enforce rules around what they can and can’t do with the technology. Our cluster analysis uncovered some uncertainty in the responses.</p>
<p>Are consumers aware that these documents are contracts?</p>
<p>In the survey 39% erroneously believed that a privacy policy is a contract and only 45% believed that a TOS/TOU is a contract. None of the interview participants indicated an awareness that the privacy policy or TOS/TOU outlined a contractual obligation. They understood the Privacy policy as a promise not to share data, but they were skeptical. As for the TOS/TOU, they understood these as “rules” that they have to abide by. It was understood more as potentially punitive than as mutually agreed terms.</p>
<p>Do consumers use or are they aware of tools to evaluate legal documents? </p>
<p>None of the participants were aware of the existence of tools they can use to evaluate legal policies. They were aware of review sites that evaluate digital products from a consumer perspective, and some understand what a browser plugin is, but tend to use them to block cookies or extend the functionality of an existing program. The interviewer demonstrated two browser plugins, including TOS;DR (tosdr.org), an independent user rights initiative that evaluates Terms of Service, and Privacy Badger (privacybadger.org), an open-source browser extension that blocks cookies, created by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
<p>Would consumers alter their behavior knowing what these documents mean?</p>
<p>Results from TOS;DR and Privacy Badger on various websites suggested by the participant were of great interest to the participants. Some said that it would potentially give them pause before using a new website, though most are cautious with new technologies anyway. However, half of the participants said that it is unlikely that knowing a site’s score would change their behavior, especially if they are a current customer of that site. They were not surprised that sites like Amazon or Facebook received low scores and suggested of these sites that “the damage is already done.”</p>
 <a></a>7.2 Recommendations 
<p>Should the Me2B Alliance create a scoring system for legal policies?</p>
<p>Given that consumers are not likely to change their behavior even if they know a site has a poor score for its legal policies it is difficult to justify creating a legal policy rating service. Alternatively, Me2B Alliance may wish to consider partnering with organizations like TOS;DR that do this type of rating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>8. Appendix A: Participant Snapshots 
<p>Below are brief snapshots of the Me-s who participanted in interviews and/or focus groups for this research. We have excluded names (even psuedonyms) and demographic information to protect the privacy of these individuals and prevent a biased reading of their responses to questions. Since we are aware that profile building technology can potentially reverse-engineer personally-identifiable information about an individual from the collection of online accounts they hold, we are careful to not only exclude names and demographic information, but also to exclude the names of specific companies and technologies. Instead, we list&nbsp; the number and category of accounts and services held by each participant.</p>



Participant 1<br>

Snapshot: Cautious Consumer<p></p>
<p>Estimated that they have 10-15 total accounts and was able to name 13. This participant was the most cautious of this group. They seemed at first to be unclear on the difference between privacy policies and TOS/TOUs but as the interview went on it became clear that they are aware of them and are curious about third party cookies and sites. Participant 1 skims legal policies when “forced to read them” before signing up, and researches unfamiliar sites. This was the only participant who expressed confidence that deleting their account was a likely response, if something bad, like theft, abuse or racism was reported in connection to the business.</p>


Quotes: Aware of and favorable of plugins because “They make it better to do anything in regard to the Internet….”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Computer, webcam, mobile device, four different web browsers.<br>
</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: Several email account providers including two provided by the employer, one cloud-based file storage service, one social media account, and one mobile wallet account that they said they had subsequently deleted.






Participant 2<br>

Snapshot: The Skimmer<p></p>
<p>Estimated having somewhere in the range of 51 to 100 accounts. Skims privacy policies and terms of service for items specific to the use of their financial information. This participant mentioned two cases that would make them rethink using a particular digital technology: security breach and sharing of credit card information. Used the term “virtual footprint” when describing what the privacy policy allows companies to track.</p>


Quotes: “I do think it’s on me to read them [privacy policies and terms of use] and absorb them and figure them out.”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Computer with webcam, mobile phone, tablet device, and two web browsers.</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: One personal and one work email account, an online chat tool, one streaming media service and several online retails sites for household items and clothing.






Participant 3<br>

Snapshot: Too Many Accounts<p></p>
<p>Selected the option for between 51 and 100. This participant stood out for the sheer number of products and services they could name at once that they use. Understands clearly that they all track users but is carefree about most of it. Answered questions gleefully and with wry cynicism at times.</p>


Quotes: On EULAs: “documents you have to scroll to the end to use the product. Random clauses thrown in that no one ever challenges it.” On TOS/TOU: “If you violate the terms, incite violent revolution, we can ban you.”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: One home computer with webcam, one mobile phone, one tablet computer, and two web browsers</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: Two personal email accounts and one work email account. a personal online database, online auto service, two online social media accounts (one disengaged a while ago), three online banking or trading accounts, multiple credit cards, medical, dental, auto, insurance accounts. For work, three cloud-based file storage accounts and three conferencing accounts. Three media streaming accounts, three video game accounts and other entertainment/media accounts.






Participant 4<br>

Snapshot: Secret Shopper<p></p>
<p>Savvy about privacy and tracking cookies, even though they don’t feel very informed about or understand well the subtleties and legalese of the digital agreements. Frequently interrupted to apologize for not answering the questions but tended to have more interesting responses. While enumerating accounts, this participant remarked that it “feels way more than expected.” Does not use cloud-based file storage accounts except for phone backup. Rarely creates accounts at online stores, other than one major retailer, which they use a lot.</p>


Quotes: “I always forget my password…so I just do the option where you enter as a guest… I do it over and over.”<p></p>
<p>Legal documents “are very long and legalese.” “It’s set up most of the time where you have to say you agree, because if you don’t, you can’t go to the next step to buy your grilled cheese sandwich or whatever, so you just click accept.”</p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Two personal computers with webcam, one mobile phone, two tablet computers, three web browsers.</p>


Key connected products and services discussed:&nbsp; Two personal and one work email accounts, several work software accounts, three social media, several financial accounts including credit cards, checking account, investment, and insurance accounts, one cloud-based file storage service, two online conferencing accounts and one that they use without an account. several online retail accounts (“If I buy anything I create an account.”); Two media streaming accounts. Several mobile apps, one local newspaper account and one restaurant loyalty program.






Participant 5<br>

Snapshot: Tech Savvy<p></p>
<p>Estimated having over 101-500 online accounts, many of which use a federated ID to access rather than creating separate accounts. “[There are] too many to count.” Skims online legal policies. Handles a lot of visual assets at work so is most interested in copyright. Very interested in pricing and fees. Skeptical of bias in news media and does not pay for news.</p>


Quotes: “When I sign up, I definitely want to know what the company had access to.”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Two personal computers, one mobile phone; one web browser, “Several” email accounts including a personal account, a work account and a student email account.</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: Four social media accounts, one airline, one credit union, four credit cards including two affiliated with retail loyalty programs. Health insurance, HSA and IRA investment accounts. Three cloud-based file storage accounts, two of which are unused. Four online retail accounts.






Participant 6<br>

Snapshot: Avid Online Shopper<p></p>
<p>Has hundreds of online accounts and five different emails. Noted that their list of passwords is huge. Read about 2%. Ambivalent about privacy policies and TOS/TOU, but not naïve. Has had an experience where a company offered a free blender on signup but never sent the blender. But won’t necessarily delete an account when something bad happens. Referring to a favorite site, they said sometimes there is only one place where you can get something you need.</p>


Quotes: “There are certain things that I won’t give up.”<p></p>
<p>Devices regularly used: Two personal computers with webcams, two browsers, one mobile phone, three tablet computers.</p>


Key connected products and services discussed: One personal and one work email accounts, two social media accounts, two cloud-based file storage accounts, several online retail accounts, two music streaming accounts, one news account, two online money transferring services, a dog walking service.

<p>Understanding of Legal Policies</p>
<p>First I am going to ask you some questions about your interaction with the legal policies of your online accounts.&nbsp;Please answer to the best of your understanding and feel free to ask me to clarify any questions that you don’t understand.</p>
 
 Do you read the privacy policies or terms of service for online, digital products or services? 
 Do you know what the difference is between these documents? 
 Off the top of your head, what are some things you might find in one of these documents? 
 Are there any specific paragraphs in a privacy policy or terms of service that you tend to look for or read? 
 Another way to ask: Have you been ever tried researching information about a company’s terms of use and privacy policy? Did you find what you need? 
 Would reading news about a company that shows they care about privacy make you feel more secure using them? 
 Have you ever read a privacy policy (or TOS) that made you decide that you didn’t want to use the website after reading it? 
 Do you recall receiving a notification in email or paper post about an update to a privacy policy (or TOS) that made you consider changing the service? 
 
<p>Awareness of Legal Policy Protections</p>
<p>Next, I’d like to understand why you companies have these policies. Again, there is no judgement. All answers are good answers.</p>
 
 
 
 What do you think the privacy policy is for? 
 What rights do you have? Are they protecting your rights/giving you rights/protecting you? 
 (Who are legal policies for?) 
 Do legal policies protect you as the consumer? How? 
 Do legal policies protect the organization? How? 
 Privacy policy 
 Terms of Service/Terms of Use 
 Have you seen cookie notices? 
 Are these legally binding? 
 Are they related to the privacy policy? 
 
 
 
<p>Introduce the definitions</p>
<p>Privacy policy: Public promise of how the technology and the company will treat you and your data. Enforceable by the FTC in the US.</p>
<p>Terms of Service/Terms of Use (“TOS/TOU”): The two-party contract that you are signing that both parties will abide by. Enforceable by the court of law.</p>
<p>Does any of this change your understanding of these policies?</p>
<p>Importance of these policies</p>
 
 
 
 Do you think it is important to read them before signing up for an account? 
 Why? 
 Why not? 
 Could they be important to you? 
 
 
 
<p>Awareness of Tools</p>
 
 
 
 Did you know there are plugins that read privacy policies? 
 If so, do you use them? 
 If you are aware of plugins and don’t use them, why don’t you use them? 
 Would you like to see a couple of these tools?
 
 If so, walk through ToS;DR (tosdr.org) and Privacy Badger (privacybadger.org) 
 Filter for people who do use them 
 Control group of people who don’t 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Trusted Opinions</p>
 
 
 
 Do you talk about legal policies with anyone? 
 Whose opinion would you trust to make a decision about whether to use a digital technology? (The following could be allowed to arise organically and then suggested: independent agency, rating service, friends, certification, etc.)

 Implementing Greenpeace International’s Web&nbsp;Strategy <p>In late 2020, WAO ran a project designed to help Greenpeace International (GPI) establish a thoughtful and targeted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vf68ZdEZBU4Zh8Tu8pn79FDfgmsH_sUP6dEr7ilpdN0/edit#heading=h.p2pc8ilo3j9d">communication strategy for its website</a>. We worked directly with the GPI Comms Department and recommended things to help accomplish GPIs website communication goals. We wrote an extensive report and now is the time to begin implementation of our own recommendations. We’ve prioritised them, sorted them into “jobs to be done”, and we’re ready to kick off off the project. Our plans for the next few months are in this&nbsp;post!</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers of&nbsp;WAO Phase 0:&nbsp;Openness <p>Essential for the success of this project is the open and collaborative approach <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open</a> is known for. We are setting up and running this project in public, and we intend to use open methodologies to help our colleagues in the communication department stay up-to-date on what the project discovers and decides. Of course we are also using open methods to make sure we can listen to the folks who are ultimately responsible for GPI’s communication. We will also hook into the community initiative of the <a href="https://medium.com/planet4">Planet 4 team</a> as well to ensure we take NRO perspectives into account when necessary.</p> Phase 1: Groundwork “Content is King, Queen, and everything in between” something Laura Hilliger said and Bryan Mathers illustrated. Image cc-by-nd Bryan Matters of&nbsp;WAO<p>The first thing we need to do is establish some baselines, research some context, and make some decisions that will scaffold the rest of the project. During the first phase we will focus on three “Jobs”: Data, Research and Engagement.</p> Data <p>One of the first priorities is a small project for a Data Analyst. Some of the recommendations from the Strategy document make the need for a data analyst&nbsp;clear.</p><blockquote>“Website content should take into account that many are coming to Greenpeace for the first time, while others know us&nbsp;well.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Increase data-informed evergreen content as part of a SEO strategy for increasing visits to Greenpeace International.”</blockquote><p>We need to be able to measure our communicative approaches so we can see what’s working and what’s not. In order to do that, we need to set some baselines, find out where we are and create or update existing data dashboards that will help us make data informed decisions in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>We’re lucky to be collaborating with Michael Wignall from <a href="https://orangetreedigital.co.uk/">Orange Tree Digital</a>. Michael will working with some of the data collection processes and outputs set up by some incredible, data savvy GPI folks to tailor data outputs for the Communication Department’s needs. He will create a robust system that pulls together data from multiple sources and displays it in a way that helps the Comms team make data-inspired decisions.</p> Research <blockquote>“The tone of the site needs to resonate with women, in a way that is inclusive and inspires engagement.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Update and consolidate pre-existing content guidelines.”</blockquote><p>To implement recommendations around audience, we need to gather best practices and pre-existing work and package it into an easy to use set of guides for the Communications Department. We know GPI has a variety of resources to pull from, so this part of the groundwork is just about streamlining the knowledge base and contextualizing it specifically for people who work on the website as well as doing some trend research.</p> Engagement <blockquote>“Create a fully fledged supporter journey for the GPI audience.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Run journey mapping initiatives within the comms department to inform communication strategy more broadly.”</blockquote><p>Finally in the Groundwork Phase, we need to tie into research around GPI audience and their journey through the Greenpeace global network. We will work with others in the Global Engagement department to create a supporter journey for the website audience.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers of&nbsp;WAO Phase 2: Production <p>Once we have looked into the data and researched and processed pre-existing materials, we should have enough context to fill in the gaps. Phase 2 will create new resources and processes that help Greenpeace staff work within the boundaries of the channel strategies.</p> Documentation <blockquote>“Create a format for campaigns that allows communications to gather input and produce suitable materials.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Develop collaborative guidelines to help NROs submit translated content.”</blockquote><p>On the back of the various bits of research, the documentation recommendations involve more creation and cataloging of resources for the Comms Department. This work will also help establish processes to help streamline collaboration between Comms staff and Greenpeacers on campaign teams and in&nbsp;NROs.</p> Marketing cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers of&nbsp;WAO<blockquote>“Make clear to staff that the strategic direction for the GPI website is to both Educate and Engage. Clearly define what “educate” and “engage” mean in the context of Greenpeace International.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Conduct awareness raising / education amongst staff to ensure a shared understanding of the Hard and Fast Rules and how they could be applied (and where they can be ignored).”</blockquote><p>This project will be run openly and collaboratively, but a degree of specific marketing will be required to help colleagues understand the ins and outs of the project. We will use a variety of tactics to socialize the project and it’s&nbsp;outputs.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers of&nbsp;WAO Facilitation <p>We will be able to communicate with intention once we’ve used data and journey mapping to clarify what our intentions actually are. The final piece of this bit of work is to help guide stakeholders in developing a project plan for content development. We also want to empower Greenpeace Communication staff to be creative!</p><p>As with any iterative project, this piece of the puzzle will become more clear once the earlier phases are complete.</p><p>👋 WAO makes sense of complex problems while spreading the benefits of open. We’re a collective of independent thinkers and makers helping charities, ethical companies, government departments and educational institutions with sensemaking and digital transformation.</p><p>Think we might be able to help you? <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/communicating-with-intention-b3017ca81f38">Communicating with Intention</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>READ OUR NEW RESEARCH REPORT<br><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Engine-Room-Digital-ID-2022.pdf">Digital IDs rooted in justice: lived experiences and civil society advocacy towards better systems [English pdf]</a>  (Bahasa and Urdu versions will be available in the coming weeks). </p>



<p>Digital ID systems can act as gatekeepers <a href="https://digitalid.theengineroom.org/">for marginalised communities’ ability to access and realise their rights</a> – and most of the time, such systems are developed and implemented without any participation or input from civil society or the communities most significantly affected by such schemes. This severely compromises the systems’ ability to serve these populations properly.</p>



<p>As more countries look towards implementing digital ID systems (such as <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-dystopian-danger-of-a-mandatory-biometric-database-in-mexico/" title="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-dystopian-danger-of-a-mandatory-biometric-database-in-mexico/">Mexico</a> and <a href="https://www.themorning.lk/digital-ids-to-finally-kick-off-in-2022/">Sri Lanka</a>, among many others), they risk replicating the same mistakes.</p>



<p>Last year, we saw how biometric-based digital ID schemes can bring potentially devastating consequences for entire populations. In Afghanistan, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/30/1033941/afghanistan-biometric-databases-us-military-40-data-points/">the Taliban took charge of biometric databases left behind by the US forces</a>, possibly endangering thousands of people who worked with the US during the 20-year occupation. In Bangladesh, biometric data collected by UNHCR from Rohingya refugees <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2021/6/21/rohingya-data-protection-and-UN-betrayal">was shared with the Myanmar government</a> – that is, those responsible for their genocide and displacement in the first place. In Pakistan, <a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/pakistan-biometrics-stateless/">stories of thousands of people rendered effectively stateless after their digital ID card was arbitrarily cancelled</a> emerged, showing how these systems can be weaponised by state power.</p>



<p>With all this in mind, in 2021 The Engine Room coordinated a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reimagining-digital-id-systems-rooted-in-justice/">research project investigating civil society advocacy on and around digital ID systems across the globe</a>, supported by Open Society Foundations and in partnership with <a href="https://elsam.or.id/id/">ELSAM</a> in Indonesia and <a href="https://pollicy.org/">Pollicy</a> in Uganda. The research looked at how organised civil society actors are seeking to shape the design, implementation, and oversight of digital ID systems so as to eliminate harms to vulnerable populations. With the goal of understanding how justice-based systems might be achieved, we analysed existing digital ID advocacy strategies in four countries – Indonesia, Jamaica, Pakistan, and Uganda.</p>



<p>Many learnings emerged from this research, and it is worth highlighting the following:</p>



  Many digital ID systems are shrouded in secrecy and in need of myth-busting. Digital ID systems are complex and often lack transparency, and inaccurate claims are often made regarding what digital ID systems can and can’t do – sometimes perpetuated by governments themselves. If civil society organisations are to advocate successfully for changes to systems, they must first understand the existing systems.<br>  Civil society is currently driven to act reactively, rather than proactively. Groups find themselves pushing for change within problematic proposals and systems, rather than being able to proactively advocate for a system that could meet the needs their communities actually face.<br>  Large international organisations are playing a key role in instigating and shaping advocacy. While they can provide valuable assistance to local civil society organisations in helping them to articulate concerns and organise activities, it can be tricky to navigate contexts where the international and local organisations have different ideas. If the international organisations lack members with knowledge of the local context, or fail to include such individuals in their processes, they risk orienting their advocacy work towards targets that do not fit with local organisations’ actual priorities.<br>  Litigation has been a valuable resource across all contexts researched, whether focused on specific aspects of a system or seeking to impede the overall implementation of a system.<br>  Engaging with digital ID systems’ technical specifications is often considered by grassroots organisations as being out of the scope of digital ID advocacy. We observe relatively little advocacy by grassroots social justice organisations that focuses on the technical elements of digital ID; this fact is probably attributable to the prevailing lack of transparency, along with the relatively high degree of technical sophistication needed to understand the options available and the likely ramifications of such details.

 Introduction 



<p>Europe’s Data Governance Act (DGA) reached a milestone. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/11/30/promoting-data-sharing-presidency-reaches-deal-with-parliament-on-data-governance-act/">European Parliament announced</a>&nbsp;it “…reached a provisional agreement on a new law to promote the availability of data and build a trustworthy environment to facilitate its use for research and the creation of innovative new services and products.”</p>



<p>What does the Data Governance Act mean to the ToIP framework and the SSI community?</p>



 Background 



<p>The DGA defines an “intermediary” that facilitates processing and sharing of data for individuals and organizations to “…increase trust in data intermediation services and foster data altruism across the EU”. In the&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData</a>&nbsp;framework for user-controlled data sharing, intermediaries are called&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/">MyData Operators</a>&nbsp;and there is a certification program in place. (See references at the end of this blog post.)</p>



<p>The DGA intermediary has a trusting relationship with the individual. There cannot be any conflict of interest in sharing the data from the individual. In the eyes of the Act, the sharing of the data shall foster “<a href="https://eudatasharing.eu/news/digital-governance-act-proposes-sharing-data-public-good-and-selflessness-concept-data">data altruism</a>” across the EU.</p>



<p>To achieve this goal, DGA provisions a certification program and rules for some public-sector data.</p>



 SSI Data Sharing Models 



<p>The Data Governance Act introduces new roles into data sharing and will set up the necessary governance for a more transparent and accountable data economy. Two main actors are introduced called Data Sharing Service or Intermediaries [refer to chapter III, Requirements Applicable to Data Sharing Service in&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0767">Data Governance Act</a>] and Data Altruistic Organizations [refer to chapter IV, Data Altruistic in same reference].</p>



<p>Neither of these actors shall have a financial incentive that conflicts with representing a Data Subject when personal data is made available to Third-parties or Data Using Service. The following diagram has three SSI data sharing models.</p>



<p>A business or organization collects personal data and shares it with a third-party often in proprietary and closed interfaces. A non-proprietary health care data exchange interface is&nbsp;<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/">FHIR</a>&nbsp;from HL7 which created an open interoperable standard.</p>



<p>A cooperative or intermediary represents the individual when sharing personal data. The sharing shall be standardized and interoperable between different suppliers.</p>



<p>A non-profit organization, acting altruistically, facilitates sharing of data that are in the public institution’s domain. The public institutions may, for example, be health care systems.</p>



Figure 1: Data Governance Act Architecture Overview



<p>Some similarities can be drawn with the Verifiable Credential model where the Data Subject is a Holder, an organization is the Issuer and a third-party is a Verifier.</p>



 The DGA adds intermediaries to the ToIP framework 



<p>The key difference is addition of the Intermediary. The Intermediary represents an agent for the Holder (Data Subject) which has direct control of processing of personal data through a policy engine. Figure 1 shows the ToIP framework with the actors introduced in the Data Governance Act.</p>



Figure 2: ToIP control and data planes overview



<p>Two layers or paths when performing data exchange are described in the diagram.</p>



  A data path (yellow arrows) composed of Verified Credentials (VCs) and interfaces to a data repository.  A control path (green arrows) that sets the conditions for personal data usage, given through a data subject consenting to collecting, processing or sharing of personal data.  



<p>Each actor in the diagram has three different role types: a data role, a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) role, and a privacy role.</p>



  The data role represents Data Subject who the collected data relates to, the Data Source that collects the data, the Data Sharing Service that processes the data prior to sharing the data, and Data Using Service which provides services based on the shared data.  In addition to the standard DLT roles an additional role called Intermediary is introduced. As described before, the Intermediary facilitates the processing of data on behalf of the Data Subject prior to sharing with a third party.  The privacy roles are the standard Data Controller/Processor, Data Subject, and Third-party. To better understand the Data Subject, it is split into two, a client and an agent. The Data Subject has direct control via the Client. The Agent allows the Data Subject to delegate control to the Agent (as a proxy).  



<p>The final aspect to understand are the key functions to enable the Intermediary to act on behalf of the Data Subject. The Intermediary requires a privacy function that applies the transformation and the privacy control selected by the Data Subject. For example the Data Subject may give consent to processing anonymized personal data that would be controlled by the privacy engine. The storage function may be in a wallet or a pseudonymized database with restricted access.</p>



 Summary 



<p>While it may look like most of the work in ToIP relate to VC’s, there is also the work from Inputs and Semantics work group that look at standardizing the storage, portability of the personal data, and creating a layered schema that helps with setting the policy engine when preparing and sharing of the data.</p>



<p>The Data Governance Act can be supported based on the technology being promoted in ToIP Working Groups. The work underway in ToIP Working Groups are aligned with the specific requirements of the Data Governance Act. Both ToIP and the DGA are avoiding a pervasive data ecosystem that promotes the surveillance economy. We both put a data exchange with humans at the center of any data transfer.</p>



<p>A future blog post will look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">Digital Markets Act</a>&nbsp;in relation to ToIP. When an organization exceeds a threshold of users and net income, they are required to adhere to the rules of a Gateway stipulated by the Digital Markets Act. More in the next post.</p>

  Rothex: traceability of eggs has never been easier than with GS1 standards
guilherme.alme…

             <p>Rothex is an Argentinian company that produces, packages and distributes eggs. The company wanted to develop a significantly improved traceability system for its storage and distribution processes. Yet, a major challenge was how to determine the batch size. Since many farms supply Rothex with eggs, they tend to be in heterogeneous quantities that generate a mixed distribution of eggs in differently-sized trays.</p>

<p>To solve this issue and improve its stock handling system, Rothex turned to GS1 standards to help track and trace its egg products. Now, the Rothex traceability system leverages GS1 standards to uniquely identify the eggs by lot/farm and pallet. Each pallet of multiple lots of eggs is identified with a GS1 Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) that in encoded with the lot identifiers in a GS1-128 barcode. By scanning the barcode, the company can easily identify the different lots or farms from which the eggs came.</p>

<p>Rothex has realised multiple benefits from its new traceability system. For example, the company has lowered administration costs due to reduced time associated with searching for information. They can also easily locate egg products with an improved stock management system. With the exchange and integration of knowledge during the traceability project, global teamwork has resulted with a new work culture and ways of working together.</p>

  QUHOMAtrace is a unique combination of IoT and traceability data for upstream visibility in agri-food

             <p>Farms, cooperatives and other agri-food businesses want to create a competitive advantage by addressing consumers’ needs for easy accessibility to valuable information about their crops and food. Yet, there was no single solution that traced the exact location and climate conditions of crops’ cultivation—while also linking crops to the final products eaten by consumers.</p>

<p>QUHOMAtrace from Future Intelligence, an IoT provider, and GS1 data sharing standards have addressed this need for traceability. The QUHOMAtrace platform is designed as an innovative integrator of entity-based registries (e.g., IoT data) and event-based information (e.g., data produced from traceability applications). GS1 EPC (Electronic Product Code)-enabled standards provide the needed foundation for the identification of farm plots, each crop’s batch/lots, and sensors associated with the farm plots and crops, enabling the traceability of crops from farm to fork. Farming visibility events are captured and stored as interoperable, GS1-standardised EPC Information Services (EPCIS) event data.</p>

<p>For the harvested product, information on events prior to a crop’s harvest is now available, such as when it was planted, how it was treated and information from sensors. Farmers can now communicate with their procurers, buyers and/or consumers every detail that happens in the field. They can receive customised advice on the use of a product, how to lower the cost of an external quality inspection, or even how to increase consumer trust and loyalty.</p>

<p>Farmers can also get aggregated data that helps them determine which farm practices can increase a field’s capacity to produce quality crops and food. It can provide the needed justification of a farmer’s environmental decision since this data proves the necessity of certain farm practices, such as irrigation and spraying performance, insecticides applied and more.</p>

  Hungast Group: innovative solutions for consumer safety in foodservice

             <p>In September 2015, the 37/2014 (IV.30), the Ministry of Human Resources’ (EMMI) regulation, took effect in Hungary that outlines catering, nutrition and health principles for implementation by mass catering companies and mass caterers when providing dietary food.</p>

<p>To comply with regulatory and consumer demands, Hungast Group turned to GS1 Hungary to help build this traceability system based on GS1 global standards. Now, on every reusable dietbox, there is a unique GS1 product identifier encoded in a GS1 DataMatrix barcode that globally identifies the specific food in the box, the institute and the type of consumer it will be delivered to. By scanning the GS1 DataMatrix barcode, Hungast Group has access to real-time information that has helped it increase efficiencies in preparation, cooking and logistics processes.</p>

<p>With improved processes, Hungast Group can now provide individual-specific diets so that all consumer demands are fulfilled, resulting in 100% accuracy in dietetic foods. The company’s new, two-step verification system has helped the commissioning staff, so that the risk of multiple errors and the amount of time spent has decreased. With this, working has become easier for colleagues, improving productivity.</p>

<p>Before the traceability system, one third of dietboxes had to be removed from the catering system and made up every 6 months. Hungast’s new GS1 standards-based solution has eliminated the need to do this and provides full transparency.</p>

             <p>Airfield Estate, a charitable trust and working farm, is designed to facilitate active learning focused on food, farming and the land. A complete farm-to-consumer experience has been created that educates the public at all stages of the food journey, linking healthy soils to animals and plants and food production. To support its mission, the farm wanted to provide accessible product data to consumers, enabling them to be more informed about its milk product.</p>

<p>To increase the transparency of milk’s journey, Airfield Estate implemented cow-to-consumer traceability and advanced labelling throughout its milk production process. The farm implemented GS1 standards and fTRACE, a cloud-based solution for batch-specific product traceability, on its milk labels.</p>

<p>Intelligent barcodes are used on Airfield’s milk labels that encode production information and fTRACE-provided traceability data in a closed loop production and sales environment. An fTRACE URL is embedded in a QR code, displaying the milk’s traceability data to consumers and linking directly to the fTRACE website and data source. A GS1 two-dimensional (2D) DataMatrix barcode is included for closed-loop proof of concept, which incorporates food waste and product recall.</p>

<p>This data gives Airfield Estate the ability to display and educate stakeholders on the implementation of full supply chain traceability and smart barcode data—all in one location. The traceability solution has also helped Airfield improve stock management and prevent food waste with the use of expiry dates. With the scan of the QR code on the intelligent label, consumers are better informed. And, with data provided with the scan of the DataMatrix barcode, Airfield can execute faster product recalls, if needed, increasing consumer safety.</p>

  IPC/Subway delivers the promise of end-to-end traceability throughout the Subway system

Thu, 01/13/2022 - 10:00



 
             <p>Independent Purchasing Cooperative (IPC), a Subway® Franchisee-owned company, is responsible for the supply chain processes for the more than 43,000 Subway restaurants globally. IPC needed a system to enable full supply chain visibility to optimise its operations. The Cooperative was focused on ensuring food safety for Subway guests and finding business efficiencies that end-to-end traceability would bring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve this challenging initiative, IPC developed a strategy for getting all of its suppliers and distributors on board. The company collaborated with its supply chain partners to implement GS1 standards for quality data to meet the information transparency needs of its restaurants and consumers alike. Today, suppliers and distributors use GS1 standards to uniquely identify their products and locations as well as exchange product information through the Global Data Synchronisation Network™ (GDSN®). Subway Franchise Owners use a specialised app to capture and use product data at restaurants for the benefit of their operations and customers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>IPC has been able to quantify US $1.3 million in annual cost avoidance by maximising truckload capacity based on accurate product data enabled by GS1 standards. In addition, standardised product data drives operational efficiencies, reduces supply chain costs, and saves time and labour. By using quality product data, Subway restaurants can improve their inventory management and ensure enhanced food safety practices with faster and more precise responses to product recalls and withdrawals. IPC and its independently owned Subway restaurants are looking to further differentiate and enhance consumers’ experiences with customised offers and other innovative approaches to supply chain management.</p>

 Our January co-op&nbsp;day <p>As usual, <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open</a> had our monthly co-op day (or co-op morning, to be more precise). As we head into 2022 we’re continuing to change and evolve as an organisation.</p><p>This month we talked about everything from whether text should go inside or outside a digital badge through to structural changes we’d need to make to the co-op should we go after funding for some of our ideas. That’s how it goes when you co-own a business with your&nbsp;friends…</p>Strategic Starfish activity from November&nbsp;2021<p>In recent co-op days we’ve run a ‘Strategic Starfish’ activity, something which will appear on the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/knowledge-pool/tools/">tools and approaches</a> part of our Learn with WAO site. This time around, we just looked at the output from November, considered what’s changed, and reminded ourselves of some stuff we wanted to start doing (and some things we want to stop&nbsp;doing!)</p><p>As we’ve got into the habit of scheduling co-working sessions for our ongoing projects, our co-op days are increasingly operational in focus. This time around we had three things we wanted to get&nbsp;sorted:</p>  Ensuring better use of our internal Trello&nbsp;boards  Finalising the badges to be issued to our&nbsp;intern  Running a proposal about whether to pursue grant-funding   1. Ensuring better use of our internal Trello&nbsp;boards <p>While we’ve tried a number of different ways of organising both or internal and client-facing projects, we keep coming back to <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a>. There are definite advantages to using a dedicated tracking system such as <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> for products, but for anything more lightweight, Trello is super-flexible.</p><p>Ironically, we end up being more disciplined with our client-facing Trello boards — especially those that are open and publicly-accessible — than our internal ones. This co-op day was therefore a good time to ensure we practise what we&nbsp;preach.</p>A snapshot of WAO’s BizMgmt Trello&nbsp;board<p>Just as mesmerising murmurations of starlings result from <a href="https://theconversation.com/starling-murmurations-the-science-behind-one-of-natures-greatest-displays-110951#:~:text=These%20%E2%80%9Cboids%E2%80%9D%2C%20as%20Reynolds,distant%20birds%20would%20move%20closer.">three simple rules</a>, so effective use of Trello results from following three simple guidelines:</p>  Add contextual information to a separate&nbsp;list  Cards progress across the board from left to&nbsp;right  Cards in the ‘Doing’ list should have an assignee and due&nbsp;date  <p>There are other, bonus things to do like @-mentioning people, using checklists, and adding tags, but in our experience the above three guidelines get to the heart of working more productively.</p> 2. Finalising the badges to be issued to our&nbsp;intern <p>WAO’s first-ever intern, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/hello-world-6b5c8caed8db">Anne</a>, has been due some badges for a few months now. We mentioned these in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/designing-badges-for-co-creation-and-recognition-62fd06fd5636">previous blog post</a>, with the blocker being the final badge&nbsp;design.</p><p>The shape of the badges reflect the triangular ‘A’ and the ‘O’ in the WAO wordmark, and the colours align with our <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/guidelines/brand">brand guidelines</a>. The icons are openly licensed from the <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">Noun&nbsp;Project</a>.</p><p>This co-op day was an opportunity to finalise these, with the main points of debate being whether the text goes inside or outside the badge, and whether or not the WAO logo adds anything to the badge&nbsp;design.</p> 3. Running a proposal about whether to pursue grant-funding <p>WAO members very much enjoyed running <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/search?q=catalyst">several Catalyst-funded projects</a> in 2020 and 2021 and so towards the end of last year we considered specifically setting ourselves up to work with&nbsp;funders.</p><p>To that end, we explored some possibilities with <a href="https://www.workingwithjoe.co.uk/">Joe Roberson</a>, who helped us think through the benefits and drawbacks, and introduced us to four funders potentially open to working with&nbsp;us.</p><p>All four funders responded to our enquiries, with two saying we’d be technically eligible and other two saying we’d not only be eligible but they’d welcome our application(s).</p><p>Although we enjoyed working with Joe, the proposal we ran during today’s co-op day made us realise that our Catalyst work was at arms-length from the actual funder (The National Lottery). We’d have to change fundamentally as an organisation and take our eye off client work. That’s not what we want to do right now. We decided that we would revisit the idea of grant funding when we have an idea that we can’t build without foundational support.</p><p>The last thing we did in the 3.5 hours that constituted this month’s co-op day was recording some content for our first podcast episode of Season 3. We’ve got a number of interesting guests lined up, but we thought it was appropriate to kick things off for the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/podcast">Tao of WAO</a> in 2022 with an episode featuring our members (and&nbsp;intern!)</p><p>Once Laura and I have top-and-tailed it, the episode will cover our predictions and things we’re looking forward to this year, as well as a discussion about going ‘dormant’ as a co-op member. We’ve got one member just coming back from dormancy (John) and one about to enter a period of dormancy (Bryan) so we thought we’d take the time to explain what it is, how it works, and why it’s beneficial.</p><p>2022 is looking like a busy year already, so our regularly-scheduled co-op days are a great way to ensure that we continue to be <a href="https://thoughtshrapnel.com/2020/01/20/management-emotional-intelligence/">“self-organising ducks”</a> and continue to succeed on all&nbsp;fronts.</p><p>👋 WAO makes sense of complex problems while spreading the benefits of open. We’re a collective of independent thinkers and makers helping charities, ethical companies, government departments and educational institutions with sensemaking and digital transformation.</p><p>Think we might be able to help you? <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wao-in-2022-83ab42615399">WAO in 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Can you briefly describe the goal of the ASDI and your role within it?</p>
<p>Data is core to addressing the climate crisis, but too much of the required data is dispersed in different sources, available in different formats, exposed through different tools, and requires different levels of technical expertise to analyze it. All of these factors present challenges to analyzing sustainability data efficiently and effectively extracting the knowledge from it that drives decisions and policy. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/collab/asdi/">Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)</a> is a tech-for-good program that seeks to significantly reduce the cost, time and technical barriers associated with analyzing large datasets to generate sustainability insights. One of our core efforts is around democratization of data, making foundational datasets available to anyone, powered by the Amazon Web Services cloud. ASDI supports innovators and researchers around the world by providing them with the data, tools and technical expertise they need to move sustainability research and analysis to the next level. </p>
<p>Why has ASDI partnered with GLEIF and OS-Climate, and what role does ASDI play in the partnership?</p>
<p>This collaboration is a wonderful example of how ASDI can help complement the work of other key players in the climate space. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) data is critical to helping businesses assess the climate change-related risks of their investments. Having this type of information next to other foundational datasets in the cloud, together with access to computational capabilities, can help us streamline the risk assessment process. </p>
<p>In this collaboration, GLEIF retains complete control and ownership of the data in the AWS cloud, but all costs related to data storage and egress are covered by the ASDI program. GLEIF commits to managing the data and also making it openly available to anyone. Groups like OS-Climate, Allianz and BNP Paribas are then able to access the LEI dataset on the AWS cloud and use it more effectively to get better insights into the transitional and physical climate risks of their financial investments. </p>
<p>What is the benefit of having LEI datasets publicly available in the cloud via ASDI’s data catalog?</p>
<p>By storing climate-related datasets in the cloud, we are accelerating innovation by minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze these datasets, some of which are in the terabyte and petabyte scale and otherwise not accessible to most. The LEI data is collocated with petabytes of these foundational data assets and can more easily be integrated in the analysis process. Other datasets available to users include climate projections, historical weather records, satellite observations and more.</p>
<p>ASDI continues to expand its <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/collab/asdi/">data catalog</a> in response to the needs of the sustainability community. By hosting the LEI data on AWS and creating a direct connection between GLEIF’s servers and the AWS S3 bucket, we are able to provide LEI updates every eight hours, making this piece of information available to anyone around the world in a timely manner. </p>
<p>How can verifiable identities enhance global sustainability data and improve the evaluation of climate finance risk and opportunities?</p>
<p>LEIs connect to key reference information that enables clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in transactions. Each LEI contains information about an entity’s ownership structure and thus answers the questions of <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/access-and-use-lei-data/level-1-data-who-is-who">'who is who’</a> and <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/access-and-use-lei-data/level-2-data-who-owns-whom">‘who owns whom’</a>. This enhances transparency in the global marketplace and allows investors to more easily assess how responsible, from a sustainability perspective, different assets in a given portfolio are. By expanding access to this dataset, businesses and entities around the world can more easily make better-informed decisions about their investments. </p>
<p>How will the partnership accelerate research and innovation for sustainability and climate-aligned finance?</p>
<p>Removing barriers to access and use of foundational datasets will minimize the time and effort associated with its analysis, and accelerate data-to-knowledge pathways. For example, financial services company Allianz is specifically using LEI data to help predict the impact climate change may have on the insurance business, and to help expand the company’s asset management portfolio to include more environmentally friendly and sustainable projects and causes. BNP Paribas, as another example, is using the data to build an open-source entity-matching service which will greatly democratize the creation of climate-aligned analysis.</p>

<p>Since the pandemic began, many social justice organisations and activists have increased their reliance on digital technologies, which has brought many challenges. Organisations have had to develop new ways of working, reshape programmes, support staff and communities and protect themselves against digital attacks. With support from <a href="https://www.sigrid-rausing-trust.org/">Sigrid Rausing Trust</a>, we are deepening our support to organisations who are going through digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of this, we invite activists, collectives and movements – particularly those who serve marginalised communities – that are facing challenges incorporating technologies in their work to reach out to us for pro bono light touch support!</p>



 Covid-19: the digital divides have deepened and social justice organisations are still facing a digital emergency 



<p>Our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/strengthening-intersectional-approaches-to-covid-19-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/">research on intersections of social justice and data and digital rights</a> found that going through a digital transformation during a global pandemic has affected the workflow of civil society organisations and influenced their ability — or inability — to reach the communities they serve. During our interviews, we found that for many organisations:</p>



  it has been harder to engage with the communities they serve, especially migrants, refugees and the elderly from marginalised communities;  there have been difficulties working remotely during lockdowns, due to inequalities in access to connectivity, to digital technology and general infrastructure needed to transition to remote work;&nbsp;  the quick transition to remote work in a resource-constrained environment acted as an obstacle to the selection of context-relevant, justice-based tech tools.&nbsp;  



<p>Practitioners highlighted a lack of resources for moving their work to a remote setting or implementing responsible data practices or digital security protocols, not to mention addressing staff burnout. Across all four regions of our research, but especially in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, many examples were shared about how the lack of resources for transitioning to remote work or adopting safer digital practices negatively affected social justice organisations and their ability to respond to crises. These crises included both geopolitical ones (e.g. military occupation and government repression) and increasing digital and physical attacks on activists.</p>



 Get support from us! 



<p>In light of this digital transition, we are providing pro-bono, hands-on tech &amp; data support to social justice groups going through digital transformations, as part of our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Light Touch Support programme</a>. If you’ve been dealing with the challenges related to digital technologies in your social justice work, we can support you. <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Reach out to us and schedule a call</a>!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our support may include:</p>



  Redesigning or tweaking your existing workflows to better address your needs and the needs of the communities you’re working with using tech and data in effective, responsible and strategic ways, helping to adapt offline services to the online sphere or hybrid formats.  Responsible data: Adapting responsible data considerations to existing and new projects, and more, developing and implementing an organisational <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">Responsible Data</a> Policy and/or a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/">RAD</a> (data retention, archiving and disposal) Policy.&nbsp;  Tool selection: Choosing tools that are aligned with your political values, learning how to adopt a justice-focused approach in selecting tools and systems for your work (such as an email server, internal communications tools, video conferencing tool, and more), making connections to open source infrastructure providers to transform operations, and developing technical intuition to better navigate the tech tools landscape.  Organisational security: Providing recommendations for secure digital communication and data storage considering your specific context, identifying tools that are accessible and that don’t pose privacy threats, getting guidance on digital care for activists and general capacity building around organisational security practices.  



 More to come! 



<p>As part of this project, we plan on sharing what we learn about navigating the challenges of digital transformation. Keep an eye on this blog if you’re interested or reach out to hello[at]theengineroom.org.</p>

  Many policymakers have been interested in protecting children’s privacy and expanding COPPA. Recently, Me2BA alongside a coalition of advocacy groups endorsed Representative Castor’s Kids PRIVCY ACT. We're proud to support this bill, but we urge members in Congress to address non-profit carve outs in data privacy laws.

<p>For several years, Democrats and Republicans have worked to <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-hawley-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-update-childrens-online-privacy-rules">reform COPPA</a>, both in Congress and at the state level.</p>
<p>Recently, Me2BA alongside a coalition of advocacy groups <a href="https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/RepCastorLetter.pdf">endorsed</a> Representative Castor’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4801/text#H0F0567F4AC5847D3931CA37661F6CD44">Kids PRIVCY ACT,</a> which is the ongoing effort in the House to reform COPPA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re proud to support a bill that will:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Strengthen the legal protections afforded to children under COPPA, and extend COPPA protections to adolescents ages 13 to 17, who have long gone without privacy protections online, while creating new rights for families.&nbsp; 
  Prohibit surveillance advertising and other harmful uses of data on all digital services likely to be accessed by children, rather than limiting protection to ineffectual notice and consent on “child-directed sites.”&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-4-me2b-alliance-product-testing-report-deeper-look-at-k-12-school-utility-apps-uncovers-global-advertising-company-from-cbs-viacom-unexpected-security-risks/">Note our recent research on behavioral advertising in K12 school utility apps</a>, which raises deep questions about corporate data mining of kids for profit.&nbsp;</p>
 
  Incorporate key elements of the UK’s groundbreaking Age-Appropriate Design Code, requiring companies to consider the best interests of young people when designing their platforms, and to conduct risk assessments to determine potential harms to children and teens. 
 
<p>However, Me2BA does not support the long-standing non-profit carve outs in data privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We urge members of congress to follow GDPR’s lead and draft legislation that does not include data broker loopholes for non-profit organizations. Note that the Kids PRIVCY Act was not attempting to establish a new carve out, but it fails to close existing non-profit carve outs by adopting a prior definition of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4801/text#H0F0567F4AC5847D3931CA37661F6CD44">covered entity</a> that essentially exempts most non-profits under the broad exemptions under Sections 4 and 5 of the FTC Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Policymakers should acknowledge that if they continue to allow non-profit carve outs, they are not solving the actual issue at hand. Would it be just to allow non-profit data brokers to get a free pass? Many political non-profit data brokers are known to purposefully attempt to create nationwide voter files– are they exempt under the current carve outs?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that reforming COPPA and the FTC Act to ensure that non-profit data brokers operate under the same rules as for-profit data brokers will not be an easy feat, yet we remain hopeful that policymakers will address non-profit carve outs in data privacy laws. We will continue to advocate for the safe and respectful treatment of people by technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Me2BA grows, we anticipate that we will be asked to participate in more advocacy campaigns and letters. We take this seriously and value transparency. Accordingly, our Policy and Legal Working Group is creating a checklist to standardize our approval process for sign-on letters. What do you think should be on our advocacy endorsement checklist? Send us your suggestions at <a href="mailto:feedback@me2ba.org">feedback@me2ba.org.</a>&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>The concept of SSI was designed with the citizen and privacy in mind. However, existing implementations lack user-friendliness (e.g. showing hash codes to users), creating potential barriers in users’ adoption. OnboardSSI focuses on providing a secure and user-friendly wallet solution creating an easier way for citizens to manage their identity. OnboardSSI will leverage AI to remotely verify users’ identity, without human validator intervention, and creating verifiable credentials. </p>
<p>End-users will perform a 3-step identity verification including scanning of proof-of-identity (e.g. passport), person cross-check through liveness detection, facial matching, and document validation, reaching High Level of Assurance based on eIDAS regulation. OnboardSSI will provide the appropriate abstraction for citizens to easily manage their credentials. Finally, Quadible’s AI continuous behavioural authentication, will secure the credentials, by combining 14 different behavioural and biometric traits.</p>

				 <p>The SSI mandate service is a generic and holistic approach to provide and request mandates. Mandates are SSI credentials signed by the dependent that can be requested by either the dependent or authorized representative. These credentials can be used to prove to a verifier that the authorized representative is authorized to act for specific actions on behalf of the dependent.</p>
<p>The mandate credentials are stored in the wallet of the authorized representative as opposed to a central database in current systems. The dependent can revoke this credential at any point in time if he/she no longer wants the authorized representative to act on their behalf by updating a revocation hash on the blockchain. The SSI mandate provides mandates completely peer to peer and isn’t limited to individuals only. A SSI wallet can also represent a device or institution, for example a company can use a SSI company wallet to authorize employee’s to access the building or use the company credit card up to a certain amount.</p>

				 <p>One of the things people enjoy the most about the internet, is that it enables them to talk to others remotely almost without limit.<br>Unfortunately, remotely often means that parties are not sure who they are communicating with. Think of the epidemic of robocalls and prank calls the telecoms industry has been battling for years, or you yourself simply trying to videoconference with your bank: the absence of an identity layer can be a huge problem. Adding SSI to internet communications resulting in seamless identified communications is the solution to this problem. It enables people engaging in any form of internet communication to exchange presentation requests and proofs, and communicate at the same time.</p>
<p>Mixing two protocols<br>Dedicated to identified communications, Dutch startup and initiator of the SSIComms project Bloqzone (bloqzone.com) has built several solutions to this problem in the past using more standard local identity solutions such as DIGID and IDIN. Unfortunately, these sofar tended to result in a somewhat awkward customer experience since the enduser has to switch between multiple applications during one session.<br>A more thorough approach is therefore needed where not only one application is able to handle both communications sessions and identity sessions, but also where both communications and SSI protocols are interwoven.</p>
<p>The SSIComms project<br>The project SSIComms adds SSI to internet communications by adding SSI wallets to the renowned SYLK Suite, an award winning ensemble of communications solutions with the SIP protocol at its core. This enables users to respond to presentation requests for credentials entirely voluntarily and according to SSI principles during communications sessions.<br>The solution is designed to function within an SSI ecosystem and conform to all its principles by extending the SIP protocol to accommodate identified communications and by linking governance-as-code to the implementation to ensure the rules (as much as possible) are enforced in the source code.<br>The use cases include identification before and during session, the principle of verify the verifier, and exchange of payment tokens during sessions.<br>The resulting source code will be available open source and offer developers the opportunity to integrate their own wallets with the enhanced Sylk Suite react native client.</p>

In our last round of Matchbox, for example, we supported the Legal Advisory Information Center (LAIC) in South Africa to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/responsible-data-and-sustainable-platform-adoption-with-legal-advisory-information-center/">adopt responsible data practices and transition to a sustainable platform</a> to manage their land tenure cases, and assisted Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS) in Argentina to<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/using-uwazi-to-build-a-database-documenting-institutional-violence/"> reconceptualise their database documenting cases of institutional violence</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/revamping-our-intensive-tech--data-support/" title="https://www.theengineroom.org/revamping-our-intensive-tech--data-support/">revamped the Matchbox programme</a> to make room for even more flexibility and more organic relationship-building with our partners, and to enhance the quality of our support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, partners were selected through an open call and selection process. Our new approach is designed to deepen relationships and solidarity with our Matchbox partners by working with potential partners in non-intensive ways first, through our Light-Touch Support programme (LiTS). Ideally, this new approach will give our potential partners more opportunities and agency to identify their own needs, allowing support to develop more organically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our new process for Matchbox partnerships looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>After your organisation has <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">engaged with our Light Touch Support</a> multiple times and it seems like you and your work might be a good potential fit for more intensive, Matchbox-style support, we propose an exploratory call to discuss Matchbox-partnership possibilities:</p>



  During the call, we’ll share more information about our Matchbox support offer and have some discussion around whether this is the right time to deepen our collaboration. If, after the call, both you and our team assess that a Matchbox partnership has the potential to be successful, we’ll send you a survey to get a more detailed understanding of your support needs  The survey will be followed by a clarifying discussion between your team and ours.  We then work together to prioritise support areas and design a work plan to implement over 6-8 months.&nbsp;  



<p>If your organisation** is interested in getting support from The Engine Room, please <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a Light Touch Support call</a> with us!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bring a current tech- or data-related challenge you’re grappling with, and we’ll tackle it together. Through the LiTS process, you’ll be able to get a better sense of how our support works and what it entails,&nbsp; assess if this type of collaboration works for your organisation, and meet some of our team members.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>**Our LiTS and Matchbox support is primarily offered to groups with limited resources, particularly those based in Africa and Latin America,&nbsp; whose work confronts power imbalances, injustice and rights abuses in a given social context.</p>The post <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-can-your-organisation-get-intensive-support-from-the-engine-room/">How can your organisation get intensive support from The Engine Room?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org">The Engine Room</a>.

   From 2022, we’ll be running our Matchbox programme a little differently. After months of research and reflection, we have decided to make our Light Touch Support programme (LiTS) the primary way through which we select Matchbox partnerships.

<p>The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/">Matchbox programme</a> provides direct, intensive support to social justice organisations from resource-constrained backgrounds who are interested in using technology and data to strengthen their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since Matchbox was launched in 2014, we’ve been partnering with organisations via an open call and subsequent <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/our-matchbox-learnings-from-partner-selection-to-matchmaking/">selection process</a>, guided by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uF2fIbFJ4JBNfEwOT0WpftXVeXqqTBuB8TfF6nqHZY4/edit#gid=1192898981">criteria</a> developed to help us find initiatives that would be a good fit. Over the years, we’ve grown <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vzVl-xb1wji_KRFyI6k2gfq4d7RsJyymdNBiv7vr8Hk/edit#gid=0">our matchmaking skills</a> and supported <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/">a number of partners in Latin America and Sub Saharan Africa.</a> Our core Matchbox support team continues to be based in these two regions, and have themselves worked within local social movements and civil society organisations.</p>



<p>From 2022, we’ll be running our Matchbox programme a little differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inspired by learnings from <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Tipping-the-scales-The-Engine-Room.pdf">our recent research on equity in funding</a>, we are moving towards a new selection process. After months of research and reflection, we have decided to make our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Light Touch Support programme</a> (LiTS) the primary way through which we select Matchbox partnerships. Our LiTS programme provides lightweight support to organisations and individuals working towards social justice, who have questions about using data or technology in their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 2022, we will do away with the open call selection process (which can be labour- and resource-intensive for organisations who apply) and instead invite Matchbox applications from organisations who have already engaged with our LiTS programme beforehand. We believe that this will allow us to deepen our connections with organisations more organically, build partnerships in non-extractive and non-exploitative ways, and ensure our partners’ time and resources are well applied.</p>



 What’s changed?&nbsp; 



  Growing our relationships and support offers organically: Instead of committing to long-term partnerships with organisations we meet through a selection process, we are now keen to start small (through LiTS) and develop our collaboration with organisations more organically, taking more time to become familiar with each other and ensure that our way of providing direct targeted advice is something that resonates with our partners.  More time spent supporting organisations: Open calls involve an extensive selection process that demands a lot of work from everyone involved. The process can be a strain on organisations – especially during the pandemic – and also on our own team, since we’re only able to support a handful of partners intensively at a time. By growing our connections with former LiTS partners instead, we spend more time on relationship building, project design and support provision.  Growing more equitable partnerships: As with any relationship, it usually takes a while for us and our partners to&nbsp; get to know each other: our areas of focus and expertise, our workflows and working styles, our commonalities and differences. Letting organisations know that they can now request more intensive support, and mutually engaging in assessing if, how, and when that is appropriate, reinforces a more equitable approach to partnership, grounding the growth of our support in trust, honesty and solidarity.&nbsp;  Increased flexibility: The open call process tied us to a particular application window; we will now instead be able to offer support to organisations along a more organic timeline. Trust helps us to hold space for honest conversations where partners have room to engage with us at the most appropriate and opportune moments for them, allowing us to provide support that is responsive to shifting organisational contexts, capacities, resources and needs.&nbsp;  Shorter timeline: We used to take on a sizable project to work on with our partners for around 12-18 months; Matchbox partnerships will now take place&nbsp; over 6-8 months. The more contained timeline requires us to really prioritise what’s needed most, and to embark on it incrementally.  



 New processes = new challenges&nbsp; 



<p>This is a new format, and we’ll need to learn and refine the programme accordingly as we go. We’ll need to figure out things like how to best navigate shifting numbers of partnerships, and&nbsp; how to best manage a more demand-driven level of support (in terms of our matching our internal resources to changing levels of demand).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll also need to keep an eye on who might not know about us, in order to ensure that we continue to have a diverse pool of partners. This means actively promoting our LiTS support in spaces more accessible to those who tend to be excluded from tech and data spaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On that note, if you are working in a social justice context and have questions or ideas related to using tech and data in your work, we’d like to invite you to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a LiTS call with us (</a>or to please share our LiTS programme with partners you think might be a good fit!).</p>



<p><br>We are also eager to hear your thoughts, concerns, advice, experiences, questions, and ideas around our new approach – feel free to reach out to us at joshua[at]theengineroom.org.</p>The post <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/revamping-our-intensive-tech-data-support/">Revamping our intensive tech &amp; data support</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org">The Engine Room</a>.

<p>Being a support organisation, our work is focused on strengthening civil society organisations through their use of data and technology. We support organisations in the process of considering the privacy, security and ethical implications of organisational practices around technology both in everyday and strategic decisions. We are thrilled to be partnering with the <a href="https://www.hrfn.org/">Human Rights Funders Network (HRFN)</a> on their journey to strengthen their organisational security.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hrfn.org/">HRFN</a> is a network of funders from the Global South, East, and North dedicated to resourcing human rights action around the world. Their unique context has led to the desire to focus on strengthening internal practices around digital security. We are excited to support them in exploring new topics, best practices and “unknown unknowns” in the way they collaborate, select platforms, and implement safety protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are working with HRFN to assess their current organisational and digital security processes and build a way forward to more secure, resilient and justice-focused practices. For the next 10 months, we will be assessing HRFN’s infrastructure and conducting interviews with staff to better understand their organisational security needs. With this input we will detect opportunities, build a roadmap together and accompany HRFN in the implementation of the plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your organisation is also navigating the organisational security journey we’d love to chat with you about it. We’d like to invite you to join our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/projects/organizational-security/">Organizational Security Community</a>, use the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-toolkit-orgsec-practitioners/">organizational security toolkit</a> we put together and to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/contact/">get in touch</a> with us if you need support.</p>

<p>The 3Box Labs team recently published <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74">a new standard for creating capability containers</a> for accessing decentralized data to the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA">Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance</a>. Capability containers are an approach for managing advanced data security and permissions, commonly referred to as “Object Capabilities” or “OCAPs.” </p><p>This new standard is currently in development for use on Ceramic. Once deployed in a future version of the protocol, it will allow Ceramic to be fully compatible with the new <a href="https://login.xyz/">Sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE)</a> specification as well as provide advanced data flow control features for resources stored on the Ceramic network. This post explains how it all works.</p> The need for more advanced access controls <p>For Ceramic, a decentralized data network, identity and access control are first-class considerations. A key question when managing user-centric data is, "As a user, how can I safely permit a third-party to act on my behalf?" Use cases could be as basic as allowing an application to read private information in my profile, or as complex as allowing an application to update my data sharing and permission settings. To make all of this work, Ceramic needs more advanced access control functionality to support all applications that involve data sharing, collaboration, teamwork, or other multi-user, data-driven features.</p><p>Most access control implementations follow one of two distinct approaches: Access-Control Lists (ACL) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">Object Capability model</a> (OCAP). ACL includes role-based access control, mandatory access control, and discretionary access control. This solution includes maintaining a list of known accounts along with their permissions.</p><p>On the other hand, OCAPs use capabilities as a means of managing access control rights without being locked-in to a specific account model or canonical ACL list. Ceramic, like other Web3 protocols, works in a decentralized and highly adversarial environment. This introduces risks and complexities beyond those found in centralized systems relating to DoS, the Ceramic code supply chain, the supply chain of the applications built on top of Ceramic, private key stealing/loss, a UI that misleads users, government actions, and finally protocol design flaws. As a permissionless and decentralized network, there’s also no centralized registry of roles and permissions that an ACL would require. Therefore, we believe object capabilities are the natural correct choice for designing an access control protocol that operates in a distributed environment.</p> Introduction to Capabilities <p>A capability is an unforgeable piece of data, that represents a right to operate on an object. It contains a list of allowed actions and restrictions on each object, together known as a caveat. When an entity that owns a capability issues another one, these capabilities form a chain. Every following capability in a chain contains a caveat that permits less or equal to the previous one.</p><p>You could think of a capability as a "power of attorney" document, but more powerful: the capability may include the right to delegate some of the permissions to yet another actor. In the figure above, we have three entities A, B, and C.</p>  "A" issues a capability to "B" with the set alpha=[1,2,3], representing permitted actions on some resource.  "B" gives another capability to "C", based on its first capability.  Now, "B" attenuates (reduces) the permissions of "C" to beta=[1,2].  "C" then invokes an operation on a resource presenting both the capabilities.  "Resource" is able to check the entire capability chain to either allow or reject the invocation.  <p>Our initial research on capabilities found two existing approaches for how to represent capabilities: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">zCAP-LD</a>, based on the LD-Proof specification, and <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/auth-without-backend/">UCAN</a> by Fission, which has no formal specification. Both share the same general structure; they describe who can perform what action with a cryptographic proof. In examining these options for Ceramic, we found that while both zCAP-LD and UCAN could be serialized as IPLD objects, they use signature schemes that are not easily compatible with the blockchain wallets primarily used for authentication amongst Ceramic community developers and throughout the broader Web3 ecosystem. Therefore, we decided to pull elements from each and create a new format, <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74">CACAO (Chain Agnostic CApability Object)</a>.</p> Capabilities on Ceramic <p>Today when a user opens an application that uses Ceramic to store and manage data, she is likely authenticated via <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/authentication/3id-did/3id-connect/">3ID-Connect</a>. 3ID-Connect protects a user's private key and all the signing requests which go through it. For each Ceramic stream update, the following process occurs:</p><p>Whenever the app needs to update a stream it goes to an identity wallet—3ID-Connect—to request a signature for the update before applying it to the stream. The process repeats for all subsequent updates.</p><p>Instead, we would like an application to request a capability once for writing to a stream (or any other access-controlled resource) and proceed to do many updates. This is a critical UX improvement and needs to be done while maintaining security.</p><p>The corresponding key scheme looks as follows:</p><p>From a UX perspective, the flow resembles permissioning on a modern operating system. Before an iPhone application can access a protected resource, it has to ask for the user's permission.</p><p>Compared to an OS permissioning system, CACAO provides two critical advantages.</p><p>First, re-delegation and attenuation of permissions. This enables more sophisticated and powerful permissioning systems to be created. For example, users could grant rights to a data collective, privacy watchdog, or bank that they trust to manage permissions well. Or they could grant permission to a social application to further grant certain permissions (say, to read their private social graph) to other users on the app, thus trusting the application to create shared social experiences without compromising UX.</p><p>Second, CACAO gives users and other entities direct cryptographic control over their granted permissions, rather than relying on 3rd party enforcement (e.g., Apple’s code). &nbsp;Among other benefits, this means permissions can always be revoked. It also creates auditable and cryptographic guarantees that the correct permissions are being enforced, rather than finding out an application has abused your trust and granted permission to data where they weren’t supposed to (e.g. Facebook and Cambridge Analytica).</p> CACAO Standard &amp; Implementation <p>As described in <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74">CAIP standard draft</a>, we can represent the signed "<a href="http://login.xyz">Sign-in with Ethereum</a>" (SIWE) payload as an <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a> object. We named it <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74">Chain Agnostic CApability Object or CACAO</a>. This allows us to describe desired permissions as URIs (see the SIWE Resources section) in the SIWE payload and use the IPLD object directly as a capability.</p> <code>type Payload struct {
  domain String // =domain
  iss String // = DID pkh
  aud String // =uri
  version String
  nonce String
  iat Int // Unix timestamp =issued-at
  nbf optional Int // Unix timestamp =not-before
  exp optional Int // Unix timestamp = expiration-time
  statement optional String // =statement
  requestId optional String // =request-id
  resources optional [ String ] // =resources as URIs
}</code> <p>In Ceramic, data is stored in IPLD DAGs called streams. An update to a Ceramic stream is a <a href="https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-jose/spec/">DAG-JWS</a> object called a commit, containing a cryptographic signature and the <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/cid">CID</a> of the original payload. To leverage capabilities in this structure, we reference the target capability in the JWS header as a "cap" property. When verifying a new commit, we could see that a signer differs from a stream controller. In this scenario, we check if the controller has permitted the signer to perform the operation by validating the referenced capability in the JWS header.</p> <code>{.p.domain} wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:
{.p.iss[address]}

{.p.statement}

URI: {.p.aud}
Version: {.p.version}
Chain ID: {.p.iss[chainId]}
Nonce: {.p.nonce}
Issued At: {.p.iat}
Resources:
- {.p.resources[0]}
- {.p.resources[1]}
...
- {.p.resources[n]}
</code> <p>We thus achieve the goal of allowing an application to act on behalf of an account.</p> Next steps <p>This post outlined our approach to capability-based authorization in Ceramic, however there is still much work to be done before it is ready for a general audience. One particular challenge will be formalizing attenuations. Instead of relying on the sophisticated composition of "if" statements —which is a common practice — we may explore a domain-specific language to deal with any caveat uniformly with strict mathematical guarantees. Another challenge will be introducing the right UX patterns that responsibly give users direct control over their data and permissions.</p><p>Finally, we’ll be looking for the right specific use cases to benefit from capability-based access control to fully develop these use cases first.

<p>Though Blockchain Commons initiatives date back to our 2016 foundation of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a> and our 2017 work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a> (initially funded through support from <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Blockstream</a>), it’s only in 2020 and 2021 that <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/">Blockchain Commons</a> has come into its own as a full member of the blockchain design community. We’re thrilled with the work we’ve been able to produce in the last two years, with many projects seeing great advancement in 2021.</p>

 Our Vision 

<p>One of the core things we did last year was to define our vision and objectives in a concrete form. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">vision</a> is to advocate “for human dignity online by enabling people to control their own digital destiny.”</p>

<p>We feel that this is particularly critical following the increased focus on digital life during the pandemic, and what we hope will be an increase in human prosperity as we emerge from the COVID crisis. At this crossroads, we must choose to either trust governments to have total control over our digital self, or we must fight for our digital freedom. Obviously, we choose the latter path.</p>

<p>We are working toward our vision through the creation of infrastructure that is open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. Four early objectives are intended to advance our vision in the next few years: the creation of a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community">community of designers</a>; the definition of a self-sovereign design architecture; the creation of demand for this architecture; and the welcoming of peers into our industry.</p>

 Read More 



 Architectural Overview 

<p>To date, our biggest focus has been on our architectural objective. We began with community discussions about the extant flaws in the blockchain ecosystem, particularly related to interoperability between different applications and services. That led us into the creation of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/README.md">specifications</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">Gordian Principles</a>, which outline our core desires for interoperable infrastructure.</p>

<p>This led to the development of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons">reference libraries</a> that followed our specifications &amp; architecture objectives and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">reference applications</a> that used the libraries. The next step will be for these specifications (and libraries) to be deployed in physical products, which we’re just starting to see as 2021 comes to an end.</p>

<p>We generally see this as the model for Blockchain Commons development: we talk with the community, create a spec, and demonstrate how to use it, then the community creates applications.</p>

<p>So what did 2021 specifically bring for our architectural objective?</p>

 Our Specifications 



<p>Much of our original architectural work on specifications such as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#readme">LifeHash</a>, <a>SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md">URs</a> occurred in 2020, but in 2021 we made few major expansions: we produced v2.0 of LifeHash, to make it more compatible with grayscale screens; and we released our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">Request/Response design for URs</a>, which we see as the interoperable end-goal of UR design.</p>

<p>With much of this base work done, we also increased our educational support for our specifications in 2021: our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a> overviews our work; while we also produced extensive docs for both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-overview.md">UR</a>.</p>

 Our Reference Apps 

<p>Our next goal with our specifications is to bring them into practical usage by the blockchain ecosystem. Blockchain Commons trailblazes the way with reference apps that demonstrate both their usage and our libraries. Our most notable release in this regard for 2021 was <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, an app now available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">iOS and Mac App stores</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool demonstrates how to create an app based on the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. It also shows best practices and UX for specifications such as LifeHash, UR, SSKR, and PSBTs with animated QRs. The app is a complete reference for the feature set that we’d love to see all airgapped hardware wallets supporting in the coming year.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
We also produced <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool</a>, also for the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple app store</a>, which reveals how the Gordian Principles can be applied to the wider world of data storage.</p>

<p>Finally, our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server platform</a> saw its 1.0 release: this is the linchpin of our Gordian architecture, meant to demonstrate how users can maintain independent control of their digital destiny.</p>

<p>We look forward to more of this work appearing in the deployments of blockchain manufacturers, with some of the first releases of Blockchain Commons specifications already out from
<a href="https://foundationdevices.com/passport/details/">Foundation Devices</a>, <a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, and <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow</a>, with more to come. We’ve already begun <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/Integration.md#using-sparrow-as-a-transaction-coordinator">documentation</a> on how shared use of these specifications creates a new world of interoperability.</p>

<p>Though our architectural work has been our biggest priority, we also did work on our two other major objectives: creating demand for our work and enlarging the blockchain community through education.</p>

 Creating Demand 

<p>Creating demand for open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate infrastucture came mainly through work with legislative bodies. We’ve worked with Wyoming for years, and were thrilled to see their first-in-the-country definition of digital identity go into effect <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">in July 2021</a>. It depends on the delegatable power of a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">Principal Authority</a>, so we wrote about what that means for the future of digital identity. Because Wyoming is so far ahead of the rest of the country on digital matters, we’ve suggested they create an <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JNmCMVEdMpAHoqVZ7UBakr2PtHgQI4hIgSpRD07nkkU/">eResidency program</a>, to bring these advantages to everyone.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons also testified before other legislatures and lawmakers including ones in Nevada, North Dakota, Buenos Aires, and the Netherlands. We’re thrilled to be able to continue explaining the need for self-sovereign and compassionate digital infrastructure across the world.</p>

 Supporting Education 

<p>The flip side of creating demand is educating the next generation of blockchain developers. One of our prime thrusts in that direction has always been our Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course, which we minorly updated to keep up-to-date with Bitcoin 20.0 as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin 2.1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/es"></a>
More importantly, we also released complete translation of Learning Bitcoin into <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/master/es">Spanish</a>. This was our first truly open-development project, initiated and entirely conducted by volunteers. We’re very grateful to these volunteers for managing the translations, as we think they’re critical in the continued design and development of blockchain technology internationally.</p>

<p>Our other long-term educational program at Blockchain Commons is <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody">SmartCustody</a>: helping designers and users alike to increase the resiliency of their digital holdings. We feel that this is critical education because it allows people to take full andresponsible control over their digital assets and it helps them to avoid the most common losses, stemming from lack of knowledge and human error.</p>

<p>Though we’re still seeking funds for a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md">v2.0 of our course</a>, we have written a few articles that cover some of the technological methods that can improve the resilience of custody in the future, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">multisigs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">SSKR shares</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">timelocks</a>. Some of the material remains preliminary, but that’s because integration of the technology is exploratory as well. We look forward to more completely bringing this material into #SmartCustody in the future, as these technical tools are what we’ve always seen as the end-goal of #SmartCustody work.</p>

<p>Finally, we also repeated our internship program in 2021, and were thrilled to herald another coterie of new blockchain developers (and others interested in the field) into the industry.</p>

 Our Future 

<p>Looking forward, there’s lots to be done.</p>

<p>We’re hoping to see even more third-party projects bringing our specifications to market: not only hardware and software wallets, but also online services that leverage them. We’ll also be continuing to support our specifications with reference applications that can be used by developers to test their interoperability.</p>

<p>
Gordian Recovery is our next planned reference release: it’s intended to demonstrate how to recover funds even if a wallet manufacturer disappears, especially for the more complex situation of multisig recovery.</p>

<p>More new initiatives will include investigations into Ethereum as another blockchain that could benefit from some of our infrastructural work and beginning to leverage Rust as a more fundamentally secure language for writing apps. Finally, we’re expecting to work with the recent Taproot soft-fork, and opportunities offered by its Schnorr signatures, as the biggest new advance in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>

<p>This coming year, we also hope to see the return of the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a> design workshops, which incubated a lot of the ideas that have gone into Blockchain Commons. A second virtual salon is occurring <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/out-of-the-box-2052-tickets-231958081867">this month</a>, but the resumption of the full design workshops will of course be pandemic-dependent. In the meantime, we’re thrilled to see the continued development of RWOT’s ideas: we celebrated the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/26/self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on/">five-year anniversary of self-sovereign identity</a> with Coindesk and were also thrilled to contribute to the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity book</a> from Manning.</p>

<p>Our biggest challenge going forward is that we need Blockchain Commons to be more self-sufficient, which has proven a difficult nut to crack given the foundational nature of a lot of the work we’re doing. We’re very grateful to our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub sponsors</a>; if you’re doing work that will ultimately benefit from some of the specification and interoperability work we’re doing, we encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor as well</a>, to ensure we can keep doing that work. You can also show your support for our ideals with the self-sovereign NFTs that we’re hoping to roll out in 2022.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone for the support and interest in Blockchain Commons to date, especially including the early adoptors of our specifications, our sustaining sponsors: <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blockchainbird/bird">Blockchainbird</a>, <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a>, <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a>, <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a>, <a href="https://keyst.one/">Keystone</a>, <a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained Capital</a>, and our many [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons].</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation plays an important role in the interoperability of Internet identity.&nbsp; This is to announce the OpenID Foundation individual community board member 2022 election schedule.&nbsp;Those elected will help determine the role the Foundation plays in facilitating the development and adoption of open identity standards as well as the strategic direction of the organizations.</p>
<p>Per the Foundation’s bylaws, three individual community board members are elected.&nbsp; Nat Sakimura’s and John Bradley’s terms have one year remaining. George Fletcher’s two-year is coming to an end. I want to thank George for his ongoing service to the Foundation and the community at large.&nbsp; George is eligible to nominate himself again for this important role, as are others</p>
<p>The individual community board member election will be conducted on the following schedule:</p>
 
 Nominations open: &nbsp;Friday, December 31, 2021 
 Nominations close: &nbsp;Friday, January 14, 2022 
 Election begins:&nbsp; Monday, January 17, 2022 
 Election ends: Monday, January 31, 2022 
 Results announced by: Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
 New board term starts: Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
 
<p>All members of the OpenID Foundation in good standing are eligible to nominate themselves, second the nominations of others including those who self-nominated, and vote for candidates. If you’re not already a member of the OpenID Foundation, we encourage you to join now at&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/registration">https://openid.net/foundation/members/registration</a>.</p>
<p>Voting and nominations are being conducted on the OpenID Foundation web site at <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/elections/51">https://openid.net/foundation/members/elections/51</a>. Please log in at&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/">https://openid.net/foundation/members/</a>&nbsp;to participate in nominations and voting. If you experience problems participating in the election or joining the foundation, please send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@oidf.org">help@oidf.org</a>&nbsp;right away.</p>
<p>Board participation requires a substantial investment of time and energy. It is a volunteer effort that should not be undertaken lightly. Should you be elected, expect to be called upon to serve both on the board and on its committees. You should have your employer’s agreement to attend two or more in-person board meetings a year, which are typically collocated with important identity conferences around the world. If you’re committed to open identity standards and work well with others, we encourage your candidacy.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to publicly address these questions in your candidate statement:</p>
 
 What are the key opportunities you see for the OpenID Foundation in 2022? 
 How will you demonstrate your commitment to the work of the foundation in terms of resources, focus and leadership? 
 What would you like to see accomplished in 2022? How do you personally plan to make these things happen? 
 What resources will you bring to the foundation to help the foundation attain its goals? 
 What current or past experiences, skills, and interests will inform your contributions and views? 
 
<p>Candidates can address these questions in their election statements on various community mailing lists, including <a href="mailto:openid-general@lists.openid.net">openid-general@lists.openid.net</a>. Please forward questions, comments and suggestions to me at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.</p>

<p>BrightID tackles the problem of Sybil (duplicate account) attacks. By developing a public graph, BrightID has brought about an infrastructure in which different algorithms can be tried to counteract such attacks. Applications will choose what algorithms suit them best to verify their&nbsp;users.</p><p>Bitu is the first graph-analysis-based verification method that BrightID offers. The nodes inside the main regions of the graph get verified by Bitu. It recognizes nodes outside the borders of those regions as Sybil accounts. This verification method is based on the fact that when a graph is drawn using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing">Force-directed algorithms</a>, Sybil accounts are pushed away from the main, dense regions to the borders. The reason is that Sybil accounts can not make a significant number of connections with honest ones and can only make connections with each other. That is why they get pushed away from the main regions to the surrounding districts.</p><p>In current seed-based algorithms, there is a small number of highly trusted nodes called seeds which have the power of verifying users. Because nodes are verified on the basis of their proximity to the seeds in the graph, such algorithms are very vulnerable to attacks from&nbsp;seeds.</p><p>In Bitu, however, there is no seed. In fact, every node is a seed and can verify others as long as they remain in the main regions of the graph. While seed-based methods rely on a minority of highly trusted seeds, Bitu relies on a low-trusted majority.</p><p>Can BrightID scale while maintaining security against Sybil attacks? We have been frequently asked, as <a href="https://medium.com/u/587a00dbce51">Vitalik Buterin</a> did in “<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/10/18/round7.html">Gitcoin Grants Round 7 Retrospective</a>”:</p><blockquote>BrightID is going to face a tough challenge making it reasonably easy for regular users to join but at the same time resist attacks from fake and duplicate accounts. I look forward to seeing them try to meet the challenge!</blockquote><p>Verification based on the help of a small number of highly trusted seeds gives users a hard time getting verified. On the other hand, increasing the number of seeds decreases the security of the network against&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>Relying on a majority of low trusted nodes instead of a minority of high trusted ones known as seeds enables Bitu to maintain scalability while ensuring security. Bitu enables users to get verified easily through making a single connection with one of the users in the main regions. Thus BrightID can scale its network. And if a user in the main regions tends to create a significant number of fake accounts to verify them by making connections with them, the fake accounts get pushed away from the main regions and even the attacker will get unverified. This prevents large-scale Sybil attacks and guarantees security.</p><p>Moreover, Bitu can tackle small-scale Sybil attacks; it enables apps to verify users based on the number of connections. For instance, Gitcoin may require users to have at least 10 “Already known” connections in Bitu. So the higher the required number of connections is, the more secure the app gets. This makes it too hard for Sybil accounts to make enough connections without getting out of the main&nbsp;regions.</p><p>An example helps clarify how it works. User X wants to create 10 fake accounts in order to use them in the Gitcoin application. If Gitcoin requires only one “Already known” connection for verification, user X with strong connections to the main regions of the graph can drag those ten accounts into the main regions without the risk of getting out of the main regions. However, if Gitcoin requires ten or more “Already known” connections for verification, user X needs to either connect these ten fake accounts to honest users or connect these ten accounts to each other to reach the minimum required number of connections. Note that honest users don’t make connections with unknown accounts as “Already known” and connecting those ten accounts to each other causes all these ten accounts to get pushed away from the main regions of the graph and get unverified.</p><p>Bitu is the first method that tries to tell bots and fake users from real ones through the viewing of the graph. The BrightID graph is available to the public, and everyone can easily distinguish the main regions and the borders by looking at the graph. You can log in to the <a href="https://explorer.brightid.org/">BrightID explorer</a> and see your own and your connections’ location in the graph. Refer to our <a href="https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified/bitu-verification">Gitbook</a> for more information on how to get verified in&nbsp;Bitu.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/what-is-markaz-verification-level-47397372c8eb">What is Bitu Verification?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Second Committee Note now available</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce publication of “Event Terms List Version 1.0,” a Committee Note from the members of the OASIS Emergency Management TC [1].</p>



<p>The variety of practices employed regarding “event” types in Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) messages makes it difficult to compare messages from different sources. The problem has been presented as an interoperability issue where some consumers of CAP struggle to compare differences in language and meaning of the terms used in the &lt;event&gt; element in CAP.</p>



<p>The &lt;event&gt; element is the focus for this Committee Note, as it is the only required element in CAP directly associated with the subject event for a CAP message. Aligning practices surrounding this element, as opposed to other possible candidate elements, is the choice adopted in this work product for addressing this interoperability concern.</p>



<p>The Committee Note is available here:</p>



<p>Event Terms List Version 1.0<br>Committee Note 02<br>12 October 2021</p>

<p>With the holiday season upon us, gift-giving is on the minds of many. A perennial favorite is LEGO, beloved by generations of children and adults alike. As the world's most popular engineering and educational toy, and the world’s <a href="https://brandfinance.com/press-releases/brand-finance-global-500-2021-lego-named-worlds-7th-strongest-brand">7th strongest brand</a>, LEGO knows a thing or two about learning; to this end, in 1986, they started the LEGO Foundation to study and support child development. Now, the LEGO Foundation have teamed up with a DIF member organization, the Learning Economy Foundation, to build a gamified learning app which showcases all the key components of the decentralized identity stacks, with an emphasis on <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#what-is-so-decentralized-about-a-did">DIDs</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#what-is-so-decentralized-about-a-vc">VCs</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#what-is-a-wallet">wallets</a>. Thus, the <a href="https://medium.com/@ntonani/super-skills-a-mobile-application-use-case-for-dids-and-vcs-d174467ccf46">Super Skills app</a> was born.<br></p><blockquote>The Super Skills app combines a custodial wallet (Torus) and Ceramic VC/storage tooling to give children private, exportable, future-proof achievement records – a self-sovereign educational credentialing system in miniature.</blockquote><p>With their interlocking studs, LEGO has long been a go-to analogy for explaining modular architectures and thin-layered tech stacks, particularly in the emerging tech space of <a href="https://forkast.news/understanding-nfts-digital-assets-think-lego/">NFTs</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@benjosh243/blockchain-the-technology-behind-bitcoin-explained-with-lego-cfd1cd6879c4">Blockchains</a>. The growing field of decentralized digital identity is no exception, where how thinly to slice the layers and which interfaces to standardize are the bread and butter of our <a href="https://identity.foundation/interop/">interoperability working group</a> and technical steering committee. The easy-to-grasp idea of a system of interchangeable pieces clicking effortlessly together makes intuitive the target state of standardized interfaces allowing a great architectural flexibility based on modular components. </p><p><a href="https://www.learningeconomy.io/">The Learning Economy Foundation</a>, a U.S. based non-profit with a global mission to accelerate the world toward next generation education and workplace infrastructures, created <a href="https://medium.com/@ntonani/super-skills-a-mobile-application-use-case-for-dids-and-vcs-d174467ccf46">Super Skills</a>, building on the LEGO Foundation’s core values of finding creative ways to make education sustainable, equitable, accessible and fun. A simple app where children aged 5-12 undertake playful experiences (called ‘quests’) to learn core skills, collect resources and complete seasonal narratives, while also familiarizing the next generation of digital and crypto natives with &nbsp;the vocabulary and paradigms of digital identity, by using digital wallets to store, modify, transport and present digital credentials of their achievements. <br></p>Building a future of decentralized educational credentials, brick by brick - Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ryanquintal?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Ryan Quintal</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a><blockquote>Lego Foundation: “Together we need to make a leap in playful learning, creating a future that promotes inclusive education, lifelong learning opportunities for all children, and where holistic skills and innovation are central.</blockquote><p>The LEGO Foundation categorizes tasks into five broad skill categories, namely: creative, social, cognitive, physical and emotional. Tasks can develop multiple skills simultaneously, and there are no current plans to introduce competition between users. Successful or even partial completion of tasks is confirmed by an educator, parent or guardian. Taking a fun, interactive approach to learning maintains attention and interest. As the child trains useful skills, they are also equipping themselves with provable credentials for these skills which can then be presented or exchanged digitally at a later time.</p><a href="https://www.legofoundation.com/en/about-us/how-we-work/">Source: How We Work: The LEGO Foundation</a><p>A major priority for the Super Skills project was the protection of children and their data. The team decided on a decentralized identity approach, to ensure that none of the organizations involved would be required to host users’ data; all data ownership stays with the subject, and all data stewardship needs to be credibly portable. To achieve this, three core ‘primitives’ were identified in this approach: VCs (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>) and DIDs (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C</a>), two standards-track W3C data models that are the foundation of most DIF work, and Digital Wallets, an community draft specification for how to portably house, sign and present credentials. Together, this architecture pioneers portability and modularity for this important data.<br></p><p>Combining these primitives with a UX simple and resilient enough for very young children using shared equipment presented additional architectural requirements. By leveraging the <a href="https://docs.tor.us/">Torus SDK</a> and the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/welcome/">Ceramic Network</a>, they can ensure that no data is saved onto a specific device, which may be a communal classroom iPad or smartphone. In this way, users' self-management of private keys, one of the core challenges of decentralized identity, is simplified with familiar <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC) interfaces and recovery mechanisms.<br></p><p>Decentralized Identifier (DID)— a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a> refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DIDs</a> have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Identity being portable and forward-compatible (i.e. "exportable") is of paramount importance when data subjects are too young to consent to long-term custody or sign their own terms of service contracts!<br></p><p>Verifiable Credential (VC) — a specification that provides a standard way to express <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential">credentials</a> on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable. Much like DIDs, portability is a key superpower of VCs-- and a key requirement in the education space, where data needs to be globally consumable to be of use to its subject.<br></p><p>Digital Wallet — a digital wrapper for utilizing cryptographic key material to sign, send, store, prove VCs, etc. Learning Economy Foundation is co-owner of a W3C-CCG work item to specify a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/">Universal Wallet</a>, i.e. a portable and interoperable interface to make wallets more interchangeable and “exportable.” &nbsp;The Super Skills app doesn’t just comply with the specification, but was designed to function as a working prototype of this kind of portability, pioneering a forward-commitment to portability from the outset of the project. <br></p><p>The interoperability and portability principles of DIDs and VCs mean that in the future, users should be free to choose any compatible digital wallet, and to take their data between platforms as they see fit.<br><br></p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">Source: Affinidi- What Is The Trust Triangle</a><p>Together, these primitives enable users to own and control their own data, and have it confirmed as authentic without either the verifier or the user communicating with the issuer of the credential. This is commonly known as the triangle of trust, a foundational model for decentralized identity.<br></p><p>Under the hood, this project aims to develop a native <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> experience that leverages all of the advantages of decentralized identity technology, but to use plugins such as Torus to deliver it in a way that’s practically indistinguishable from traditional approaches in UX terms. The technical platform is also open-ended and useful beyond the Super Skills app: It has been built to allow “quest-builders” to construct their own courses, credentials, content, etc and provide ways to issue credentials that can be utilized outside the platform. The VC exchange mechanisms are intended to be an extensible open-source contribution to the credentialing community.<br></p><p>Building a future of decentralized educational credentials, brick by brick</p><p>Nathan Tonani of the Learning Economy Foundation has written a technical review of the implementation used in the Super Skills app, which you can read in detail on Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@ntonani/super-skills-a-mobile-application-use-case-for-dids-and-vcs-d174467ccf46">here</a>.<br></p>

     <p>On time for the end of 2021, as planned, Federal Council has announced on Dec 17th their <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-86465.html">decision</a> in regards to the future direction of E-ID implementation. This decision is a result of the public consultation that has started with a publication of their discussion <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/en/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf.download.pdf/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf">paper</a> “on a traget vision for an e-ID” and culminated with a conference on October 14th.</p>
<p>DIDAS community welcomes the decision wholeheartedly and applauds the commitment to orient the implementation of the future E-ID system based on SSI principles with the focus to enable the so called “ambition level 3“, as it was called in the discussion paper.</p>
<p>In the selected implementation variant, based on SSI, a decentralised solution architecture is highlighted, which focuses on maximum protection of privacy.</p>
<p>In “ambition level 3, the aim is enable the usage of various E-ID attributes not just for eGovernment use-cases, but also in the other sectors, as a building block, in order to generate maximum added value for the population of Switzerland. This “level of ambition” clearly goes beyond the creation of the E-ID and aims to build an ecosystem of (business-domain) ecosystems in which, in addition to the E-ID, other verifiable credentials can be exchanged securely and reliably.</p>
<p>In such an implementation scenario, the E-ID plays an important role, but it is only part of the puzzle. In this blog post, we would like to provide a practical guidance, expressing consolidated, expert postion of our members, regarding the regulatory requirements that must be created for an effective and efficient implementation.</p>
<p>First, let us consider the following roles in the SSI model: “Holder“, “Issuer &amp; Verifier“, and “Decentralised Trust network“:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holder: Central to the success of an SSI-based E-ID ecosystem is low-threshold access to suitable wallets. We assume that a market will develop a suitable solution here. For use as a carrier of the E-ID data or attributes, minimum requirements for the wallets or certification processes should likely be specified by the state.</p>
<p>Issuer &amp; Verifier: In many sectors, operational or technical standards already exist for the exchange of credentials. Some of these are based on regulatory requirements, but in many cases they are sponsored and developed by organisations coming from the relevant sector itself. These already existing structures should be reused and, if deemed necessary, adapted or expanded so that they can leverage a common trust network. This may require amendments to the regulations of individual sectors. Here, the creation of an enabling conditions for harmonisation and compatibility with the overarching LEI framework should be strongly considered, with the goal to support international interoperability. This point explicitly refers not only to the E-ID or the eGovernment sector (“ambition level” 1 or 2), but to the entire ecosystem according to the “ambition level 3”.</p>
<p>Trust network: The trust network is the common basis for the secure exchange of credentials between all the actors. This can be done on the basis of a blockchain, for example, but other possibilities are also conceivable. There is a clear need to clarify governance in terms of state supervision, as well as technical and operational standards. The development of these standards, but also the performance of operational tasks, such as the operation of nodes when implemented with a blockchain, should preferably be carried out in cooperation with organisations from the various sectors.</p>
<p>Since different sectors will contribute to this ecosystem, we would like to take a closer look at the interplay between these sectors:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here we place E-ID as an important part of the ecosystem in the “eGovernment” sector. Among other things, the issuing processes of the E-ID and the division of tasks between the Confederation and the cantons will have to be regulated there. However, aspects of international interoperability must also be adequately taken into account. Following the same logic, the necessary standards for Educational Degrees or Standards for Health Certificates will be established in their respective ecosystems or industrial sectors. The important requirement here is that all these ecosystems place their so called “trust anchors” in common the “trust network”. This will ensure the secure exchange of credentials across sector boundaries.</p>
<p>In summary, we suggest the following three main measures:</p>
 
 In terms of a “sector eGovernment”, the federal government is to define the design of the processes relating to e-ID together with the cantons. This gives residents of Switzerland the opportunity to store and use their personal E-ID as a “Verifiable Credential” in their wallet. International developments must be taken into account. Requirements for wallets, in which E-IDs can be held, must be defined. 
 In the individual sectors, the existing structures are to be leveraged . Where necessary, existing regulations should be adapted so that the use of the E-ID and operation of ecosystems for the electronic exchange of Verifiable Credentials is made possible. This should also include the creation of an enabling conditions for harmonisation and compatibility with the overarching LEI framework, in order to support international interoperability 
 For the trust network, clear framework conditions for governance as well as for the technical and operational standards must be defined. Organisations from the participating sectors are to be involved in the operational implementation of the “trust network”. This approach will strengthen the decentralisation of the “trust network”.

	<p>We’re pleased to announce that the Me2B Alliance has fully approved our <a href="https://me2ba.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/me2ba-operating-proceduresv1.0-20211210.pdf">Membership Operating Procedures</a>. This significant milestone for the organization defines the governance, organization, and operating rules for the Me2B Alliance Membership activities, projects, and Working Groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was the process?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Operating Procedures were subjected to&nbsp;multiple approval stages which included:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Membership Council reviewed&nbsp;the&nbsp;draft&nbsp;Operating Procedures weekly beginning&nbsp;in&nbsp;September 2021&nbsp;and&nbsp;unanimously&nbsp;voted to approve&nbsp;them&nbsp;at the end of October&nbsp;2021.<br>
 
 The draft Operating Procedures then moved on to a two-week review period by the Full Membership Community.&nbsp; 
 Following the review period,&nbsp;the Full Membership Community&nbsp;voted to approve the draft Operating Procedures.&nbsp;43% of members voted (33%&nbsp;required)&nbsp;and&nbsp;100% voted to approve&nbsp;(51%&nbsp;required).&nbsp; 
 The&nbsp;last step&nbsp;in the process was&nbsp;a review and vote by&nbsp;the Board of Directors. This final&nbsp;approval&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;on December 10, 2021.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;This rigorous process ensured a thorough examination&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Operating Procedures which are a crucial part of our membership operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
What are the Operating Procedures?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Operating Procedures are used by Me2B Alliance Members, Working Group Chairs, and Me2B Alliance Staff to provide governance for membership operations and ensure successful development of respectful tech specifications. They also define voting, our publication approval process, Working Group responsibilities, and much more.&nbsp;</p>

 A reflection on&nbsp;2021 <p>We Are Open Co-op has had a big year! It’s time for a bit of reflection, and we thought we would write a quick post that sums up all the things we did this&nbsp;year.</p> Quarter 1 Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> of&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>As we came into 2021, we kicked off the year with <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-year-of-the-rebuild-co-op-2-0-2c67ad5c69e6">a Co-op Day</a>. 2020 was certainly A Year, so we needed to regroup and reflect on what we wanted to co-op to be. We reviewed processes and policies and set our sights on what we wanted to achieve in 2021. We wanted to do different kinds of projects. We wanted to inspire our long term clients and contacts.</p><p>We bid for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/prototyping-with-purpose-catalyst-definition-phase-f1ee568b3684">the Catalyst Definition project</a> in January. We were successful, and Catalyst asked us to run a programme for a cohort of 10 charities. Meanwhile, Doug Belshaw was running <a href="https://medium.com/sector-challenge-9-claiming-universal-credit">another Catalyst programme</a> in parallel. Throughout the spring we helped our charities learn new skills. We helped them make <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/archive/2021/02">plans for their communities</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/archive/2021/03">define the charity tech projects</a>. We assisted their digital transformation initiatives.</p><p>In March, we began production for an internal Greenpeace International project that shall not be named 😉 In April, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/thats-a-wrap-2c6bd649968c">we wrapped up the Definition Project</a> and continued to make resources and assets for our secret learning project at Greenpeace.</p> Q2 Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> of&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In May, we did some <a href="https://weareopen.coop/near/">workshopping with the crypto platform NEAR</a>, which was the first time we accepted cryptocurrency as part of our fee. In May, We Are Open Cooperative also <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wao-turns-five-30747f4df0f9">turned 5 years old</a>. We celebrated this momentous occasion by launching our <a href="https://weareopen.coop">new website</a> and adding more stuff to our <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop">free learning resource hub</a>. As icing on the cake, two members created a new podcast “about the intersection of technology, society, and internet culture — with a dash of philosophy and art for good measure” called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao">the Tao of&nbsp;WAO</a>.</p>Our Tao of WAO header, CC-BY Laura Hilliger of&nbsp;WAO<p>We also created a proposal to develop an internship programme for WAO. We wanted to provide new people with intimate understanding about the kinds of skills and mindsets members and collaborators have. We wanted to create a programme in which we could learn from our interns, as they would learn from&nbsp;us.</p>Learning journey design (using Whimsical) CC-BY Laura Hilliger &amp; Doug Belshaw of&nbsp;WAO<p>Catalyst selected us for another Catalyst programme, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/all-good-things-come-to-an-end-e3d21a93da49">the Continuation Programme</a>. This was an extra bit of funding for charities to have more one to one support. The co-op set up consultation sessions and office hours for charities. To give back to a wonderful funding partner, we participated in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-common-ground-8fadc99692cd">the Catalyst Network Engagement Working&nbsp;Group</a>.</p><p>June is also the month we started working on a new project with longtime collaborators, <a href="https://www.participate.com/">Participate</a>. We went to Participate with some ideas on revamping an email course we used to run on the basics called <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badge-bootcamp-will-be-back-soon-b11859b01873">Badge Bootcamp</a>. After one meeting, we realised that <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/participation-thats-what-s-gonna-save-the-human-race-pete-seeger-ae57ba8370a5">it’s a good time to do more</a>. We started looking at the intersection between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">Communities of Practice</a> and <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open&nbsp;Badges</a>.</p> Q3 CC-BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/hashtag/activism/">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>In July our ideas with Participate started to balloon. We published a post on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badges-for-digital-transformation-7e9e1a17e714">Badges for Digital Transformation</a> and documented <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/4-benefits-of-open-recognition-pathways-a51c10a37633">the Benefits of Open Recognition Pathways</a>.</p><p>Also in July, we had time to work on some internal stuff and process things that have been happening in the world. We had a bit of an existential chat and published a post and a wiki page to explain <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/spirit-of-wao-e5cb23c8cdfb">the Spirit of&nbsp;WAO</a>.</p>Anne, very much frozen in Lapland, CC BY-NC-SA Anne&nbsp;Hilliger<p>And then came August, another momentous month as WAO welcomed <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/hello-world-6b5c8caed8db">its first intern</a>. Anne started on the first, a start date that allowed her to have a good full month of onboarding as August tends to be quite slow. In August, our Catalyst Continuation project <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-end-of-the-beginning-fad2447f378f">came to an end</a>. We had time to help Anne get to know her new workplace and colleagues.</p><p>There was movement in the open badges community, as a proposal to align Open Badges with the W3C standard for Verifiable Credentials was made. Developments in this conversation impact some of our clients, so <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-standards-should-be-developed-openly-1f0cf552308d">we paid close attention</a> to the discussion.</p><p>Towards the end of August, we started working with our friends at <a href="https://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a> on a strand of work for a new client, <a href="https://juliesbicycle.com">Julie’s Bicycle</a>, a pioneering not-for-profit mobilising the arts and culture to take action on the climate and ecological crisis.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> of&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In September we continued collaborating with <a href="https://outlandish.com">Outlandish</a> on Julie’s Bicycle (JB) software projects, and we launched <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/climate-change-for-the-better-457134bd0b43">a new strand to the project</a>, the Strategy strand. Our task was to help the climate-focused non-profit with strategic stuff. In September we helped JB write job descriptions, figure out structural stuff and otherwise support the organisation as they prepare to hire their first digital team. We also began thinking about the strategy that team would implement.</p><p>Our September co-op day used a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/strategic-starfish-another-co-op-day-4745b52b798f">Strategic Starfish</a> to reflect a bit on how things are and where we want to&nbsp;go.</p> Q4 CC-BY Laura Hilliger and Bryan Mathers of WAO. <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">Join us&nbsp;here</a>!<p>A lot of work happened behind the scenes in October. We prepared to launch a pilot training programme with Greenpeace. We ran interviews for a Product Lead, contributed to funding documents and started imagining a digital strategy for Julie’s Bicycle. We prepared and then launched the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-e26a1b055ff5">Keep Badges Weird</a> community alongside Participate at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jObhmAVyCKk">Badge Summit</a>, and we did platform feedback work for Participate as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The Keep Badges Weird community received a good reception, and we pushed out three badge heavy posts around our community facilitation and content creation.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/designing-badges-for-co-creation-and-recognition-62fd06fd5636">Designing Badges for Co-creation and Recognition</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reflecting-on-the-evolving-badges-and-credentials-ecosystem-6efac4d673d3">Reflecting on the Evolving Badges and Credentials Ecosystem</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/good-things-happen-slowly-bad-things-happen-fast-2fd894cbd4df">Good things happen slowly, bad things happen&nbsp;fast</a>  <p>In addition to helping members with Keep Badges Weird work, <a href="https://medium.com/@anne.hilliger/rethinking-we-are-opens-learning-platform-learnwith-wao-b6d2f4d022a3">Anne spent time</a> in the autumn thinking about and improving Learnwith.</p><p>For Greenpeace, we launched our pilot and agreed to a new project.

We’re bringing the two Julie’s Bicycle strands, software and strategy, back together as the digital strategy envisions a big shift. We’ve also been pleased to begin onboarding JB’s new product lead, who hasn’t even officially started.</p><p>Anne’s fresh eyes and interest in media pedagogy has proven extremely helpful in the Participate Keep Badges Weird work. We’ve encouraged her <a href="https://medium.com/@anne.hilliger/all-i-am-thinking-about-are-open-badges-9c9760a60c49">to fall deeper into the world</a> of edtech and, in particular, badges. Over the course of her internship, Anne has been coming up with badges that are relevant to her. WAO has started thinking about a badge design system so that she gets her badges&nbsp;soon.</p><p>The last bit of “work” we have to do this year is our WAO Christmas Party. We’re going to eat mince pies, play silly games and spend a bit of time just being together before we retreat for some well earned&nbsp;rest.</p> Next Year <p>Oh there’s so much! Members are looking forward to more <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao">Tao of WAO podcast</a> in 2022, we’ll come back to get our badge design done and dusted, and we’re going into the new year with a fairly full client&nbsp;slate.</p><p>We are, however, always looking for new, interesting things to do. We have some changes afoot (all good things!) in the co-op so it’s going to be interesting to see how we evolve next year. For now, if you’re reading this post and feel like you want to work with a collective of independent thinkers and makers, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">give us a shout</a>!

<p>We at DIDAS are committed to establishing and promoting a viable and thriving self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>We are convinced that this identity-centric approach will enable a fundamental change in how social, public and business areas interact and work together in the future. This change will underpin the values ​​of our country and lead to greater data sovereignty and better data protection for each individual.</p>
<p>Our goal is to overcome complex, systematic and multifaceted challenges in the design of services and to enable more seamless digital processes &amp; experiences. With this <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SSI-Explainer-Introduction-final.pdf">presentation</a> (in German) we start the journey and want to:</p>
 
 Offer a broader audience access to functionality and developments relating to the topic of self-sovereign identity – comprehensive and interdisciplinary. 
 Give interested parties the opportunity to deal with the topic in a simple, understandable and technology-agnostic manner and to develop an understanding of the effects and potentials of digitisation. 
 Show citizens the advantages compared to other approaches so that they can follow discussions relating to digital identity (e.g. E-ID) and form an opinion. 
 Provide decision-makers with a memorable summary of the most important principles, international opinions and relevant take-aways. 
 
<p>The <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SSI-Explainer-Introduction-final.pdf">Self Sovereign Identity Explainer</a>&nbsp; (in German) is the basis for the future discussions and in-depth learning. It briefly introduces the development history of digital identity and roughly describes the different phases of identity in the Internet age.</p>
<p>In order to gain a better understanding of how a digital identity should be designed and the principles according to which it should be realized, we briefly deal with the characteristics and complexity of an identity. Derived from this understanding, we summarise the most important SSI principles (WEF, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">Christopher Allen</a>, Sovrin <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">principles)</a> in an easy to understand way and thus formulate our DIDAS Good Practices.</p>
<p>These good practices will help us in the future to better classify and evaluate technological developments, legal and regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Building on the preceding explanations, we reflect on the functionality of the peer-to-peer approach and show the importance of a governance framework – it is actually the interplay of “Human Trust” and “Cryptographic Trust” that enables a functioning ecosystem that is accepted by all parties. We conclude the Self Sovereign Identity Explainer with a short presentation of the benefits and show how SSI pays off for the parties involved.</p>
<p>We wish all readers a fruitful examination of the world of Self Sovereign Identity and we would be pleased if we can win you over to this exciting and promising topic.</p>

 Reaching the Next Milestone in Counteracting Sybil Attackers <p>The development of BrightID began three years ago with the goal of providing a decentralized platform for applications to ensure the uniqueness of their users and counteract the attack of bots on their applications. We believe that the only decentralized, scalable, and reliable way to detect humans from bots in the future of cyberspace is to rely on the social relations of&nbsp;humans.</p><p>From the beginning, BrightID was supposed to distinguish real users from bots and verify them by analyzing the graph formed by connections that users make with their friends and family members. However, the graph-analysis-based verification methods can only be used if there is enough data covering them. It is not possible to use such verification methods unless a graph of a significant number of users who have connected with at least a small number of friends exists. That is why BrightID had to make use of another verification method to verify its early users in the initial stage although that method was not reliable and scalable.</p><p>Joining connection parties and making connections with a trusted person who hosts the call was the initial verification method that BrightID used. In this stage, BrightID was like a newborn fed on milk. As milk is the only suitable food for a newborn to grow in the first stages of growth, the only healthy way that BrightID could grow enough was to rely on the Stars in connection parties to verify users. And just as milk is not enough for newborns to grow as they age, BrightID cannot grow by only relying on stars. And just as humans always use milk as nutritious food, using stars can always be a basic verification method in BrightID.</p><p>Today, we are proud to announce that BrightID has grown enough to start using graph-analysis-based verification methods. BrightID has more than 30,000 active users, 10,000 of whom have made 4 connections on average with the people they know in person. That is why BrightID can now start to use other verification methods. Soon BrightID will be making use of various verification methods, the first ones are Aura and&nbsp;<a href="https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified/bitu-verification">Bitu</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/brightid-verification-story-2d0c2ab82f42">BrightID Verification Story</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The eKYC and Identity Assurance (eKYC &amp; IDA) working group is developing extensions to OpenID Connect that standardize the communication of assured identity information, i.e., verified claims along with trust framework and assurance level as well as information about how and when the verification was done. The core of that work has become OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance (OIDC4IDA).</p>
<p>With its first interoperability event, the working group has taken an important step on the journey towards a final specification. Interoperability of implementations is paramount and with the support of the GAIN proof-of-concept participants, where this specification is an important technical building block, several organizations have been able to test their implementations.</p>
<p>At the core of the event was the beta eKYC &amp; IDA conformance test plan developed by the OpenID Foundation. The test plan will ensure that implementations of the OIDC4IDA specification adhere to the rules described in the current implementers draft, and thereby assure technical interoperability across identity providers and relying parties.</p>
<p>In the last week of November, four early implementers of the OIDC4IDA specification (<a href="http://bankid.com">BankID Sweden</a>, <a href="https://github.com/identityfirst/eKYC-Hub">eKYC Hub Open Source Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.dizme.io/">DIZME</a>, and <a href="https://yes.com">yes.com</a>), all in the role of identity providers, came together to run the tests and to present their results in a special session of the OAuth Security Workshop 2021. All four Identity Providers ran the tests successfully, detecting only minor deviations from the standard.</p>
<p>These existing implementations will be also available in the sandbox being set up by the upcoming GAIN proof-of-concept community group for interested RPs to test with.</p>
<p>The eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance working group plans to organize another interoperability testing event, together with relying parties, in the near future.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/12/16/ekyc-identity-assurance-interop-event-update/">eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Interop Event Update</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

<p>The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation announced a <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Meaningful-Gift-Alliance-Governance-Framework.pdf">critical governing framework (PDF)</a> to assist Santa in making his toughest choices during Christmas Eve.</p>



<p>For generations, Santa used many information sources, potentially unreliable, to choose gifts.&nbsp;However, with the advent of verifiable credential standards, systems, and governance, a more trustworthy ecosystem is being built which will issue NAUGHTY and NICE verifiable credentials based upon trustworthy evidence and accountability standards for all participants.</p>



  



<p>ToIP, working closely with the Santa-led Meaningful Gift Alliance (MEGA), applied its ground-breaking Metamodel Specification to define the ecosystem whereby trustworthy NAUGHTY and NICE credentials will be made available to Santa on Christmas Eve. This effort is expected to save Santa and his elves around 3.14159 million elf-hours per Christmas event which translates into a minimum of 742,000 additional toy deliveries for the 2.2 billion children of the world. #logistics #supplychain</p>



<p>Santa is thrilled. “Those NAUGHTY and NICE lists are just too difficult to scroll through when I’m out all-night delivering presents. I get acid reflux worrying that I’ll get my lists mixed up! This new ecosystem delivers all the information I need right to my satellite smartphone with the confidence I need to sail through the night!” #UXdesign</p>



  



<p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Meaningful-Gift-Alliance-Governance-Framework.pdf">Governance Framework (PDF)</a> sets nuanced and contextual rules for the privacy protection of BAD and GOOD life events for children, used as input to the quantum-computer generated algorithm that issues NAUGHTY and NICE credentials. It also allows for parents, guardians, and child-advocates to petition on a child’s behalf.&nbsp; The <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/mega/glossary">Glossary of Terms</a> for uses for the MEGA <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Meaningful-Gift-Alliance-Governance-Framework.pdf">Governance Framework (PDF)</a> is supported by a Trust Over IP terms community using the Trust Over IP terms wiki tool.</p>



<p>“While we want to save Santa some stress, the main focus is ensuring every child gets a meaningful gift each gift-giving season.” says Nichola Hickman, Secretariat for the Meaningful Gift Alliance. “We consulted with many meaningful gift-givers, including representatives for Wookie Life Day, Mother Earth, the IFFF (International Federation of Fairy Godmothers &amp; Tooth Fairies) and the Free Magi-Sons. They all had experienced fraud from grown-ups claiming to be children, so we are delighted with this new method of ensuring that every child gets exactly what they deserve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bids will be announced shortly for vendors for MEGA’s technical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MEGA also joined the Good Elf Pass Initiative whose “interoperability blueprint” supports its crucial role as issuers of these credentials. The ground-breaking “Hypersleigh” blockchain standard will also support rapid delivery and high security for all Meaningful Gifts. #hypersleigh</p>

 Data Agreement demos  from NGI ESSIF-LAB sub-grantees iGrant.io, Gataca and the Human Colossus Foundation. These three demo'd implementations demonstrate how a consent notice (or "data agreement" as it was called in the ESSIF-LAB context) gets signed as a shared record between issuers/verifiers (data controllers) and holders (data subjects). The data agreement sets a clear purpose of usage, what personal data is collected, how long data can be retained and on what lawful basis it can be processed; both parties keep a record, allowing precise GDPR enforcement and transparency on all sides.
 
 The data agreement was originally based on the Kantara Initiative's Consent Notice, which is now being standardized as a new <a href="https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27560.html">ISO standard 27560</a>.

 Some noteworthy changes 
 OIDC4VP removed the option to embed VP inside the ID Token, the only option is to send a separate VP Token alongside ID Token 
 Current OIDC4VP draft mandates the use of PEv2, but there are discussions to allow arbitrary "policy languages"

 Call to Participate - DIDComm User Group
 
 Now that the DIDComm v2 spec is nearing completion, and there are robust libraries in multiple programming languages, we are starting a user group to share learnings as we put DIDComm into production. We will organize community resources, produce a handbook, foster application-level protocol creation, maintain the didcomm.org website and repo, and recommend best practices. We invite anyone who's interested to register in the user group's <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/didcomm-usergroup">email list here</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/F4Qw7h6Sr9">Discord channel here</a>. 
 
 
 The first regular meeting will be held on January 10th-14th, with meeting selection to happen prior on the above communication methods. 
 Although this UG is sponsored by DIF, this is not an IP-protected context. We won't be developing specs or working on standards. Thus, you don't have to be a member of any particular org to join, and there are no legal terms to review or paperwork to sign. Please join us!

 Status update for <code>did:keri</code>, and plans to add it as a work item to the ID WG.

 Current status of did:keri
 
 The goal is to continue and further expand the work on the DID method specification, to figure out how all the KERI building blocks can be utilized together in a method spec. 
 Does did:keri by itself make sense, or only "KERI in the context of an existing DID method" (e.g. did:indy:keri)? 
 The work in the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">KERI WG</a> is in a special state. The goal is to "wrap up" that current status of KERI so that the KERI spec work goes into a "sleep" state. There are two communities, one working in the Trust-over-IP Foundation (ToIP), one working at DIF. 
 The proposal is to contribute the KERI work itself to the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/crypto-wg/">Applied Cryptography Working Group</a>, and the did:keri work to the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/">Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>.

 3 design options:
 
 1. No awareness - most flexible for higher layers 
 2. Current approach - prefix with bit array to match order to underlying order (doesn't allow for canonicalization algos or higher-level users which need to reorder, i.e. LDP URDNA) 
 3. Append a more elaborate structure - byte array of indices referring to the message order in underlying dataset

 Hyperledger Aries 
 
 To anyone in the Aries Community that either builds Frameworks or deploys Aries solutions:
 
 Many of  in the Aries community want to transition from using the "early days" <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md">RFC 0160 Connections protocol</a> (part of AIP 1.0) to the newer <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">RFC 0023 DID Exchange</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">RFC 0434 Out of Band</a> protocols.  A "community upgrade" has been proposed that will accomplish that in a way that we can avoid periods of instability between Aries agents (Issuers, Verifiers, Wallets, etc.) if we coordinate a series of changes in our deployments. 
 A PR has been proposed to RFC 0496 (Transition to OOB and DID Exchange)  and is expected to be accepted that will move us to Stage 1 of the transition, where all implementations are to be updated to accept requests using both the older Connections and newer DID Exchange protocols. During that period, all deployments will continue ONLY to send requests using the older Connections protocol. Please see RFC 0496 for the details of the entire transition. 
 
 
 The Aries Working Group is requesting that all deployments of Aries:
 
 Support this transition 
 Update their code bases and deployments to achieve Step 1 of the transition. 
 Document their completion of that Step in the RFC (per instructions). 
 Monitor the conversation around RFC 0496 to be ready to go to Step 2 of the transition. 
 
 
 Please direct any questions to the Aries channel in <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger RocketChat</a>.

	 <a></a>1 ABSTRACT 
<p>TLDR: Common technical frameworks and app templates used by hundreds of organizations, when combined with technical weaknesses built into devices and operating systems from Google and Apple, are leading to unregulated and out of control student and parent data sharing to unexpected online advertising companies.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://me2ba.org/school-mobile-apps-student-data-sharing-behavior/">Spotlight Report #1 report</a> from May 2021, the Me2B Alliance Product Testing team audited and analyzed a random sample of 73 mobile applications on Android and iOS used by 38 schools in 14 states across the U.S. — apps used at least a half a million people (students, their families, educators, etc.).</p>
<p>The audit methodology in Spotlight Report #1 primarily consisted of evaluating the 3rd party code packages (also known as software development toolkits or “SDKs”) included in each app, using an external database with historical data on SDKs in apps, combined with a Me2BA risk scoring process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After publishing Spotlight Report #1, we were contacted by the Student Data Privacy Project to examine apps used by 18 schools/districts for their <a href="https://www.thesentinel.com/communities/parents-nationwide-file-complaints-with-u-s-dept-of-education-seek-to-address-massive-student/article_3133b6ce-e30e-11eb-9a6f-4b21a35875b0.html">FERPA Complaint with the Department of Education</a>. Our data supply testers noticed significant network traffic, well beyond the SDK channels, as well as certain legacy development tactics that relied upon in-app browsers opening websites within the apps. The hypothesis was that many of the school utility apps were using in-app WebView methods to display content, and this was, indeed, the culprit. The WebView development technique allows external websites to open within an app, without launching a separate browser (see Appendix A for an example, and guidance on how to spot this technique). This process results in all of the vendors integrated into a website receiving user data in the context of the app that opened that webpage within their in-app browser. For school utility apps, this so-called “context” typically includes the name of their school, or school district. We took a closer look at the network traffic to confirm the assumption and to determine the scope and scale of this data sharing.</p>
<p>Within the domains in the sample, we noticed significant amounts of network traffic associated with school sports pages and discovered a vendor providing sports scores for K-12 schools across the U.S. and monetizing their “free service” with extremely aggressive advertising monetization schemes, baked right into these taxpayers funded school utility apps.</p>
<p>The company providing this “free service for sports coaches” monetized with online advertising is MaxPreps.com, a subsidiary of CBS/Viacom, who are also the owners of the popular kids’ television channel, Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>We did not expect that our deep dive into WebView in-app browsers within K-12 school utility apps would end up requiring us to focus significant time researching a data supply chain owned by one of the largest media companies in the U.S., but we followed the data pipelines and the facts. As noted in Spotlight Report #1, in April 2021, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/technology/advertising-children-privacy.html">Disney, CBS/Viacom and about a dozen other companies</a> were parties to the largest settlement against brokers of kids’ data in U.S. history. CBS and other parties were required to make changes to some of their products and delete certain data. Yet MaxPreps seems to have never come up in that lawsuit, it’s never come up in any significant public reporting or research, and any changes to other CBS products as a result of the settlement do not appear to have not made their way to MaxPreps products. While MaxPreps was never mentioned in the California settlement and the details seemingly would not have required CBS/Viacom to make changes to their subsidiary MaxPreps, it’s clear that the behavior that the settlement pointed out, which CBS/Viacom agreed to stop, is similar if not worse within this subsidiary that offers free products for schools.</p>
<p>Our research took another unexpected turn in the course of the deep dive into MaxPreps, when we came across a handful of “<a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/dangling-domains/">dangling domains</a>.” We wrote about one such dangling domain in particular <a href="https://me2ba.org/dangling-domain-from-sdk-installed-in-150-apple-apps-putting-kids-families-and-crypto-traders-at-risk/">that Apple quietly purchased for $3,695</a> in late September 2021. The domain for sale was previously owned by a company that went bankrupt and the domain was integrated into a legacy SDK product across 159 mobile apps, with 155 of them being on Apple’s iOS marketplace, with a potential install base of tens of millions of devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the dangling domains, we also observed several hijacked domains leading to malicious sites. In at least one instance, we observed in dismay when a dangling domain was purchased by an unknown actor over the course of a few days. The following apps/domains fell prey to hijackers before we could intervene:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Santa Monica-Malibu USD Android App from Blackboard Inc. had a dangling domain of “Malibuhigh.org” – this domain still to this day hosts a fake legal website, and there could still be risks from Business Email Compromise schemes or other ways to abuse the fact that this was a real domain used by a school district in one of the wealthiest counties in the United States. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:smmusd.org">Here is a Google search result</a> showing files where this legacy domain was referenced as being valid – other government agencies communicated with this domain at different points in the past. 
 Maryland’s largest school district’s Android App, also from Blackboard Inc., already lost their sports domain by the time we figured it out, with Magruderathletics (WARNING).org being compromised and still hosting malicious redirects to this very day. After the Me2B Alliance alerted Blackboard Inc., they were able to quickly remove this domain from their active mobile app, reducing some of the risks. This is also an active domain, and <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/business-email-compromise">Business Email Compromise</a> risks for emails that originate from this domain (i.e. “@Magxxxxathletics.org”) remain a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-stole-650-000-from-nonprofit-and-got-away-showing-limits-to-law-enforcements-reach-11623058201">real threat</a>. 
 The Quinlan, Texas School District had a domain that went up for sale for $30 that was integrated into their Android app, which was purchased before anyone could take action. After the Me2B Alliance alerted Blackboard Inc., the dangling domain link was removed from the app, and subsequently the Android app was pulled down from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackboard.community.quinlanisd">the Google Play Store</a> 
 
<p>The research we are releasing today focuses on an intensive evaluation of 11 school utility apps (from an original pool of 18 apps) made by companies who support thousands of other schools with similar app frameworks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the use of WebView in school utility apps, and the operational challenges to maintain them, creates a significant channel for data sharing and also introduces serious security risks. If people using these mobile apps “can’t choose their own browser” they can’t make informed choices that empower them to block and stop some of these data transfers, which can be downright dangerous when an app for kids integrates dangling domains into WebView interfaces. If Google and Apple merely made a few changes to empower users over developers, these risks for schools, kids, parents, and administrators would nearly completely disappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These risks have been compounded by certain companies providing “free software for schools” that purposefully monetizes these free tools for apps and websites via data sharing and online advertising, with the new Me2B Alliance research focusing on the CBS/Viacom subsidiary called MaxPreps.com. Another way to think about this research is that we’ve attempted to point out a technical framework that numerous school utility apps are using, which utilizes a type of “Content Management System” (CMS) that allows school administrators to “add links” into an app, without actually submitting a new version of that app into the app store – and the links being added into the apps are merely web URLs, with the web content rendering within the app’s in-app browser. These websites rendering in the apps contain advertising pixels/javascript code, which then collect data within the apps when opened by users, and are sharing the access and user data with new companies – hundreds of them, sometimes more. Rarely do app privacy labels account for these data transfers, and neither the app makers, the schools, or the vendors collecting data within those apps and WebView URLs are currently taking accountability for making these kids user data flows safer. We’re surprised and alarmed by this “advertising for kids” architecture happening within school utility apps paid for by taxpayers, with some companies seemingly earning sizable revenues from these data pipelines. As a result, serious questions need to be asked of all the organizations participating in these schemes.</p>
<p>This report includes guidance on how to identify a school utility app with potentially unsafe WebView links in Appendix A, which we hope provides investigative journalists, data auditors, school administrators, parents, students, app developers, and everyone-in-between with a way to recognize when an app is opening web links.&nbsp;</p>

 <a></a>2 INTRODUCTION 
<p>After publishing our research across 73 school utility apps for Spotlight Report #1, we were contacted by the Student Data Privacy Project to examine apps used by 18 schools/districts for their <a href="https://www.thesentinel.com/communities/parents-nationwide-file-complaints-with-u-s-dept-of-education-seek-to-address-massive-student/article_3133b6ce-e30e-11eb-9a6f-4b21a35875b0.html">FERPA Complaint with the Department of Education</a>. Our data supply testers noticed that data was being sent to third parties beyond just the SDK channels for data sharing. Based on the visual layouts of the apps and our awareness that in-app browsers can create unexpected and unique risks, our hypothesis was that in-app browsing using WebView methods was the core culprit for these advertising companies showing up in our network logs. A simple way to think about these data sharing methods are “websites opening within apps.” Thus, we decided to take a closer look at the network traffic in a handful of apps from the FERPA research schools to validate the assumption and learn more about vendors operating in this space within school utility apps.</p>
<p>This research involved a smaller and deeper analysis, focused specifically on the data supply vendors within school utility apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we found not only validated the hypothesis that school utility apps use WebView in-app browsers extensively to serve content — indeed enabling more data sharing with third parties in unexpected ways –but we also discovered three other disturbing findings:</p>
 
 A website for school sports called Maxpreps.com, used by a large number of schools in the US, shares student data with an untold number of advertising companies. MaxPreps is owned by Viacom/CBS, a public company, named in <a>a landmark settlement</a>. The settlement required Viacom to remove cross-site identifiers related to a children’s app called “Llama Spit Spit” along with several other niche-requirements to comply with laws focused on kids’ data sharing. 
 We found several instances of hijacked domains previously owned by schools, leading directly to “parked domains” filled with online advertising.&nbsp; 
 We documented malicious pop-ups within school utility apps due to advertising data supply chain attacks by malicious advertisers promising “free gift cards.”&nbsp; 
 In addition to hijacked domains, we found several dangling domains, including the one mentioned in our <a href="https://me2ba.org/dangling-domain-from-sdk-installed-in-150-apple-apps-putting-kids-families-and-crypto-traders-at-risk/">blog</a> post from earlier this year.&nbsp; 
 
<p>During the auditing process, our team determined that the majority of school apps analyzed were built using app templates created and licensed by companies who provide app platforms (including the CMS-like backend administrative dashboard) to hundreds if not thousands of schools, and other types of community/religious organizations. In short, the apps were built with a common technical framework, and this practice is widespread, yet neither Apple nor Google seem to account for this behavior with specific in-app browser-default controls – letting users override the use of an in-app browser — a device feature, which would protect end-users from risks created by this legacy development practice.</p>
<p>Common technical frameworks – licensed app templates plus the CMS-like administrative portal – used across many organizations are leading to unregulated and out of control student and parent data sharing to unexpected online advertising and big tech vendors.</p>
<p>In order for many school apps to stay updated with relevant news, events and other details for students and parents, it is a common tactic for developers to integrate web pages directly into the apps, also known as a “WebView”<a>1</a> or an “in-app browser.” This technique allows the school to create menus of several links (URLs/domains) within the school apps that will open an in-app browser to view a related webpage with particular details about the school or program. The schools keep the details updated by maintaining the web pages that host the content or by relying on third party websites to keep content updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a method that allows the school to include dynamic, fresh information in mobile apps without having to update the app itself, and it’s particularly common for school calendars, lunch menus, and details about extracurricular activities and school events. The school’s app administrators update websites, and the apps “auto-update” with the new content from the pages. This is a helpful process to allow more people to provide content updates for apps, but it becomes problematic when those websites share data with unique advertising and analytics vendors. It becomes an emergency (as found during this research) when a school loses control over one of the domains integrated into their school apps, and an even bigger problem when that domain is controlled by spammers and scammers.</p>
<p>This problem would be mitigated if people could designate a default (and privacy respecting) browser to be the default browser used for in-app WebViews, and if Apple and Google didn’t make it possible for developers to override a user’s browser preference.</p>
 <a></a>2.1 What is WebView? 
<p>All mobile apps with an “in-app browser” are using “Webview” code/APIs, and the rules and protections for these in-app browsers are slightly unique between Apple iOS and Android platforms. Other devices / IOT use similar technical concepts, but Apple and Android have the most apps using this legacy practice as they have the oldest app marketplaces.</p>
<p>WebView is a low-level set of functions (APIs) provided by an operating system within a mobile device that allows native apps to present web pages, woven seamlessly into the application without having to open or close a separate browser. WebView allows native apps to selectively become a browser while keeping the user in the app.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2076732.2076781">2011 paper on WebView attacks&nbsp;against Android devices</a> explains this legacy development and data supply chain strategy:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“WebView is an essential component in both Android and iOS platforms, enabling smartphone and tablet apps to embed a simple but powerful browser inside them. To achieve a better interaction between apps and their embedded “browsers”, WebView provides a number of APIs, allowing code in apps to invoke and be invoked by the JavaScript code within the web pages, intercept their events, and modify those events. Using these features, apps can become customized “browsers” for their intended web applications.”<a>2</a></p>
<p>WebView in iOS relies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a>, an open-source browser “engine” first introduced 23 years ago in 1998, which later evolved into the Safari engine used by Apple around 2013. The WebView APIs are therefore limited by WebKit capabilities supported in the OS. iOS WebView is restricted and protected by iOS WebKit (built on Safari) limitations, and Android WebView is restricted and protected by a slightly similar concept with Chromium limitations. However, they both ultimately support in-app browsing as a seamless user experience without giving users full control over their own data sharing preferences within these in-app browsers.</p>
 <a></a>2.1.1 Apps That Open a Separate Browser 
<p>In contrast to the use of WebView, some apps will open external webpages by opening a separate browser. In this case, it’s obvious to the user of the app that they are no longer in the app and that they have been redirected to an external website in their default browser of choice. When the app opens a separate browser, it will use the user-specified default browser (privacy settings intact) thus allowing the user more control and security. This is the case on both Apple iOS and Android, although on both platforms app developers “get to choose” and can override user choices by loading an in-app browser instead of letting the user choose.</p>
<p>On Android, there have been some preference shifts that over the past few years that make it slightly easier to default an in-app browser, but these options are largely hidden and don’t seem to prevent app developers from deploying WebView content into apps.</p>
 <a></a>2.1.2 WebView in iOS 
<p>In iOS, original capabilities were provided through UIWebView and WebView.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year however,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=edwud51q">Apple started a process to deprecate some of the oldest aspects of App WebViews</a>, but the full deprecation deadline was paused seemingly due to Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10188/">also has a 30 minute video and support documentation</a>&nbsp;explaining how developers can update their apps from this legacy WebView coding practice into their more modern “WKWebView” practices, but it appears that no time table to depreciate this has been reset.</p>
<p>On iOS, WebView APIs are restricted by certain rules written into Safari’s Webkit browser, which has some tracking protections that are stronger than Android’s default Chromium browser frameworks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Safari’s WebView browsers don’t have the ability to send&nbsp;<a title="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">a “Global Privacy Control” (GPC) signal</a>&nbsp;to send signals to opt-out of data selling and sharing, even though this standard has made its way into both&nbsp;<a title="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-firefox-joins-browsers-implementing-global-privacy-control/" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-firefox-joins-browsers-implementing-global-privacy-control/">the Mozilla Firefox browser and the Brave browser</a>. If Safari’s WebView browsers supported the GPC, a “do not sell or share my data” signal would be sent to third party websites, which would express the preference of these users to opt-out of all data sharing and selling schemes they can legally opt-out of, which would help to keep users of all ages safer. A business can still “ignore” this GPC signal, but ignoring a preference creates unique exposure compared to no preferences being sent from a user via automated signals.</p>
 <a></a>2.1.3 WebView in Android 
<p>For Android developers,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview">Google’s flagship opensource mobile operating system still heavily relies on WebView pages</a>&nbsp;in apps, and to make matters worse,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview%22%20%5Cl%20%22UsingJavaScript">Google has detailed documentation about how to use JavaScript to increase the amount of user data being collected</a>&nbsp;via in-app WebView pages.</p>
<p>Google’s Android provides the ability for a user to set their default in-app browser, but app developers can still seemingly override this behavior and user choice.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>2.1.4 User Control of WebView-Launched Browser 
<p>Originally, users on both iOS and Android had no ability to specify the browser used by WebView, nor did they have access to any controls or settings for these in-app browsers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For iPhone users, there’s no ability to set a default browser to be used by mobile apps that open in-app web pages. Such an ability would ensure that any links open in a preferred, consistent environment, expressing data blocking preferences and automated signals of consent/opt-outs.&nbsp;While Safari’s WebView implementation could be argued is “safer, with less external data sharing” than the Android Chromium WebView implementation, partially due to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614">Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay</a> which protects network data sent within mobile apps. Yet Apple’s Safari still doesn’t have a way for users to transmit automated opt-out preferences via the Global Privacy Control or any other respected automated signals, even though this automated option is required under new California data privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike on Apple, for newer Android devices/users, there is an option to set a new default browser to open all in-app webpage links, though this feature is not heavily promoted. Moreover, Android apps appear to be able to override or ignore a user’s preference when opening an in-app&nbsp;WebView&nbsp;page, as observed&nbsp;during&nbsp;our research.</p>
<p>It appears Android has gone further than iOS to give users control of WebView in-app browsers, but it doesn’t appear that either platform gives full control to avoid these privacy pitfalls.</p>
 <a></a>2.2 How Pervasive is WebView? 
<p>It’s difficult to estimate what percentage of apps use WebView, but according to a WebView research paper from 2011 research:</p>
<p>“Currently, in the Android market, 86 percent of the top 20 most downloaded apps in 10 diverse categories use WebView.” 6</p>
<p>The use of WebView, however, is a very slowly fading coding practice, but there are a massive portion of legacy apps still using it. Even some new apps deploy in-app browsers due to the additional user data collection benefits they offer app makers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see the use of WebView in older apps that display web-based information, and for apps that conduct sophisticated user data profiling and advertising schemes —which is why Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and many other enterprise apps for large web services employed WebView.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the use of WebView is popular in utility apps built from generalized templates, a business strategy that enables profitable distribution of custom apps to a wide customer base. Virtually every legacy school utility app is precisely this kind of app, where it’s rare to not see an in-app browser being used in some way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for many school apps to stay updated, with relevant news, events and other details for students and parents, it is a common tactic for developers to integrate web pages directly into the apps – basically creating menus/links within the school apps that will open an in-app browser to view a webpage with custom information about the school — and the schools keep the details updated by maintaining the web pages that host the content.</p>
<p>In research released earlier this year, the Me2BA team found that the school apps in the research sample hadn’t been updated in 11.6 months on average. This statistic may have been slightly confusing for some parents due to the fact that the content seen in these schools’ apps was updated at a much higher frequency. This is due to these apps being built primarily with in-app WebView links, where the apps are mostly just opening website links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to explain it: the “app administrators” are actually updating websites, and the apps auto-update with the new content from the pages. This is a helpful process to allow more school personnel to provide content updates for apps, but there are risks involved for end-users because they can’t choose their own browser with consistent data sharing / opt-out preferences.</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://www.cpsb.org/cms/lib/LA01907308/Centricity/Domain/81/Blackboard%20Add%20Web%20Link.pdf">this publicly available tutorial</a> on Blackboard’s CMS admin panel provides clear instructions for school administrators on how to add URLs to their app. The tutorial also highlights a feature that makes it possible for school administrators of Blackboard school utility apps to open web links within the app or the user’s default browser (See Figure 1) – and by letting an admin turn off safety features with the toggle of a button, Blackboard has made all of the students, parents, teachers and administrators using their apps less safe.</p>
<p></p>

 <a></a>2.3 How Does WebView Enable Data Sharing? 
<p>In our previous research, we examined third-party data sharing through the use of SDKs (Software Development Kits). Another way data can be shared with third parties is when an app uses WebView to access third-party websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>User data is shared on a website opened via in-app browsers in exactly the same way it happens in a browser, but with fewer controls for end-users. Vendors integrated into these websites can collect network/IP address data, cookies, other local storage / mobile ID fields, and they can reshare this information to new vendors through the same developer tactics used on websites.</p>
<p>Many advanced mobile users have turned to ad blocker apps in order to try and minimize data flows within in-app browsers, but the vast majority of these ad blocker apps rely on “domain / request lists” in order to filter the extra sharing, which is a process that isn’t perfect and can’t protect against the most aggressive data collection efforts from unscrupulous vendors. The only way to truly stop this data sharing is at the device-level, with the support of the device operating system manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>2.4 What Information Gets Shared Using WebView? 
<p>For both iPhone and Android users, by default, the network data (IP address) is sent to most of the website vendors who collect data on any web pages that are triggered from in-app browsers. Including network data, these in-app web browsers can share cookies, fingerprint data and other local storage fields that are used to track users persistently over time.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, Apple began to test and roll out their new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614">iCloud Private Relay</a>, which obfuscates network data and should eventually protect against some types of tracking within WebView in-app browsers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, just like with SDKs, any and all personal information available to the app can be shared with third parties.</p>
 <a></a>2.5 Security Risks of Using WebView 
<p>There are several risks associated with using WebView in particular and using in-app browsers in general. We list only a couple here.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>2.5.1 Dangling Domains 
<p>It is frequently the case that links (domains) included in mobile apps very simply expire and become available for purchase in the open market. We call these “Dangling Domains”—domains that are actively being linked to in mobile apps, but no longer have a viable service provider associated with them. We found two flavors of this happening, and there are undoubtedly more:</p>
 
 Schools simply allow domains to expire, possibly due to personnel turnover, or simply due to credit card expiration. 
 The service provider using the domain goes out of business. See our recent <a href="https://me2ba.org/dangling-domain-from-sdk-installed-in-150-apple-apps-putting-kids-families-and-crypto-traders-at-risk/">blog</a> on this affecting over 150 iOS apps and potentially scores of millions of devices. 
 
 <a></a>2.5.2 Hijacked Domains 
<p>Dangling domains become problematic when those websites share data with unique advertising and analytics vendors, and it becomes an emergency (which we observed&nbsp;during&nbsp;this research) when a school loses control over one of these domains integrated into their school apps. It becomes an even bigger problem when that domain is “hijacked”, controlled by spammers and scammers as our research detailed below.&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Santa Monica-Malibu USD Android App from Blackboard Inc. had a dangling domain of “Malibuhigh.org” – this domain currently hosts a fake legal website, and there could still be risks from Business Email Compromise schemes or other ways to abuse the fact that this was a real domain used by a school district in one of the wealthiest counties in the United States. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:smmusd.org">Here is a Google search result</a> showing files where this legacy domain was referenced as being valid.&nbsp; 
 Maryland’s largest school district’s Android App, also from Blackboard Inc., already lost their sports domain by the time we figured it out, with Magruderathletics (WARNING).org being compromised and still hosting malicious redirects to this very day. After the Me2B Alliance alerted, Blackboard Inc., they were able to quickly remove this domain from their active mobile app, reducing some of the risks. This is also an active domain, and <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/business-email-compromise%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/business-email-compromise">Business Email Compromise</a> risks for emails that originate from this domain (i.e. “@Magxxxxathletics.org” remain a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-stole-650-000-from-nonprofit-and-got-away-showing-limits-to-law-enforcements-reach-11623058201%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank%22%20%5Co%20%22https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-stole-650-000-from-nonprofit-and-got-away-showing-limits-to-law-enforcements-reach-11623058201">real threat</a>. 
 The Quinlan, Texas School District had a domain that went up for sale for $30 that was integrated into their Android app, which was purchased before anyone could take action. After the Me2B Alliance alerted Blackboard Inc., the dangling domain link was removed from the app, and subsequently the Android app was pulled down from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackboard.community.quinlanisd">the Google Play Store</a>.&nbsp; 
 
 <a></a>3 METHODOLOGY 
 <a></a>3.1 Sample Selection 
<p>As with Spotlight Report #1, this research examined school utility apps, which are apps used for communication and sharing between students, parents, and school personnel. We used the list of 18 schools/districts that we investigated for <a href="https://www.thesentinel.com/communities/parents-nationwide-file-complaints-with-u-s-dept-of-education-seek-to-address-massive-student/article_3133b6ce-e30e-11eb-9a6f-4b21a35875b0.html">the Student Data Privacy’s FERPA Complaint with the Department of Education</a>, where we explored the SDKs used in the apps (similar to Spotlight Report #1). Seven of the schools required accounts/logins in order to use the apps, which we were unable to obtain. Thus, we were able to examine some of the apps more deeply than others.</p>
 <a></a>3.2 Data Collection 
<p>For this research, the data collection consists of two steps:</p>
 
 Determining which apps include WebView, and 
 Assembling a list of domains linked to by each app that uses WebView. 
 
<p>During the analysis portion of our research, our team realized that the vast majority of unique advertising requests were initiated within the apps through MaxPreps.com webpages integrated into the “Sports” tabs of the school utility apps. Thus, the testing focused on opening Sports tabs in the apps, in particular.</p>
<p>There are a few common methods to definitively detect WebView use in a mobile app. Please refer to Appendix A for tips on how you can determine if your app is launching an in-app browser.&nbsp;</p>
 
 For more advanced developers or heavy app users, the visual rendering of content within a WebView in-app browser will be noticeable because it loads more like a website (sometimes in stages, sometimes with long load times for large pages), compared to a mobile app where the content has sometimes already been downloaded with the app and the content appears instantaneously. This method can be used as an early indicator prior to more sophisticated network capture tests. 
 One method that works for Android apps and open-source apps (iOS app packages are encrypted and analyzing any source code is uniquely challenging compared to Android) entails analyzing the app source code to see if it is using WebView APIs. There are multiple ways to perform this analysis, one example <a href="https://web.ecs.syr.edu/~wedu/Research/paper/webview_acsac2011.pdf">here</a>. Typically, this method involves examining the app source code for inclusion of the WebView class in the app, although this method should be double checked against the “live app experience” (actually download/use the app on a sandboxed device) because subtle app code and platform changes can trigger these legacy code samples now opening links in the user’s default browser and not within in-app browsers. 
 Another method is to use a software tool to capture and log the network traffic via a proxy/Monster in the Middle (MiTM) connection, using a tool such as <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a> helps to analyze network traffic from the app to third party sites and makes it possible to parse the vendor request and response headers and body payloads for unique ingestions or sharing of user data. 
 
<p>For this research, we utilized the last method to log and capture the network traffic, which we believe is more accurate as it captures the fine-grained details of the user data ingestions and sharing between the app and 3rd party vendors.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>3.3 Data Collection Strategy 
<p>Our testers captured network traffic while using 36 apps representing 18 schools/districts. We conducted manual client-side testing which included navigating around the app, attempting to click all potential links within app menus, and exercising multiple functions in the app in order to find latent URLs triggered by deeper use of the app. Charles Proxy recorded all the domains connected to during the testing. See Appendix H for a sample list of 189 de-duped domains on the “Sports” tab powered by MaxPreps.com within just two Blackboard apps.</p>
<p>When we became aware of the high network activity on the sports pages in apps, we deliberately more deeply probed those pages, which we knew generated sizable ad related traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inherent limitations in this manual testing method are:</p>
 
 It’s not identical from app to app. Our purpose was to “click all the links” so our testers could attempt this until they were satisfied, yet this process does create unique results per app, and the order of clicking links is unique per test. This mostly impacts the analysis, and has minimal impact on whether advertising is shown or specific vendor selections within any one advertising supply chain. 
 The testing didn’t systematically execute every single possible path in the app user experience (UX). We may have missed other harmful links, so don’t hesitate to let us know if you are familiar with any problematic kids’ data brokers. 
 Since external links branch off into numerous (potentially countless) other external sites, the testing didn’t examine every externally linked branch of every possible path in the app UX, down to its terminus. The numbers presented later in the findings section are illustrative only. The reality is that if we’d tested longer, the number of external advertising data transfers would continually rise. 
 The findings represent a single snapshot in time and would likely be different in quality if they were rerun today. 
 
<p>Automated testing could have removed the first limitation above but wasn’t an option as automated testing would have prevented or impacted many of the ad syncs altogether, in addition to a number of other limitations. Automated testing would also have created other challenges and prevented our ability to detect key findings such as:</p>
 
 Many schools have significant problems with their sports feature built via MaxPreps. 
 Dangling domains are displayed to end-users in visually inconsistent ways, we would have likely missed one of the dangling domains being briefly available for sale for $30.

 <a></a>3.4 Analysis 
<p>We conducted an analysis of the unique domains invoked by all the apps during the data collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be noted that once we realized the “Sports” tabs were full of online banner ads, and syncing unique vendors with every page load, several of the test sessions of these apps and data flows from the MaxPreps sports pages, were merely “refreshing the sports tab” for 5-10 minutes to capture a sample of the advertising vendors who received data within the app. We were not focused on capturing the brands buying ads within MaxPreps, but our screenshots below include major brands like Best Buy, Amazon, Cisco and Bertolli.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note, however, that this was mainly an exercise in curiosity to provide a rough order of magnitude of the kinds of links being invoked. It should only be regarded as informational and not normative or prescriptive. If the tests had gone on longer, we would expect to find new advertising vendors, and our research into the data supply chains across MaxPreps content should be considered a “snapshot.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>And important part of our analysis entails desktop traffic capture using the tool <a href="https://www.crownpeak.com/products/tag-monitoring-and-management">Trackermap from Evidon</a>. Figure 2, below is an example of the “network traffic” captured from one of the MaxPreps school pages. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2 MaxPreps Network Traffic Map</p>
<p>This network traffic map merely demonstrates some of the controller, processor, and co-controller flows of user data across one page load and outside the context of the school utility mobile apps. Within the school utility apps, if a user refreshed the sports pages, numerous more vendors were being captured through the advertising syncs, which we captured in our live tests with real mobile devices.</p>
<p>When auditing any page or app with active advertising supply chains, it’s important to remember that there are tens of thousands of advertising companies globally, and it’s common for unique advertising vendors to receive data before an ad is shown, and then more unique vendors to receive data after an ad is shown. The advertising bidstream is also a constant flow of user data, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k78ewv/bidstream-data-google-twitter-att-verizon-foreign">a whole separate can of worms</a>. These advertising data flows create a significant sprawl of user data, and depending on where a test is being conducted, unique regional advertising companies are likely to receive data for any one specific advertising supply chain test. Due to these realities, the significant list of advertising companies who received user data from the MaxPreps advertising flows, within school utility apps, should be considered a baseline of data sharing with significantly more data sharing occurring for other users, in other locations, and at other times of the year. In short, what we found was very bad, but the reality is significantly worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the advertising vendors we were able to capture with this process, we distilled all the unique domains invoked by the apps, identified the business owner of the URL, and assigned a risk rating similar to our SDK risk rating in Spotlight Report #1. Table 3 describes the risk ratings for the unique domains. Note that “Malicious” maps to detected malicious redirects. (See <a href="https://product.voxmedia.com/2018/1/22/16902862/why-ads-redirect-to-giftcards-and-what-were-doing-to-secure-them">this</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/technology/personaltech/battling-adware-that-redirects-your-browser.html">this</a> for more information on malicious redirects.)</p>

 <a></a>4 FINDINGS 
 <a></a>4.1 MaxPreps&nbsp; 
<p>Through our examination of the domains called by the school utility apps, we noticed one standout was present in every school utility app provided by Blackboard, Inc., which was MaxPreps.com. Maxpreps.com is a <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/utility/aboutus.aspx">school sports scores and analysis platform owned by CBS Viacom</a>, who are also the public media company who own the children’s television channel Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>MaxPreps is ostensibly a valuable tool for parents, students, school staff and fans to follow their teams. The problem, however, is that it is a self-avowed advertising platform (see section 4.1.1), that provides no transparency, consent, or control for the aggressive advertising supply chains integrated into their pages, and subsequently integrated into school utility apps via WebView.</p>
<p>Troublingly, we found MaxPreps.com in apps for schools that had students likely under the age of 16, due to the inclusion of Freshman and JV sports data.<a>3</a></p>
<p>MaxPreps provides a free service for coaches and team management tools, with marketing language on pages including: “High School coaches get FREE access to team management and communication tools.” (source @ <a href="https://secure.maxpreps.com/utility/member/login.aspx">https://secure.maxpreps.com/utility/member/login.aspx</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3 MaxPreps Sign In Page</p>
 <a></a>4.1.1 Advertising on MaxPreps 
<p>Currently, MaxPreps offers 17 different advertising formats as shown in Appendix D. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is a video of navigating a MaxPreps-powered school sports page in a Blackboard app, with ads that were shown:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Video 1: MaxPreps-powered Sport Page in Blackboard App</p>
<p>From a high-level, there should be no taxpayer funded mobile apps for schools that have online advertising within them – this should be a hard and fast rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inclusion of MaxPreps advertising vendors within in-app webpages within school utility apps demands that the advertising on these pages be “technically sandboxed” so that they can’t trigger pop-ups or malicious experiences/redirects/downloads — and the types of ads shown in these apps should be contextual and significantly limiting any user data ingestions. Unfortunately, during our research, we captured both a malicious pop-up network that was breaking the functionality whenever it triggered, served via the Kargo SSP advertising vendor, as seen below in Figure 2, as well as malicious redirects and pop-ups within several of the “Sites” within the MaxPreps’ Sports tabs that had custom domains, where apparently schools forgot to re-register the domain, and the domains were subsequently scooped-up by malicious advertising actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p>Here is a short video of the malicious pop-ups in a Blackboard app available to students, parents and teachers: &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Video 2: Malicious Pop-ups in Blackboard School Utility App</p>
<p>MaxPreps also has advertising from Google on many of the pages, which includes behavioral retargeting ads and syncs people’s data to numerous new advertising companies before and after the auctions. The full list of advertising vendors who received data can be requested by contacting the Me2B Alliance at services@me2ba.org.</p>
<p>The MaxPreps search pages (Figure 5, below, shown here on a desktop connection), which let you sort by “Schools,” “Athletes” and “Videos” includes ads from the public advertising company Taboola, which consistently serves up inappropriate ads and links to low quality websites.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 5 Example of Google Advertising on MaxPreps Website</p>
 <a></a>4.1.2 How Many Schools Use MaxPreps? 
<p>According to the MaxPreps website, MaxPreps partners with over 200,000 school coaches throughout the United States (source: <a href="https://support.maxpreps.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004604407-About-MaxPreps">https://support.maxpreps.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004604407-About-MaxPreps</a>). Based on the website’s vast list of teams, thousands of schools in the United States use MaxPreps.</p>
<p>Several resources on the MaxPreps website flaunt the reach of the service. Figure 3 is a portion of the “<a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/documents/CoachHandout.pdf">Coach Handout</a>”, flaunting that the site “already has your school information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 6 MaxPreps Coach Handout</p>
<p>Note that you can use the <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/search/default.aspx?type=school&amp;search=&amp;state=al&amp;gendersport=">public MaxPreps search interface</a> (Figure 6) to find out if your school may be using MaxPreps within your school mobile apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7 MaxPreps School Search</p>
<p>When attempting to determine the scale of schools potentially using this MaxPreps software, it became clear that MaxPreps claims to only work with High School students, but there are countless private and Christian schools who have K-12 curriculum, who are being “serviced” by MaxPreps. For example, Victory Christian Academy, in Chula Vista, California, has a K-12 curriculum, and is frequently covered by MaxPreps. This raises questions about whether certain school apps have users under the age of 13 interacting with the “sports” tab connected to a MaxPreps scoreboard, filled with online advertising.</p>
 <a></a>4.1.3 MaxPreps advertising being purchased by the U.S. Military&nbsp; 
<p>To our surprise, for at least some period of time, MaxPreps was used by the military to serve military recruitment ads to high school students, and one of the example advertising documents from CBS Interactive on MaxPreps is for the U.S. Army National Guard, with the text of the ad saying:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Serve Part-Time</p>
<p>Learn what makes the Citizen-Soldiers of the Army National Guard different. Find out how they serve their communities as well as their country, part time. Click here for more information.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.cbsinteractive.com/advertise/MaxPreps_Mobile_Wall_Post.doc">https://www.cbsinteractive.com/advertise/MaxPreps_Mobile_Wall_Post.doc</a></p>
<p>In 2015, MaxPreps was mentioned in 3 federal contracts from the Department of Defense, Department of the Army, with all three from the “…Readiness Center” – likely all focused on recruitment. (See Figure 9)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 9 US Government MaxPreps Contracts</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://sam.gov/search/?index=_all&amp;pageSize=25&amp;page=1&amp;sort=-modifiedDate&amp;sfm%5Bstatus%5D%5Bis_active%5D=true&amp;sfm%5Bstatus%5D%5Bis_inactive%5D=true&amp;sfm%5Bkeywords%5D%5B0%5D%5Bkey%5D=Maxpreps&amp;sfm%5Bkeywords%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=Maxpreps">https://sam.gov/search/?index=_all&amp;pageSize=25&amp;page=1&amp;sort=-modifiedDate&amp;sfm%5Bstatus%5D%5Bis_active%5D=true&amp;sfm%5Bstatus%5D%5Bis_inactive%5D=true&amp;sfm%5Bkeywords%5D%5B0%5D%5Bkey%5D=Maxpreps&amp;sfm%5Bkeywords%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=Maxpreps</a></p>
<p>It appears only one contract that mentioned MaxPreps was awarded to a company called “RED CARROT INC” for $4,301,517 and the phrasing of the contracts makes it appear that only a portion of this $4.3 million would have gone to MaxPreps advertising, with the money being spent on other apps and websites. MaxPreps was however mentioned by name in the title of these Requests for Proposals. The details of the federal contracts can be seen <a href="https://sam.gov/search/?index=_all&amp;pageSize=25&amp;page=1&amp;sort=-modifiedDate&amp;sfm%5Bstatus%5D%5Bis_active%5D=true&amp;sfm%5Bstatus%5D%5Bis_inactive%5D=true&amp;sfm%5Bkeywords%5D%5B0%5D%5Bkey%5D=Maxpreps&amp;sfm%5Bkeywords%5D%5B0%5D%5Bvalue%5D=Maxpreps">here</a>.</p>
 <a></a>4.1.4 Obsolete Data Still Being Monetized with Online Advertising<br>
 
<p>MaxPreps seems to have profiles for private schools like the “<a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/va/christiansburg/pathway-christian-academy/">Pathway Christian Academy</a>”&nbsp;(see Figure 10 below) in Christiansburg, Virginia, and various pages for sports at this school (volleyball @ <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/pathway-christian-academy-(christiansburg,va)/volleyball/home.htm">https://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/pathway-christian-academy-(christiansburg,va)/volleyball/home.htm</a>) yet the Pathway Christian Academy seems to no longer exist and have been replaced by the <a href="http://www.vatechniques.com/staff">Virginia Techniques Training Center</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10 Obsolete School Data with Ads in MaxPreps</p>
<p>Why does MaxPreps continue to make new team pages for a school that seemingly doesn’t exist anymore? Why are so many pages across MaxPreps empty, yet still serving advertising from major brands?&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.1.5 Other Noteworthy Behavior in MaxPreps: 
 
 MaxPreps uses kids’ photos on website pages that are filled with online advertising. For further example, please see Appendix E. 
 We found it peculiar that MaxPreps heavily relies on freelance photographers, who license their photos to MaxPreps without compensation. Photographers are only paid a portion of sales when a photo is purchased from the MaxPreps website, and apparently not a portion of any advertising revenues. Please see Appendix F for more details.&nbsp; 
 MaxPreps generates “profiles” for athletes without their knowledge or consent and prompts other users to “follow” the profile to get alerts for when new photos are added to the site. Please see Appendix G for more information. 
 
 <a></a>4.2 Dangling &amp; Hijacked Domains: An Unexpected Security &amp; Privacy Risk 
<p>The research into the 18 apps unexpectedly revealed another serious and urgent set of risks caused by the use of WebView in mobile apps: expired, embedded URLs (“dangling domains”) that have been acquired (“hijacked) by bad actors. When the domain is hijacked by a bad actor, the compromised website can result in an array of harms to students through malicious website redirects including flagrant collection of personal information for spam purposes, and links to inappropriate websites (such as pornographic content), or scam credit card/gift card offers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 11 Hijacked Domain with an Amazon Gift Card Scam</p>
<p>Here is a video of a dangling domain within a Blackboard app: &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Video 3: Dangling Domain in a Blackboard App</p>
<p>Figure 12 (below) shows a screenshot of a dangling domain within a Blackboard app for a school that was briefly available for purchase for $30. This was an example of a domain that was briefly lost and then the team at Blackboard, after being alerted to the problem by our team, were able to take action by removing the domain from the app and subsequently the Android app was pulled down from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackboard.community.quinlanisd">the Google Play Store</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 12 Dangling Domain</p>
<p>Our team reached out to the internationally recognized anti-malware researchers at Confiant.com with some early details about these compromised websites within apps. The&nbsp;Confiant&nbsp;team was able to confirm the problem existed and pointed our team to additional malware research that had found similar exploits in the past that triggered pop-up ads and other low quality advertising experiences. The Me2B Alliance deeply appreciates the support from&nbsp;Confiant and their work.</p>
<p>We are willing to discuss additional details and concerns with any U.S.-based cybersecurity companies who contact us.</p>
<p>After confirming that several U.S. schools had apps that were hosting compromised websites that injected scams and aggressively shared the student and parent user data, our team reached out to Blackboard’s security team with detailed information about our disconcerting findings. Blackboard responded quickly, and we appreciated the thoroughness of their response: they confirmed early research, they alerted schools, and they removed links from existing apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s unknown if any students or parents at the impacted schools were alerted, and the serious ongoing Business Email Compromise risks from the compromised school domains remain. This warrants more widescale notifications to school districts and states, as well as parents and administrators to alert them that emails from the compromised domains are illegitimate and potentially harmful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, our team still has strong concerns about advertising companies who ingested data via these compromised apps, and we have concerns for any ad buyers who could have been defrauded by these advertising companies allowing these monetization schemes to exist for criminal domain squatters and hijackers.</p>
<p>We could find no indication of a business relationship between Blackboard and MaxPreps, but MaxPreps was integrated into the “Sports” section of every Blackboard app we tested. Nonetheless, app template providers like Blackboard should be taking more steps to make sure their mobile apps are safe from extraneous data sharing from vendors like MaxPreps, or any other vendor who operates advertising networks. (We question whether any webpage that is run by an advertising network should ever be in a K-12 school app.) The safety of this supply chain and technical infrastructure is someone’s responsibility (see also Section 4.4).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We support GDPR regulations and any privacy frameworks that place accountability squarely on the “data controllers”, which we believe companies like Blackboard to be. The data flows that occur in the context of a WebView in-app browser are integrated into that app, no matter the domain integrated into that architecture by any administrator. The core app template architecture creates the risks, which we believe companies like Blackboard should acknowledge, so that they can make changes to their own app code to make these school utility apps safer. In particular, an app admin should not be able to turn off a privacy feature that impacts end-users of the app. Blackboard and any company operating in the school utility ecosystem needs to disable any features that allow this “safety toggling” concept.</p>
<p>As it stands, we’re still waiting for companies like Blackboard to change their systems, but this process is deeply complex due to the shared ownership of their apps with client schools and school districts. Apple and Google can also make changes to their underlying operating systems in Android and iOS that would help all companies like Blackboard comply with user choice and preferences. If this change happened at the operating system level, it would save hundreds of millions of dollars in development costs for developers who want to give users the ability to select their own in-app browsers, without also having to rewrite all their legacy code and apps.</p>
<p>We appreciate that companies like Blackboard are “between a rock and a hard place” and believe that raising these issues in a transparent way will help move these challenging debates forward.</p>
 <a></a>4.3 Extensive Data Sharing Through WebView / In-app Browsers 
<p>Note: This section is provided as informational only and should be viewed as an illustrative “snapshot” of the findings from the manual testing sessions of the apps shown earlier in Tables 1 and 2. This information is included to give a sense of the magnitude of the situation.</p>
<p>This current analysis exposed yet another data conduit to third parties, beyond the use of SDKs. Namely, the practice of including embedded browsers in apps, using WebView (in both Android and iOS apps). Mobile apps with embedded browsers can easily communicate and are sharing student data with an unbounded universe of third parties via URLs/requests from these WebView-invoked vendors – usually sent using JavaScript. The “context” of the app is sent with these third-party requests through a “referrer field” or “path field” which tells advertisers the name of the app being used, creating risks when the app is for K-12 students, parents, teachers and administrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, users have no choice or control over the use of an in-app browser when the app developers overrule preferences, which means school utility app users can’t configure browser privacy settings, or enable a privacy signal such as the <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a> signal. Both Apple and Android have some protections on in-app browsers, but they are minimal and the inability for users to always overrule an app and choose their browser of choice to open web links exacerbates the risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linking to a single webpage within an in-app browser oftentimes results in numerous outbound requests to new vendors. This can go very badly (i.e. hundreds of potential third parties) when the linked webpage is run by an advertising entity who is hosting banner or video ads on the pages.</p>
<p>Troublingly, WebView is particularly common in school utility apps<a>4</a>. The sample size was small, but based on our past experience auditing school apps and awareness of vendors in this ecosystem, we believe that in-app browsers are prevalent due to this process costing less to build and maintain for the tech vendors, and being easier to maintain for non-technical school administrators.</p>
<p>To quantify the magnitude of the situation, through less than 3 “sessions” using each of the apps, we found:</p>
 
 Over 650 unique external URLs were invoked in 11 Android apps, 73% of the links were advertising or analytics related, 9.5% of the links were ostensibly appropriate, but had an unacceptable level of advertising connected to them, and 3% of the links were hijacked domains leading to malicious sites. 
 Over 550 unique external URLs were invoked in 6 iOS apps, 66% of the links were advertising or analytics related, 8% of the links were appropriate but had an unacceptable level of advertising connected to them 
 
<p>The number of external URLs students are sharing data with each day could easily number in the thousands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will each of these vendors be alerted that they could have ingested data from users under 13? Will the advertising companies like Google and Taboola, who hosted the banner ads on pages, be required to alert advertising vendors who synced data from any of these school apps? In California, will users under 16 have their data deleted? If the app can’t tell the difference between an under 13/16 user and other users, should all the data be deleted and vendors encouraged to delete all the data they ingested under that “it could be under 13” threshold? Will these vendors who ingested data from these URLs be required to delete or modify any algorithms and models they optimized using data from these apps?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to once again underscore the fact that this wasn’t necessarily “apples to apples” testing, and the numbers, while large, are likely small subsets of the actual numbers, given the limits of our testing and the reality of advertising data supply chains. There are no conclusions to be drawn with respect to “iOS versus Android” here. The value of the findings has to do with the sheer volume of third parties and the distribution of the kinds of URLs included. If our testing sessions were longer and exercised more functionality, it would have yielded an infinite list of linked URLs from advertising companies.</p>
<p>In short, if 73% of third-party URLs included in these apps are advertising related, this means that students’ and/or parent’s data is being shared with potentially thousands of advertising entities every time students use the app during the course of a school year.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.4 Who is the Data Controller for Apps Built from Licensed School App Templates? 
<p>Our research from earlier this year showed that privacy policies for school utility apps were often inaccurate and inadequate. This current, deeper analysis, including a discussion with a team from Blackboard, underscored the reality of “data controller confusion” for licensed app templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of school utility apps, the school is often the customer of the technology/platform provider, and in the supplier agreement, the school (licensee) typically is understood as the data controller for the app, and the technology provider (licensor) is absolved of any data controller responsibilities (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">following a Section 230 protections line of reasoning</a>). Further, while the team conducting this research are not lawyers, functions like a radio button to toggle off security and privacy features in a CMS back-end dashboard may possibly void Section 230 protections. The serious problem here, however, is that the school may not be aware of what those responsibilities are, and worse, may not really know they’re responsible. Which begs a larger question of, who is the data controller—or perhaps more accurately—who are the data co-controllers in the case of apps built from licensed school app templates? And who are the data processors? And when there are technical loopholes and missing safeguards to protect kids from being profiled by advertising companies, who along this data supply chain is required to take action?</p>
<p>Important to note that this business model (licensed app templates) isn’t unique to EdTech; this is a pervasive business model for which data controller/data processor roles between the platform provider and the licensee must—and likely will eventually—be clarified in the courts.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.5 Key Insights – Summary 
<p>In summary, the key insights from this research are the following:</p>
 
 Mobile apps using embedded browsers (both iOS and Android) present an alternate channel by which personal information can – systematically and at scale – be sent to third parties.
 
 It is, therefore, insufficient to analyze only the SDKs in a mobile app to assess data flow to third parties. And due to the time-based reality of new advertising vendors being synced before and after advertising auctions, these types of data supply chains create infinite risk for students, parents, teachers and administrators. 
 
 
 Mobile apps that include embedded browsers have been found to include hijacked domains with active malicious redirects. More care needs to be taken by schools both for the user data privacy and security implications, but also due to the massive potential harm from business email compromise schemes. It’s our hope at the Me2B Alliance that security experts at the Department of Education, DHS, CISA and FBI are thinking about the risks from public and private schools losing access to their domains, and the ecosystem risks from this behavior being coupled with any criminal business email compromise schemes. 
 There is a thriving practice for bad actors to constantly scan for expired URLs and purchase them, inserting malicious redirects for data collection (advertising/drive by download honeypots), or other harmful tactics. We observed in real time at least one school-related-dangling-domain get purchased by an unknown actor (i.e. not related to the school). Whose responsibility is it to prevent and who should be alerted when the domains are lost? 
 Neither iOS nor Android app stores require developers to disclose either the use of WebView, or the included URLs in the app information label, making it impossible for users to understand with whom their data is being shared. Apps are also not required to prominently note the types of advertising within their apps, and whether advertising vendors who bid and win the chance to serve an ad in the app get an opportunity to sync additional data from the user. 
 The providers of technology (including licensable mobile app templates) are accountable for data processing practices that occur within the context of their app template WebView pages, yet legacy development practices coupled with mobile operating systems not fully supporting user choice for preventing in-app browsers, are making it nearly impossible to keep non-technical customers’ users safe from harm. 
 
 <a></a>5 Me2BA Recommendations 
 <a></a>5.1 Schools 
 
 All schools/districts that have students under the age of 13, and all schools in California that have students under the age of 16, who are using the Blackboard Mobile Communications App and who have added MaxPreps.com into the app:
 
 Immediately remove the MaxPreps.com link from their school/district apps. 
 Immediately send an email to <a href="mailto:support@maxpreps.com">support@maxpreps.com</a> and ask whether MaxPreps can support deletion requests for your schools’ users to the advertising vendors like Google and Taboola. 
 
 
 School app administrators need to be trained on the risks of embedding URLs in apps.
 
 School app administrators should recognize that if they can’t audit a page for advertising or analytics vendors, then they need to find help. 
 Coaches and all school staff need to be warned about digital product monetization schemes and everyone should know the mantra, “if the product is free, you are the product.”&nbsp; 
 
 
 Schools and school districts must have processes in place to:
 
 Keep track of all owned URLs, especially when embedded into mobile apps used by students, parents, teachers and administrators,&nbsp; 
 Ensure that URLs aren’t expiring (due to expired credit cards, etc.).&nbsp; 
 Have a plan for what to do if a domain expires, because a compromised domain for a school could lead to significant Business Email Compromise or specific types of payment fraud against a State or the Federal government. &nbsp; 
 
 
 
 <a></a>5.2 MaxPreps.com/Viacom 
 
 Immediately remove all student data for children under the age of 16, because it was obtained without consent or awareness and it could be impossible to determine what data is under 13 and what data is under 16,&nbsp;
 
 If it’s impossible to determine which users are under the age of 13/16, all data should be purged that was received from school utility apps. 
 
 
 Immediately remove all of the online advertising from the pages integrated within all school utility apps until all behavioral retargeting ads are turned off, all inappropriate ads are turned off, and unsafe data transfers are turned off.&nbsp;
 
 We believe that a full removal of all advertising is the correct initial course and anything less than a full removal of the advertising from these pages will need to be coupled with concrete details about what is being done to give users control and transparency of the advertising data sharing. 
 
 
 Strongly consider not serving online advertising on MaxPreps webpages served within apps until Google and Apple update settings that gives students, parents, teachers and administrators the ability to open in-app WebView links via a browser of their choice.&nbsp; 
 Consider ending the monetization of all MaxPreps.com content with online advertising, not only the content served within school utility apps, but the content on the website too.&nbsp; 
 
 <a></a>5.3 Apple and Google 
 
 The fastest, most efficient way to reduce the serious risks of student data sharing to advertising companies, and malicious redirects through acquisition of expired URLS is for Apple and Google/Android to immediately update their operating systems to allow users to designate a safe default browser for use by in-app embedded browsers, and not let developers overrule that choice. The default browser choice that users should choose should be a browser that is configured to the highest level of privacy and security, such as the Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox, or the Brave browser on iOS devices. Further, the default browser should also be one capable of sending the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal, for maximum privacy (which Safari cannot do yet, although Mozilla’s Firefox and the Brave browser both can send this additional GPC opt-out signal).&nbsp; 
 App privacy labels within the app marketplaces (or any marketplace with an approval process is the data controller for the user data flows within those apps that use marketplace/operating system-derived metadata) must include all third parties who are receiving data – including those receiving data via WebView data flows.
 
 This means the app label needs to include all URLs invoked in the app. 
 Apps should not be able to claim that they don’t track users, if they embed in-app WebView webpages with significant amounts of user data transfers to advertising companies, and active online advertising auctions within these pages. 
 If an app is using online advertising, especially in school utility apps, there needs to be significantly more work done to document all advertising vendors within that data supply chain. If you are the data controller of the app and have partners who monetize this app with online advertising, you take on the obligation of documenting your data processors and co-data-controllers. 
 
 
 
 <a></a>5.4 Developers of licensable, templatized apps (like Blackboard) with in-app browsers 
 
 Include security features in your app configuration service to keep your customers’ users safe—especially when they are children. For example:
 
 The CMS admin panel should default to—and possibly only allow—links to open in a separate browser. Why should admins be able to turn off a privacy and security feature? 
 System should automatically check if a newly entered URL is active before saving the entry.&nbsp; 
 System should automatically periodically (daily) check if client-entered URLs are still active and should alert the app administrator about any dangling domains, and disable any calls to them. 
 System should present highly visible and understandable warnings that expired URLs present serious security risks to their users.&nbsp; 
 System should warn users about the risks for embedded websites via in-app browsers, especially when training for these risks could be the difference between a safe way for students and parents to learn about their school sports program, and the current dystopic reality where an entire company has been created with “free products for coaches” which is actually a product being heavily monetized with online advertising – the kids were the product all-along. 
 
 
 
 <a></a>5.5 Federal, State and Local Policy Makers 
 
 Schools need more training and support to understand and fulfill their duties as Data Controllers and Co-Data Controllers, especially when any student data could be shared with online advertising companies.&nbsp; 
 Schools need resources to be able to “check that their websites and apps are safe from unexpected external data transfers” – and if schools are using vendors who contract across numerous local, state and federal jurisdictions, providing software for a wide variety of schools, there should be federal standards to require these vendors to operate both in good faith and with an acknowledgement that when any utility app for schools is unsafe, it’s usually just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; 
 The Department of Education should consider launching a “privacy bounty program” similar to technical bug bounty programs, to support the public spending time auditing school mobile apps and websites. 
 Schools and School Districts should be required to report lost or dangling domains within a specific period of time, so that the public and other government administrators know that emails from these domains can no longer be trusted. A public registrar of formerly-government-owned-domains would also be useful – the vast majority of these are on .com, .org &amp; .us domain suffixes, as any .gov or .edu domains are apparently more easily recovered. 
 
 <a></a>6 Appendix A – How to Spot WebView Pages in a Mobile App 
<p>Sometimes it’s obvious to detect the launch of an external website from within a mobile app through the recognition of popular brand (like Facebook for example). Other times, it can be harder to distinguish. If you want to be exceedingly certain, we suggest following the methods outlined in Section 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some ways to detect the use of WebView through the interface:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 13 Example WebView Page</p>
<p>Things to look for on the page:</p>
 
 Is there a different color scheme on the page? 
 Is there a large, new logo and brand name on the page (like “MaxPreps” on Figure 13)? 
 Did the page load differently / more slowly and piecemeal? 
 Are there ads on the page (like the car dealership ad in Figure 13)? 
 Is there a new Sign-in button?&nbsp; 
 Is there a separate “hamburger menu” button (usually 3 lines or dots)? 
 Do you see pop-up advertising like the Amazon Prime ad from the Kargo SSP, seen above? 
 
 <a></a>7 Appendix B – Data Flow Analysis Using TrackerMap 
<p>The screenshots below are from a paid tool from Crownpeak called “Trackermap” – the colored nodes are unique vendors receiving data. The vast majority of these data transfers would be “a surprise” to app makers and typically none of these data transfers are accounted for in Apple / Google privacy labels or other types of legal disclosures. Most lawyers don’t know these data flows exist, and many app developers don’t understand this either – and the people updating apps without technical knowledge rarely know about these risks.</p>
<p>When an in-app browser opens a WebView URL, this is represented in the images below with a large purple circle. All of the nodes flowing off this core circle, are the unique vendors who received data in the context of the app that opened the original URL within a WebView.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some of the screenshots below, which are desktop simulated data flows from pages that opened within some of the WebView in-app browser sessions, some of the pages had minimal vendors receiving data – whereas on other pages, countless advertising vendors received data. When a page has numerous advertising vendors collecting data, this usually means there are banner ads on the page, and the potential for a near unlimited number of vendors to receive user data if refreshing a page and the ads on it regularly.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>In the globalized digital economy, the job of verifying the identities of trade partners is becoming more complex and costly as each month passes. GLEIF data (see related links below) highlighted that 50% of financial institutions use, on average, four different identifiers to validate each customer organization. Individual businesses, which lack both the verification skills and the resources of financial institutions, struggle even further. </p>
<p>In November 2021, GLEIF partnered with Contour, a global network of banks, corporates and trade partners working together to revolutionize the trade finance industry by removing barriers to entry. The partnership enables the use of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) within Contour’s platform and puts digital identity at the heart of its proposition. </p>
<p>We caught up with Aaron Seabrook, COO at Contour, to discuss the partnership and explore why digital identity is such a vital component in creating more accessible trade networks. </p>
<p>What are some of the common challenges Contour’s clients encounter when trying to verify the identity of potential trading partners? </p>
<p>When organizations set out to build relationships with new suppliers, establishing that they are indeed who they claim to be is a vital step. We have heard from our member organizations that supplier verification processes are fragmented and inconsistently applied, particularly so following the business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Establishing the identity of a new supplier tends to be a manual process which, of course, is very inefficient: it is prone to human error; a challenge to scale in line with business growth; and really time consuming. </p>
<p>Why did Contour decide to partner with GLEIF?</p>
<p>Contour’s vision is to create a better world for businesses by making global trade accessible, digital, and secure. Our platform’s goal is to simplify the financial workflows between banks and corporations to enable seamless collaboration in real time. By doing so, we hope to reduce complexity and optimize efficiency for all involved. </p>
<p>As we have grown the platform, we have encountered challenges along the way when onboarding new member organizations. Some have multiple connections into disparate networks where they may be registered under a slightly different name, others may register with us using a holding company and be using a trading company to sign into others. When we try to piece this information together, mistakes happen because we’re reliant on manual processes. Digital systems crave structure, so we decided that a unique identification system was for our platform. </p>
<p>We chose the LEI because it is a well-governed and widely adopted global standard.</p>
<p>How will Contour’s customers benefit from access to the LEI as part of this latest partnership?</p>
<p>The LEI is going to become a central part of the Contour onboarding system through our new role as a Registration Agent. When an organization joins Contour, they go through our automated onboarding journey. Part of this system will now include a check to see if they have an LEI. If not, we will not only register them but shoulder the cost of doing so too.</p>
<p>Not only will the LEI improve our users’ customer experience within Contour, but it will also have a significant impact on their overall digital trade journey. Our members have multiple connections within multiple networks. With an LEI, a company’s legal reference data is available electronically to anyone, anywhere, for free - it can be universally validated. When used in international trade and trade finance, this creates greater confidence amongst trading parties resulting in more transparent and efficient cross-border exchanges of goods and data. In addition, the LEI will also lower data reconciliation costs, reduce transaction discrepancies and improve risk management for all our clients. </p>
<p>From their first day of joining Contour, our members will be in possession of a globally recognized digital identifier, applicable not only within Contour but across other international systems as well. This will help them realize the benefits of digitalization more quickly.</p>
<p>What long-term potential do you see for ID initiatives, such as the LEI, for global trade?</p>
<p>We believe that the LEI holds vast potential for global trade. As part of our vision of making trade accessible and inclusive to all, this means providing companies, both large and small, with the tools to improve their access to trade finance. The LEI enables SMEs in developed and developing countries to quickly establish their credentials via a native digital identity that is recognized globally. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/mckinsey-company-and-gleif-leis-and-client-lifecycle-management-in-banking-a-u-s-4-billion-beginning">GLEIF and McKinsey data</a> highlights that banks issuing trade finance could save up to $500 million every year by using the LEI for letters of credit alone. The potential for savings across the entire KYC process are therefore tremendous. Banks may also be incentivized to lend to a broader range of businesses of all sizes if those borrowers could offer up a globally recognized and validated form of organizational identity. </p>
<p>Businesses with LEIs are also more likely to be able to establish credit terms with international partners in the supply chain, creating further opportunities for global economic growth. </p>
<p>The ripple effects that can occur by equipping businesses with LEIs are remarkable. We want to ensure that Contour plays a key part in the drive to make the LEI de-facto means of legal entity ID by continuing to advocate for industry adoption. </p>
<p>A fairer, more open, and more efficient international trade ecosystem is in sight.</p>

<p>ClaimReview is one of the hidden jewels that can be found amongst schema.org's 2700+ definitions. To kick off a series of guest posts around this topic, we bring you a guest post from two members of the factchecking and open data community who have been exploring the potential of this work.</p> Enriching ClaimReview for fact checkers <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mr_dudders">Andrew Dudfield</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ldodds">Leigh Dodds</a></p><br><p>To help fight bad information, search engines, social media platforms and other sources of online content are increasingly highlighting the work of fact checkers by labelling posts with incorrect, misleading or harmful information.</p><br><p>This is often enabled through the publication of structured data that uses Schema.org's <a href="https://schema.org/ClaimReview">ClaimReview</a> schema. This defines a simple approach for <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/factcheck">tagging fact checking articles</a> that has been collaboratively developed and documented through <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. For more background for a journalistic and factchecking audience, see <a href="https://reporterslab.org/">Duke Reporters' Lab</a>'s <a href="https://www.claimreviewproject.com/">dedicated site</a>.&nbsp;</p> <br> At&nbsp;<a href="https://fullfact.org/">Full Fact</a> we have recently been exploring ways to revise and extend the claim review metadata to provide more detail that might enable further reuse and labelling of content, and further insights into the fact checking process.<br><br><p>Our investigation has covered the following areas:</p><br>  <p>Current scope and application of ClaimReview. The currently defined model provides a lot of flexibility around how much detail might be included in a review, with Google, <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/Webmaster-Blog/September-2017/Bing-adds-Fact-Check-label-in-SERP-to-support-the-ClaimReview-markup">Bing</a> and others recommending specific profiles of that in their structured markup documentation. Full Fact has adopted their own approach for applying the standard,&nbsp;we have reflected on that experience and the current recommendations from Google, Bing and other adopters, in pursuit of a Full Fact profile that is close to those used elsewhere.</p>  <p>Identifiers and linking. How can additional links and identifiers be included in ClaimReview markup to support disambiguation and aggregation of data? We've concluded that Schema.org already provides useful properties which, if applied consistently, can support this goal. In line with its growing role as a clearing house for identifiers, we believe <a href="https://wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> would be a useful common target for linking data across the community, e.g. making use of schema.org's <a href="https://schema.org/sameAs">sameAs</a> property. Full Fact articles <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_dudders/status/1466362791200280581">now contain</a> experimental markup in this direction.</p>  <p>Enriching Claims. The standard was revised to include the notion of a <a href="https://schema.org/Claim">Claim</a>: a statement made by an author that appears in one or more locations. We believe this is an important part of the data model and one that should be more widely adopted. Consistent use of Claim markup would help to clearly indicate situations in which a person or organisation is repeatedly making the same claim, or where others are repeating the same misinformation. In addition to enriching claims with author and appearance information, the addition of topic information would provide a useful dimension to the data, helping to surface related claims and fact checks.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Corrections and actions. The <a href="https://fullfact.org/blog/2019/jun/how-fact-checking-works/">second wave of fact checking</a> is about more than just writing fact checks, it involves taking action to tackle disinformation. How might we surface data about requests for corrections to published content, and record when those corrections have been made? Schema.org currently includes some vocabulary to help describe corrections and comments which we've explored. But further work is needed to define a useful way of recording and sharing the other activities undertaken by fact checkers</p>  <p>Citing evidence. Finally citing evidence is an essential part of performing a fact check, so how can we use existing Schema.org vocabulary to help to surface the key resources, papers and datasets that were used in producing a fact check?</p>  <br><p>Building on the open, collaborative approach that the community has taken so far, we have published <a href="https://fullfact.github.io/markup-investigation/">our research notes</a> that explore these questions in more detail and present some early recommendations. We welcome feedback from anyone working to tackle online disinformation.</p><br><p>We would also like to propose the creation of an informal mailing list or community group to support ongoing discussion and experimentation, e.g. hosted at W3C alongside the broader <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">Schema.org CG</a>.</p><br><p>Our joint goal would be to create proposals for further enhancing the current Schema.org model, as necessary, and documenting useful patterns of applying the current model to real-world scenarios including both tagging content and developing APIs.</p> <br>

<p>Wolf McNally’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash">LifeHash</a> is one of Blockchain Commons’ interoperable specifications intended to make digital infrastructure open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. A LifeHash takes a cryptographic objects such as a seed or a key (or really, any sort of data) and turns it into a beautiful and easily recognizable image.</p>

<p>You can now play with LifeHashes at <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash-web/">C++ implementation compiled to WebAssembly</a> allows you to enter an arbitrary text string or a SHA-256 digest and view the corresponding LifeHash — using one of a few different LifeHash variants. (We recommend v2 as the “official” LifeHash.) Because it’s compiled into Webassembly, LifeHash.info does all the work in your browser, ensuring your secrets stay safe!</p>

<p>A similar idea called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-blockies">Blockies</a> already exists to identify Ethereum addresses. They’re a great addition to the Ethereum ecosystem, but LifeHashes incorporate a few additional features. Because each one is built from an iteration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>, they’re more detailed. They also have been carefully formatted to display well on grayscale screens and low-resolution screens, with our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Q1-2021-Report/">LetheKit offering a proof of concept</a>.</p>

<p>So why use LifeHashes? They ensure that any time that you see a key or seed in a different environment, you’ll be able to recognize it through the visual hash (and now you can use <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a> to display the LifeHash derived from the SHA-256 hash of an object, even if your app doesn’t support LifeHashes). As an adjunct to existing computer and human examinations of digital hashes, LifeHashes can improve your security.</p>

<p>LifeHashes are particularly important for Blockchain Commons given our focus on resilient and independent airgapped architectures: a LifeHash allows for the easy comparison of a cryptographic object on either side of the gap, so that you know that you received what you were expecting. Transferred a seed? Asked to sign a PSBT for a specific account? LifeHashes can help you avoid costly errors.</p>

<p>Our explainer video talks more about LifeHash and demonstrates how it works:</p>





<p>Blockchain Commons is dedicated to improving the human aspects of the digital world; LifeHash does that by considering the human experience of cryptographic hashes and providing visual cues to replace (or at least supplement) the long strings of letters and numbers that we can’t easily differentiate.</p>

I learnt that, if you plan, document and discuss a task clearly with your mentors and the people in the community, the time it takes to complete it is considerably lower and you don’t need to do any rework for it. This experience also improved my techniques in maintaining proper code and designing the code keeping conventions in mind. Finally, I learnt a lot about Hyperledger Fabric architecture as well as Hyperledger Indy and Docker networks.”</p>

<p>“I have been part of the Hyperledger ecosystem for the last five years and seen it grow to 18 projects, including DLTs, libraries and tools for efficient blockchain development and deployment. Hyperledger Fabric is the most used DLT in enterprise applications, and decentralised identity (DID)/self-sovereign identity (SSI) applications have grown in the last three to four years. To support Fabric as a ledger for Hyperledger Aries will increase the adoption of DID/SSI in enterprises by adding the flexibility to use Fabric as a ledger for SSI/DID systems and will create more interoperability within the Hyperledger ecosystem. It is a really interesting project. I have learnt lot as a mentor and got the opportunity to contribute more to the Hyperledger ecosystem. My mentee, Harsh, did really well. He completed this project and now we are planning to propose this as a Hyperledger Lab to build out the future roadmap.”</p>

<p></p>
 Shops.scot is a new venture under development, that will launch in the new year. 
<p>As the title suggests, this will operate a ‘Multivendor Marketplace’ – A site where multiple sellers can each create their own e-store, and visitors can browse and buy from any of them.</p>
<p>This will accelerate our Digital Nation Action Plan, specifically the digital enablement and support of micro and small businesses. It’s still the case that many don’t even have a web site.</p>
<p>So this will provide them an ultra simple way of achieving that, with the key distinction from other options like EBay or Amazon obviously being that it’s entirely Scotland focused. This means a much more local, hands on technical support, and a concentrated market focus.</p>
<p>Key features will include:</p>
 
 A powerful set of digital marketing tools – As well as loading up your products, you’ll be able to send e-vouchers, email marketing etc. 
 Cryptocurrency – Accept Bitcoin payments et al. This is another key technology field where SMEs know they should be doing more but it is simply beyond them. 
 
<p>In short it will leverage the SaaS (Software as a Service) model to make easily accessible the powerful e-commerce and digital marketing technologies that most small businesses would greatly benefit from but don’t have the resource or expertise to deploy themselves.</p>
<p>There is also great potential to team up with other Scottish innovators, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/">Miconex</a>. They offer a gift card system that could tie in with #1, with a particular focus on local towns, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/casestudy/case-study--the-perth-gift-card">Perth</a>.</p>
<p>Shops.scot will be able to provide the core e-commerce tools for selling their products, and organized into similarly local sections, like Shops.scot/Perth. This will provide a powerful combined solution to achieve key Scottish Government goals like <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scottish-government-offers-support-local-online-firms">boosting local commerce for local merchants</a>.</p>

<p>Discussion Papers are to White Papers as a quick sketch is to a finished painting. Where a White Paper advocates for a completed solution as the best solution for a problem or set of related problems, Discussion Papers provide a quick way to write up a radical or unexpected idea to solve a problem in a way that fosters discussion and collaboration on refining the idea.</p>



<p>The goal of Trust over IP working groups and task forces is to produce SSI and related technologies and standards, eventually advocating them outside Trust over IP for general adoption.</p>



<p>White Papers are the gold standard for talking about solutions with enough development, testing and successful deployment to provide evidence that this is a solution that is ready for mainstream adoption.</p>



<p>Discussion Papers are focused on providing a quick way of capturing new directions or ideas for stubborn problems in 500 to 2000 words with a combination of google docs (for authoring) and blogs (for comments) that encourage quick turnaround and lively discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ideas can be radical, opinionated or unexpected, but they do have to solve a problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The structure of a Discussion Paper is problem-focused, focused on issues that customers or consumers of ToIP (or related) technologies have now or need to be solved to make distributed Digital Identity and the Data Economy successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The (suggested) Discussion Paper outline:</p>



  (Executive) Summary  Problem(s to be solved)  Requirements for a Solution  Solution  Pro’s, Cons (vs other Solutions) &amp; Vulnerabilities  See Also (other ToIP related ideas)  Resources and References  Links to supporting documents &amp; URLs    



<p>Trust over IP welcomes Discussion Papers from ToIP members, encouraging potential contributors to join Trust over IP.</p>



<p>Start by reviewing the <a href="https://live-trustoverip.pantheonsite.io/our-work/discussion-papers/">published Discussion Papers</a> on this site.</p>



<p>To find out how to submit a title for a Discussion Paper, plus author guidelines, tools and templates, see the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Guidance+for+Discussion+Papers">Discussion Paper guidance</a> on our wiki.</p>

Bild: Anwendungsfälle im Bildungsbereich mit dem Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>In diesem Artikel möchten wir einen Überblick über die Anwendungsfälle im Bildungsbereich geben, an welchen wir im Rahmen von <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a> derzeit arbeiten. Der <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/lissi-use-cases-education-c39908690300">Artikel ist auch in Englisch</a> verfügbar.</p><p>Wir verbringen viel Zeit in der Schule oder in Universitäten, um einen guten Bildungsabschluss zu erlangen. Mit erfolgreichem Abschluss an einer (Hoch)Schule wird ein Zertifikat als Nachweis der erbrachten Leistungen ausgestellt. Diese werden aktuell in Papierform ausgestellt und sind somit nicht medienbruchfrei bei Dritten vorzuweisen. Mit Lissi erhältst Du deine Bildungszertifikate direkt in Dein Wallet und kannst es nach Bedarf dritten Parteien, wie z.B. einem potenziellen Arbeitgeber oder einer Universität präsentieren. Wir gehen aber noch einen Schritt weiter und möchten zusammen mit unseren Partnern aus dem Bildungssektor alle Prozesse, welche vertrauensvolle Interaktionen voraussetzen, digitalisieren. Vorerst zählen dazu die folgenden drei Anwendungsgebiete:</p>Bild: Bildungsnachweise im Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Bildungsnachweise: <p>Es gibt eine Vielzahl an Nachweisen für erbrachte Leistungen im Bildungsbereich: Von Abschlusszeugnissen der Schule und Universität bis hin zu Schulungsbestätigungen vom Arbeitgeber oder einer Online-Plattform. Aktuell erhalten wir diese Zertifikate in Papierform oder als PDF, welche nur schwer durch Dritte überprüft werden können. Parteien, die die Zertifikate überprüfen möchten, haben oftmals keine Möglichkeit eine Fälschung von einem Original zu unterscheiden. Dies ist für alle beteiligten ein Problem. Wir arbeiten aktiv mit Anbietern von Bildungszertifikaten daran, diese Nachweise zu digitalisieren, sodass Du diese bequem in Deinem Lissi Wallet speichern kannst und Dritte diese einfach überprüfen können. Unser Ziel ist es, den kompletten Prozess für einen Studenten abzudecken und das fängt bereits im Gymnasium an. Mit dem Lissi Wallet kannst Du alle Zeugnisse vom Schulabschluss bis zum Master und alles dazwischen lebenslang und selbstbestimmt aufbewahren.</p><p><a href="https://www.bwi.de/news-blog/blog/artikel/sichere-digitale-identitaeten-wie-das-pdf-aus-der-bewerbung-verschwand">Ein Beitrag dazu </a>hat unser IDunion Partner, die BWI GmbH veröffentlicht.</p>Bild: Bewerbungen bei Bildungseinrichtungen mit dem Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Bewerbung für Bildungseinrichtungen: <p>Bei einer Bewerbung an einer öffentlichen Einrichtung als Student:in sind oftmals einige Nachweise notwendig. Häufig zählen dazu der Personalausweis, bisherige Bildungszertifikate oder sonstige Dokumente abhängig vom Studiengang und den persönlichen Umständen. Da diese Dokumente im Großteil noch in Papierform vorgelegt werden müssen, ist dies viel Aufwand für Bewerber:innen sowie die Bildungseinrichtung. Mit Lissi möchten wir die digitale Übersendung der Dokumente ermöglichen, welche besonders wertvoll bzw. schutzbedürftig sind. Damit fällt für Bewerber:innen der Mehraufwand weg, z.B. Kopien beglaubigen zu lassen. Bildungseinrichtungen können die Bewerbungen dann schneller und effizienter bearbeiten, was für alle Beteiligten von Vorteil&nbsp;ist.</p> Campusmanagement: <p>Zusammen mit der Technischen Universität Berlin untersuchen wir, wie die Campus Management Infrastruktur mit SSI-Agenten erweitert werden kann. Diverse Leistungen, beispielsweise der Zugang zu den Campus Diensten werden zukünftig mit verifizierbaren Nachweisen angeboten. Lernende sowie Lehrende haben somit über das Wallet Zugang zu den verschiedenen Dienstleistungen der Hochschule. Hierzu zählen z.B. Anmeldungen für Kurse oder Veranstaltungen, der Erhalt von Bescheinigungen, der Zugang zu Räumlichkeiten oder die Beantragung von sonstigen Leistungen. Somit hat die Bildungseinrichtung einen direkten Kontakt zu jedem Lernenden und kann bequem Informationen anfragen und Leistungen zur Verfügung stellen.</p>Patrick Herbke der Technischen Universität Berlin über das Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>Organisationen, welche Interesse der Zusammenarbeit an den genannten Anwendungsfällen haben oder neue Anwendungsfälle aus dem Bereich einbringen möchten, können uns gern via info@lissi.id kontaktieren.</p><p>Dein Lissi&nbsp;Team</p>

Picture: Use cases with the Lissi Wallet within the education sector.<p>In this article we would like to provide you with an overview of the use cases within the educational sector we are currently working on within <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>. The <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/lissi-anwendungsf%C3%A4lle-bildung-7c7bda96ea64">article is also available in&nbsp;German</a>.</p><p>We spend a lot of time in school or universities to get a decent education. Upon successful graduation from a school or university, a certificate is issued as proof of the achievements. However, these are currently still only issued in paper form and therefore cannot be easily presented to third parties. With Lissi, you receive your educational certificates directly in your wallet and can present them to third parties, such as a potential employer or university, as required. However, we are going one step further and, together with our partners from the education sector, would like to digitise all processes that require trusted interactions. For the time being, this includes the following three application areas:</p>Picture: Educational certificates with the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Educational Credentials <p>There are a variety of proofs of educational achievements: from school and university certificates to training confirmations from employers or an online platform. Currently, we receive these certificates in paper form or as PDFs, which are difficult to verify by third parties. Parties who want to verify the certificates often have no way to distinguish a fake from an original. This is a problem for all parties involved. We are actively working with education certificate providers to digitise these credentials so that you can conveniently store them in your Lissi Wallet and present them to third parties. Our goal is to cover the complete journey for a student and that starts in high school. With the Lissi Wallet, you can store all your certificates from graduation to master’s degree and everything in between for life long&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Our IDunion partner, the BWI GmbH, has published <a href="https://www.bwi.de/news-blog/blog/artikel/sichere-digitale-identitaeten-wie-das-pdf-aus-der-bewerbung-verschwand">an article on this&nbsp;topic</a>.</p>Picture: Applications to educational institutions with the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Applying to educational institutions: <p>When applying to a public institution as a student different documents are required. Oftentimes these include the identity card, previous educational certificates or other documents depending on the course of study and personal circumstances. Since most of these documents still have to be submitted in paper form, this is a lot of work for both the applicant and the educational institution. With Lissi, we make it possible to send documents that are particularly valuable or in need of protection in digital form. This eliminates additional work for applicants, e.g. the need to have certified copies. Educational institutions can then process applications faster and more efficiently, which is an advantage for everyone involved.</p> Campus management: <p>Together with the Technical University of Berlin, we are investigating how the campus management infrastructure can be expanded with SSI agents. Various services, such as access to campus services, will be offered with verifiable credentials in the future. Learners as well as teachers will thus have access to the various services of the university via the Lissi Wallet. These include, for example, registering for courses or events, obtaining certificates, accessing premises or applying for other services. Thus, the educational institution has direct contact with each learner and can conveniently request information and provide services.</p>Patrick Herbke of the Technical University of Berlin about the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>Organizations which are interested in collaborating on the above use cases or would like to contribute new use cases from the field are welcome to contact us via <a href="mailto:info@lissi.id">info@lissi.id</a>.</p><p>Your Lissi&nbsp;Team</p>

 Reflecting on a decade of the Open Badges ecosystem <p>Today, a pre-recorded keynote panel conversation goes live to kick off the <a href="https://www.ic-badges-credentials.org/en/icobc-symposium">2021 International Council of Badges &amp; Credentials Symposium</a>. My interlocuters were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrilemoie/">Kerri Lemoie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/longpd/">Phillip Long</a> and we could have talked for&nbsp;hours!</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>As I was preparing for this panel discussion, I made notes which turned into this post. Like any history written by someone who was part of the events, it is partial and personal. I will have missed out things both obvious and important.</p><p>You may also want to read <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reflecting-on-the-evolving-badges-and-credentials-ecosystem-6efac4d673d3">this post</a> published last week on the evolving badges and credentials ecosystem.</p> The development of standard can take a while to bear&nbsp;fruit <p>I can remember being excited about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> when I found out about it in 1998, but it wasn’t until 10 years later that people were using it everyday for useful things like exchanging files or connecting devices.</p><p>So I realised that it would probably take a decade for Open Badges to become mainstream. It’s nice when <a href="https://medium.com/the-slackerati/why-the-future-remains-bright-for-open-badges-f09eb6ffe889">predictions</a> turn out to be correct! We’re now in the situation where badges are popping up everywhere, with hundreds of millions of them issued in the last couple of years&nbsp;alone.</p>CC BY-SA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle#/media/File:Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg">Jeremy&nbsp;Kemp</a><p>I admit to being skeptical about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">Gartner hype cycle</a> (see diagram above) when I first discovered it. However, it’s actually described the development of Open Badges pretty well over the last 10&nbsp;years!</p><blockquote>“Communications tools don’t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring,” (Clay&nbsp;Shirky)</blockquote><p>What follows isn’t just a nice story, it’s instructive in terms of how technologies develop, and indeed how important people are to the process. Technological development is not inevitable, nor is technology neutral. People make and shape it, making decisions along the way that can have far-reaching implications.</p> Technology Trigger (2011–13) <p>It’s worth remembering that badges are nothing new. Anyone who can remember pre-social media online interactions will remember badges in web forums. And, of course, badges in games have been around&nbsp;forever.</p><p>Some organisations were experimenting with digital badges before 2011, but these were siloed and easy to right-click and copy. The ‘technology trigger’, the innovation with Open Badges, was to invent and make available an open metadata standard.</p><p>This standard not only described the required and optional fields of information for the metadata, but also provided a way in which badges could be verified.</p>CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>The initial work in this area was funded by the <a href="https://www.macfound.org/">MacArthur Foundation</a>, which funded a lot of the <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">Mozilla Foundation</a>’s work around online learning in the early days. The original <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">white paper</a> explored four different learner scenarios and was widely interpreted, especially given the zeitgeist, to be supportive of thinking about a landscape in which we wouldn’t need universities anymore.</p><p>This proved to be a distraction, as innovation is rarely either/or but rather and/and. There was pushback in some quarters of formal education, especially in Higher Ed where there was much talk of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and that nebulous term: “quality”.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/open_badges/">v1.0 release</a> of the Open Badges came in March 2013, with a lot of fanfare and was followed by the <a href="https://clalliance.org/resources/chicago-summer-of-learning-2013/">Chicago Summer of Learning</a> that year where thousands of badges were issued to young people in the city of&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p>Personally, I attended around 50 events that year as part of the Mozilla Open Badges team, popularising and explaining the possibilities. One of my first was the 2012 <a href="https://epic.openrecognition.org/">ePIC conference</a> which has been a galvanising force since that time in thinking about badges for recognition rather than just credentialing.</p> Peak of inflated expectations (2014) BadgeKit<p>Open Badges were on a roll and, to capitalise on this, the Badge Alliance was formed. Many of the Mozilla Open Badges team transferred over to the new organisation and work started in earnest on BadgeKit, a way that any organisation could set up and issue&nbsp;badges.</p><blockquote>2014 was a great building year for the badges ecosystem and the Badge Alliance (BA) network, and 2015 has been an exciting year so far. Rooms are overflowing for badging-related presentations at conferences around the world, more compelling use cases are popping up all the time, and the level of understanding and conversation about badges is far higher than two years ago. While the Badge Alliance has played a pivotal role in this progress, much of the work has come from the community itself.</blockquote><blockquote>The BA was created to grow the community and seat the ownership and accountability of the badging work in the ecosystem that was using badges. We’ve accomplished that — the BA has grown, with hundreds of organizations pledging to work together to issue and understand Open Badges. The first year of the BA’s investigation, community-building, and outreach provided us with a better understanding of the state of badges in the world, and connected a vibrant community around collaborating to use a shared technology. The momentum behind Open Badges has never been stronger.</blockquote><blockquote>(<a href="https://openbadges.tumblr.com/post/123556754619/the-badge-alliance-in-2015">Open Badges&nbsp;blog</a>)</blockquote><p>At the time, I was a co-chair of the Digital / Web Literacies Working Group at the Badge Alliance, but otherwise wasn’t directly involved in the day-to-day operations, having remained at the Mozilla Foundation to work on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/WebLiteracyMap">Web Literacy&nbsp;Map</a>.</p><p>It was pretty clear, though, that the hype around Open Badges — including talk about the ‘end of universities’ was greater than the technical ability for the badges ecosystem to develop. The technology needed to mature, and so <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nateotto">Nate Otto</a> took over from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinknight">Erin Knight</a> as Executive Director to steer it in that direction.</p><p>It’s hard to underestimate the impact that Erin and the team she built had on the online learning landscape at the time. The team, never more than around 10 people, galvanised a community of thousands of technologists and educators into&nbsp;action.</p> Trough of disillusionment (2015–16) IMS Global Learning Consortium<p>I left Mozilla in April 2015 for the world of consultancy, working with <a href="https://www.cityandguilds.com/">City &amp; Guilds</a> and other organisations on Open Badges and projects around digital literacies. The narrative that was came out was that the Badge Alliance was only ever meant to be a temporary steward for the Open Badges standard before it found a new home at <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a>.</p><p>Whatever the true story, there were severe headwinds as the MacArthur Foundation moved on to fund other initiatives. Nate was working at the Badge Alliance on top of his role on <a href="https://badgr.com/">Badgr</a>, and this was the time when the world was unreasonably excited about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a>. In fact, it got to the stage where, when presenting on badges, I’d have slides ready for the inevitable blockchain questions. I tried to explain that not every badge is high-stakes, and other problems blockchain can&nbsp;raise.</p><p>After a flurry of excitement about the possibilities of badges, people were a little bit at a loss as to what to do with them. We were in the trough of disillusionment. There were plenty of academic institutions experimenting with <a href="https://altc.alt.ac.uk/blog/2015/06/implementation-of-open-badges-in-education/">badges for staff CPD</a> but the assumption was that blockchain would fix credentialing. Initiatives such as MIT’s <a href="https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/what-we-learned-from-designing-an-academic-certificates-system-on-the-blockchain-34ba5874f196#.4m4bmwcm0">Blockcerts</a>, which were compatible with the Open Badges specification, got a limited amount of traction.</p> Slope of enlightenment (2017–19) <p>Thankfully, along with City &amp; Guilds, organisations started using badges in new and interesting ways. A perfect example of this is <a href="https://ibm.com">IBM</a> and, in particular David Leaser. Having run a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-training/open-badges-a-better-way-to-track-skills-and-accomplishments/">pilot in 2015</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-training/open-badges-vs-certifications-is-there-a-battle-brewing-in-the-it-credential-market/">introduced the first IBM badges</a> in 2016 for “resume-worthy activities,” by 2019 he was an advocate for Open Badges <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-training/badges-need-rigor-or-do-they-really/">not only for credentialing</a> but for recognition. In mid-2020, IBM <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-training/ibm-issues-its-three-millionth-digital-badge-and-disrupts-the-labor-market-in-the-process/">issued its three millionth badge</a> showing how quickly these things can&nbsp;scale.</p>IBM badges<p>Badges started popping up on LinkedIn, within email signatures, as well as being shared on resumes and CVs. These were often from professional associations such as the <a href="https://www.badges.sssc.uk.com/getting-started/what-you-need-to-know-about-open-badges/">SSSC</a>, who not only issued them for CPD activities, but for activities such as implementing the recommendations of an important resport within the care&nbsp;sector.</p><p>There was a growing recognition that badges were useful tools for marketing, for talent acquisition, and for team formation. Inevitably, organisations came together to standardise on frameworks within badges were issued, for example the European MOOC Consortium who established the <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/the-common-microcredential-framework">Common Microcredential framework</a>.</p><p>Building on this, and given the cost of university tuition and talk of a growing ‘skills gap,’ there emerged what has become known as the <a href="https://credentialasugo.org/">Credential As You Go</a> (CAYG) movement. CAYG focuses on incremental credentialing in an attempt rather than the all-or-nothing approaches of bachelor’s degrees and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>Open Badges not only began to be known by many different names but were also starting to be used in quite different situations.</p>Image from <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reflecting-on-the-evolving-badges-and-credentials-ecosystem-6efac4d673d3">Reflecting on the Evolving Badges and Credentials Ecosystem</a> Plateau of productivity (2020+) <p>The Covid-19 pandemic merely accelerated a process which was already underway. As we all worked and/or learned from home, there was a need for solutions which allow us to represent ourselves at a distance.</p><p>Whereas previously people would get in touch to discuss piloting badge programmes, the talk is now very much about adding them into to augment existing systems. For example, <a href="https://www.multiverse.io/en-GB">Multiverse</a> is an organisation “building an outstanding alternative to university and corporate training via professional apprenticeships”. They are an IMS-certified badge issuing platform, but are no a general-purpose issuer. Rather, they use Open Badges to add superpowers to their programmes.</p>Multiverse<p>The next step, which is the move to <a href="https://kayaelle.medium.com/the-future-of-open-badges-is-verifiable-bce27664a668">Open Badges 3.0</a> and alignment with the W3C’s Verifiable Credentials standard, will be an interesting one. Decentralised identifiers will do away with the need to issue to email addresses, and issuers can specify for the first time what kind of thing they are issuing due to alignment with the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/about/clr">Comprehensive Learner Record</a> (CLR). For example, the CLR states whether something is an assignment, membership, a degree, or even a&nbsp;license.</p> Conclusion <p>The best way to predict the future, as the saying goes, is to invent it. So I’d like to thank all of the people who have, and are currently, working to make Open Badges into the force for change that it has become. I’ve already named some people by name, for example Kerri Lemoie and Nate Otto, but there are so many people who have been visible and active in the community over the decade, as well as those who have been quietly working away behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p><p>One of the reasons I got involved in Open Badges a decade ago was because I wanted a world where young people, including my own children, could choose whether to go to university. With development such as CAYG and providers such as Multiverse enabling professional apprenticeships, I feel that we’re getting&nbsp;there.</p><p>But more than that, I feel like Open Badges and the work around it is enabling a world where a much wider and more diverse set of skills are valued. And that’s got to be something worth celebrating! 🎉</p>Keep Badges Weird&nbsp;header<p>If you’d like to keep up-to-date with some of the latest developments around Open Badges, you may want to join the <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">Keep Badges Weird</a> community.

 Virtual Event, 12-14 October 2021<br>  <br>What is the Internet Identity Workshop? <p>IIW is run as an “<a href="https://agilecrete.org/what-is-an-open-space-unconference/">Open Space un-Conference</a>”, designed to be a dynamic, participant-led 'marketplace of questions and topics', to foster conversation, networking and learning. Empowering everyone to speak, ask and present, this format takes partial inspiration from decentralized approaches to technology. Collectively, attendees set each day’s agendas, volunteering a mix of prepared presentations, open discussion, product demos and workshops. Hundreds of attendees, including a number of DIF members, put together a huge programme of content for the 33rd IIW, covering topics ranging from the technical minutiae of IAM and SSI to big-picture discussions about ethics and strategy, and participated in over 110 virtual sessions across the three days.</p><p>A book of proceedings, containing the notes from all of the sessions will be collated and published by IIW (back catalogue from previous IIWs <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops">here</a>, and a wiki of notes from individual sessions <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_33_Session_Notes">here</a>). Here we will overview a few of the topics discussed and sketch out some of the strong and weak signals discernible in the collective discussion. To that end, sessions are clustered thematically and not chronologically.</p> 101 Sessions <p>A staple of IIW, 101 Sessions are conceived as entry-level primers, often given by the same IIW veterans year after year, on various aspects of the digital identity landscape. They are designed to give participants a solid base from which to engage fully with the rest of the programme. 101 Session topics this year included OAuth2 101, UMA 101, OpenID Connect 101, with DIF’s own Chris Kelly and Karyl Fowler (Transmute, DIF Steering Committee) presenting an <a href="https://youtu.be/GWszMWmSLSQ">SSI 101 session on Self-Sovereign &amp; Decentralized Identity</a>.<br></p> Governance &amp; Ethics<br> <p>Informing the whole framing of this technical revolution is a broader, more conceptual sea change. Ever-popular themes for discussion include the ethical underpinnings of decentralized identity, and the increasing awareness of potential pitfalls.</p><p>The contours and workflows of identity in the digital age are largely molded by government regulations around privacy, security, and their historic interest as one of the main issuers of identification documents. For this reason, analyses of policy tendencies and direction are in close dialogue with the design of products and infrastructure, which has long been a hallmark of this particular unconference.</p> Ethics &amp; Equity <p>Identity veteran Adrian Gropper led an indefatigable series of sessions each focused on an interlocking important concern about how identity technologies change how we understand, exercise and protect fundamental human rights across a variety of systems with Human Rights Impact of Identity Protocols. Privacy, a pillar of the decentralized identity movement, got discussed in terms of the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/pimdl-v1-final-html/">Kantara Report</a>, at John Wunderlich’s Privacy Enhancing Mobile Credentials session.</p><p>User choice, data portability and consent also sparked lively discussions with Adrian Gropper and Alan Karp’s session on Policy Managers and John Phillips’ session on Designing for Consent. The ethics of making any of the above mandatory at DID Ethics &amp; Mandatory Vaccine Passports with Timothy Holborn to corona section?</p> Governance of SSI systems <p>The oversight and governance of the decentralized identity community got plenty of attention, as Open-Source organizations like DIF and ToIP introduced themselves and spoke about the work they facilitate. This discussion continued on the topic of Interop(erability) and where the appropriate venue is to continue this valuable work (Kai Wagner, Andreas Freitag, Hakan Yildiz, Eugineu Rusu). <br></p><p>Decentralized Identity tech also offers exciting new possibilities itself for governance, democracy, humanitarian aid and education, as discussed by Drummond Reed, cheqd’s Alex Tweeddale &amp; YOMA’s Nicky Hickman, imagining what the Future of Governance using these tools might look like. &nbsp;YOMA’s work on an interim <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UGUq6wuTrJH-TCkL7Fzw8cHqcFXMoQwK/edit">Governance Framework</a> in Africa, which is ultimately built on <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Governance+Metamodel+Specification">ToIP’s Governance Metamodel Specification</a>, was examined as one example.</p><p>The ongoing effort by the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition to get Verfiable Credentials (VCs) and trust frameworks recognized within Californian legislation was outlined by Kaliya Young and Ally Medina at Verifiable Credentials Policy Committee - &nbsp;Come Help us Pass a Trust Framework in California, identifying challenges and a path forwards towards greater legal and institutional acceptance for VCs.<br></p> Covid, Health, Travel<br> <p>Corona has been a driving force recently in the decentralized identity space, particularly with regard to health and vaccination records, as well as greatly affecting travel. How decentralized identity tech like smart contracts and DIDs can empower individuals and give them granular control over their health data was tackled in Elias Strehle’s session, entitled Controlling your medical data via DIDComm - discussion and feedback on our system architecture. <br></p><p>Building on this system architecture theme, and the challenge of how to deal with varying forms of data arriving from a variety of sources, was teased out at Semantic Interoperability with Layered Schemas and Semantic Pipelines with Burak Serdar, who invited us to test a live, interactive <a href="https://playground.layeredschemas.org/">Layered schema playground</a> that manipulates and edits the various layers as defined by metadata, and then rounding off by considering the implications of this for the storage of digital healthcare data.</p><p>Linux Foundation Public Health launched the Global COVID Certificate Network in June 2021 to enable interoperable and trustworthy verification of COVID certificates between jurisdictions, based on a global trust architecture. Lucy Yang and John Walker outlined the state of this initiative at Updates on the Global COVID Certificate Network, while they were also joined by Kaliyah Young for COVID Credentials: How to Meet the Market Where it is, to join community leaders of the COVID Credentials Initiative (CCI) reviewing the state of play and obstacles to adoption</p> VC-centric Technical sessions <p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) were an inescapable topic at IIW33, both following up IIW32’s strong theme of roadmapping adoption of BBS+ signing systems for selective disclosure and more generally educating people about the <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">4 flavors of VCs</a> and how they interact.</p> Vc tooling and education <p>Sometimes the best thing to do is lead by example, and Kyle Den Hartog presented his Working with JSON-LD - Best practices and improvements (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16OTHsmxk_WQsbTfbIGkBUadpryMcSEeR/edit#slide=id.p4">DECK</a>) along with proof of concept code (<a href="https://github.com/kdenhartog/context-integrity">GitHub</a>) to demonstrate how handling JSON-LD data can be done elegantly. As a strong theme at the last two IIWs was that LD-VCs have a steep learning curve and require a 90-degree turn in many approaches to credentialing and data exchange, this will surely be remembered as one of the most useful and educational sessions of the conference.</p><p>At An Extended LDP-BBS 2020 and ZKP-LD Playground, Dan Yamamoto &amp; Kazue Sako dove even deeper into the operation of BBS+ protocols and zero-knowledge proofs. The tagteam recently forked Mattr’s BBS+ LD implementations and were presenting on strategies for handling the “multiple blank node” problem, a common stumbling block in signing over flattened graphs. Attendees were invited to a<a href="https://playground.zkp-ld.org/"> ZKP LD playground</a> to test their approaches.</p> Updates from the OIDF/DIF collaboration: <p>Kristina Yasuda, Torsten Lodderstedt started us off by considering generally Open ID Connect for SSI, examining some potential benefits, and comparing the typical OIDC flow to a more SSI-led Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider (SIOP) model. Kristina and Torsten returned, this time joined by Oliver Terbu and Tobias Looker, to give us an insight into the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a> work towards a protocol suite for SSI at their session on VC Issuance using OpenID Connect, while considering the potential of the OpenID protocol and how it operates with existing frameworks luke FIDO 2 or Microsoft and Apple’s authentication methods.<br></p><p><br></p> Verifiable Credentials versus Mobile Driver’s Licenses (mDL) <p>Andrew Hughes (Ping Identity) did a series of sessions on Mobile Driving License AND Verifiable Credentials laying out the basics of mDocs (mobile driver's license) as currently released, including the OIDC/web transport specification, and how the data model and protocols could co-exist and whether they should. Discussion here was predominantly about <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO 18013-5</a>, a new ISO standard designed to primarily specify a driving license data models, protocols, and security models, which has led to renewed interest in digital forms of electronic ID (eID) credentials issued by and closely regulated by state identity authorities.</p> VC adoption vectors <p>No new technology can get off the ground without some consideration about how and where it gets adopted and implemented. Trinsic’s Ben Crockett kicked off with an overview of the global playing field, in his Global Verifiable Credential Adoption session. Newly-minted DIF members <a href="http://cheqd.io">cheqd</a> presented Payment rails, customisable commercial models and decentralised governance for SSI, which gave Fraser Edwards &amp; Alex Tweeddale a chance to examine roadblocks, in particular the lack of commercial models, in the adoption path for SSI models and payment systems. They rounded this off with cheqd’s vision of <a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/the-internet-identity-workshop-how-to-make-ssi-work-c3f2fe35b5c6">being the one to bridge this divide</a>.</p> The Universal Registrar and Friends <p>Longtime DIF insider Markus Sabadello introduced the IIW community to DanubeTech's new commercial offering <a href="http://godiddy.com">GoDiddy.com</a> (based squarely on two of DIF's oldest work items, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a> (and <a href="https://uniregistrar.io/">Universal Registrar</a>), following the classic "hosted service, open-source self-hosting option" formula; DanubeTech also gave additional technical sessions about these work items. The Universal Resolver Work Item was recently folded <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/universal-resolver-calls-wrapup/">back into the main DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>, where work continues. Markus was joined by Azeem Ahamed and Cihan Saglam to discuss DID Registration Architectures more generally, discussing considerations for working with CRUD methods while remaining architecture-neutral<br></p> Other Technical Sessions <p>Sam Curran led a session on-boarding interested community members to the protocol work being organized within and on top of DIDComm. The session was named Fantastic DIDComm Protocols, and How to Write Them because the focus was on DIDComm protocols as a <a href="https://didcomm.org/">community-driven toolkit</a> where sub-protocols and extensions are contributed organically by users, and users discuss design issues and implementation issues with one another in a forthcoming User Group, which provides an “outer circle” to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm Working Group</a> (which will continue on after the completion of the v2 specification to manage the iteration of the DIDComm and the related protocols in an IPR-protected venue).</p><p>The DIDComm reference implementations Session with Alex Scherbakov and Vyacheslav Gudkov gave newcomers to the space a crash-course on DIDComm v2 and DID:Peer, while extolling the virtues of reference implementations for emerging specifications. They also illustrated how basing these implementations on established libraries is important to ensure interoperability with a live <a href="https://github.com/sicpa-dlab/didcomm-demo">DIDComm demo</a>.</p><p>DIDComm was one primary use-case but not the only possible use case discussed by Oliver Terbu and Alen Horvat in a session called “LibP2P as transport layer,” which explored the possibilities of the DIDComm mediator networks and other lightweight infrastructure crucial to SSI systems being spun up in a peer-to-peer way. The <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p library</a>, which came out of the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> stack for decentralized storage and has found a lot of adoption in blockchain for other peer-to-peer applications and communication transports, could end up being crucial as more infrastructure moves out of centralized clouds and into more organic distributed systems.</p><p><a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189992/Persistent+Compute+Objects">Picos</a> (persistent compute objects) are DIDComm-enabled agents supporting SSI. Picos, DIDComm, and Decentralized SSI Agencies from Phil Windley explores the potential of these microservices, aligned with many of the design goals of decentralized identity, and how they could function as nodes for a scalable Internet of Things (IoT) model.<br></p> DID AuthN WG without DIDs <p>Surprisingly, one of the best-attended sessions at this IIW wasn’t about the DID/VC stack at all, but rather about the Ethereum stack so central to the work of Consensys, Affinidi, Ceramic, and many other DIF members. As part of a <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum/">grant</a> from the Ethereum Foundation and in collaboration with the Ethereum Name Service (a registrar for linking ethereum addresses to a DNS-like record system), Spruce has been been driving a design process for Sign-In With Ethereum informed by community calls to harmonize how relying parties within the Ethereum community request an “off-chain signature” to log into services and create sessions. Both chairs of DIF’s DID Authentication WG (which has not been holding regular meetings while focusing on the Authentication aspects of the DIF/OIDF specification work) have been participating, as have DIF members Ceramic; <a href="https://login.xyz/">work is ongoing</a> and an alpha release will be available soon.</p> User Journeys &amp; Product Thinking <p>Strategies For Bridging to Next-Generation Identity Systems (from the bottom up) from David Schmudde outlined some potential solutions to e-commerce challenges using VCs, OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC). Conversations and topics arising at each IIW often make a reappearance at a later session, and Phil Wolff’s UX: continuing the mid-2021 IIW UX conversation, revisited a UX design session held at IIW32 in April of this year. A unified tech framework ideally needs to be complimented by a common visual language, as well as a standardized way of describing the tools and processes involved.</p> Devices &amp; users <p>Considering end-users’ experiences and which devices they use to access new technology is also incredibly important. To this end, IIW co-founder Doc Searls, along with Joyce Searls and Johannes Ernst hosted User Stories for the VRM Intention Byway. <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">The Intention Byway</a> presents an alternative vision for how buyers and sellers in a decentralized marketplace can reach one another with their offerings. Bridging Digital and Physical to Make Identifiers Identify by Liam McCarty discussed both the technical challenges between varying device types, while underscoring the need for consumer, community and business interest in decentralized tech to attain widespread adoption and trust.<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explosive-growth-smart-homes-internet-135745356.html"> IoT and Smart Homes add to the growing number of entities online</a> that will need an ‘identity’, and digital assistants as mediator for ‘communal computing was outlined by Chris Butler at Is the smart home a dictatorship, co-op, or homesteading?</p> Organizational Bread-breaking <p>At Time is Running Out - Get to Market: revenue, costs and who pays for what, Kimberly Linson argues that without a convincing business case, adoption of new tech may be slow or even stall, and the financial cost of implementation needs to be borne by someone. Phil Wolff hosted VC Metaphors - Containers and ? to discuss how we can agree on a common language around this emerging technology and how it can be easily presented to policy-makers, customers and businesses alike. In a similar vein, Kaliyah Young used two separate sessions dedicated to Explainers Needed to host an open discussion about where the knowledge or vocabulary gaps are around decentralized identity tech, and how and where we should fill them. The huge number of ideas to come out of these sessions will provide a wealth of informational content for the sector, important for making it cohesive and accessible.</p><p>Karim Stekelenburg, James Ebert and Timo Glastra used Taking the adoption of SSI to the next level to discuss how this conversation also needs to extend to developers, who may not necessarily already be involved in the digital identity space. Ample documentation, open-source communities and extendable functionality of frameworks were just some of the resources name-checked to make the sector welcoming beyond the enthusiasts and dedicated groups seen at spaces like IIW. Illustrated use-cases, specifically one based on Aries and written in JavaScript was highlighted for using familiar, stable and well-documented APIs to improve accessibility. <br></p> Other User-Centric Data Orgs <p>Lisa LeVasseur, at Identification Minimization and other Respectful Tech Principles, explored how decentralized identity solutions can offer increased security, privacy and anonymity. The discussion centered around minimizing user data collection, under the umbrella idea of ‘respectful’ tech design principles, as outlined by the <a href="https://ooqc943yvdw4abzes1q1ezta-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/intro-me2b-spec-iis-101321.pdf">Me2B Alliance’s Attributes for Respectful Me2B Commitments</a>. Lisa returned with Scott Mace to introduce attendees to the IEEE P7012 working group at Privacy Signal Standard Update (<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/7012.html">IEEE P7012</a>), the standard for machine readable personal privacy terms. Again, Lisa shared a framework out of the Me2B Alliance to illustrate how P7012 can matter in the arc of a digital relationship, such as between an individual and a web site.<br></p> ToIP <p>Judith Fleenor presented an Introduction To Trust Over IP, introducing <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>, and reviewing their first year as part of the digital identity community, focussing on not only the technical questions around decentralized identity, but also accountability on the legal, business and social impact layers. Neil Thomson gave an overview of one cluster of related work items at ToIP entitled VCs Meet Reality: Custom VC Evaluation with Privacy that went into the weeds on the nuances of progressive disclosure and privacy considerations of complex, real-world use-cases involving sensitive personal data requiring consent receipts and the like. This work was partly done in the context of the Brussels-funded <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/essif-lab/">ESSIF-LAB incubator</a> project, which allowed European startups (many of them DIF members) to collaborate on privacy and regulatory compliance issues specific to the European context.<br></p> Next Steps <p>Many thanks and much praise to the dedicated team at IIW for running a virtual event of this scale, and providing a virtual venue for such vibrant exchanges and discussion. As always, the conversations at IIW are like games of jump-rope: you can jump in and out at any time with a little tact and coordination. Many of these conversations happen at DIF, or have touchpoints with DIF that give periodic updates at DIF meetings, and the upcoming DIF Face-to-Face in early 2022 will include major updates from many of these. In particular, DIF’s <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/productmanagers">community of practice</a> for Product Managers and UX professionals is actively seeking discussion topics and presentations to keep the momentum going between IIWs and DIF F2Fs, so do <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/groups">join the mailing list</a> and reach out if you’d like to discuss product ideas, user stories, and UX quandaries. As always, the best way to keep up-to-date, gain insight and learn-while-doing is to <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/">get involved directly</a> with the open-source decentralized identity community.</p>

 Working on the digital vision for Julie’s&nbsp;Bicycle <p><a href="https://juliebicycle.com">Julie’s Bicycle</a> is a non-profit helping organisations in the arts and culture sector understand their carbon footprints. They’ve created a unique set of tools, the <a href="https://ig-tools.com/login">Creative Green Tools</a>, as well as many high-impact programmes specifically to support the creative&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Over the last months, our vision for the digital transformation and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/climate-change-for-the-better-457134bd0b43">strategic direction</a> for Julie’s Bicycle (JB) has solidified. We are pleased to note that not only have we assisted Julie’s Bicycle in hiring their first ever Product Lead, we’ve also established a pathway and guideposts designed to help JB achieve a digital vision that will put them squarely in the column of digital leader for the climate&nbsp;crisis.</p> External vision <p>It should come as no surprise that We Are Open is encouraging JB to become an open organisation (<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/open-course/">we do this all the time!</a>). We are advising they move forward with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service#OpenSaaS">OpenSaaS</a> model and pair it with a community strategy in which they fly the flag of openness together with environmentalism.</p><p>The external development piece of this strategy details the community-driven approach and processes that will help Julie’s Bicycle grow strategically and sustainably. Key to this development is embedding the open approach, which will help JB bring its existing audience and help them to leverage community in ways which would significantly augment opportunities for Julie’s&nbsp;Bicycle.</p>how the different pieces of the community interact. cc-by We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op<p>We’ve used JB’s theory of change to create three distinct design principles for the digital work JB has on the horizon. With creativity, sustainability and solidarity, JB will design its tools and resources together with and for the cultural community. The “Creative Climate Digital Platform” will connect and make visible all climate action taking place in the cultural sector for advocacy and communications. This will enable users to communicate climate action and campaign/advocate to their own creative communities.</p><p>We will create an intersection between climate activism and technology by engaging with and inside of the Open Source community, and we will use these associations to foster peer to peer knowledge exchange, collaborative problem-solving, an opportunity to use and improve tools and resources and leadership in the climate tech&nbsp;space.</p>cc-by We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op<p>The overarching objectives for the community are&nbsp;to:</p>  Enable peer to peer knowledge sharing so that we are making all creative climate action visible, profiling emerging and established sector experts, encouraging collaborative problem-solving and leadership, supporting people to connect with each other and learn new and best practices, and co-create new knowledge with the sector directly.  Make visible the global creative response to the climate challenge, enabling a coherent advocacy tool and a joined-up approach to creative climate action across the&nbsp;world.   Internal Vision <p>As an open mindset is not something that can be delivered by an Openness team but should be embedded across the organisation, we’ve created an internally focused strategy to help JB integrate the necessary tools and processes. This way of working will open new doors for staff as well as for external collaborators and partnerships.</p><p>We started by looking at the systems they use (e.g. a ‘<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/content-is-king-queen-and-everything-inbetween-3c2fc4b1e19c">System Ecosystem</a>’) and thinking about ways digital could augment and support collaboration inside the organisation. We are considering the overlap between internal work practices and external engagement and planning for the remix and reuse of documentation for the good of the external strategy. We’re also advising on software choices that can help JB staff manage the complexity of JB’s work, both now and in the&nbsp;future.</p>cc-by We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op<p>We know that our way of working is becoming more common, but there are peculiarities in the world of non-profit that have to be taken into account when doing digital transformations towards openness. Though still works in progress, we are establishing the groundwork to help JB staff learn about open principles and practices. We are preparing ourselves for a deeper engagement on these topics in&nbsp;2022.</p> Next year <p>We are pleased that JB is eager to continue working with us and are thus beginning to write phase plans for 2022. On the tools side of things, we are still collaborating closely with our friends at <a href="https://outlandish.coop">Outlandish</a>.

<p>GHP Guardianship Blog<br>John Phillips and Jo Spencer</p>



 Does international travel only ever involve independent adults? 



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for trusted sharing of verifiable data and the use of digitally-enhanced credentials. Check-in apps may or may not be a temporary requirement whilst we get on top of the pandemic, but the need to present a combination of tickets, visas, identity “documents” and vaccination certificates has always been a challenge for travel and other scenarios. The more you have to show, and the more complex the rules that need to be applied, the more complicated it becomes for all involved. The need to “open-up” safely and support domestic and international travel, as vaccinations roll out widely, gives us the opportunity and need to consider how best to build trusted travel information sharing solutions based on global standards, open software and governed participants and rules.</p>



<p>One of the realizations and perspectives resulting from nearly 2 years of work on guardianship (for minors or adults who need care) is that our societies and economies are not made of independent adults alone, and yet that is all too often an implicit assumption in the way we design and build solutions using digital interactions. Having come to this realisation, we now see this challenge everywhere that digital solutions and interactions are proposed. We need to consider how best to provide support for dependent minors and adults and their guardians in travel, as we should for all affordances in human life.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://lnkd.in/gfwuM-qi">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint</a> is an international effort of more than 120 people from many organizations and countries. A few months ago, we (Jo Spencer and John Phillips) were asked by chairs working on the Blueprint to write an addendum for guardianship to consider how travel for accompanied and unaccompanied minors and adult dependents might best be enabled with digital health and travel passes.</p>



<p>After several months of work, incorporating the team from the Sovrin Guardianship Working Group and others, with valuable insights from several airlines and people working with International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Guardianship addendum is ready for formal publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can download the&nbsp;<a href="https://live-trustoverip.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GHP-Guardianship-Addendum.pdf">Addendum PDF</a>&nbsp;directly or find it on our&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/deliverables/">Tools &amp; Specifications page</a>.</p>



<p>The GHP Blueprint provides a comprehensive framework for the processes of registration, credential construction and travel planning catered to the use of digital and physical verifiable credentials. However the first release doesn’t cater for supported travel and the resulting process and credential implications.</p>



<p>Travel by accompanied and unaccompanied dependents is all too often not considered by designers – it’s not part of the ‘normal’ flow. A minor consequence of this is poor journey experiences and inconvenience for the carers and their dependents, the major consequence is that it exposes vulnerable people to exploitation and travel companies to risk and liability.</p>



<p>The addendum looks to add value into the GHP Blueprint in the consideration of supported travel. It uses the approach and “mental model” developed within the Sovrin Guardianship Working Group and articulated in the ESSIF-Lab Framework&nbsp;<a href="https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-pattern-list">Mental Models</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The expectation expressed in the addendum is that as travel restrictions are eased, we will see a large up-tick in family travel and hence addressing the need for parents holding digital and digitally-enabled credentials was worth addressing. During the development of the addendum it became obvious that existing processes and practices followed by airlines and others are often informal and most written considerations are aimed at the specific case of travelling minors (rather than travelling dependent adults). The use of digital credentials would need to be able to add levels of trust into the process of registration-departure-travel-arrival and provide practical enhancement and efficiencies, without creating a burden. Current transit processes are generally not focused on providing proof of guardianship statuses, even for unaccompanied travel scenarios.</p>



<p>Applying the developed models of guardianship, using the flexibility of Verifiable Credentials and the trusted mechanisms of sharing VCs, can provide the ability to add guardianship credentials into the travel process (or not) without breaking the existing approach and complicating the technical details defined in the Blueprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In future releases of the Blueprint, we’ll look to incorporate considerations of supported travel and guardianship throughout the Blueprint. For now, the addendum provides an overview of the implications and insights into how accompanied and unaccompanied travel scenarios can be enhanced, efficient and trusted.</p>

  <p>Currently available technology enables global trade to become fully digital. To support this, technical standards must be created, and rules and legislation must be harmonized internationally. Public administrations are to invest in digitalization to the same extent as those trading and also the numerous service providers around trade. The outcome will be promising,  but one success factor is close collaboration between the various players.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/globalisierung/52543/entwicklung-des-warenhandels">volume of globally produced goods and services</a> has approximately doubled in the past 30 years and trade has more than tripled. Many areas of production and trade have been digitized, but in the absence of a universal approach to digital networking, siloed systems have been implemented, creating countless ‘digital islands’. Data is still transferred between the participants’ computer systems on printed documents or as unstructured PDFs. This burden is caused by the lack of interoperability and needs to be overcome, if the potential of digitalization is to be fully leveraged, and to change processes to become safer, more reliable, more sustainable and less expensive. Addressing this challenge would also support preventing criminal or dubious business practices, such as trade-based money laundering, fraud or sustainability claims which are difficult to verify. It will also serve to make trade finance a great deal more accessible to SMEs and so help to close the so-called ‘trade finance gap’ and would also spur sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>Over the same period of time, the past 30 years, information and communications technology has developed very dynamically. While home computers were expensive in the early 1990s and mobile phones were luxury goods, smartphones are now the global standard. Almost all of the performance parameters of these handheld computers exceed those of the supercomputers of the 1990s at drastically reduced energy consumption. The miniaturization and integration of circuits now allows networked sensors and actuators to be connected to machines and everyday objects, which are also becoming increasingly available everywhere. This is the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). Machines ‘talk’ to each other and also interact via smartphones, wearables or voice commands with humans. Ubiquitous computing has become a reality. Data processing can now happen everywhere, at all times and for all purposes!</p>
<p>Again, over the same period, internet and <a href="https://www.dstgb.de/Publikationen/Dokumentationen/Nr.%20148%20-%20Mobilfunk%20-%20Gestern%20-%20Heute%20-%20Morgen/Doku_148_mobilfunk_030518.pdf?cid=6eo">mobile networks</a> have developed just as rapidly. While the focus at the start of digital mobile communications was still on voice transmission, this is now a marginal quantitative event, accounting for less than 1% of the data volume generated in the networks. Data transfers predominate, connectivity speeds and data amounts per month are being sold, the call minute has become obsolete as a billing unit. High quality mobile networks have been commissioned on a global scale. <a href="https://gulfnews.com/special-reports/how-satellites-could-revolutionise-high-speed-internet-for-the-unconnected-know-the-benefits--and-risks-1.1623153273647">Satellite constellations</a> are being put in the sky and will complement mobile networks to entirely close existing connectivity gaps. Every point on the earth’s surface will be networked with high bandwidth and low latencies. Production facilities in Germany, copper mines in Zambia, container ships in the middle of the Pacific and aircrafts flying over China or Brazil will as a result become participants in a continuous data exchange. </p>
<p>This data exchange, running everywhere, at any time and for any purpose can be called ubiquitous networking. Through combining ubiquitous computing and ubiquitous networking, endpoints for human interaction with processes modelled in software become available everywhere. Also machine to machine interactions, more precisely between the software processes running on them, become available everywhere and at any time.</p>
<p>Decentralized business networks, DLT, IoT, AI</p>
<p>The administration of foreign trade takes place within a multitude of systems, most of which are operated in the data centers of trade participants and their service providers. Paper or paper substitutes with poorly structured data are still used in most instances to transfer data between systems. A PDF file is an example of a paper substitute. Although this file is generated and transmitted digitally, it often only replaces the slow mail delivery and does not readily support programmed end-to-end processes. Also the providers of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have insufficiently addressed this challenge so far. Although datasets can be exchanged between the ERP systems of sellers and buyers, this scenario seems to lack technical standards or “neutral ground”. Often data transmissions entail a legal background, for which time stamps are desired along with a legally binding signature. The development of <a href="https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Periodic-Table-WTO-TFG-DLT-Trade-2020.pdf">distributed business networks</a>, featuring a certain degree of decentralization and being located between ERP systems may close this gap.</p>
<p>In the future, decentralized business networks will serve as orchestration means for most complex business processes between stakeholders and service providers. Business interactions related to financial services, logistics services, insurance, customs clearance, inspection certification, certifying origin and other required services can be undertaken within these distributed systems. Required data will be entered into and retrieved from these networks. This will obsolete re-keying of data and data quality will increase as a consequence. For most service providers in the supply chains, decentralized networks may become the primary point of sale. </p>
<p>Generally, the networks are underpinned by a distributed ledger, which restricts system entries to consensus based append only mode, on the basis of predetermined, programmed rules. This creates ‘technical trust’ and will allow the automation of cross-organizational business processes on an unprecedented scale. Smart contracts determine the agreed rules and defined procedures for business processes in code and will be programmed across company boundaries.</p>
<p>A number of technical standards and protocols already exist for exchanging data between different networks, the participants’ back-office systems and the environment’s IoT data sources and sinks. Others are in the design stage and are being developed. The end-to-end use of ISO standards and compliance with United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) <a href="https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/tf_recommendations">recommendations</a> is becoming a prominent quality feature of trading systems. Certification of the standard conformity of these systems may become a service. Extensive data permeability between the networks is the goal, and zero configuration scenarios may become a possibility through standardization. Efficient access to data facilitates the use of artificial intelligence alongside prescriptive and predictive analytics. Use cases could be around fraud deterrence, meeting regulatory obligations without effort, and enabling promising big data based applications. Paper as a means of data sharing will be considered old fashioned and eventually become obsolete. Or even suspicious. But how will the wet ink signatures look like in this new world? How will a data transfer or a data based transaction become legally valid?</p>
<p>Digital identities</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">Digital identities</a> for organizations, people, objects and software processes will be means to grant access rights to numerous systems and networks and to the transactions managed on them. Directory services, which today assign role based access privileges in software systems, and regulate access to organizations' resources and services, will gradually be replaced by external services for digital identities, and so migrate into the decentralized space between the companies. Roles and privileges will in this way be exposed in a programmable and verifiable way to the outer world, into a fabric of digitally rendered services. </p>
<p>In simple terms, a digital identity consists of one <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">identifier</a> (or many) and several <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a> attached to it. Both components have been extensively standardized by the W3C. As the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a company’s globally unique identifier it will serve well as root of an organization’s identity. The verifiable Legal Identifier will allow to amend the LEI by verifiable credentials, some of which can grant an organization’s employee access to transactions in third-party systems. The verifiable credentials granting access or certifying facts are digitally signed by those granting or certifying, and hence programmatically verifiable by the stakeholders of the respective transactions by means of software processes This can therefore take place  automatically, reliably and audited.   </p>
<p>An example from the field of digital identities illustrates this: To process a letter of credit, a bank will need to access several business networks in which the purchase order, commercial invoice, bill of lading and certificate of origin are all digitally recorded. The access rights to the respective transactions in these third-party systems will be transferred into the bank’s digital identity as a set of verifiable credentials as soon as the buyer specifies in a B2B-network or letter of credit network that the bank has been commissioned to issue the letter of credit pertaining to the transaction. The bank may then delegate the access right to these datasets to its employees involved in the process, by transferring a corresponding verifiable credential into their personal digital identity. This will allow the bank’s employees or even the bank’s software autonomous processes to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>The transaction conducted by means of a digital identity relies on an X.509 certificate, which is part of a chain of trust that ends at the trust root. The authorization and authenticity of the transaction carried out by these means is cryptographically guaranteed and is likely to be covered in Germany by the eIDAS implementing act and the legal directives issued for this purpose. Equivalent regulations in non-European legal areas would be necessary and should be asserted, produced and enacted.</p>
<p>Creating network effects</p>
<p>Similar questions about ‘statutory congruence’ arise when using electronic records for trade documentation. Little progress can be made if the use of electronic records for bills of lading and consignment bills is legally admissible in the exporting country, while the importing country enforces a fallback to expensive and slow paper processes for legal reasons. The legal basis for doing business in globally strung networks should be standardized. In 2017 the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) presented a proposal for national laws to be adapted, the <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records">ML-ETR</a>, i.e to cater for globally harmonized legislation on the transfer of property titles securitized in negotiable trade instruments.</p>
<p>The vision of an internet of trade also requires considerable joint efforts on a technical level to become a reality. Technical standards ensure interoperability and should be jointly developed and also deflated where several existing standards compete for the same purpose. A technical commercial language of uniform vocabulary, semantics and syntax is desirable as it would significantly ease, cheapen and accelerate the interlinking of the multitude of systems and networks. An example is the core business vocabulary in the <a href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/docs/casestudies/gs1_epcis_source_to_shelves.pdf">EPCIS standard from GS1</a>.</p>
<p>Trading parties and their service providers, such as banks, insurers, logistic service providers and inspectors are facing major changes. These will impact internal IT and process landscapes, qualifications of employees involved in trading processes and products offered. Public administrations and customs authorities should play a leading role in this process and ideally set a global course. <a href="https://peppol.eu/about-openpeppol/history-of-openpeppol/">Peppol</a> is a European example for this.</p>
<p>The ICC has taken up the role as a global convenor of the numerous standardization bodies working towards these goal. The <a href="http://dsi.iccwbo.org/">ICC Digital Trade Standards Initiative</a> has started operations in mid 2020.</p>
<p>The changes will be so sweeping that even large organizations and enterprises will not be able to make a difference on their own. To create a network of networks and realize the full potential of  network effects, all parties must cooperate in a coopetion effort. COVID-19, besides being a regrettable misery for many, has worked as an unprecedented accelerator for global digitalization efforts.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>World trade will become almost entirely digitalized and networked in the course of the next decade. Siloed systems and paper-based documentation are becoming increasingly sidelined and will soon be deemed in arrears. From the convergence of different technologies, a nervous system of the world economy is emerging and is about to be woven with ever increasing density.</p>
<p>The ability to participate digitally in commercial trade is becoming critical and requires companies to embrace new processes and skills. Public administrations should seize the opportunitiy and rapidly progress their digitalization efforts and promote technical standards. Global cooperation among the large variety of stakeholders around trade is required.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> are two of the popular open source repositories that can help propel development of decentralised identity products and services. Aries is a toolbox of several blockchain-agnostic repositories that allow for trusted online peer-to-peer interactions based on decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. The project grew out of work that was happening in Indy to create technologies for managing decentralized identity. Aries was moved to graduated status by the TSC in February 2021. Indy graduated in 2019 and provides a specific blockchain purpose-built for identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeing the growth in interest for these two projects, Hyperledger Foundation has partnered with member company <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and its team of deeply experienced developers and architects to develop this free, multi-course curriculum to help developers and architects gain a deeper understanding of decentralized identity, with a deep dive into Aries and Indy. Registration and preparation information can be found on this <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops">Workshops page</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These two four-hour, beginning level hands-on workshops provide opportunities to install and run the Indy and Aries components just like you would if you were making a real Indy-based network or Aries-based application. They introduce the necessary Git repos as well as how to use the Indy Command Line Interface (Indy CLI), run the Aries toolbox and create and issue a verifiable credential. They also introduce some current projects using Aries and Indy to help you accelerate your understanding of decentralized identity and build the skills necessary to successfully make changes to the underlying code with hands-on guidance to develop your own projects.</p>

<p>Neil Thomson – QueryVision</p>



 Terms 



<p>PII/SD – a broader capture of personal data to include Personally Identifiable Information (<a href="https://piwik.pro/blog/what-is-pii-personal-data/#what-is-personally-identifiable-information-(pii)?">PII</a>) and (personally) Sensitive Data (SD). Examples: medical or financial records or location history</p>



 Introduction 



<p>Several problems currently remain unsolved in the ToIP stack and SSI in general, which appear a natural fit for a digital equivalent of a “Notary public” as a trusted independent agent (or agent/agency), which may be a combination of human and computational services.</p>



<p>In the SSI book scenario, “Alice sells the car to Bob”, the transaction is completed between Alice and Bob directly. They individually deal with car financing, payment, ownership exchange, and license transfer themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper builds on that scenario with “Bob buys a house from Alice”. A home purchase is an example of a more complex, real-world transaction. In the non-SSI world, it typically involves formal agreements and can require personal guarantees, exchanging PII through a Lawyer or “Notary Publique/Public Notary”.</p>



<p>A Notary acts as a trusted 3rd party for both Bob and Alice. The Notary’s duties include ensuring documentation is complete, issues are resolved (state of the home/property), creating a sale contract, doing various searches and registration updates, overseeing fund transfers, paying taxes, etc.</p>



<p>The rationale for working through an SSI version of a home sale is to explore how to structure online transactions in a privacy-preserving manner while preventing the following scenario:</p>



  A Financial transaction between individuals fails– Alice agrees to a financial transaction with Bob to provide a service via a direct person-to-person peer-DID (“contextual” identities) connection with some VC/proof exchange to establish trust, but otherwise avoiding the exchange of PII or root identity.  Bob accepts payment from Alice, then dissolves the relationship by tearing down the communication channel, wipes any record of Alice or their own contextual identity (peer DID), does not provide the service and when eventually found by Alice, disputes the agreement.  



<p>As a side benefit, this scenario also explores the Digital Notary role as a transaction assistant, acting as a trusted delegate of both Bob and Alice.</p>



 Problem 



<p>The direct Bob/Alice interaction model of “Alice sells the car to Bob” was intended to show that SSI interactions can handle real-world transactions. The example includes a person-to-person transaction using DIDS that includes a car as an SSI entity in its own right, with its own independent identity and related records.</p>



<p>Given that base, how does SSI handle the more complex day-to-day transactions, including inter-personal and person-to-organization transactions?</p>



<p>Online Transactions and the ability to negotiate – Currently, a standard way of handling online interpersonal transactions is via a service like PayPal. The problem is that the individual frequently has no control over the transaction “contract” nor the ability to negotiate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A case in point is buyers and sellers using PayPal as a transaction broker, where “Legal Agreements for PayPal Services” primarily protects PayPal vs. Buyers, Sellers or the actual money transfer.</p>



<p>This problem is resolved in “human space” via agreements negotiated directly or through a 3rd party, including penalties or holdbacks (or performance bonds).</p>



<p>Privacy – Bob and Alice are most likely strangers who, for most interactions, only need to establish contextual identities, with trust established for the current context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In human space, transactions that can result in (financial) harm (such as selling a home) require bank-level KYC level identification verification.&nbsp; This is required to reach either party should terms and conditions in a contract not be met or damages sought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As was debated at IIW 33, you only have complete control of your personal data (and privacy) if you don’t interact with anyone or anything, in person or digitally.</p>



<p>The human space solution is to interact via a mutually agreed trusted 3rd party.</p>



<p>This also serves to address the problem for Bob and Alice, that they may not be aware of all the tasks that are required in a transaction that does not result in injury to one or both parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What could a digital, SSI version of the human space solution look like?</p>



 Requirements for the Solution 



<p>Buying and selling a house has potential complications which could financially impact the Buyer or Seller. So the overall requirement is to protect the buyer and seller through:</p>



  Ensuring that all financial and non-financial issues related to the property and home are known and transparent to the Buyer and Seller  That the parties in the transaction MUST be identified to a bank-level “know your customer” to ensure complete transparency and accountability, including that:&nbsp;  The Seller is, in fact, the owner and is authorized to sell  That there are guarantees, with enforcement, on redressing financial and physical problems with the home and property after closing the sale  That the Seller will be paid, in full by the Buyer  That the Buyer is entitled to purchase the property (citizenship requirements)    That the privacy and PII/SD data of the Buyer, Seller (and any other parties) must not be disclosed to other parties in the transaction.  That any disputes about the property or home are known and addressed  That all documentation, taxes and other process steps are completed correctly.  The buyer and seller do not personally have to be experts on houses, properties, or a house sale’s legal ramifications.  That the solution provides a framework for semi or fully automating the transaction process, contracts and other agreements, that provides for governance as an integral component  Provide a mechanism for different jurisdictions to provide a model and mechanism for organizations to incorporate governance controlled contracts, terms and conditions    



 Solution(s) 



<p>Note: &nbsp;For this discussion, a Digital Notary is a service that spans the range from a human Notary Public with digital tools to a fully computational home sales process and contracting service, realizing a complete service as a “smart contract”. The same is assumed of other services in this Scenario.</p>



<p>The following is proposed:</p>



<p>An independent agent (Digital Notary) works as a trusted intermediary for parties in transactions within a framework that allows for partial or complete automation of the transaction workflow, including support for formal or “smart” contracts.</p>



<p>The Digital Notary is a first-class SSI entity that can establish communication channels with the parties and supporting services, including establishing trust and exchange of Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Digital Notary (software components) and its collection of related services must be subject to, and certified by, governance authorities (or delegated agencies) for the jurisdiction(s) in which they will operate.</p>



<p>A Digital Notary may collect “know your customer”/”Foundational Identity” PII data from the Buyer and Seller to do the following:</p>



  Bind the buyer and seller to terms and conditions in the house sales contract such that they can be “reached” in the case of a dispute or where “performance bonds” (or equivalents) are required  Obtain delegation from the Buyer and Seller to collect and verify with financial institutions, land registry and financial Lien registries any and all documentation concerning the potential pitfalls about the buyer, seller and the house/property. This may include delegation to make and receive payments on behalf of the parties.  



<p>The current practice for non-digital house sales provides PII (root identity class information) of the Buyer, Seller, and potentially other parties in the sales contract/agreement and related “paperwork” distributed to the Buyer and Seller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this proposal, privacy can be increased through the Notary holding (in trust) the only copy of the complete documentation, including full PII/SD information. The Buyer and Seller receive depersonalized copies.</p>



<p>Disputes on the transaction would be via the Notary of record or delegated to another trusted 3rd party (Lawyer, Courts, etc.) through formal means.</p>



 



 Solution Workflow 



<p>Bob and Alice have agreed that Bob will buy Alice’s house. They have collected the required information and are ready to proceed:</p>







  Bob and Alice create a session with a Digital Notary (DN) Service, where a list of qualified Digital Notaries which can handle house sales in their (governance) jurisdiction(s) are presented. Both parties work to select and agree on the Digital Notary (DN) used.  The selected DN is instantiated and establishes connections with Bob and Alice, establishing trust as a licensed, governed entity using standard SSI workflow.  The DN establishes the specifics of the house sale transaction from Q &amp; A with Bob and Alice, including collecting initial information on the property and house, which may be in the form of documents, claims or VCs, plus any other pertinent information to establish the “components” needed to complete the transaction and any conditions.  The contracts (and other document types) made available for the transaction are from a jurisdiction governed repository of templates, including contract types, terms, clauses, permissible conditions,&nbsp; plus supporting documents, executables, etc. that are required (and optional) and are compatible with the transaction.    The DN requests the required level of identity and delegation authority to complete the transaction  Bob and Alice are requested to provide “know your customer” level (aka “foundational”) identities and grant access to the underlying identity claims to the DN, which the&nbsp; DN verifies with the Issuer(s)  Bob and Alice are asked to delegate the DN the rights to act on their behalf for specified financial transactions, access to house-related information registries and to update or create new entries with specified agencies and services. This may involve using Foundational class identifiers.    The DN interacts with Bob and Alice to collect information to determine the clauses, terms and conditions of the (house sales) contract, which may be constrained by the jurisdictional template(s).  This may include resolution of issues with the property (roof repair) prior to the sale or conditions (a property survey is required, which must not find blocking issues)    The DN may construct manual or automatic logic on steps taken (and verified) and payments to be exchanged as part of the contract  This will likely include the handover of the property and occupancy steps for the new owner (Bob).&nbsp;  This may include holdbacks or performance bonds on post-sale warranties for work done or unknown defects    Bob and Alice (crypto) sign the contract.&nbsp;  The contract is now in execution mode, which will use notifications and events with Bob’s and Alice’s personal Agents to inform each of the obligations, confirm completion of clauses in the contract with completion events from those Agents.  Bob and Alice get copies of the contract(s) and other documents related to the house sale where Bob, Alice and any other parties are de-identified.  The DN registers the contract within the DN trust framework with all the related documentation, including “foundational” identities of the parties    On completion of the contract (including expiry of any conditions, the DN archives the house sale artifacts and “dissolves”&nbsp;  Access to the house sale archive for non-performance of the contract or later discovered issues may be requested with a jurisdiction controlled court order or equivalent.    



 Pros, Cons and Vulnerabilities 



<p>Pros</p>



  Provides an SSI “pattern” of allowing PII information to be used in any interaction between parties in a manner via an independent entity that uses has mechanisms to capture and use PII without disclosure outside the transaction.  Provides a mechanism to immediately use human notaries (or equivalent) as the “glue” using SSI to connect with Bob, Alice and all the related services and agencies in an SSI transaction contract, with the ability to migrate over time to fully automated digital notary/SSI contracts, starting with simple online purchases and moving to more complex contracts over time  



<p>Cons</p>



  “Smart” Contracts are just in their infancy and primarily focused on crypto-coin and currency exchange to non-crypto, so how they evolve is speculation.&nbsp;  



<p>Vulnerabilities</p>



  Unknown – However, the intent is that all the components of the “contract framework” and “digital notary” concepts are that all the components would be 1st class SII components and subject to the same rigour and security standards.

<p>While predictive analytics (PA) has been proliferating over the last decade in a range of sectors, PA systems are, <a href="https://rd4c.org/articles/why-we-need-responsible-data-for-children/index.html">as noted by UNICEF and Govlab</a>, “often designed with (consenting) adults in mind, without a focus on the unique needs and vulnerabilities of children.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020 and 2021, The Engine Room conducted research in partnership with UNICEF to look into predictive analytics specifically in relation to children. Among other questions, we asked:&nbsp;</p>



  How is PA currently being used or proposed in contexts that impact or will impact children?&nbsp;  What are the potential benefits and risks involved?  What should be taken into account when deciding on how – if at all – to implement PA systems in these contexts?&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>We looked at how PA has been or is being used or planned in a number of relevant sectors, including health, education, social welfare and child protection.&nbsp;</p>

 Research findings: Where predictive analytics might impact children, special caution is needed 



<p>Our research posits that it is crucial to carefully consider the ethical implications of predictive analytics specifically as they relate to children, who as a demographic may have distinctly different needs (as reflected in the <a href="https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>). Since machine learning algorithms are typically trained on the data of adults, assumptions based on the behaviour of adults are baked into these models –&nbsp;meaning that their outputs may well be inappropriate for children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research found that, despite limited evidence of PA’s effectiveness in real-world implementation, it does have potential to offer benefits in certain contexts, if responsibly deployed in a way that builds upon contextual knowledge and local expertise, and if used as just one stream of information in combination with these others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Potential benefits might include, for example, improving humanitarian crisis management or enabling more efficient resource allocation, and these benefits best reveal themselves at the population level – that is, in using predictive analytics with population-based outcomes where children are indirectly impacted. It’s worth noting, however, that though the benefits of PA are often touted as increasing efficiency, the evidence in relation to this claim is not comprehensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When PA is used to generate predictions that are targeted to individual children, the potential risks are significant. Our research showed that using PA in this context requires comprehensive risk mitigation measures to avoid causing harm; these are outlined in the report. In this context in particular, predictive analytics should only be understood as part of a much broader assessment to support decision-making –&nbsp;that is, PA should never be relied upon as the sole source of information for making decisions about children’s lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope our findings serve to support both decision-makers and those already working with PA systems, and ultimately contribute towards ensuring the protection of children’s rights throughout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 23,748,232 NFTs on the OpenSea marketplace, each with a different level of quality and technical construction. Some are secure, made for longevity, and technically sound. Many are not – subjecting buyers to hacks, rug pulls, broken images, and missing metadata. </p><p><a href="https://www.fungyproof.com/">FungyProof</a> surfaces this information for users so they can make more informed decisions and improve the quality of their existing NFTs. <a href="https://app.fungyproof.com">Check out the Fungyproof app</a> to discover information about your own NFTs!</p> Not all NFTs are created equal <p>When purchasing NFTs, most users simply look at the associated digital asset (art, song, ticket, etc.) or the creator before pulling the trigger. But an NFT is much more than a single boilerplate Smart Contract. NFTs actually consist of custom logic for token trait randomness (e.g. Chainlink VRF) and Smart Contract properties, linked metadata, linked assets such as images, animations, audio files, 3D files, and more. The manner in which Smart Contract logic is written and external assets are linked varies with each NFT. Combined, these properties make up the NFT’s “Mint Conditions.”</p><p>Want to learn more about how an NFT is constructed? Read this <a href="https://learn.fungyproof.com/">NFT Primer</a>.</p> Token grading can inform NFT buyers <p>Most users are flying blind when purchasing or selling visual media NFTs today, often using subjective measures or social signal to influence buying behavior. With Fungyproof's grading algorithm, users can start to make more informed, data-driven decisions for more intelligent purchasing. Grading a token consists of running the token’s “Mint Conditions'' through the FungyProof grading algorithm. This algorithm is a weighted, score-based system, which assigns a grade based on the technical implementation of a token as well as a few other factors such as energy usage (gas efficiency) and asset retrieval latency. For a full list of the 30+ data points checked, take a look at the <a href="https://fungyproof.notion.site/Grading-Rubrics-f348a35f8b164bb3ab97dec36e6a6e08">grading rubric</a>.</p> Cases protect and enrich your NFT assets  <p>FungyProof Cases enrich existing NFTs, digitally binding to the asset to protect it and help it stand out from the rest. The first set of cases will enrich your NFT by backing it up to decentralized storage solutions (IPFS + Filecoin). This immortalizes the NFT’s Mint Conditions and improves asset and metadata storage, thus improving your NFTs grade. Future cases will enable other enrichments such as carbon offsets, Arweave permaweb storage, attaching encrypted data, earning achievements, and more.</p><p>Cases are a new token standard developed by the Fungyproof team, known as a Non-Fungible Enrichment (NFE) that enables NFTs to own other NFTs. With cases, you can associate new data to your token without having to wrap or otherwise affect it. Once an NFE is bound to a token, any data associated with the NFE, such as the token backup, is then tied to the NFT provably and immutably.</p><p>The team's first set of cases include the standard FungyProof Case and the limited Neon Cases, which support ERC721s and many non-standard NFTs (CryptoPunks, CryptoKitties, etc.). Over time, more cases will launch with new functionality, rarities, and support for more chains. Cases are currently only available on FungyProof, but in the future the team plans to offer the option to "unbind" Cases, allowing users to remove and trade them on marketplaces. </p> Making data accessible through an open registry <p>The registry is a public service that allows anyone to view all of the information about an encased NFT. This information includes a token’s Mint Conditions, bound enrichments, provenance, and more. The registry is accessible through the FungyProof app, API, or on-chain through an NTF’s case via the enrichmentURI contract property.</p><p>The registry is designed for a few use cases:</p>  Buyers purchasing an NFT who want to browse the registry for NFT grades to select one that has been selectively upgraded  Sellers who want to ensure their NFTs are high quality and technically sound for the long-term and protect their reputation  Marketplaces that want to add information for their users    Using Ceramic to Append Metadata  <p>The glue between the FungyProof Case and the NFT registry is the Ceramic metadata. When binding a Case to an NFT, FungyProof needed a mutable metadata storage solution. Changes that occur to the NFT's data -- such as grading, new enrichments, and transfers – need to be appended to the metadata creating a historical audit trail. </p><p>Using Ceramic, FungyProof has created one of the first implementations for dynamically appending metadata to an NFT over time. When you bind a case to an NFT, a metadata file is also generated and stored with it. As the NFT and its value changes, or new enrichment types are available, the Ceramic stream can be updated. This opens the door to unlimited possibilities for enrichable NFTs.</p> What's next for Fungyproof? <p>FungyProof is just getting started. Future plans include new types of enrichments, browser extensions, marketplace and wallet integrations, economic incentives for community contributions, and more.

<p>New Zealand cybercrime continues to grow with the government cyber incident tracking agency, CERT, reporting a 14 percent increase in scams and fraud in the last quarter.</p>



<p>Fraud awareness this week is important for raising awareness of the potential risks Kiwis are facing with increased online activity.</p>



<p>This just shows how critical digital identity trust is in a world that is rapidly becoming more digital, Digital Identity New Zealand executive director Colin Wallis says.</p>



<p>Secure digital identities are an important foundation for the digital economy and with so much business, communication and purchases happening online it is more important than ever to be able to trust in peoples digital identity, he says.</p>



<p>“Having a secure, privacy-aware and trustworthy digital identity system will be important for enabling the economy. This is why Digital Identity NZ members are collaborating to provide feedback via the submission process on the government’s proposed digital identity framework.</p>



<p>“We are also hosting a large conference in May next year on digital trust, bringing together experts in digital identity, privacy and security, which are all needed to create trust.”</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZ is a not-for-profit member association in the NZ Tech Alliance. Wallis says it is working to create a country where people can express their identity using validated and trusted digital processes.</p>



<p>Identity fraud has increased a staggering 86 per cent in the last financial year, while investment fraud has risen by 37 per cent over the same period.</p>



<p>A total of 79 percent of New Zealanders are concerned about the protection of their identity and use of personal data by organisations, according to survey commissioned by Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ).</p>



<p>Walls says there is public concern and some frustration about how their personal data is shared online. Change in behaviour is occurring with 73 percent of Kiwis claiming to have made a change to their online behaviour because of privacy concern.</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2019/05/Digital-Identity-Yabble-Benchmark-Research-Infographic-May-2019.pdf">Their recent survey</a>&nbsp;found 85 percent of respondents said there was a lack of transparency, as well as concern in having to share data with so many organisations.</p>

 🚀 Foundation News 
 
 DIF Comms
 
 ToIP &amp; DIF published a <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec/">Joint Public Statement of Support</a> for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification becoming a W3C Standard 
 Weekly open Comms calls (see <a href="https://bit.ly/dif-calendar">DIF Calendar</a>) continue to be a great venue for generating ideas and collecting feedback from our members. All are welcome, so do drop in! 
 
 
 
   🛠️ Group Updates  
 <a href="http://identity.foundation/interop/interop.html">☂️ InterOp WG (cross-community)</a> 
 
 Ongoing focus: Information accessibility and collection
 
 Information accessibility: How to better structure information, such as the <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">"faq"</a> and the meeting notes for both members and external readers? 
 Information collection: How do we make it easier to contribute and encourage better editing, is this needed? How to best surface pages/examples? 
 Debate about whether to use github for WG notes 
 David, Chris, Balazs, Juan and Snorre to meet for a tooling meeting 19th Aug to discuss and painpoints related to documentation efforts and WG info presentation (open to all membership).

 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">🔓 DID Auth</a> 
 
 SIOP special calls have been making a steady progress, Following are notable changes introduced to a SIOP v2 spec 
 Introduced DID Resolution method as part of RP Registration metadata section. When SIOP request is signed, RP’s <code>client_id</code> can be a DID and SIOP can obtain a key signing the request from RP’s DID Doc. The rest of the RP metadata must be obtained from a <code>registration</code> parameter in the SIOP request. 
 Introduced Dynamic SIOP Discovery metadata option. When RP has pre-obtained SIOP’s issuer identifier, it can use OpenID Connect Discovery to obtain SIOP’s metadata, namely <code>authorication_endpoint</code>. When Dynamic discovery is used <code>iss</code> in the ID Token in SIOP response must be a SIOP issued identifier and NOT <code>self-issued.me/v2</code> 
 OIDC4VP specification has been stable with minimum changes. Work on a spec how to issue VCs using OpenID Connect (which has an option to use Credential Manifest) is also happening, so stay tuned!

 There is a general sense that the next version of DIDComm will be at IETF. But DIF can still remain the home of the DIDComm User's Group. The User's Group can become the focus for implementation help, maintain didcomm.org, and work on the Implementer's Guide.

  <p>As we’ve heard from our partners throughout this interview series, the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative in Africa has been a success for all involved. It is, however just the start. It has been a model showcase for how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the world can gain ‘financial inclusion’ through Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs). The World Bank’s definition of financial inclusion for businesses is that they ‘have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way’.</p>
<p>While financial inclusion for SMEs across the world is a desirable end goal in its own right, it is also important to recognize that the impact of this initiative – when it is rolled out more broadly across multiple emerging markets – will go far beyond the SMEs and financial institutions involved. It has the potential to positively impact the broader economy by significantly strengthening the global supply chain. Let me explain how these two concepts are linked. </p>
<p>The lack of a universal identity prevents SME growth and overseas trade</p>
<p>SMEs make up 90% of businesses globally. However, without legal credibility or a way to officially prove their identity across borders, many of these businesses struggle to access finance, form partnerships or trade overseas – particularly for those in developing markets where a higher risk factor may be perceived. Banks are prohibited from offering them trade finance without undergoing painstaking and costly Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering checks – processes which are hampered without a verified identifier. As a result, the gap between the demand and supply of global trade finance is growing and has now reached <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-11/global-trade-finance-gap-widens-to-1-7-trillion-on-covid-19">$1.7 trillion following a 15% rise since 2018</a>.</p>
<p>The launch of the business identity initiative has illustrated this problem with a focus on Africa. However, it’s important to remember that this is a global challenge faced by SMEs and banks all over the world. And as a result, countless SMEs are prevented from engaging within the global supply chain – whether that is because they can’t invest, scale, or form the necessary partnerships – due to one simple factor. An inability to prove who they are. </p>
<p>The LEI supports expansion of global supply chains and traceability of suppliers</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in Africa, a profusion of benefits arise when financial institutions facilitate the issuance of LEIs to SMEs by becoming <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agents</a>. Which is why financial institutions should now be motivated and encouraged to use this model to deliver a globally recognized identity to their SME customers. Not only will it give SMEs broader access to financial services – a clear benefit to banks – but it has the wider impact of enabling SMEs to apply for trade finance and establish contractual, regulated agreements with banks, payments networks and trading partners. The result will be greater participation in domestic and international markets and a bolstered flow of inbound capital, which can then be used to further fuel the market’s economic development. </p>
<p>Imagine a world where millions more SMEs were able to scale and trade, with trust, internationally. How many more – both in terms of volume and diversity – products and services would be available to us all through the global supply chain, and what would the impact of increased competition be on service and price? It’s an aspirational thought and one which lies within reach. By opening up cross-border trading opportunities to more SMEs, the LEI can be seen as a critical – and immediately available – tool in the drive to create a much broader and more competitive supply chain for businesses worldwide. Additionally, using a global open identifier would help bring transparency to supply chain relationships – a critical component of sustainable supply chain monitoring and reporting.</p>
<p>What’s needs to happen next?</p>
<p>All change has to start somewhere – and the success of the first iteration of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative in Africa shows what great potential lies ahead for the global supply chain and subsequently the world’s economy if financial institutions across more countries take up the reins and drive it forward.</p>
<p>The result of greater financial inclusion among SMEs will be a strong, more diverse, transparent and competitive global supply chain ecosystem. Consequently, we could expect to see the positive impact – financial growth and prosperity – across all types of companies across all regions of the world. </p>
<p>Now that the initaitive has been set in motion, GLEIF invites more financial institutions to explore the benefits of becoming a Validation Agent to support – and derive the benefits from – broader financial inclusion among SMEs. GLEIF continues to seek dialogue with governments, NGOs, banks and other stakeholders interested in either expanding the LEI initiative across Africa or in replicating the model in other developing countries. We’re here to help.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s Note: This is the final blog posting covering the 2021 FIDO Developer Challenge. We invite you to read the previous blog posts to learn more about past stories:</p>



  <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/announcing-the-fido-developer-challenge-for-developers-across-the-globe/">Announcing the FIDO Developer Challenge for Developers Across the Globe</a>  <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge-welcoming-teams-to-the-implementation-stage/">FIDO Developer Challenge: Welcoming Teams to the Implementation Stage</a>  



<p>This year’s FIDO Developer Challenge reached a successful conclusion, with a ceremonial event during <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2021-conference/">Authenticate 2021</a> in Seattle. The recorded <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge/">video</a> of the ceremony is available now, and we’re pleased to share more detailed stories of the three finalists as well as the rest of the teams that made it to the final stage.</p>



 Leaders of the Top Three Teams. 



<p>Gold Winner – Lockdrop</p>



<p>Lockdrop, a company based in Toronto, Canada, strengthened their document transfer service using end-to-end encryption with WebAuthn as an MFA authentication option. The team wants to help businesses and people exchange larger datasets easily and securely, a problem that is prevalent across most industries and results in people falling back to insecure and/or archaic forms of data transfer such as email, fax, CD-ROMs (yes, CD-ROMs!), and USB sticks.</p>



<p>Silver Winner – Shaxware</p>



<p>Shaxware is a company located in Tokyo, Japan. They created a Proof of Concept, fashioning the Japanese National ID Card (My Number Card) into a FIDO roaming authenticator. They proposed to extend WebAuthn by using the external IC card as a primary digital certificate.</p>



<p>Bronze Winner – SoundAuth</p>



<p>SoundAuth is the team name for a company (Trillbit) based in Boston with R&amp;D staff stationed in India. This team built a FIDO MFA solution that leverages data over sound technology to provide a seamless user experience while eliminating the need to rely on an additional hardware token or internet connectivity.</p>



<p>From the initial pool of applicants, fourteen teams from eight different countries (Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, USA, Vietnam) competed throughout the FIDO implementation stage – including the three finalists detailed above. There were also many concepts that did not make the top three yet have shown compelling ways to leverage the strength and usability of FIDO Authentication. Examples include:</p>



  a FIDO and AI-based remote test proctoring system (India)  a web payment system, leveraging FIDO-based digital wallet (France)  a FIDO-based online note-taking apps for developers (Vietnam)  FIDO-based VPN access (South Korea)  FIDO and AI-based assisted technology for visually impaired people (South Korea)  



<p>Thanks and final thoughts</p>



<p>The 2021 FIDO Developer Challenge was made possible by the support and active engagement from the event <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge-our-sponsors/">sponsors</a> – who not only helped fund the event operations and prizes, but gave hands-on feedback and guidance as judges. Thanks also to the W3C and WebAuthn community for guidance and support through the FDC Discord Channel – it was great to see so many people weighing in to help these development teams.</p>



<p>We were very pleased to have built off of our prior developer hackathon efforts in Korea, to have brought the challenge global, and to have added&nbsp; a focus on public APIs. The Challenge demonstrated that the combination of open technology coupled with the entrepreneurial vision of a developer will result in inspiring outcomes and innovation. We look forward to expanding this effort in 2022. Please don’t hesitate to reach out (<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/contact/">https://fidoalliance.org/contact/</a>) should you have any feedback or suggestions on the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Written by <a href="https://medium.com/@markus.sabadello?source=post_page-----48e6b4a5cc3c--------------------------------">Markus Sabadello</a> and Bernhard Fuchs, edited by Chris Kelly<br></p><p>In May 2021, the DIF <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a> set up a weekly Special Work Item Call (held in addition to regular "main" Working Group calls), to make progress specifically on the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/">Universal Resolver</a> project, developing a tool which can resolve DIDs across multiple DID methods, based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID Core 1.0</a> and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">DID Resolution</a> specifications. The minutes and recordings of these weekly meetings can be found on the Working Group's <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md#special-work-item-calls)">agenda page</a> on GitHub, hosted alongside the Open Source Universal Resolver documentation and code.<br></p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@grakozy?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Greg Rakozy</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a><p>The main achievements of the dedicated Work Item calls can be summarized as follows:<br></p>  Driver policy updates: added <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/main/docs/driver-development.md#how-we-handle-problems-with-drivers">a troubleshooting guide for dockerized drivers</a> .  Successful issue review: all <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">GitHub</a> issues have been addressed with PRs and/or closed with explanatory comments along the way.  Improvements in deployment, testing, and release: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/charts">Helm</a> charts contributed by member org <a href="http://spherity.com">Spherity GmbH</a>, Prometheus integration, etc.  Review and application of findings from a <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/issues/86">Security Quickscan</a>, conducted by security specialists from <a href="https://radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a>.<br>  <p>Considering that the group has accomplished these goals, there is currently no more need for dedicated calls. Work on the Universal Resolver work item will continue on Github (under the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/">Identifiers &amp;Discovery</a> repositories) and on DIF Slack in the Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group channel, #wg-id. Going forward, a time slot on the "main" I&amp;D Working Group calls can be requested by any member of the community to discuss topics related to the Universal Resolver project.<br></p><p>Current topics and future plans for the Universal Resolver include:<br></p>  An open directory of well-known public instances of the Universal Resolver, operated by the community (see <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/pull/214">open PR</a>).  Additional integration with test suites, to verify standards-compliance of drivers.  Ongoing addition and maintenance of drivers for supported DID methods.<br>  <p>As a service to the community, DIF will continue to host an instance of the Universal Resolver (currently reachable at <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>), which can be used for testing and experimentation.<br></p><p>Many thanks to all who have contributed to this important project! </p><p>Why not <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/">get involved</a> at the Decentralized Identity Foundation and see what else is in the works!</p>

<p>When I first came across <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, I was still a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht. I had never contributed to open source, and only minimally understood how the process of contributing and maintaining even functioned. Now, only two years later, my company (<a href="https://animo.id/">Animo</a>) specializes in building SSI solutions using Hyperledger Aries and other SSI technologies, and I am one of the core contributors to a lot of the open source libraries built on top of it.</p>



<p>In this blogpost I’m going to share what it’s like to be a maintainer for the Hyperledger Aries project. You’ll learn how you can start contributing and maybe even set yourself on a path to becoming a maintainer.</p>



 The ecosystem 



<p>Hyperledger Aries provides standards and protocols focused on holding and exchanging verifiable credentials, but it is much more than that. Hyperledger Aries provides the foundation for peer-to-peer interactions, exchange of verifiable credentials and secure messaging. It provides standards through the so-called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFCs</a> and has open source implementations in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">Rust</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">.NET</a>.</p>



<p>Aries uses <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md">DIDComm</a> for a secure messaging protocol, but <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm is a lot more than just a way to exchange credentials</a>. Once you start getting a sense of the enormous potential of DIDComm, it’s difficult not to get excited. Aries provides you with an agent that helps you manage your digital interactions, just like your browser helps you interact with the web.</p>



<p>At <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo</a>, we’re leveraging Aries at the core of almost all of our projects. We contribute to several open source frameworks, develop applications on top of these frameworks and build end-to-end solutions using verifiable credentials. For example, we recently started a pilot with the <a href="https://odyssey.org/past-editions/odyssey-2020/public-safety-and-security/inclusive-safety-communities">Centre for Emergency Control Room Innovation</a> that leverages DIDComm for secure communication and exchange of location between the emergency call centre staff and a qualified volunteer. Although we are involved with several Aries frameworks, we have a particular expertise in (and fondness for) Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ).</p>



<p>We use AFJ for most of our projects. We’ve contributed a lot to it because, simply put, we saw the potential of the framework and someone needed to do the work to get it there. Being a maintainer of a project means more than just contributing code.It means you’re responsible for the overall direction and vision of the project. Maintainers concern themselves with the roadmap, the place of the project within the ecosystem and coordination of working group efforts and calls. On a more operational level, there’s also a lot of reviewing pull requests, addressing github issues, answering questions on Rocket.Chat and writing documentation. If this sounds time consuming, that’s because it is. But putting in the effort is essential to creating long lasting, structurally sound code that can be freely used by anyone to build amazing things.</p>



<p>Contributing to a project hosted by Hyperledger, specifically, means you get a lot of the needed infrastructure other projects might not have. There is a wiki for meeting notes, a Zoom account for our meetings, GitHub repos, unlimited CI minutes, a chat platform, and assistance from the Hyperledger staff when needed.</p>



 Becoming a maintainer 



<p>I can recommend that every developer be involved with open source, and every company invest in open source software. Open source software provides the foundation for almost all software in the world, and is essential for a world where self-sovereign identity becomes a standard.</p>



<p>Besides, working on open source software can be a really good learning experience. You get to work with some of the greatest minds of the industry on the future of digital identity. Maintaining and contributing to Hyperledger, and open source in general, has been really valuable for me. There is something magical about how open source works, and how we can work together towards a shared goal, even if you’re halfway across the world.</p>



<p>I can imagine that sounds a bit intimidating. Luckily, you don’t have to start out this way. You can start the way we all do, by quietly listening to working group calls until you find something you want to participate in. Once you decide you’d like to become a contributor or a maintainer, you’ll find that communities will be happy to help you get started.</p>



<p>Here are some of my personal tips to get involved with a Hyperledger project. I’ve used the AFJ community as an example throughout.</p>



  Attend working group calls – Working group calls are the perfect place to introduce yourself and show your ambition to contribute to the project. This is also the place to stay up to date on the current and planned work of the project. (<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Framework+JS+Meetings">AFJ Meetings</a>)  Get familiar with the codebase – Even though it can be daunting and hard to make sense of a project at first, it is important to get familiar with the project. You should make it as easy as possible for maintainers to review your initial PR and get it merged! (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">AFJ Repository</a>)  Answer questions on Rocket.Chat – Help other people get started with the project and answer their questions! You learn a lot by finding answers to other people’s questions. And also don’t hesitate to ask questions yourself. There are a lot of people with very specific domain knowledge eager to answer your questions. (<a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries">Aries Channel</a>, <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-javascript">AFJ Channel</a>)  Look at open issues – Knowing what to work on can be complex when getting familiar with a new project. Github issues often describe missing features or bugs, which can be a great way to find the first item to work on. In AFJ, we currently have more than 70 open issues,&nbsp; all waiting for someone to pick them up. (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues">AFJ Open Issues</a>)  Read about the topic – Read about the topics that underpin the project. For SSI, I recommend reading the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self Sovereign Identity</a> book. If you’re ready to get a bit more in-depth, I recommend to start reading the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFCs</a>. These are fundamental for contributing to any Aries project.  



<p>My best advice is to experience it yourself. Even the smallest pull request is valuable to a project and can give you the confidence to keep going. And, before you know it, you’re the maintainer of a project yourself.</p>



<p>If you have any questions, or if you’d like to make contributing to open source software your job, you can reach me at timo@animo.id. We’re always looking for motivated and ambitious people to join our team and are always happy to help new contributors get started.</p>

<p>The breakthrough innovation of the Ethereum blockchain is the enablement of smart contract execution in a decentralized way, which opened the door for decentralized applications interacting with digital assets. The next major step on the roadmap of web3 will be the bloom of decentralized social networks and the blockchain-based Metaverse. A decentralized social graph protocol to describe the relationships between users and entities will be a critical backbone for this. </p><p>Using Ceramic, CyberConnect is building a new decentralized social graph protocol. This critical piece of web3 infrastructure is blockchain-agnostic and openly accessible for developers to build decentralized social networks and other apps in the Metaverse.</p><p>Want to get the latest updates on CyberConnect? Follow the team on <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberConnectHQ">Twitter</a>!</p> The downfalls of today's gated social networks  <p>The rise of global social network giants has empowered the centralized tech cartels to misuse user data, infringe on user privacy and impose censorship. As reported after the investigation by Cambridge Analytica, Facebook collected social graphs and personal profiles from millions of users without their consent, with the end goal of fueling more directed political advertising and inappropriately profiting from the personal data of their users. The current landscape of web2, filled with centralized social networks, has deviated from the principle of the World Wide Web. Namely: to enable the decentralization of information on a large scale.</p> CyberConnect Protocol: A user data solution for Web3.0 <p>In the early web2 era, there were isolated social graphs for each social application, but people quickly got tired of registering and redeclaring friends on every new site. Thus, the optimal solution at that time was to consolidate all the relationships onto one app, i.e. Facebook. As soon as Facebook gained mass adoption and realized the value of the social graph it owned, the company swiftly changed its policy and shut down its API to protect itself from future competition. The initial promise of a shared social graph was broken, and the door to the world's largest social data was closed for good.</p><p>To combat this paradigm, CyberConnect aims to empower Web3 social networks to be decentralized, censorship-free, and self-sovereign. CyberConnect is proposing a new decentralized social graph protocol, a web3 infrastructure that is blockchain-agnostic and openly accessible to all. The goal is not to build a one-for-all social network. Instead, CyberConnect welcomes all web3 citizens and dApps to contribute to the protocol, building social networks and Metaverses collaboratively.</p><p>As the next stage of web3 begins to take shape, the CyberConnect protocol will offer decentralized options for how data is used and perceived with the following features:</p>  Publicly accessible: the decentralized social graph data will be publicly accessible for all dApps as an add-on feature for developers to leverage user connections to grow beyond their existing user base  Self-sovereign: while the social graph data is open to all, only users have full control over their own social graphs (i.e., adding, deleting, and updating the connections)  Blockchain-agnostic: instead of tying to a single blockchain, the protocol is created for a multi-blockchain ecosystem to support connections from anywhere  Decentralized governance: inspired by Ethereum’s vision, CyberConnect will commit to the ideals of shared security, permissionless systems, and decentralized governance, which will shape the roadmap and development of the protocol   Token-incentivized: in order to support the long-term development of the CyberConnect Protocol, CyberConnect will introduce a token-incentivized model in the beginning stage to fairly reward all contributors who help bootstrap the social graph  Options for privacy-preserving features: CyberConnect knows some users care about their connection data more than others do, and as such is actively researching the technical solutions for enabling privacy-preserving features in the future  Play socially with friends and see your rank in web3 games Using Ceramic to build a decentralized social graph database  <p>At the heart of CyberConnect is a tamper-proof data structure that efficiently facilitates the creation, update, query and verification of user-centric data. Long-term data retention on CyberConnect is guaranteed through Ceramic’s blockchain anchoring and a custom data pinning service. </p> Multi-account identity <p>CyberConnect also uses Ceramic and the platform's 3ID DID method to ensure that users are authenticated and authorized to write data streams. The 3ID DID handles secure key rotation (different from blockchain private key) so that users are not at risk of losing their transactional private key and thus access to all their corresponding social data. 3ID DID also supports cross-chain, multi-wallet use cases so that users can connect accounts into a seamless identity structure, ensuring CyberConnect is future proof.</p> Identity index for composability <p>CyberConnect also uses IDX, Ceramic's identity protocol, for easy user data indexing and integration with other protocols and applications. IDX provides a unified interface for application developers to query data within an user's namespace, both within and outside of CyberConnect.</p> Universal social graph index <p>CyberConnect also sources and curates social graph data from platforms including Foundation, Rarible, and even web2 platforms such as Twitter. The aggregation of all this data creates a rich and unique user experience. For example, imagine a social platform that is able to provide every user with an automatically generated "suggested user list" based on who they have bought NFTs from historically, who they've transacted with (sent/received tokens or NFTs), and who they follow on other platforms like Rarible and Twitter. This is dramatically different from most new social platforms being created in today's centralized architecture, in which you start from scratch at every opportunity. </p><p>CyberConnect also indexes higher dimensional network data, which allows it to generate new connection suggestions based on existing social graphs. This curation and indexing aims to combine both the user-owned publicly accessible social graph with other off-chain data from across web2 and web3 applications.</p>Get content recommendations based on a personal social graph<p>This universal social graph index is exposed to application developers through an API gateway. Developers can easily build a new "instagram for NFTs" without worrying about building and managing the corresponding database to store contact lists and follows. As such, CyberConnect accelerates time to value for application developers, allowing them to focus on content curation and recommendation algorithms based on the social graph data. Similarly, developers can focus on game experience instead of social components, using CyberConnect to import existing friends lists, similar to Steam.</p> What's Next for CyberConnect <p>Beyond the CyberConnect Protocol, the CyberConnect team has also recently announced CyberChat, a trustless, decentralized chat app that helps round out the social ecosystem for web3. CyberChat enables users to log in with a blockchain wallet, create their user profile based on on-chain data, and frictionlessly send chat messages while interacting with the blockchain. With CyberChat, decentralized projects and DAOs can now manage their communities on a crypto-native basis.</p><p>For more information, read the official white paper on the <a href="https://cyberconnect.me/">CyberConnect website</a>.

<p>Updated 18 Nov 2021 with more details about our second community call, scheduled for December 2nd 2021.</p>



<p>As the effects of the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-are-living-in-a-climate-emergency-and-were-going-to-say-so/">ongoing climate emergency</a> amplify, the fight for environmental justice has become more crucial than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While technology is being used to support these efforts, it is also part of the problem: technological ‘innovation’ <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/climate-strike/">is taking its own environmental toll</a>, climate disinformation <a href="https://hkingaby84.medium.com/climate-disinformation-the-threat-to-cop26-3e43094360c0]">flourishes online</a>, climate justice activists are facing increasing digital attacks and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/us-listed-climate-activist-group-extremists">surveillance</a>, and for many of the <a href="https://www.openglobalrights.org/climate-change-and-human-rights/">communities affected the most by the climate emergency</a>, lack of internet access has meant limited access to information about relevant changes, policies and support mechanisms.</p>



<p>The recent emergence of spaces designed to bring together digital rights and climate justice activists – such as t<a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/gathering-for-a-sustainable-internet/">he gathering for a sustainable internet</a> and <a href="https://www.appropedia.org/Open_Climate">the Open Climate series</a>, among others – show an increasing interest in exploring how convergence between these two communities could strengthen the work of both.</p>



 New research: exploring connections&nbsp; 



<p>With that in mind, we are excited to announce a new research project <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/upcoming-research-how-digital-rights-and-climate-justice-intersect/">supported by the Ford Foundation, Ariadne and Mozilla</a> that will look at how climate and environmental justice can be centered in digital rights movements and explore some of the areas where digital rights and environmental justice intersect. Specifically, we’ll be exploring what kinds of collaborations between the two currently exist, what challenges these collaborations face, and what opportunities there are for strategic action to achieve goals on both fronts in an intersectional way.</p>



<p>Through our research we aim to develop a set of recommendations for funders to support them in implementing grantmaking strategies aimed at maximising impact in both areas.&nbsp;</p>



 Join our second community call&nbsp;on December 2nd 



<p>We kicked off our research with an initial community call in November, which aimed to discuss preliminary research findings, hear from practitioners working on environmental justice and digital rights issues, discuss challenges, and try to identify opportunities for greater collaboration. </p>



<p>To continue the discussion, we’ll be hosting a second community call on December 2nd from 9-10am EST/ 3-4pm CET. </p>



<p>For this call, we’ll be using a more interactive format, with breakout discussions. Topics will include: </p>



  How does your work address environmental justice and/or digital rights, and how do you want it to?  What kinds of support do you think work at this intersection needs in order to be able to address the urgency of the continued, accelerating climate crisis?  On the flip side, what kinds of tensions and contradictions exist between digital rights and environmental justice, which must be taken into consideration going forward?  



<p>Whether you’re working in either the environmental justice space or the digital rights space or are just interested in the topic, we’d love to see you there. Everyone is welcome!</p>



<p>To register, please email us at hello [at] theengineroom [dot] org.</p>



 We want to hear from you! 



<p>If you’re working at or exploring the intersection of climate justice and digital rights, we’d love to hear from you: please feel free to email us at hello [at] theengineroom [dot] org.&nbsp;For updates on how our research is going, follow us on Twitter @engnroom, or sign up to our newsletter <a href="https://us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1747fd8a7bf587bd4a215d984&amp;id=53139510a0&amp;e=8a7f1d5bf0">here</a>.</p>

<p>This statement was co-written by DIF and ToIP, it can also be read at <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2021/10/29/a-dif-toip-joint-statement-of-support-for-the-decentralized-identifiers-dids-v1-0-specification-becoming-a-w3c-standard/">ToIP’s blog here</a>.<br></p><p>On 3rd August 2021, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/PR-did-core-20210803/">proposed</a> advancing the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification to their W3C Recommendation stage, the ultimate level of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsW3C">W3C standards process</a>, which indicates that the specification as currently defined is technically sound, mature and ready for adoption. This includes the expectation that this will allow for widespread implementation, as well as further development and ongoing evaluation, paving the way for future versions.<br></p><p>Collectively, the memberships of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/#members">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/about/members/">Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a> represent over 350 companies globally who are committed to the development and implementation of decentralized identity and trust infrastructure. Many of these organizations have contributed directly or indirectly to the W3C DID 1.0 specification for one simple reason: the DID layer of cryptographically verifiable identifiers is foundational to the common infrastructure we are building together and on top of; therefore, this spec is an integral part of DIF’s and ToIP’s shared vision for an empowered, secure and interoperable future, and in line with <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/">W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles.</a><br></p><p>As such, DIF and ToIP support the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification becoming an official W3C Recommendation. DID 1.0 represents the efforts of over thirty active W3C Working Group contributors over the past two years— on top of contributions from dozens of others in the W3C Credentials Community Group and its predecessors for several years before that. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. Having common ground for development, particularly in terms of interoperability, allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus. It also mitigates the risk of shifting goalposts, which seriously hinders long-term development, investment, and widespread adoption. <br></p><p>DIDs are a critical part of a technical foundation for the products and activities of many of our members. Many of the implementations in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/#report-by-methods">DID Working Group’s implementation report</a> were developed by engineers and companies who collaborate openly at DIF on points of technical interoperability, and at ToIP on points of policy and governance. DIF also hosts the <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">Universal Resolver</a>, a community project which puts practical intra-DID method interoperability into practice by co-developing a “translation engine” for diverse DIDs with contributions from DIF members and non-members alike. Similarly, other DIF efforts like the <a href="https://didcomm.org/">DID Communications</a> protocol and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> protocol and ToIP efforts like the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification">ToIP Trust Registry Protocol</a> serve to align a broad range of implementations and ecosystems already building on these standards, laying the groundwork for robust interoperability across ecosystems and diverse families of technologies.</p><p>This specification is the result of half a decade of sustained, broad-based, dedicated work on the part of W3C, DIF, and ToIP members. We acknowledge also the work done by numerous, forward-thinking organizations who have already built working implementations using the provisional specification, thereby laying the foundations of new infrastructures for “identity data”. We believe DIDs will change the course of digital identity by building in better user controls, portability, and interoperability at the lowest possible level, while also offering increased security and simplicity for implementers and service providers. This advancement unlocks new opportunities for our digital lives, and we look forward to leveraging DIDs and other technologies developed in the community to champion a new class of user-first, self-owned digital identity systems.</p><p></p><p>Signed,</p><p>Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) &amp; Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)<br></p><p>October, 2021<br></p>

 Reference Libraries 

<p>Some of our most important work at Blockchain Commons is on specifications that improve the interoperability and resilience of cryptocurrency wallets. Our reference libraries allow developers to incorporate those specifications into their own code.</p>

<p>SSKR Security Review. However, there’s one more thing required before our libraries can be used in production releases: security reviews. Our vision is that third-party developers using our libraries will work with us to contract a security review from a third-party. They can take advantage of all the libraries already reviewed, and then they can increase that selection with a review of their own. Our sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, began that process this quarter by arranging a security review for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a> libraries through <a href="https://radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security (ROS)</a>.</p>

<p>The folks at ROS tested our software and noted potential security problems. We then worked with them to close all issues that we felt were a priority. Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to transparency, we have published the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/reviews/2021-security-review.pdf">review</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md">response</a>, which includes a listing of issues that we resolved, as well as those we did not (and why). Thanks to this review, we feel that the <code>bc-shamir</code> and <code>bc-sskr</code> libraries are the first of our reference libraries ready for production deployment.</p>

<p>Project Nayuki Port. We also released a minor new utility library, a port of the Project Nayuki QR library into Swift as <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/QRCodeGenerator">QRCodeGenerator</a>. We’d discovered that Apple’s native iOS QR generation is inefficient for QR codes where individual segments require different optimization. Nayuki does the right thing, by individually optimizing each segment, so we ported it over as a replacement for the native Apple libraries, for use in our own code and by other developers.</p>

 Reference Apps 

<p>Our reference apps provide exemplar use of our specifications (and libraries).</p>

<p>Seed Tool Updates. The release of Seed Tool was one of our big events in Q2. In Q3 we’ve continued that work through two notable upgrades, releasing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/README.md#version-history">1.1 in July, 1.2 in August, and 1.2.1 in September</a>. Some of the biggest updates included arbitrary key derivation, preset SSKR schemes, and developer functions that make it easier to test out QR &amp; UR-based requests and responses. We also added our first Ethereum support, through the ability to derive Ethereum private keys and addresses from your stored seeds. Our updated <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/MANUAL.md">Seed Tool Manual</a> describes all of the latest functionality.</p>

<p>QRTool Updates. Seed Tool wasn’t the only reference app to get attention; <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QRTool</a> also received some minor updates in July, though those largely took the form of minor bug fixes. Updating QR Tool to use the Project Nayuki library port will be our next big update for QR Tool, sometime in the future.</p>

 Bitcoin Utilities 

<p>Other utilities make it easier to use Bitcoin and other blockchain and crypto-technology.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Standup Updates. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup</a> was one of Blockchain Commons’ first releases. It automates the installation of a secure Bitcoin Core setup on a Debian Linux device or virtual machine . However, Bitcoin Core is always changing, requiring occasional updates. Our newest version of Bitcoin Standup, 0.8.0, updates the scripts to work well with Bitcoin Core 22.0 (which made some changes to its code signing).</p>

<p>However, Bitcoin Standup 0.8.0 does more than that. We’ve always imagined Standup as an engine that can install a wide variety of cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, and the new version of Standup offers the opportunity for the first such addition: <a href="https://cypherpunkpay.org/">cypherpunkpay</a>, an easy and accessible server for receiving Bitcoin payments. This addition, though just a starting point, was one of the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> projects initiated by our 2021 interns, to offer cyryptocurrency support for activists.</p>

<p>Gordian Server Officially Released. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a> project took Bitcoin Standup as a jumping-off point and offered the same ability to easily install Bitcoin Core on the more accessible macOS UI. Like Bitcoin Standup it’s intended as the heart of a self-sovereign setup, where you can control both your wallet and your server. We released Gordian Server in some preliminary versions in 2020, but we’ve now polished it to improve its stability and ease of use, and have released it as the Feature-Complete <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.0.0">1.0.0</a>. Like our newest Standup release, this version of Gordian Server has also been updated to work correctly with Bitcoin Core 22.0.</p>

 Learning Resources 

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ goals has always been to improve the developmental understanding of Bitcoin. We also extend that goal to our own releases by working to make our specifications as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our popular <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a> has brought numerous developers into the industry. We’re thus thrilled to offer complete translations in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a>. This enormous amount of work was the product of a number of volunteers, some of whom were also working with us as interns, which means that the <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a> should again be thanked for their support. We hope that these translations will help bring Bitcoin development to the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, which seems particularly important given El Salvador’s recent move to Bitcoin as a currency. (Learning Bitcoin also enjoyed quite a few minor edits as a result of the translations, as well as updates to include i2p and some recent revisions, resulting in our release of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/releases/tag/v2.1.0">version 2.1</a>; we’ve also got plans for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/TODO-30.md">3.0</a>.)</p>

<p>New SSKR Docs. Shamir’s Secret Sharing is a critical element of #SmartCustody in today’s digital-assets world, which is why our SSKR library received our first security review. We’ve also been expanding our docs to talk more about how and why to use secret sharing (and why not to). Our newest <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR docs</a> include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">Designing SSKR Share Scenarios</a>, which discusses many models for sharing (including all of the default scenarios now found in SeedTool), and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md">SSKR Dangers</a>, which talks about why we ultimately prefer multisigs to secret-sharing.</p>

 Building to Specifications &amp; Laws 

<p>Specifications and supportive references are the first steps in bringing new ideas to the industry. To reach their fullest potential, those ideas eventually have to become something more …</p>

<p>DID Standardization. The DID specification, which is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">1.0 candidate recommendation</a> for an international standard, is our next big technical step forward for self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, big centralized companies such as Apple and Google have taken notice and unsurprisingly raised complaints. We’ve offered some support with language and with championing the hard work already done, though the heavy lifting continues to be done by the editors, including Drummond Reed, Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, and Markus Sabadello.</p>

<p>Principal Authority. Many specifications and standards need legal support to reach their fullest potential. Our work in Wyoming has resulted in the state legislature arriving at a legal definition of digital identity that centers on the concept of principal authority. This quarter, we released <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">a paper</a> on how principal authority defines self-sovereign identity, and what the next steps are. (We also presented the paper and testified about it to the Wyoming legislature.)</p>

<p>eResidency &amp; Other Testimony. Overall, we’ve been thrilled to be working with Wyoming, creating some of the first and best laws for supporting blockchains, cryptocurrency, digital identity, and digital companies. In a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2021092109-01E-Residency.pdf">recent presentation</a>, we urged them to leverage the infrastructure they’ve created into an eResidency program that can extend these benefits to companies worldwide. In other testimony for Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, and the Netherlands we have provided support new laws for DAOs, updates to GDPR regulations and have advised how to avoid vendor lock-in and future-proof technology.</p>

 Other Future Expansions 

<p>Finally, we’re also looking to the future in other ways.</p>

<p>Ethereum Expansion. As noted, we’ve expanded Gordian Seed Tool to support Ethereum key derivations. We’ve also been experimenting with selling some self-sovereign-identity NFTs to raise funds for Blockchain Commons. Generally, this all demonstrates our goal of bringing many of our philosophies, architectures, and models to the Ethereum blockchain. In particular, we believe that #SmartCustody, and especially SSKR, could help Ethereum, which has a lot of its own challenges for responsible key management, such as the lack of true multisig. If you’d like to support our expansion into Ethereum, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a> and let us know why you did (or watch for upcoming NFT auctions!).</p>

<p>Second Intern Program. Finally, we’ve just completed our second summer’s intern program, and we’re thrilled to have another batch of interns who we helped to introduce to the world of blockchain development and who in turn helped us push forward projects such as our Learning Bitcoin translations and revisions. They also: produced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Secure-Development-Setup-macOS">secure development setup guide</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Pseudonymity-Guide">pseudonymity guide</a> that offered more support for activists and HRF; developed a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli program</a> for leaving behind your digital assets; worked on creating a stable version of Esplora; and more. Some of our 2021 interns have already gone on to other paid work in the field; we’re looking forward to seeing what they create next!</p>

<p>Thank you, as always, for your interest in Blockchain Commons and the improvement of the entire blockchain field. If you like what we’re doing, we again encourage you to become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Github sponsor</a> so that we can continue forward with our work of making the industry independent, private, interoperable, and resilient!</p>

<p>As I write my first newsletter to you as Digital Identity New Zealand’s Executive Director, I’m acutely aware that I am familiarising myself with the controls as I operate them. Michael left large shoes to fill, so my feet will have to grow! I’ve been away from Aotearoa a while, so it’s good to be back and appreciate the progress being made. In my time away, I was privileged to lead an international digital identity industry organisation; one of the very few that operate a digital identity trust framework. So, you’ll understand how excited I was to arrive back in time to see the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Digital Identity Trust Framework Bill</a>&nbsp;progress through Parliament to its current Select Committee stage.<br>&nbsp;<br>I look forward to joining you on that journey and bringing some learnings from my previous gig along too. I expect it to be DINZ’s key focus these next few months. Stakeholder collaboration is the key to success in the case of Trust Frameworks, so you can be sure that I’ll be looking for opportunities where DINZ can play a role.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would also like to remind the community that nominations for the DINZ Executive Council are currently open. All member organisations&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2021/10/07/executive-council-nominations-now-open/">can nominate a representative</a>. Please help shape both the history and future direction of Aotearoa’s Digital Identity sector by submitting your nomination using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2vbc4LJwrENW5a6VxGOUhsG2wj9ZQCljN9uyjm9YzwuqXNg/viewform">online form</a>. The deadline for nominations is 5pm Thursday 28 October. Online elections will follow, and the new Council will be announced at our Annual Meeting on Thursday 2 December. If you are a member and would like to attend the Annual Meeting&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-nz-annual-meeting/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2c3334cb9a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_04_24_COPY_05&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2c3334cb9a-118146817">please register beforehand</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>As many of you will be aware, the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Digital Identity Trust Framework (DISTF) Bill</a>&nbsp;was introduced to Parliament, has had its First Reading and the Select Committee is now accepting public submissions. This is great news and something that industry in general has encouraged and now welcomes. There is no better time to join and get involved in Digital Identity New Zealand to help shape this piece of the country’s tech history.<br>&nbsp;<br>To that end, DINZ received a request from the Department of Internal Affairs to circulate to its primary member contacts some information about the Select Committee schedule and process. DINZ duly did so on October 15th and now wishes to share that with the wider community. Have your say on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bill by <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/53SCED_SCF_BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">making a submission</a>&nbsp;before 2 December 2021.<br></p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>Munyaradzi Kamhozo is Account Relationship Manager at NMB Bank Limited, a registered commercial bank based in Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>NMB Bank’s role in this initiative is to act as the Validation Agent, working with the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as the Local Operating Unit (LOU), to issue SME clients with globally recognized digital business identities. Project partners GLEIF, Cornerstone Advisory Plus and Cenfri supported NMB Bank Limited to complete the required qualification process. </p>
<p>The LEI presents a significant opportunity to help close the current trade financing gap and support more SMEs to engage in international and domestic trade. NMB Bank Limited saw that potential, which drew them to the Validation Agent role, supporting its key objectives to create a market leading proposition for its SME client base, foster greater financial inclusion in the region and support the growth and formalization of the Zimbabwean economy. </p>
<p>How could this LEI initiative improve domestic and international trade out of Zimbabwe? </p>
<p>Most Zimbabwean SMEs rely on an international supply of raw materials. At least 80% of our SME customers engage with international suppliers on a regular basis. Currently, however, if an SME in Zimbabwe completes a telegraphic transfer to a supplier based in Europe, the correspondent bank will have to validate the identity of the Zimbabwean business and, without an established form of legal identity, this process can take up to a month.  </p>
<p>The LEI initiative will help by building trust in both the global financial ecosystem and in key supplier relationships. Using an LEI can significantly reduce the time correspondent banks take to validate the identity of the SME, ensuring that they can quickly access key supplies without building up excessive interest on local currency loans which, for SMEs in Zimbabwe, range from 40 per cent to 60 per cent per annum depending on the financial institution. </p>
<p>The benefits of the LEI also apply to Zimbabwean exports. By obtaining an LEI, SMEs can increase their international visibility and credibility with new overseas clients. All buyers must screen new suppliers to validate that they are who they say they are. With an LEI, this process will be faster and simpler than ever before. This will help to create new opportunities for our exporters, enabling them to foster new markets and grow domestic and international trade. </p>
<p>How is the LEI initiative helping NMB Bank compete and/or differentiate itself in the financial services marketplace? </p>
<p>One of the principal benefits of being a Validation Agent is that NMB Bank is now able to offer an entirely new service to our SME clients which allows them to save significant time when partaking in international transactions and opens opportunities to access trade finance, something which none of our competitors can offer currently. Addressing these key pain points will help us grow our client base and deliver an attractive proposition to SME customers. </p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, becoming a Validation Agent meant NMB Bank also had to undertake a comprehensive training program to get us up to speed with GLEIF’s regulatory standards. This has allowed us to realign our internal processes with an international standard of best practice. We can now set the standard for due diligence processes in the region. </p>
<p>By supporting SMEs as part of the Validation Agent role, NMB Bank is also actively supporting the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s National Financial Inclusion strategy, which aims to increase financial and economic inclusivity in the country. </p>
<p>What long-term potential do you see in the LEI initiative, both for banks and SMEs in Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>Zimbabwe, like many African countries, has a sizeable ‘informal economy’. It is estimated that around 80.8% of those employed in sub-Saharan Africa work within the informal sector.  Unfortunately, this means businesses operating in this sector lack the credentials necessary to grow and often find themselves losing money when undertaking cross-border transactions. In the long term, we can see the LEI helping to formalize our economy. With a globally standardized identifier, our businesses can prove their legitimacy and engage in regulated trade, leading to the generation of more money for the businesses and their employees. </p>
<p>We also believe that the LEI will have long term impacts on access to trade finance. SMEs currently struggle to access finance as they are perceived as ‘too risky’ by international lenders. As a result, the current trade finance gap in African stands at $81 billion.  When we apply for credit lines for our SME clients with an LEI, the screening process undertaken by the Development Finance Institutions to identify the applicant will be much simpler, meaning SMEs can access more trade finance, faster than ever before. This will also allow many businesses to be freed from the control of loan sharks as more legitimate lines of credit become available to them. </p>
<p>For banks, in particular, the LEI initiative will help to streamline onboarding processes. By adopting the role of Validation Agent, banks can provide a faster and more efficient experience for new clients by handling the LEI issuance process internally. Banks will also benefit from a simplified approach to establishing automated beneficial ownership systems, in line with Zimbabwe’s national project to do so. This means the initiative will contribute significantly to supporting Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism. </p>
<p>What kind of change in Zimbabwe would you like to see result from broad LEI adoption among SMEs?</p>
<p>Overall, we want to see accelerated financial inclusion in line with Zimbabwe’s National Inclusion Strategy. Broad adoption of the LEI is a big step towards achieving this.  </p>
<p>The formalization of Zimbabwe’s economy as a result of LEI adoption will not only benefit banks and SMEs, but the entire population. At an international level, a formal economy means more taxes are paid, which, in turn, means our government can invest more into key infrastructure projects to support the growth of the nation, improving the standard of living for all. </p>
<p>We’d also like to see a change in the perception of Zimbabwe in international markets. Our national mantra is ‘open for business’. We want to be seen in this way. Currently, we are seen as a risky market in the eyes of international lenders, banks and suppliers. The LEI presents an opportunity to help us overturn this perception. If the world knows who you are, the opportunities will flow in.</p>

  <p>The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) is proud of its ongoing transparency initiatives. Namely its open approach to providing unrestricted access to the latest LEI data from around the world with the Quarterly LEI System Business Reports, which are made publicly available free of charge. Through this ‘LEI in Numbers’ blog series, GLEIF aims to highlight key data from the latest report, explaining trends and profiling successes from the global LEI rollout. </p>
<p>The latest report, covering Q3 2021, shows positive growth in the volume of LEIs worldwide. More than 60,000 LEIs were issued in Q3, representing a quarterly growth rate of 3.3%. This steady increase is welcome news as it is common for issuance levels over the summer months to slow. As a result, the total active LEI population is now 1.88 million. </p>
<p>For a further summary of the past quarter’s data, the below infographic contains the key statistics from Q3 2021. </p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/q3-2021-in-review-the-lei-in-numbers/q3-business-report-infographic_final-750x1994.jpg"></a>
<p>In Q3, Iceland was the largest growth market for LEI issuance, with one of the highest growth rates seen in 2021 (30.8%). This is another significant quarterly increase for Iceland. Between Q1 and Q2, it doubled its growth rate from 9.2% to 19%. This regional growth was driven largely by strong competition among LEI issuers.</p>
<p>Aside from growth in new LEI issuance, renewal rates grew across EU jurisdictions (65.5%, up from 65.0% in Q2) and non-EU jurisdictions (63.0%, up from 62.9% in Q2). The average renewal rate of jurisdictions with more than 1000 LEIs globally remained steady. This consistently high level of LEI issuance and renewals across multiple regions is testament to the maturity of the Global LEI System and its increasingly central role in bringing trust to ecosystems. </p>
<p>In Q3, a new issuer was onboarded into GLEIF’s network of Local Operating Units (LOUs): NordLEI. Previously, NordLEI had been operating as a registration agent in the Nordics before adjusting their status to LOU to actively drive greater LEI adoption across Northern Europe. </p>
<p>For the full report which includes further detail on the status of LEI issuance and growth potential, the level of competition between LEI issuing organizations in the Global LEI System and Level 1 and 2 reference data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Reports page. </p>
<p>If you are interested in reviewing the latest daily LEI data, our Global LEI System Statistics Dashboard contains daily statistics on the total and active number of LEIs issued. This feature now enables any user to review historical data by geography, increasing transparency on the overall progress of the LEI.</p>
<p>For further detail, or to access historical data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Report Archive. We look forward to sharing our progress each quarter as we continue to drive LEI adoption in 2021.</p>

				 <p>OKP4 takes on a European dimension by opening an office in Munich</p>
<p>While OKP4 is beginning to deploy its first use cases in France, particularly in agriculture and logistics, the company is now opening a German subsidiary in Munich. This is an opportunity for the company, specialized in the creation and animation of Data Spaces, to take on a European dimension that can be very essential when it comes to data issues.</p>
<p>OKP4 has officially launched its German subsidiary in Munich at the beginning of October 2021, in collaboration with SCE Space Cooperative Europe, founding member of aNewGovernance. OKP4 GmbH, the new subsidiary of the young Toulouse-based company, will be able to deploy OKP4’s Data Spaces offerings on the German market, particularly in agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>The creation of this subsidiary was also an opportunity for OKP4 GmbH to welcome Onecub, another founding member of aNewGovernance, into its capital for their expertise in digital identity management and consent management.</p>
<p>OKP4’s goals in Germany are clear: to establish Data Spaces projects within German organizations, but more importantly, to reinforce OKP4’s position as a reference in Europe about governance and Data Spaces management for organizations.</p>
<p>Emmanuel MONDON and Markus HAUSER of SCE seized this opportunity to organize a real learning expedition with interesting meetings such as: Invest in Bavaria (the development agency of the state of Bavaria), The Bayerischer Bauernverband (the Bavarian Farmers’ Union), and innovation consulting structures such as ARTTIC or EURA AG.</p>
<p>The founders of OKP4 GmbH also met with the heads of the TUM World Agricultural Systems Center (Hans Eisenmann-Forum for Agricultural Sciences) to discuss agricultural data sharing ecosystems and to consider academic collaborations in the context of European innovation projects (Eurostars 3 and Horizon Europe).</p>
<p>The European network of actors working on Data Spaces continues to grow and shows a growing dynamic with even more collaborations and more partnerships. Data Spaces are the future!</p>

<p>Earlier this year a popular vote has rejected a proposed law on electronic identification (<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/digital-identity-scheme-faces-scepticism-around-data-privacy/46399636"> results </a>).&nbsp; It was however very clear that a new solution has to be found soon as e-ID can be an important enabler for multiple use-cases and accelerate digitalisation of many daily processes for both the individuals and organisations, if done correctly.</p>
<p>Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) has started a <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/zielbild-e-id.html">public consultation</a>, which should inform Federal Council’s upcoming policy decision.&nbsp; A discussion paper “on the target vision for an e-ID” has been <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/en/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf.download.pdf/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf">published</a>, which explores a number of different options and approaches to the future of electronic identity.&nbsp; Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp; (SSI) has been highlighted as one of the possible options and a number of questions has been raised.</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity for DIDAS to provide in-depth commentary to the proposed vision and contribute our collective ideas and expertise to help make a well informed decision. Our submission (in German) is available <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stellungnahme-DIDAS-FINAL-V1.0-website.pdf">here</a></p>
<p>So what did we advocate for?</p>
<p>For us, the members of DIDAS, it was crucial to emphasise that the upcoming policy decision will determine the future of digitalisation efforts in Switzerland and, consequently,&nbsp; its position at&nbsp; international level. The authors of the discussion paper have proposed 3 “levels of&nbsp; ambition”:</p>
 
 e-ID ( secure identification option without media discontinuity&nbsp; – e.g. identity card that can be used in the digital world&nbsp; + login) 
 e-ID linked to other state-regulated proofs&nbsp; ( basic electronic identify + cryptographically linked additional attributes – e.g. driver’s license, diploma, COVID certificate, criminal record, etc) 
 Ecosystem of digital proofs&nbsp; ( e-ID is just one credential, other credentials that are independent of the e-ID are possible, government and private bodies can issue credentials&nbsp; ) 
 
<p>It’s very clear to us that only the Ecosystem of Digital Proofs (Level of Ambition 3) represents the actual ambition that is worth pursuing – creation of a true, future-proof and flexible foundation for digital Switzerland.&nbsp; To create such an ecosystem it’s important to adopt the right approach ( principles, technology, governance model, etc) and&nbsp; make sure that the government plays the appropriate role and enables rather than hinders the future growth and success of this ecosystem.</p>
<p>We have made strong argument in favour of focusing on adopting SSI principles and best practices as the foundation for Ambition Level 3.&nbsp; We highlighted and outlined both the advantages that this will bring ,as well as the open questions that still need to be addressed. E.g. on technology and legislation level.&nbsp; We know that SSI is not perfect yet, but we need to focus on the rapid progress that is being made ( as well as contribute to it) in order to create solid foundation that will last for years to come rather than make a short term decision in favour of something better understood but not designed for the ownership and privacy of the data, open ecosystems, transparent governance and flexibility.&nbsp; We are fully convinced that given the timeframe to draft and implement the future legislation we have ample opportunity and time to get it right!</p>
<p>We further argued that the Government will play an important, enabling role for the ecosystem and by adopting SSI can safely focus on the attributes (or verified credentials) that it has historically been providing. Thus facilitating a smooth transition from a paper-based world to&nbsp; a future, where verifiable data enables new levels of efficiency and flexibility without negatively affecting privacy for both the individuals and organisations.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to the future collaboration with relevant governmental agencies and policy makers that are engaged in decision making process. We’ll continue to explain and promote SSI. Many of our members already implement solutions using SSI principals and technology stack – we happy to provide this expertise to help build the true digital foundation for the future of Swiss Confederation.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>We spoke with Alberta Abbey, LEI Analyst, Data &amp; Analytics, LSEG to discuss how this initiative will support wider adoption of globally recognized business identities, in the form of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), across Africa and how to encourage more entities across Africa to obtain LEIs.</p>
<p>LSEG performs an important role in the Global LEI System as a LEI Issuer, also known as a Local Operating Unit (LOU). LEI Issuers are accredited by GLEIF to issue LEIs to legal entities, supplying registration, renewal and other services, and acting as the LEI system’s primary interface with legal entities. They also work in cooperation with Validation Agents, a new operational model within the system which allows financial institutions to obtain and maintain LEIs for their clients, to support their issuance workflows. </p>
<p>What was LSEG’s role within this flagship initiative? </p>
<p>As the LEI issuing organisation, we provide training and ongoing support to the African Validation Agent.</p>
<p>Why did you decide to become involved with the initiative?</p>
<p>LSEG joined this initiative to facilitate wider LEI adoption across Africa. By demonstrating the uses and benefits of LEIs, our aim is that this project will encourage more entities across Africa to obtain LEIs. We started the project with a partnership approach, which we intend to continue beyond the pilot.</p>
<p>As the 2nd largest issuer of LEIs globally, this project is a good opportunity to partner with the African agent to make LEIs more easily accessible across the continent.</p>
<p>As the LEI Issuer in the Africa LEI initiative, what benefits does LSEG hope to realize through its participation, for itself and also for the banks and SMEs in the region? </p>
<p>We’re pleased to be working with NMB Bank, which is the Validation Agent. Through the collaboration, we’re providing the platform that gives entities in the region access to obtain LEIs, thereby making their status internationally verifiable through GLEIF.</p>

 Digital trust summit a call for action to address Aotearoa’s digital identity challenges. 



<p>The Digital Trust Hui Taumata/Summit will headline next year’s Techweek22 festival and provide an opportunity for a cross-section of stakeholders to share insights on building a thriving trust economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scheduled for the 19th of May at TSB Auditorium, and with a one-day programme featuring keynote talks, panels, use cases and roundtable discussions, the Digital Trust Summit is a must-attend event for all those invested in the future of New Zealand’s digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>Personal data is the new currency of the digital economy. Used effectively, this data can deliver benefits for individuals, businesses and government. But as Aotearoa reaches its digital adolescence, pertinent questions remain:</p>



  How will identity, security and experience integrate?  How can citizens maintain sovereignty over their personal data?  What underpins a successful transition toward open finance?  How will Te Ao Māori be woven into Aotearoa’s Digital Identity?  What are the global opportunities for New Zealand as a ‘trusted digital economy’?  



<p></p>



<p>The speed of our digital transformation and the benefits it delivers for society has much to do with trust. That is to say, declining trust in the way personal information is secured, validated and applied will prevent us from realising the collective economic benefits of digital. With an undoubtedly kiwi flavour, the Digital Trust Hui will seek to answer these questions and more with the help of local and international leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In December 2019, members elected the first Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. The Council is the governing group for the association; providing guidance and direction as we navigate the developing world of digital identity in Aotearoa. Each Council member is elected for a two-year term, with elections held annually and results notified at the AGM in December. So, as we approach the end of the year it is time for us to call for nominations for the Council seats coming up for re-election.<br><br>This year, there are seven&nbsp;positions up for election, x3 positions in the Major Corporate, x3 positions in the Corporate Other, and x1 position for the SME/Start-up category.<br><br>When we formed the Executive Council we asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. You did that. The power of that diversity has shone through in the work of the Council this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.<br><br>As the Council has considered its own makeup, we’ve identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those involved in the business and service sectors and kaupapa Māori organisations are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. Digital Identity NZ has a policy on Board diversity which you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cd211649fd1d09c759c0112f&amp;id=50a0dc76a6&amp;e=40f3555481">here.</a><br><br>Once elected in December, one of the first responsibilities of the new Council will be to elect a new Chair for the EC Council or consider re-electing the current chair. Following the departure of David Morrison, who served as Chair of our organisation since 2018, in February 2021, the council elected Ben Tairea as the new Chair, and both are excellent Kairahi (guides/counsellors/leaders). Currently supporting Ben diligently are Sat Mandri, co-chair and Tamara Al-Salim, deputy chair and their serving terms are through to 2022.<br><br>2022 is a pivotal year for digital identity with the introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We are looking forward to some stellar nominations to help us in exploring and pursuing the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference in 2022 and beyond. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>Barry Cooper is a Technical Director at the Centre for Financial Regulation and Inclusion (Cenfri), an independent, not for profit think tank which works on African financial sector development.</p>
<p>Cenfri has a wide reach across Africa, holding relationships with both regulators and Financial Service Providers (FSPs). Cenfri’s role in the initiative was multifacted and involved finding candidate banks in suitable jurisdictions where the initiative could have the most impact on MSMEs and act as a demonstration case; engaging with regulators regarding the initiative; leading working sessions with the selected bank to guide them through the LEI process and address any challenges; and report writing and validation; among others.  Cenfri and Cornerstone Advisory Plus’s evaluation mechanism successfully identified suitably regulated markets and FSPs that have a strong interest and investment in their micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) clients. </p>
<p>Why did you decide to become involved with the initiative?</p>
<p>Cenfri has done a lot of work on identity, anti-money laundering (AML), counter financing of terrorism (CFT), know-your-customer (KYC) and MSME finance issues and this opportunity resonated with our work. In addition, we strive to lead on best and next practices and were greatly attracted to this initiative as this was the first in Africa, and provided a significant opportunity to shape key practices. </p>
<p>How does your organization benefit from its involvement in the LEI initiative?</p>
<p>Involvement in this initiative benefits Cenfri as we gain unique learnings from prototyping the process, helping to inform our approaches to solving MSME finance issues, particularly in our focus countries in Africa, which include Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>The LEI initiative has also provided a tool that we can recommend to institutions and regulators to address AML-CFT, compliance and de-risking challenges. In addition, Cenfri obtained its own LEI, which we can benefit from using ourselves. </p>
<p>What problems does LEI usage enable SMEs in Africa to overcome in the medium to long-term?</p>
<p>There are 54 states in Africa, each with their own incorporation bodies and registries, which each have varying processes and idiosyncrasies. Reliable verification and further incorporation of information for due diligence and risk management processes require high local country skill levels, can take significant time and is prohibitively costly and hence employed more in larger transactions. MSME, and even some corporate, transactions in Africa are either not progressed or are subject to default assumptions of higher risk. </p>
<p>LEI usage enables MSMEs to obtain a much stronger identity which is globally accessible, trusted and verified. Local banks have deep expertise in their national systems, risks and processes. The LEI harnesses this knowledge in a globally accessible format. The LEI is positioned to overcome risk management information asymmetries enabling better formal trade flows through more accessible trade finance, more accurate finance risk ratings, reduced unfavourable risk premiums, limited transaction delays and fewer outright rejections. It also helps to create more visibility for MSMEs and increases opportunities to trade and connect with partners they may otherwise not have been able to connect with. In addition, it can solve compliance challenges for AML-CFT by ensuring they are adhering to the highest standards globally.</p>
<p>What would the African SME landscape look like if Africa’s $81bn trade finance gap could be narrowed? What would this mean for the regional economy?</p>
<p>Narrowing the $81bn trade finance gap could have material implications for the African economy and its people, with the potential to enable significant growth and competitiveness in international markets. The question remains whether changes in trade activity would be inclusive with positive impact at the lowest income levels or if the benefit would be limited to primary industries and existing corporates, benefitting established social strata. Positive measures, like the LEI, are intended to help MSMEs to participate on a fair footing, promoting sustainable growth and economic diversity. Contributing over 50% of employment worldwide according to the World Bank, a small increase in the size and income of MSMEs can have a significant impact on employment levels and enable the supply of services more efficiently throughout markets. Narrowing the trade gap should link with fostering intra-regional trade between African countries to further enable inclusive growth and development.</p>
<p>What opportunities could be created for the people of Africa if all SMEs could be equipped with globally recognized business ID?</p>
<p>Equipping all SMEs with an LEI will create a universal, continent-wide, robust and interoperable global identity. We see the unlocking of significant latent business and employment opportunities not only for global trade but particularly for trade within the Africa region which in the past has been systemically difficult between 54 states. The LEI will greatly enhance the accessibility and competitiveness of MSMEs not only globally but within their countries and the region. As mentioned previously, moderate MSME growth can have a significant impact in employment across diverse economic sectors and particularly at the lower income levels. Through enhanced networking effects the LEI can also result in better distribution of goods and services across countries, enabling access to additional local, sustainable products and services for Africans.</p>

<p>How we keep pace with changes in digital technologies, and how they are used in our economy and across our communities, will have a strong impact on Aotearoa New Zealand’s future prosperity.</p>



<p>The potential benefits from digital ways of working are exponential. They will help improve lives, expand consumer and career choices, and contribute to solving wider issues, such as climate change.</p>



<p>Our government is embarking on a journey to create&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3628718/national-strategy-digital-twin-and-skills-shortages-on-nz-tech-minister-s-mind.html">A Digital Strategy for Aotearoa</a>&nbsp;that seeks to respond to the social, economic, education and cultural opportunities from digital technology, along with the risks that these technologies can bring.</p>



<p>The strategy will endeavour to set out key goals, priorities and activities for the short to medium term (two-five years), as well as longer term results (out to 2031 and beyond).</p>



<p>The overarching framework for the strategy will consist of three pillars:</p>







 
 
<p>As we have stated previously,&nbsp;Identity&nbsp;along with&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Security&nbsp;is one of the three core elements of&nbsp;Trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Digital Strategy for Aotearoa begins to take shape, DINZ will be at the centre of the conversation around why a thriving Digital Identity ecosystem is an essential element in achieving the strategic vision of&nbsp;enabling all of Aotearoa New Zealand to flourish and prosper in a digital world.</p>
 



 

 
 



<p>In other news,&nbsp;I’m sad to say that I will be stepping down as Executive Director for Digital Identity New Zealand this month and someone very well known to many people across the Digital Identity community,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-wallis-7921274/?originalSubdomain=uk">Colin Wallis</a>, will be stepping into my shoes.</p>



<p>Colin is a Kiwi who has been overseas for a few years and has recently returned.&nbsp; For the last five years up until mid-June, Colin led the<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, a globally acknowledged Trust Framework Operator of conformity assessment and Trust Marked schemes for Identity, Credential and Consent Management Service Providers.</p>



<p>Building on 21 years of contribution to international standards and industry consortia, Colin will continue to maintain some of his other leadership positions across the consortium space in Information Security, Privacy and Trusted Identity.&nbsp; While leading Kantara he was a member of the OECD’s<a href="https://www.internetac.org/members">Internet Technical Advisory Committee</a>&nbsp;amongst others and will continue his contributions to standardisation into ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27/WG5 Identity Management and Privacy technologies.</p>



<p>Before heading off overseas, Colin worked in the Government’s digital identification programmes, initially at the State Services Commission and later at the Department of Internal Affairs (Government Login Service, iGovt and RealMe), where he has regularly represented New Zealand in international fora.</p>



<p>With his depth of knowledge and experience, it will surprise no-one that Colin was named in One World Identity’s Top 100 Influencers in Identity.</p>



<p>I’d like to welcome Colin into the role and wish him all the best.</p>

<p>The Ceramic community is committed to providing the best possible developer experience for building Web3 data applications. Over the past few months, the community has made significant upgrades to Ceramic's emerging open source developer tools and data standards ecosystem, including replacing the popular IDX.js client with a more powerful and flexible set of tools. This post describes the best ways to build applications on Ceramic today as of October, 2021.</p> The Web3 data architecture <p>The primary difference between Web3 and Web2 applications is their data architecture. Web3 applications rely on a user-centric ("self-sovereign" or "sovereign") data storage architecture. In this model, application data is hosted on a decentralized network, stored with each individual user, and is written to and queried by applications client-side. This contrasts to Web2 applications, which rely on an application-centric design where all data for all users of an application is stored in a single database server siloed to that application. </p> What's needed to build sovereign apps? <p>Therefore, building Web3 data apps requires a few foundational primitives:</p>  Network for decentralized data availability with fast mutability  Protocol for identity-centric, model-based data storage and retrieval  Client for performing CRUD operations on users' stores at runtime   User-centric data models <p>As you can see, Web3 data applications are built on the concept of data models for storing and retrieving structured data from user-controlled storage. Web3 takes a model-based approach vs. an application-based approach in order to allow for simple data reuse and composability across applications. It's much easier for applications to share individual data models with other applications (e.g. <code>user profile</code>, <code>social graph</code>, <code>skills</code>, <code>linked blockchain accounts</code>) than it is to force these applications to share entire databases containing all different kinds of data, many of which are not shared between applications. </p><p>Creating a great developer experience around building applications with user-centric data models is important to accelerating adoption of this new Web3 data architecture. Tools that improve the developer experience and increase cross-application data interoperability include: </p>  Tooling to create and deploy data models  Tooling to share, discover, and reuse data models   Example: Decentralized social network <p>As a simple example of how this all works, let's consider a decentralized social network. Behind the scenes this application can be reduced to just four data models, where each user maintains their own data in their own store for each model:</p>  <code>PostList</code>: stores an index of a user's posts  <code>Post</code>: stores a single post  <code>Profile</code>: stores a user's profile  <code>FollowList</code>: stores a list of users they follow   Application deployment and usage <p>To deploy this data application, a developer would deploy each of these data models to Ceramic. After they're available on the network, they can be used by any application to CRUD a user's data store for that model. For example, if another developer is building a new social network and wants to bootstrap it with existing users and content, they can simply reuse the same data models as the initial social network and their application will be able to automatically load and support storage interactions on this existing data. This is how multiple applications can collaborate on shared data sets, and how open data standards and protocols can emerge from any developer in the community.</p><blockquote>For an example of two applications building on the same data models to achieve data interoperability, try the <a href="https://self.id">Self.ID</a> and <a href="https://dns.xyz">DNS</a> applications. Any change to data in one application is automatically reflected in the other.</blockquote> IDX: ID-centric, model-based storage protocol <p>Ceramic provides a decentralized network for data availability with fast mutability, the foundation upon which Web3 data applications can be deployed and run. About a year ago the Ceramic community first introduced <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">CIP-11 "Identity Index"</a>, commonly referred to as the <code>IDX protocol</code>. It specifies a protocol for identity-centric, model-based data storage and retrieval implemented on top of Ceramic – the second requirement for building sovereign applications.</p> IDX.js: The most popular IDX client <p>IDX protocol (CIP-11) is just a specification and not working code. To make the protocol usable by application developers, the <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> team created IDX.js, a runtime library for performing CRUD operations on users' data stores – the third and final requirement for building Web3 data applications. They also created supporting tools such as the IDX CLI, and a reference application, <a href="https://self.id">Self.id</a>, to showcase IDX.js and related Ceramic technologies.</p><p>By serving as a simple entry-point to building applications on Ceramic, adoption of IDX.js has accelerated in lockstep with growth of the Ceramic ecosystem and has become the most popular way to build applications on Ceramic. Almost all of the applications currently deployed on Ceramic mainnet are using IDX.js.</p>Usage of IDX.js has accelerated with usage of Ceramic Why change a good thing? <p>In an attempt to offer more features, service more use cases and provide the best developer experience, the scope of IDX.js grew beyond simply providing a bare-bones implementation of the IDX protocol to a point where it became unnecessarily monolithic and opinionated. </p><p>As a result, IDX.js and associated libraries <code>idx-constants</code>, <code>idx-tools</code>, <code>idx-cli</code> are being deprecated. They are replaced by a new collection of tools outlined in the rest of this post.</p><blockquote>If you are currently using IDX.js and/or 3ID Connect, there is no rush to upgrade your code. There are no breaking changes to the IDX protocol itself, and the data interactions of the new libraries are fully compatible with IDX.js.</blockquote> DataModels: Open source for data models <p>DataModels allows developers to create, share, reuse, and discuss open source data models for Ceramic applications that can be used with the IDX protocol, enabling cross-application data interoperability.</p> DataModels Registry <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels">DataModels Registry</a> is an open-source, community-created repository of reusable application data models for Ceramic. It provides a single place where developers can openly register, discover, and reuse existing data models – the foundation for interoperable applications built on shared data models. Currently the registry is implemented as an open source Github repository dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2. In the future, it will be decentralized on Ceramic.</p> Installation &amp; Usage <p>All data models added to the registry are automatically published to <code>npm</code> under the @datamodels organization. Any developer can install one or more data models by using the <code>@datamodels/model-name</code> convention, making those models available for storing or retrieving data during runtime with any IDX client, including DID DataStore or Self.ID, both of which are described below.</p>Install DataModels from the @datamodels npm org DataModels Forum <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/discussions">DataModels Forum</a> is located within the DataModels Registry repository. Every model in the DataModel Registry has its own discussion thread which the community can use to leave reviews, have discussions, discuss upgrades, etc. Developers can also post <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/discussions/categories/ideas">ideas</a> for DataModels to solicit input from the community prior to adding it to the Registry.</p> Glaze: Ceramic Developer Suite <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/overview/">Glaze</a> is a suite of low-level developer tools for building applications on Ceramic. Glaze aims to provide developers with more flexibility and control by unbundling IDX.js into smaller, more specific packages.</p> DID DataStore.js: Core IDX client <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/did-datastore/">DID DataStore</a> is a bare-bones IDX runtime client – a stripped-down replacement for IDX.js – with less scope and fewer dependencies. If you've used IDX.js, you'll notice that DID DataStore does not come bundled with default data models, such as <code>basicProfile</code>, nor does it support CAIP-10 blockchain accounts links out of the box. If you want to use DID DataStore with data models or blockchain accounts you will need to separately install these as packages. If you want a more bundled, drop-in solution similar to IDX.js, see Self.ID below.</p> DataModels.js: A runtime for DataModels <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/datamodel/">DataModels.js</a> is a runtime library that simplifies the process of using data models in your application. It is frequently used with DID DataStore, and supports a few useful runtime features for DataModels:</p>  Availability – ensures the data models used your application are available on your Ceramic node, so they can be used with a Ceramic or IDX client, such as <code>DID Datastore</code>  Aliasing – allows developers to assign human-readable names to their data models, so they can more easily be used within application code instead of needing to reference data models via their <code>streamID</code>  <blockquote>If you've used IDX.js or the IDX CLI, DataModels serves as a replacement for running the <code>idx bootstrap</code> command or using similar bootstrap files, and eliminates the need to create aliases at runtime.</blockquote> More Glaze Tools   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/development/#devtools-library">DevTools</a> is a library for managing the full lifecycle of DataModels, such as creating custom models, adding to existing or creating new schemas and definitions, and publishing DataModels to any Ceramic node.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/development/#cli">Glaze CLI</a> is an upgraded command line interface that is designed to support Glaze development flows. It provides more functionality than the core Ceramic CLI, and adds native functionality for DataModels and DID Datastore.   Self.ID: Bundles for building Ceramic apps <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID</a> is a suite of high-level bundles that simplify the development process for building Ceramic applications. </p> Self.ID Core: Read-only bundle <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/read/">Self.ID Core</a> is a package that comes pre-installed with everything you need to build applications that read data from accounts on Ceramic. Self.ID Core offers cross-platform support, but read-only APIs. If you are currently using IDX.js, Self.ID Core is very similar. It includes: </p>  Ceramic client: <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/http/">JS Ceramic HTTP Client</a> with all required setup. The only thing you need to do is pass in your node's <code>CeramicURL</code>  IDX client: DID DataStore.js  DataModels runtime: DataModels.js  Popular DataModels: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-profile-basic">Basic Profile</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/3id-keychain">3ID Keychain</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-accounts-crypto">Crypto Accounts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-accounts-web">Web Accounts</a>  Popular utilities: Support for CAIP-10 blockchain accounts    Self.ID Web: Browser bundle <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/write/">Self.ID Web</a> extends the Self.ID Core bundle with write APIs and provides built-in user authentication. Self.ID Web only supports browser applications, and is now the most popular bundle for building Ceramic applications.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>: Browser-based, cross-chain user authentication system that is compatible with blockchain wallets. 3ID Connect allows users to connect one or more blockchain accounts from any chain to their Ceramic decentralized identity. 3ID Connect supports all EVM chains and other blockchain platforms such as NEAR, Cosmos, Filecoin, and Tezos.   More Self.ID Tools   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/utilities/#image-interactions">Image Utilities</a>: for uploading images to IPFS, storing them in multiple sizes and resolutions, and retrieving one most desirable to your application UI. Great for optimizing application performance when handling images such as user profiles photos. Sometimes you want to show a full-resolution image (e.g. profile page), and other times you only low-res thumbnails (e.g. dashboard).  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/self.id/tree/master/packages/3box-legacy">3Box Legacy Profiles:</a> A utility function for loading a legacy 3Box profile as a BasicProfile. Previously, this was provided by IDX.js.   FAQs  Which library should I use? <p>If you are already familiar with IDX or are more advanced in your development needs, DID DataStore is likely a better option; it offers the most flexibility and new features will be implemented there first. If you use custom data models (schemas and definitions), you should get familiar with the new set of tools for data models including the DataModels Registry and DataModels.js.</p><p>If you are just getting started with Ceramic and IDX, Self.ID should provide a smoother experience. It allows you to build Web3 data applications without having to understand all the concepts in order to have a working setup. You should still learn about Ceramic and the rest of the ecosystem if you want a better understanding of the full set of possibilities.</p> What should I do now? <p>IDX.js and related packages are being deprecated. Moving forward new features and improvements will only be implemented in the Glaze and Self.ID packages. We recommend that you update your app to use the new packages whenever possible.</p> Join the developer community <p>The Ceramic community is passionate about building Web3 data applications. If you want to learn more about anything mentioned in this post, encounter any issues trying to use the new tools, either for a new project or migrating from IDX.js, please <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">join the Ceramic Discord</a>!</p><p>To get started building Ceramic applications, head over to the developer documentation for <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/overview/">Glaze</a> and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID</a> now!</p>

Bild: Diskussion über die Sicherheit von Wallets für digitalen Identitäten Aktuelle Diskussion und&nbsp;Kontext <p>Am 23. September 2021 hat die Bundesregierung erstmals den digitalen Personalausweis und Führerschein für das <a href="https://my-digi-id.github.io/index.html#mobile-app">ID-Wallet</a> einer breiten Öffentlichkeit vorgestellt und es war für kurze Zeit möglich einen Personalausweis und Führerschein in das ID-Wallet abzuleiten. Hierbei ist es leider zu Problemen gekommen, da die Nachfrage um ein vielfaches höher als angenommen war. Im weiteren Verlauf haben Mitglieder rund um den Chaos Computer Club (CCC) die ID-Wallet, sowie die zugrundeliegende Technologie in einem <a href="https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/mit-der-id-wallet-kannst-du-alles-und-jeder-sein-au%C3%9Fer-du-musst-dich-ausweisen-829293739fa0">Artikel</a> kritisiert. Da das Lissi Wallet hier genannt und gezeigt wurde, möchten wir eine Einordnung schaffen, einen Überblick über die angesprochenen Probleme geben und potenzielle Lösungen diskutieren.</p> Abgrenzung ID-Ökosystem der Bundesregierung und “Schaufenster sichere digitale Identitäten”. <p>Seit 2019 führt das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) ein Projekt zur Förderung neuer digitaler Identitätslösungen durch. Nach einer sechsmonatigen Wettbewerbsphase, für die sich jede Institution in Deutschland bewerben konnte, wurden vier Projekte zur Förderung im Rahmen der <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Sichere_Digitale_Identitaeten/sichere_digitale_ident.html">Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten</a> ausgewählt. Die ausgewählten Projekte (im folgenden Schaufensterprojekte) sind Forschungsprojekte, die mit über 120 involvierten Institutionen gemeinsam innerhalb von drei Jahren neue Lösungskonzepte für digitale Identitäten erforschen und umsetzen, darunter zahlreiche Institute mit dem Schwerpunkt IT-Sicherheit. Folgende Projekte nehmen am Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten teil: <a href="https://www.once-project.de/">ONCE</a>, <a href="https://id-ideal.hs-mittweida.de/">ID-Ideal</a>, <a href="https://www.sdika.de/">SDIKA</a> und&nbsp;<a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>.</p><p>Parallel dazu hat die Bundesregierung im <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/975188/1824788/372199dfb12ff630da046dae6ae2849d/2020-12-03-europaeisches-oekosystem-digitaler-identitaeten-data.pdf?download=1">Dezember 2020</a> ein eigenes ID-Ökosystem rund um die ID-Wallet gestartet. Das <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/Webs/PA/DE/verwaltung/projekt_digitale_identitaeten/projekt_digitale_identitaeten_node.html">BMI</a> beschreibt das Projekt wie folgt: “Bürgerinnen und Bürger können künftig persönliche Daten und digitale Nachweise verschlüsselt in ihren Smartphones speichern und dann selbstbestimmt, sicher und einfach für Online-Dienste von Unternehmen und Behörden verwenden.”</p><p>Das <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> ist bisher nicht Teil des ID-Ökosystems der Bundesregierung und wird überwiegend im Rahmen des Schaufensterprojekts “IDunion” genutzt und weiterentwickelt. Es ist bisher nicht darauf ausgelegt offizielle Dokumente wie den Personalausweis und Führerschein zu speichern und dies war bisher für Endanwender*innen auch nie möglich. Ziel der Schaufensterprojekte ist es allerdings genau dies in Zukunft zu erreichen und dafür entsprechende Sicherheitsmechanismen zu entwickeln.</p><p>Insofern sind wir für jede Kritik an der Lissi Wallet sehr dankbar und nehmen die von Lilith Wittmann und Fabian Lüpke, der unter dem Pseudonym “Flüpke” im Internet Auftritt, geäußerten Bedenken ernst. Gleichwohl ist es sehr wichtig diese immer im Kontext der verschiedenen Anwendungsfälle und deren Vertrauensniveaus zu betrachten!</p> Probleme und mögliche Lösungswege <p>In ihrem <a href="https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/mit-der-id-wallet-kannst-du-alles-und-jeder-sein-au%C3%9Fer-du-musst-dich-ausweisen-829293739fa0">gemeinsamen Artikel</a> sowie einer <a href="https://github.com/Fluepke/ssi-poc">Proof of Concept (PoC) Implementierung</a> sprechen Lilith und Flüpke mehrere Probleme der Walletlösung an. Wir möchten diese Probleme nochmal kurz in eigenen Worten erklären und mögliche Lösungsoptionen aufzeigen.</p> 1. Verifizierung von anfragenden Parteien <p>Bei verifizierten Dokumenten in einem ID-Ökosystem ist ein wichtiger Aspekt, dass die ausstellende Partei nicht in die Präsentation eines Nachweis gegenüber der anfragenden Partei involviert ist. Für den Prozess der Anfrage und der Präsentation wird eine direkte Kommunikation mit Ende-zu-Ende Verschlüsselung zwischen Nutzer*innen und der anfragenden Partei genutzt. Um die benötigten Schlüssel für die sichere Kommunikation auszutauschen, wird hierzu oftmals ein QR-Code genutzt, welcher Nutzer*innen über einen bereits bestehenden sicheren Kommunikationskanal übermittelt werden&nbsp;muss.</p><p>Beschriebenes Problem: Sollte der sichere Kanal kompromittiert werden, kann dies einer Angreifer*in erlauben, eine sogenannte “Man-In-The-Middle-Attacke” durchzuführen. Hierzu tauschen Angreifer*innen Schlüssel und Endpunkte aus und präsentieren Nutzer*innen einen gefälschten QR-Code, welcher das Ergebnis der Abfrage und damit die persönlichen Daten umleiten. Das Problem besteht darin, dass Nutzer*innen grundsätzlich keine Möglichkeit haben, die anfragende Partei innerhalb der Wallet zu authentifizieren und Betrüger*innen sich als beliebige Institution ausgeben könnten um persönliche Informationen anzufragen. Die Verantwortung den initialen Kommunikationskanal zu überprüfen liegt somit auf der Nutzerseite.</p><p>Mögliche Lösung: Um die Legitimität einer Anfrage verifizieren zu können, müssen sich anfragende Institutionen zuvor in einem öffentlichen Register z.B. mit öffentlichen dezentralen Identifikatoren (DIDs) registrieren. Die öffentlichen DIDs können durch eine vertrauenswürdige Partei (z.B. einem <a href="https://esignature.ec.europa.eu/efda/tl-browser/#/screen/tl/DE">Vertrauensdiensteanbieter</a>) in einer “Trusted List” zertifiziert werden. Das Wallet von Nutzer*innen kann bei neuen Anfragen die Authentizität über die entsprechende “Trusted List” validieren und Nutzer*innen die verifizierte Identität der anfragenden Partei anzeigen.</p><p>Grundsätzlich wäre auch denkbar, dass nur verifizierbare Institutionen hoheitliche Dokumente abfragen dürfen. Ob dies in der Realität sinnvoll wäre ist zu diskutieren. Alternativ müssen Nutzer*innen darüber aufgeklärt werden, dass die anfragende dritte Partei nicht verifiziert werden kann und die Daten nur geteilt werden sollten, wenn Nutzer*innen dem Kontext der Anfrage vertrauen. Mit der zunehmenden Offenheit der Ökosystems ergeben sich somit auch zusätzliche Risiken für Nutzer*innen.</p> 2. Der Missbrauch von verifizierten Daten: <p>Wenn Informationen mittels einer verifizierbaren Präsentation mit einer dritten Partei geteilt wurden, dann erhält diese Partei die angefragten Klardaten (z.B. Name, Geburtsdatum) und eine entsprechende Signatur vom Aussteller der Informationen, um zu überprüfen, dass die erhaltenen Informationen unverfälscht sind.</p><p>Beschriebenes Problem: Angreifer*innen, welche verifizierte Identitätsdaten abfangen konnten, können diese missbräuchlich verwenden. Dieses Problem unterliegt der Annahme, dass ein Angriff, wie in Punkt 1 beschrieben, möglich und erfolgreich war.</p><p>Bestehende Lösung: Jede verifizierbare Präsentation eines verifizierbaren Nachweises ist mit einer Nonce versehen, die sogenannte Replay-Attacken verhindert. Die Angreifer*in ist somit nicht in der Lage mit den gestohlenen Daten weitere Anfragen zu beantworten und neue verifizierbare Präsentationen zu erstellen. Sie kann ausschließlich die gestohlenen Klardaten nutzen. Da schon durch die Preisgabe der Klardaten ein Schaden entstehen kann, ist es trotzdem notwendig den unter Punkt 1 beschriebenen Angriff auszuschließen.</p> Wie geht es&nbsp;weiter: <p>Neben den aufgezeigten Lösungsansätzen gibt es sicher noch eine Reihe weiterer Möglichkeiten und auch das beschriebene Angriffsszenario ist, wie bereits erwähnt, je nach Anwendungsfall differenziert zu bewerten.</p><p>Sowohl im ID-Ökosystem der Bundesregierung als auch in allen Schaufensterprojekten kommen sogenannte “selbstbestimmte” Identitätslösungen (kurz SSI) zum Einsatz. Viele andere Staaten weltweit, entwickeln derzeit ähnliche Lösungen. Deutschland geht dabei keinen Alleinweg.</p><p>Grundsätzliche Problemstellungen werden z.B. global auf dem halbjährlich stattfindenden <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) diskutiert. Der nächste IIW findet vom 12. — 14. Oktober statt. Wir möchten gern alle Beteiligten aufrufen sich hier zu treffen, um offen und konstruktiv über die Lösungsansätze zu sprechen.</p><p>Darüber hinaus werden wir im Rahmen der Schaufensterprojekte gemeinsam mit zahlreichen Institutionen die bestehenden Herausforderungen lösungsorientiert angehen und begrüßen konstruktive Kritik und die Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit. Nur gemeinsam können wir erfolgreich ein Fundament für unsere digitale Gesellschaft schaffen!</p><p>Das Lissi Team freut sich auf eine konstruktive Diskussion.</p>
