<p>In a startling revelation, an anonymous hacker has claimed to have accessed the biometric digital ID numbers and other sensitive personal information of approximately 815 million Indian citizens. This breach is reported to be the largest in the history of India’s Aadhaar, the world’s most extensive biometric digital ID system. The Aadhaar system, which has been a cornerstone of India’s digital infrastructure, is used for everything from tax filings to accessing social services. The implications of such a breach are profound, touching on issues of privacy, security, and trust in digital systems.</p>



<p>The Magnitude of the Breach</p>



<p>Aadhaar, managed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), has been both lauded for its inclusivity and criticized for potential privacy infringements. It uses biometric data such as fingerprints and iris scans, along with demographic information, to create a unique identity number for each citizen. With the scale of the reported breach, the personal data of more than half the population of India could be at risk. This could lead to widespread identity theft, unauthorized access to bank accounts, and fraud on an unprecedented scale.</p>



<p>The compromised data reportedly includes not just names and ID numbers, but also linked services and biometric data, exponentially magnifying the potential for misuse. This incident raises serious concerns about centralized databases and the mechanisms in place to protect such sensitive information.</p>



<p>Why This Could Not Happen with SSI</p>



<p>In the wake of this massive data breach, it’s crucial to understand why such an event would be highly unlikely with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems. SSI is a user-centric model that enables individuals to own, control, and present their identity without relying on any centralized authority. It represents a transformative approach to personal data management and security in the digital era. Here’s why SSI systems offer a robust defense against the type of breach Aadhaar experienced:</p>



 
 Decentralization: Unlike Aadhaar, which relies on a centralized database, SSI is inherently decentralized. Personal data is stored on users’ devices or on distributed ledgers, ensuring that a single breach does not expose the information of millions. 



 User Control and Consent: SSI gives individuals control over their data. They consent to share specific information with entities they trust and for specified purposes. This reduces the amount of data that can be exposed in any interaction. 



 Minimal Disclosure: SSI is built on the principle of minimal disclosure, meaning that users only need to share the information that is absolutely necessary. For instance, a user can prove their age without revealing their birth date. 



 No Single Point of Failure: Because SSI does not depend on a central repository of data, it lacks a single point of failure. This makes large-scale breaches implausible as each individual’s data is siloed and protected through robust encryption. 



 Verifiable Credentials: SSI relies on cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology, where credentials can be verified without revealing any underlying personal data. Even if a data request is intercepted, the information remains secure. 



 Recovery and Revocation: In the SSI framework, users can recover their identities through independently established recovery networks, and they can revoke compromised credentials without affecting other aspects of their digital identity. 
 



<p>Looking Ahead: The Role of SSI in Safeguarding Identity</p>



<p>The alleged Aadhaar breach is a stark reminder of the risks associated with centralized identity management systems. It underscores the necessity of adopting more secure, privacy-preserving identity solutions like SSI. Nations and organizations around the world are exploring SSI as a viable alternative that empowers citizens while bolstering security.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the Aadhaar breach exposes the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized identity systems, it also serves as a critical lesson for the global community. It highlights the urgency of transitioning to more resilient, decentralized identity models like SSI, where the principles of user control, privacy, and security are not just ideals, but foundational features. As digital identities become more pervasive in our daily lives, adopting SSI could well be the paradigm shift needed to safeguard the personal data of individuals around the globe.</p>

<p>How to Fail Innovation 101<br>
In today’s academic landscape, universities expect their Information Technology (IT) Departments to be hubs of innovation. However, the prevalent understanding of ‘innovation’ often leans towards adopting market trends rather than being truly forward-looking. Unfortunately, these ‘innovations’ are often external, sourced from third-party software, rather than emerging from the IT team’s internal processes and practices.</p>
<p>This presentation aims to redefine innovation and highlight its potential within IT departments. We will explore the motivations for innovation, common missteps, and how to develop operational strategies that foster, not stifle, innovation.</p>
<p>A positive environment for innovation can benefit the entire IT team. It encourages employees to develop more effective processes and practices, and empowers IT leadership to create an environment that nurtures innovation or remove existing barriers to it.</p>
<p>We will delve into various theories of innovation, drawing analogies from a range of domains including rainforests, gardens, machines, and even Plato’s Divine Frenzy. The presentation underscores the unique pressures on IT departments to innovate, making a clear distinction between innovation and invention.</p>
<p>Innovation, according to our perspective, isn’t just about creating something new—an act of invention—but about altering product, process, or practice life cycles to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and advantage. We will provide insights on implementing innovation effectively, while also addressing potential pitfalls and challenges.</p>

<p>Creating a Path for Faculty Success in Online and Hybrid Course Development<br>
When our first Online Teaching Certificate debuted in 2017, it was a five-session series offered in person. Over time, we added a second five-session level two and transitioned to a hybrid, then fully asynchronous experience. Both levels are suitable for both new and experienced professors who want to transition to online teaching or enhance their existing skills. Using the University’s chosen quality assurance rubric as the foundation, we cover a wide range of topics, including course design, objectives and alignment, student engagement strategies, accessibility, and ideas for assessment and feedback. Our course is designed to be practical, interactive, and engaging, providing best practices in creating and delivering an online course. Level two expands on the quality assurance rubric and introduces the Transparency in Learning and Teaching process, creating engaging lectures, and utilizing the learning management system and templates. Faculty leave both levels with completed materials to use in their own online or hybrid course.</p>

<p>Find Out Where to Start Your Zero Trust Journey<br>
How do you know where to start your Zero Trust journey? Do you have all the parts of Zero Trust in place to control risk to your crown jewels? If you don’t know where to start, you probably need to assess your situation.&nbsp; Using a Zero Trust readiness assessment you can see what parts of the people, process, and technology triad you already have in place and what you don’t.&nbsp; With a readiness assessment you can figure out what to focus on first in order to tackle the remaining parts of the Zero Trust jigsaw.</p>

<p>AI and the Evolution of Strategic Planning and Assessment in Higher Education<br>
Merging theoretical discourse with practical demonstrations, this session will explore the nascent role of AI in higher education. We will focus particularly on GPT-4.0 and its potential for transforming the strategic planning process. Key areas of focus will include the use of AI in designing new strategic planning objectives and embedding sustainable but agile strategic planning assessments in existent objectives. Live demonstrations will exhibit the versatility of GPT-4.0, as we delve into “prompt engineering,” to generate explicit and actionable outcomes. Furthermore, we will explore the socio-cultural implications of integrating AI into higher education, highlighting its powerful “reasoning” capabilities, while acknowledging its limitations and potential risks. In this session, we will highlight the vital role of human responsibility in the effective use of AI. Particularly, we will focus on our own unique abilities in language mastery and logical reasoning, which when synergized with AI, enable us to attain achievements beyond what AI could reach on its own. Our objective is to provide a transformative understanding of how AI, particularly GPT-4.0, can be leveraged as a versatile resource in managing the complexities of strategic planning.</p>

<p>Using Chatbots to Improve the Online Learning Experience<br>
Chatbots improve the online learning experience by assisting users navigating library websites in search of information. Understanding users’ questions to the chatbot and placing them in subject categories reveals the types of information they are searching for. This presentation will discuss a current project conducting a content analysis of questions posed to the Lehman Library’s chatbot, which uses the ChatGPT AI. The presenters will highlight some of the chatbot’s weakness, specifically the questions users pose that it cannot reliably answer. How the information gleaned from the analysis may improve the library website through content additions and layout changes will be discussed. The presenters will argue that projects using artificial intelligence, like chatbots, can lead to better online learning experience for library users, who rely on both the chatbot and the library website to provide them with information on library and campus-related services and resources.</p>

<p>Modernizing and Enhancing Analytics Infrastructure While Moving to the Cloud<br>
“Rob Stirton, VP of Institutional Effectiveness and CIO at County College of Morris, will demonstrate how CCM uses insights from their analytics platform for real-time decision making across the institution. CCM initially implemented GCOM’s on-premise Student Success Analytics (SSA) platform to integrate data across the entire student lifecycle and develop a clear line of sight between the college’s strategic goals and daily operations. This solution leveraged their existing business intelligence software investment and dramatically improved the availability and accuracy of information through visual analytics for all audiences, while significantly reducing workload on IT and researchers. Eliminating manual data processes allows CCM department chairs to establish goals for enrollment and retention and measure progress, grant writers to include valuable details about student populations to strengthen their applications, and students services staff to improve retention for transfer students.</p>
<p>Building on this success, CCM took the natural next step in their analytics journey: modernizing in the cloud with GCOM’s SSA Cloud platform. SSA Cloud increases access and usability and reduces management costs while seamlessly integrating data sources with hybrid cloud architecture. The cloud environment is managed by GCOM, reducing CCM’s need to staff expensive, in-demand skillsets to support the infrastructure. With the move to the cloud, CCM is better equipped to adapt to changing technical business needs, while leveraging built-in capabilities such as machine learning models that identify admissions and financial aid fraud, and dynamic data exploration and ad-hoc reporting that limits the need for users to write queries.</p>

<p>NIST 800-171 &amp; GLBA: Understanding Compliance Requirements So You Can Confidently Self-Assess<br>
There are 14 sections related to security and privacy within NIST 800-171 that higher education will be assessed on, and which they may be expected to comply with by July 2024, for new Federal Tax Information (FTI) handling procedures under the FAFSA Simplification Act. This requirement is in line with the current and future GLBA Safeguards Rule, which applies to all Title IV colleges and universities, and is included in both the SAIG agreement and the Federal Single Audit.</p>
<p>Compliance with NIST 800-171 is also broadly a contractual obligation for research institutions handling Controlled Unclassified Information on their networks for the purposes of grant-funded research, and these organizations are expected to conduct self-assessments to determine and maintain compliance. This session will help you understand these requirements and the way ahead towards assessing your institution to ensure you are on track.</p>

<p>Building Data Analytics Centers for Colleges &amp; Departments<br>
“Every college, department and functional office at Rowan University needs access to data at their fingertips for decision making. Building common dashboards and models for everyone does not meet the needs of everyone. If we start tweaking common dashboards to meet the needs of everyone, the dashboards become unusable and complex. To solve this problem, we use Extract, Transform, &amp; Load process to build complex and common datasets. We build various predictive models using these common datasets. We use these datasets and models and package them into data portals that we call as data centers. We build visualizations, KPIs, dashboards and reports based on these data sets and models and package them into different data centers. These data centers will have all the data one would need in a college or a department in a way they can easily consume and make decisions on. These data centers consist of dashboards, KPIs, reports, and predictive models in one place.”</p>

<p>Authors: Atul Tulshibagwale (<a href="https://sgnl.ai/">SGNL</a>), Apoorva Deshpande (<a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>), and Shayne Miel (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/duo/index.html">Cisco Duo</a>).</p>
<p>A new draft of the Shared Signals Framework has been released for public review. Here’s how it is different from the previous version.</p>
<p>The OpenID Shared Signals Working Group (SSWG) has made important changes to the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) from the first implementer’s draft that was published in June 2021. The new draft <a href="https://openid.net/public-review-period-for-shared-signals-framework-specification/">entered</a> the 45-day public review period on October 13, 2023.</p>
 Changes Summary 
<p>The new draft is available for review <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-02.html">here</a>. Here are the main areas of changes:</p>
 Specification Name 
<p>The draft is now called the “Shared Signals Framework” (SSF), instead of the previous name – “Shared Signals and Events Framework”.</p>
 Subjects 
 
 Top-level sub_id claim. The draft now complies with the SubIds recommendation of using sub_id as the subject name and places it at the top-level of the SET. Existing events continue to have the subject member within the event, but new event types need not have this subject 
 Format in complex subjects: The complex subject types now have the following field in them: 
 
 "format": "complex" 
 Transmitter Metadata 
 
 Well Known URL: The well-known URL of the Transmitter is now at 
 
 /.well-known/ssf-configuration 
<p>Instead of the previous location which was: /.well-known/sse-configuration</p>
 
 Spec Version: A Spec version field is now added to the Transmitter Configuration Metadata (TCM). This is set to the implementer’s draft spec version or the final spec version of the document that the Transmitter supports. 
 Authorization Scheme: An authorization scheme has been added to the TCM to specify how the Transmitter authorizes Receivers. 
 Optional jwks_url: jwks_url is now optional 
 
 Streams 
 
 Multi-Stream Support: The draft now supports multiple streams between the same Transmitter and Receiver. The API has been modified to support creating such streams. The draft still allows a Transmitter to support a single stream per Receiver. However, in either case (single-stream or multi-stream Transmitters), the stream needs to be created. Earlier, Receivers only needed to Update the stream configuration in order to establish communication. It is recommended that the endpoint_url is unique 
 Poll Delivery URL: The draft clarifies that the Transmitter must supply the endpoint_url field in the stream creation process. It also defines how the Transmitter can specify the poll URL. 
 Status Restriction: The stream status methods now do not allow subjects to be included in Stream Status methods. 
 Receiver Supplied Description: The Stream now includes a receiver supplied description 
 “Control Plane” Events Always Included: Clarified language the control plane events (Verification and Stream Updated) are always delivered in the stream regardless of the stream configuration 
 Events Delivered: The draft specifies that events_delivered is a subset (not necessarily a proper subset) of the intersection of events_supported and events_requested. Earlier, it was required to be the intersection. 
 Reason in Status: The stream status now includes an optional reason string 
 
 Stream Events 
 
 No Subjects in SSF “Control Plane” Events: The Stream Verification and Stream Updated events restrict the subject in these events to only reference the stream as a whole. 
 
 Security Considerations 
 
 Authorization: The draft no longer recommends using OAuth 2.0 or the client credentials grant flow 
 Audience: Events are no longer recommended to have the OAuth 2.0 Client ID as the audience

<p>At the start of the Covid pandemic, a mutual aid group contacted us to ask for support to better understand student needs during the lockdown period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, they hoped to identify where, geographically, students were likely facing significant challenges (as determined by indicators including socioeconomic status, internet connectivity, and local COVID-19 infection rates). To achieve this objective, the team compiled publicly available health, census, and geospatial data using geographic information system (GIS) software. This analysis then enabled them to map out regions where students were most likely to require assistance in the form of food or internet vouchers.</p>



 Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to gather, manage, analyse and visualise spatial and geographic data&nbsp; 



<p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing spatial and geographic data. Essentially, GIS integrates multiple types of data, from geographical and topological data to statistical and qualitative information, into a unified system that allows for sophisticated spatial analysis and visualization.</p>



<p>While traditional data sets may contain location information (“attributes”) like zip codes or city names, GIS takes this a step further by including attributes about geographic areas. &nbsp;For example, a common use involves mapping the amount of flooding in a given location. These separate bits of&nbsp; information can then be layered on top of each other for displaying on maps or 3D models. The complexity of this data requires specialized data formats that can hold all the necessary layers, as well as software for collection, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.</p>



 What GIS can be used for in the social- and environmental-justice sectors 



<p>Earlier GIS systems were primarily used by specialized institutions because they required expensive, high-end hardware and software. However, advances in technology have made GIS more affordable and accessible, enabling it to be run even on consumer-grade computers and smartphones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The creation of cloud-based GIS solutions has also reduced the need for in-house servers and storage, thereby reducing the potential cost and complexity of deploying GIS technology. Additionally, drones and IoT sensors have made remote data collection more do-able at a lower budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those in the social and environmental justice sectors, this has meant increased access to technologies that can help them achieve their mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Land rights organisation Cadasta, for example, notes that GIS tools can “<a href="https://cadasta.org/sustainablefuture/">help communities gather digital data required for legal land claims</a> while also enabling real-time mapping and monitoring of critical assets such as biodiversity, forest cover, natural resources, and human settlements” Another organisation, Cultural Survival, has used <a href="https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/gis-and-long-range-economic-planning-indigenous">field-based participatory mapping techniques</a> combined with satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and GIS technology in order to explore economic development strategies for indigenous peoples and their territories in the Amazon Basin.&nbsp;</p>



 Potential risks to consider when using GIS technology to map and analyse information about vulnerable populations&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>With the democratization of these technologies also comes increased data collection on vulnerable populations – which means that organisations using or considering using this technology should do so only if they have considered the the risks involved, and taken steps to mitigate these risks (in some cases, a decision might need to be made to not use the technology at all). The list below is offered as a guide to some of the key areas to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Privacy and Security: One of the most immediate concerns around using GIS is the potential for the exposure of sensitive personal information. The geolocation capabilities in GIS data can expose details about individuals’ whereabouts and movements. Without rigorous security protocols, this data could be exposed, putting at risk those who may be already vulnerable. 



 Ethical Considerations: GIS technologies also raise ethical questions, particularly regarding the potential for misuse of information. Real-time tracking capabilities can limit personal privacy and freedom, especially when used without consent or adequate transparency. Additionally, if the data ends up in the wrong hands, information intended to be used to protect a resource <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/conservation-technology-9780198850243?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">can be used by poachers to easily locate it</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Discrimination: Another risk lies in the potential for GIS data to perpetuate or even exacerbate existing inequities. If GIS data collection methodologies or interpretation algorithms reflect societal biases, the technology can inadvertently contribute to systemic discrimination.&nbsp; 



 Digital Divide: While GIS technologies are becoming increasingly accessible, there is still a considerable gap in who has the resources and knowledge to leverage these tools effectively. This digital divide means that communities lacking the requisite technological infrastructure or training may be further marginalised, thereby failing to benefit from the advantages that GIS technologies can offer. 



 Environmental Impact: Lastly, the widespread adoption and use of GIS technologies contribute to the environmental footprint of the digital landscape. The energy-intensive nature of data centres required to process and store voluminous GIS data is a growing concern in the age of climate change. 
 



 Should your organisation use GIS technology?&nbsp; 



<p>Affordable advanced mapping and real-time monitoring capabilities can empower organisations in the social- and climate-justice sectors to track and visualize trends and allocate resources efficiently. However, it’s important to remember that with more advanced data collection and practices comes increased risks, particularly for the privacy, security, and well-being of already vulnerable populations. Ethical questions around consent and potential misuse of data need to be surfaced early. It will be crucial for organisations to take the time at the inception of any project that uses geospatial data to carefully assess potential risks and develop strategies for their mitigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like to learn more about GIS systems, our friends at CartONG have made a toolkit on working with GIS: <a href="https://cartong.pages.gitlab.cartong.org/learning-corner/en/intro_gis">https://cartong.pages.gitlab.cartong.org/learning-corner/en/intro_gis</a></p>



<p>If you’re working for an organisation focused on environmental or social justice, you’re also welcome to <a href="https://calendly.com/the-engine-room">schedule a no-fee call with us</a> to talk through your ideas! We look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 26, we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/llamada-comunitaria-sostener-ecosistema-de-informacion-saludable/" title="">gathered online</a> with over 20 organisers, activists and journalists from 9 countries in Latin America. We were inspired to hear from speakers Nathaly Espitia and Maria Juliana from <a href="https://noisradio.co/" title="">Colectivo Noís Radio</a>, Júlia Rocha from <a href="https://artigo19.org/" title="">Artigo 19</a>, and Ramiro Alvarez Ugarte from <a href="https://observatoriolegislativocele.com/" title="">CELE</a>, as well as from participants in the call, who joined us in an open discussion about challenges we’re facing in the information ecosystem in the region and opportunities we see for action. In this blog post we’re sharing some of the key takeaways from our conversation.&nbsp;</p>



 A healthy information ecosystem is one where people are able to listen and talk to each other 



<p>Our conversation started with learnings from Maria Juliana and Nathaly Espitia from <a href="https://noisradio.co/" title="">Noís Radio</a>, a collective from Cali (Colombia) that has been working since 2009 on producing live radio programs using voices, music, live sounds and performative actions. They shared that they don’t see themselves as a “traditional” radio station, but rather as a “medio de conversación” (or conversation medium) that creates spaces for conversation and listening, not just one-sided sharing of information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Noís Radio, the key to a healthy information ecosystem is that people are able to listen and talk to each other. This approach was echoed by other participants in the call: for Ramiro Ugarte from CELE, it is key that we think about how to generate more dialogue and conversations, because building spaces where people can have dialogue and connect face-to-face is key to combating polarisation and achieving a healthier information ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Building trust is a slow-burning process (but it’s worth it!) 



<p>During the call, we talked about some of the factors that serve as a backdrop to our broken information system: the region is going through a period of heightened lack of trust in media and institutions, there is acute political polarisation in various countries, and citizens are dissatisfied with political systems and experiencing information overload.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To respond to this scenario, many participants spoke about the value of creating information initiatives that include processes designed to rebuild trust with people in our communities. For example, in their work, Noís Radio doesn’t approach communities with a fixed, previously defined project – instead, the collective invites people to join them in conversations and share what their needs are, then they work on establishing relationships of trust and “pass the microphone to people in their communities”. During the national strike in Colombia, in 2021, for example, Noís Radio was in Cali <a href="https://noisradio.co/pr-a-la-luna" title="">recording shows from “puntos de resistencia”</a> (resistance points) with social organisations, young people, artists, mothers and other protesters who trusted their microphones and shared their voices. (You can <a href="https://noisradio.co/pr-a-la-luna" title="">listen to the shows here</a>!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When talking about their experience, Nathaly and Maria Juliana shared that, though the trust building process can be slow, it has proven to be essential, because it gives you an important foundation when you need to organise during a moment of crisis. Having already built trust with the people in their communities over time and having meaningfully involved people in their work in the past meant that Noís Radio were able to mobilise quickly in a difficult political context, generating important conversations within their communities.&nbsp;</p>



 The value of local information initiatives and fostering a sense of community 



<p>The sense that community-led efforts are fundamental to a stronger information ecosystem in the region was echoed by Júlia Rocha, who leads the Access to Information and Transparency team at Artigo 19 in Brazil. In her perspective, “local solutions are the ones that work the most”. In a region where the notion of public interest information has been often shaped by corporate interests, as phrased by Júlia, investing in local, independent, community-led communications is indispensable. Since 2020, her organisation has been supporting the work of popular communication initiatives throughout the country with the campaign #CompartilheInformação, which has given grants to groups providing trustworthy information about <a href="https://artigo19.org/2020/07/08/quinto-e-ultimo-webinar-da-campanha-compartilheinformacao-compartilhesaude-debate-popularizacao-dos-saberes-durante-a-pandemia/" title="">health</a>, <a href="https://artigo19.org/2022/11/07/conheca-os-20-grupos-apoiados-pela-campanha-compartilheinformacao-compartilhedemocracia/" title="">democracy and elections</a> and, soon, the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brazilian journalism organisations <a href="https://www.agenciamural.org.br/" title="">Agência Mural</a> and <a href="https://enoisconteudo.com.br/" title="">Énois</a> (who also joined our call!) are also showing how valuable local initiatives can be for the information ecosystem. Seeing that people lack access to information at the local, city level, they argue that there needs to be more support to the “<a href="https://ssir.com.br/governo/a-urgencia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informacao" title="">development of local initiatives that contribute to reducing news deserts</a>”, which provides citizens with the information they need in order to “participate in public life from the territory where they live”. As <a href="https://ssir.com.br/governo/a-urgencia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informacao" title="">Izabela Moi and Nina Weingrill</a> put it: “quality local coverage creates and sustains the feeling of belonging to a community and opens spaces for action and citizen participation.“&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see this in the work of Noís Radio too, in their work to empower more independent voices in the information ecosystem. In our chat, Nathaly and Maria Juliana talked about the importance of creating initiatives that go beyond capital cities, as well as how crucial it is to support the work coming from indigenous communities, afro colombian communities and migrant communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the call, we also heard from <a href="https://baudoap.com/" title="">Agencia Baudó</a> in Colombia, who is doing “journalism that connects communities” by working with community storytellers that are not only providers of information, but also local leaders working in their communities for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/co/app/baudo-ap/id6460035443" title="">social transformation</a>. Another example shared is the work of <a href="https://www.mascomunidad.org.ar/" title="">+COMUNIDAD</a>, an argentinian “solutions journalism medium” that investigates, finds and tells stories of people and cities, solving their challenges and inspiring others to transform themselves.</p>



<p>Participants also talked about the importance of counterbalancing the lack of “official” data about certain topics, especially in regions that lack access to information about issues such as sexual and reproductive health and rights or the environment, with the production of community-driven data or initiatives that democratise access to information. To that end, we talked about initiatives like Artigo 19’s <a href="https://mapaabortolegal.org" title="">map made for Brazilian women to know where to access abortion care</a> in their states – information that had been previously unavailable.</p>



 Fighting harmful trends at a regional level and more support for&nbsp; sustained, long term alliances 



<p>We discussed some of the regional trends in information disorder and how civil society in the region is witnessing the same types of disinformation being shared in many countries. Research led by <a href="https://chequeado.com/" title="">Chequeado</a> (Argentina), <a href="https://www.lasillavacia.com/" title="">La Silla Vacía</a> (Colombia), <a href="https://lupa.uol.com.br/" title="">Lupa</a> (Brazil), <a href="https://www.agenciaocote.com/" title="">Ocote</a> (Guatemala) and <a href="https://ojo-publico.com/" title="">OjoPúblico</a> (Perú), for instance, has shown how <a href="https://chequeado.com/nota/desinformacion-de-genero-como-se-articulan-los-grupos-que-difunden-falsedades-sobre-el-tema-en-america-latina/" title="">groups are organising to spread falsehoods about gender-related issues in Latin America</a>. Recent investigative project <a href="https://www.elclip.org/mercenarios-digitales/" title="">Mercenarios Digitales</a>, led by a cross-border and collaborative media alliance, has gathered evidence on the impact of an international network of disinformation actors operating in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this context, participants shared that it is key to foster more multi-country spaces where civil society organisations, journalists and human rights defenders can work in an articulated manner to build a healthier information ecosystem. Similarly, participants also talked about how important it could be to have regional alliances that would allow them to foresee the types of disinformation and attacks that are emerging in the continent.</p>



 Join our next community call! 



<p>As we make our way through this multi-year project to contribute to a healthier information ecosystem, our team is in awe of the amazing work being done by journalists, communicators, civil society, community organisers and activists who are figuring out creative ways to make sure valuable information is reaching the people in their communities.</p>



<p>Our research for this project is just getting started and we’re looking forward to continuing working with many of you as we build this work. Our next community call is happening on November 23, at 9am Ciudad de México, 10am Bogotá, 12pm São Paulo. (For this call, the main language of communication will be Spanish!)</p>

<p>During the past years, FIDO has continued its expansion as an authentication standard among eIDAS compliant identification solutions across the EU. Back in 2020, FIDO was deployed as part of an eID scheme by the Czech domain register <a href="https://www.mojeid.cz/en/support/two-factor-authentication/">CZ.NIC’s identity provider MojeID</a>, and FIDO’s eID scheme was <a href="https://www.nic.cz/page/4180/cznic-received-accreditation-to-manage-a-qualified-electronic-identification-system-from-the-moi-cr/">recognized as LoA Substantial and High</a> by the Czech ministry of interior. The year after, the <a href="https://www.buypass.com/products/authentication/fido2-solution-for-strong-authentication">Norwegian trust service provider Buypass</a> deployed FIDO2 as an authentication standard for an eIDAS eID scheme of LoA Substantial and High; this solution has been accredited by the Norwegian digitalization agency and is now being rolled out in the Norwegian healthcare sector. In April 2023, the FIDO Alliance published a <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-using-fido-for-the-eudi-wallet/">white paper</a> that describes how FIDO can be used for the EUDI Wallet under the proposed eIDAS2 regulation. So FIDO is currently gaining momentum as an authentication standard in the EU.</p>



<p>On top of these success stories, the FIDO standards have recently been referenced by two of the most respected EU organizations within cybersecurity and standardization: ENISA (the EU Cybersecurity Agency) and ETSI (the European Telecommunications Standards Institute).</p>



<p>In July 2023, ENISA published the report “<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-standards">Digital Identity Standards</a>”. The report provides a comprehensive overview of digital identity standards, standardization organizations, and authentication protocols. More specifically, the report describes the FIDO Alliance as “an open industry association launched in February 2013 whose stated mission is to develop and promote authentication standards that ‘help reduce the world’s over-reliance on passwords”. Furthermore, the ENISA report describes the FIDO standard suite FIDO2, FIDO U2F and FIDO UAF in technical detail. The ENISA report also explains the concepts of FIDO Authenticators, FIDO Metadata Service, assertions with Relying Parties, and the WebAuthn and CTAP2 APIs. ENISA concludes that the maturity of the FIDO standards is high. This ENISA report re-iterates and emphasizes the recommendation to use FIDO for two-factor authentication, which was published in 2022 in the joint publication “<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/boosting-your-organisations-cyber-resilience">Boosting your Organisation’s Cyber Resilience</a>” issued in cooperation by EU-CERT and ENISA.</p>



<p>Next, ETSI published the technical report <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.01.01_60/tr_119476v010101p.pdf">ETSI TR 119 476</a> called “Analysis of selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs applied to Electronic Attestation of Attributes”. The ETSI report analyzes cryptographic schemes for selective disclosure and their potential application for Electronic Attestation Attributes in line with the proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281">eIDAS2 regulation</a>. The purpose is to allow the users of the EUDI Wallets to select what attributes they want to share with a verifier. For example, a user may only want to disclose that she is over 18 years old at a restaurant, but no more personal information than that. The ETSI report includes a description of the VC-FIDO solution, which has been invented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3taGxBdrRU">David Chadwick at the Kent University</a>. The ETSI report states:</p>



<p>“The VC-FIDO integration is based on the W3C WebAuthn protocol in the FIDO2 standard. The WebAuthn stack is extended with a W3C Verifiable Credentials enrollment protocol, resulting in a client that can enroll for multiple atomic short-lived W3C Verifiable Credentials based on W3C Credential templates. These atomic short-lived W3C Verifiable Credentials can then be (temporarily) stored in an EUDI Wallet, and be combined into a Verifiable Presentation that is presented to the relying party (verifier). Selective disclosure is achieved since the user can enroll for the atomic attributes it needs for a specific use case, and present only those atomic (Q)EAAs to a Relying Party.”</p>



<p>These prominent references in the ENISA and ETSI reports demonstrate that FIDO has achieved a firm position as a viable authentication standard for eIDAS2 and regulated use cases in the EU. It will be interesting to follow the continued development of the EUDI Wallet implementations and the related Large Scale Pilots – it is quite likely that FIDO will be deployed in such solutions across the EU.</p>

They are a reflection of the so-called Global North and can encode and perpetuate biases and discrimination.

What perspectives do they&nbsp;hide? <p>It is telling that for generative AI, the concept of a “refugee” elicits either forlorn and emaciated faces of Black children or else portraits of doe-eyed and vaguely Middle Eastern people waiting to be rescued. When I sent these depictions to a colleague who is currently in a situation of displacement and identifies as a refugee, she laughed and said, “I sure as hell hope I don’t look like&nbsp;this.”</p><p>Generative AI is also inherently exploitative. Its training data are scraped and extracted often without the knowledge or consent of the people who created or are in the data. Menial tasks that allow the models to function fall on underpaid labor outside of North America and Europe. The benefits of this technology do not accrue equally, and generative AI looks to replicate the vast power differentials between those who benefit and those who are the subjects of high-risk technological experiments.</p> How can we think more intentionally about who will be impacted by generative AI and work collaboratively–and rapidly–with affected populations to build knowledge? <p>The production of any kind of knowledge is always a political act, especially since researchers often build entire careers on documenting the trauma of others, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jhuman/huq004">stealing stories” as they go along</a>. Being entrusted with other people’s stories is a deep privilege. Generating any type of knowledge is not without its pitfalls, and academia is in danger of falling into the same trap with generative AI research: creating knowledge in isolation from communities, failing to consider the expertise of those we’re purporting to learn from. How can researchers and storytellers limit the extractive nature of research and story collection? Given the power differentials involved, research and storytelling can and should be uncomfortable, and we must pay particular attention to why certain perspectives in the so-called Global North are given precedence while the <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/a-primer-on-ai-in-from-the-majority-world/">rest of the world continues to be silenced</a>. This is particularly pertinent when we are talking about a vast system of increasingly autonomous knowledge generation through&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The concept of story and knowledge stewardship may be helpful, a concept from Indigenous learnings which recognizes that the storyteller is not exempt from critical analysis of their own power and privilege over other people’s narratives and should instead hold space for stories to tell themselves. This type of framing continually places responsibility at the center (see for example the work of the Canadian <a href="https://fnigc.ca/">First Nations Information Governance Centre</a>). Storytelling and sharing is also a profound act of resistance to simplified and homogenized narratives, often common when there is a power differential between the researcher and their topic. Established methods of knowledge production are predicated on an outside expert parachuting in, extracting data, findings, and stories, using their westernized credentials to further their careers as the&nbsp;expert.</p><p>True commitment to participatory approaches requires ceding space, meaningfully redistributing resources, and supporting affected communities in telling their own stories. And real engagement with decolonial methodologies requires an iterative understanding of these framings, a re-framing process that is never complete. By decentering so-called Global North narratives and not tokenizing people with lived experience as research subjects or afterthoughts, researchers can create opportunities that recognize their privilege and access to resources — and then redistribute those resources through meaningful participation, creating an environment for people to tell their own stories. It is this commitment to participatory approaches that we need in generative AI research, especially as it meets up with border control technologies.</p><p>One small example is the <a href="https://www.migrationtechmonitor.com/">Migration and Technology Monitor</a> project at the York University’s <a href="https://refugeelab.ca/">Refugee Law Lab</a>, where I am Associate Director.&nbsp;, Migration and Technology Monitor is a platform and an archive with a focus on migration, technology, and human rights. Our recently launched <a href="https://www.migrationtechmonitor.com/2023fellows">fellowship program</a> aims to create opportunities for people with lived experience to meaningfully contribute to research, storytelling, policy, and advocacy conversations from the start, not as an afterthought. Among our aims is to generate a collaborative, intellectual, and advocacy community committed to border justice. We prioritize opportunities for participatory work, including the ability to pitch unique and relevant projects by affected communities themselves. Veronica Martinez, Nery Sataella, Simon Drotti, Rajendra Paudel, and Wael Qarssifi are part of our first cohort of fellows from mobile communities from Venezuela to Mexico to Uganda to Nepal to Malaysia. Our hope is that our fellowship creates a community which provides spaces of collaboration, care, and co-creation of knowledge. We are specifically sharing resources with people on the move who may not be able to benefit from funding and resources readily available in the EU and North America. People with lived experiences of migration must be in the driver’s seat when interrogating both the negative impacts of technology as well as the creative solutions that innovation can bring to the complex stories of human movement, such as using generative AI to compile resources for mobile communities.</p><p>Participatory methodologies that foreground lived experience as the starting place for generating knowledge inherently destabilize established power hierarchies of knowledge production. These approaches encourage researchers and tech designers to critically interrogate their own positionality and how much space their own so-called expertise takes up in the generation of knowledge at the expense of other realities. These framings and commitments are paramount, especially in context with fraught histories and vast power differentials–for example, where mobile populations are the abject and feared others and where generative AI models learn on these realities. Especially pertinent for scholars, technologists, and researchers who are themselves part of the so-called Rest of World, a re-imagination of expertise and knowledge must come from the ground up and any tools which are created must recognize and fight against these power differentials.</p><p>It is through participatory methodologies that we may come a step closer towards seeing a world in which many worlds fit, a phrase which as my BKC colleague Ashley Lee reminds us, comes from the Zapatista Indigenous resistance movement — a world where “nothing about us without us” moves beyond an old community organizer motto towards a real commitment to participation, story stewardship, and public scholarship which honors and foregrounds lived experience.</p><p>Thank you to Madeline McGee for her suggestions which greatly improved this piece and to Sam Hinds for her careful&nbsp;edits.</p><p>This essay is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary and transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence.

 A Real-Time Experiment to Regulate Generative AI Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christianlue?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Christian Lue</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>.<p>The public release of ChatGPT in November 2022 represents a significant breakthrough in generative AI — systems that craft synthetic content based on patterns learned from extensive datasets. This development has heightened concerns about AI’s impact on individuals and society at large. In the brief period since this breakthrough, there has been a surge in lawsuits pertaining to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/arts/sarah-silverman-lawsuit-openai-meta.html">copyright</a> and <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/microsoft-and-openai-sued-for-3bn-in-privacy-complaint/">privacy</a> violations, as well as<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australian-mayor-readies-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content-2023-04-05/"> defamation</a>. One lawyer learned a hard lesson about the dangers of AI “hallucination” after citing seemingly genuine but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html">bogus</a> judicial precedents generated by ChatGPT in a legal brief submitted to court. There are even reports that such systems have been implicated in an individual’s decision to commit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkadgm/man-dies-by-suicide-after-talking-with-ai-chatbot-widow-says">suicide</a>.</p><p>Given these concerns, there is a growing demand for regulatory action. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, addressed the US Congress in May and called upon legislators to&nbsp;act.</p><p>The EU has taken the lead in legislative endeavors. In April 2021, the European Commission proposed a Regulation on AI (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206">AI Act</a>), marking the first step toward a comprehensive global legal framework on AI. This landmark legislation aims to foster a human-centric AI, directing its development in a way that respects human dignity, safeguards fundamental rights, and guarantees the security and trustworthiness of AI&nbsp;systems.</p><blockquote>The agile innovation process that permeates the software world, where distributed technologies are frequently released in early stages and iteratively refined based on usage data, necessitates a regulatory system that is designed to learn and&nbsp;adapt.</blockquote><p>The proposed AI Act adopts a risk-based approach, categorizing AI systems into three main risk levels: unacceptable risk, high risk, and limited risk. This classification depends on the potential risk posed to health, safety, and fundamental rights. Certain AI systems such as those that generate “trustworthiness” scores, akin to the Chinese Social Credit System, are considered to present unacceptable risks and are completely prohibited. AI systems used in hiring processes and welfare benefit decisions fall into the high-risk category and are subject to stringent obligations. These include conducting a conformity assessment and adhering to certain data quality and transparency requirements. Meanwhile, chatbots and deepfakes are considered limited risk, subject to relatively minimal transparency requirements.</p><p>Shortly after the proposal was drafted, and after the release of ChatGPT, it became clear that the Commission’s draft contained a significant hole: it did not address general purpose AI or “foundational models” like Open AI’s GPT-n series, which underpins ChatGPT. Fortunately, due to the EU’s multistage legislative process, the release of ChatGPT occurred while the European Parliament was deliberating on the AI Act. This provided a timely opportunity to include new provisions specifically targeting foundational models and generative AI.</p><p>Under an <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0236_EN.pdf">amendment</a> adopted by the European Parliament in June, providers of foundational models would be required to identify and reduce risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights through proper design and testing before placing their models on the market. They must also implement measures to ensure appropriate levels of performance and adopt strategies to minimize energy and resource usage. Moreover, these AI systems must be registered in an EU database, with details on their capabilities, foreseeable risks, and measures taken to mitigate these risks, including an account of risks that remain unaddressed. The amendment would impose additional obligations on foundational models employed in generative AI. These obligations include transparency requirements, ensuring users are aware that content is machine generated, and implementing adequate safeguards against the generation of unlawful content. Providers must also publish a detailed summary of copyrighted content used to train their&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While the final version of the AI Act will be determined by the trilogue among the European Commission, European Parliament, and European Council, its current form already marks an ambitious and real-time attempt to regulate generative AI, highlighting the challenges of regulating a rapidly evolving&nbsp;target.</p><p>On this occasion, the EU’s legislative process kept pace with the latest advancements before the laws were set in stone. However, it raises the question: how often can we count on such fortunate timing, and what proactive measures should be&nbsp;taken?</p><p>We must embed flexibility into such laws. Indeed, the EU has taken some steps in this direction, granting the Commission the authority to adapt the law by adding new use cases into the risk categories. Yet, considering previous experiences with the Commission’s implementation of delegated acts, it’s debatable whether such mechanisms alone can keep up with the rapid pace of AI development.</p><p>The agile innovation process that permeates the software world, where distributed technologies are frequently released in early stages and iteratively refined based on usage data, necessitates a regulatory system that is designed to learn and&nbsp;adapt.</p><p>It is important to embrace a variety of techniques for adaptive regulation, such as regulatory experimentation through pilot projects and embedding systematic and periodic review and revision mechanisms into legislation. Adaptive regulation further necessitates openness to a diversity of approaches across jurisdictions. It encourages learning from one another, which implies that the EU should resist its inclination to solely dictate global standards for AI regulation, and instead regard its efforts as contributions to a collective pool of learning resources.</p><blockquote>While adaptive regulation does come with its own costs, clinging to static regulation designed for a hardware world with fully-formed products manufactured in centralized facilities, could potentially prove to be even more costly in the face of rapidly advancing technology.</blockquote><p>Simultaneously, the amendment has significantly broadened the Act’s scope. While the Commission’s draft focused on mitigating harms to health, safety, and fundamental rights, the European Parliament’s version extends these concerns to include democracy, the rule of law, and environmental protection. Consequently, providers of high-risk AI systems and foundational models are required to manage risks associated with all these areas. However, this raises concerns that the Act might transform into a catch-all regulation with diluted impact, thereby creating a considerable burden on providers to translate these broad goals into concrete guardrails.</p><p>This amendment has exacerbated existing concerns that these broad requirements and accompanying compliance costs might stifle innovation. In an open <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wrtxfvcD9FwfNfWGDL37Q6Nd8wBKXCkn/view">letter</a> to EU authorities, over 150 executives from companies including Siemens, Airbus, Deutsche Telekom, and Renault criticized the AI Act for its potential to “undermine Europe’s competitiveness and technological autonomy.” One of the significant concerns raised by these companies relates to the legislation’s strict requirements aimed at generative AI systems and foundational models. The letter equates the importance of generative AI with the invention of the internet, considering its potential to shape not only the economy but also culture and politics. The signatories caution that the compliance costs and risks embedded in the AI Act could “result in highly innovative companies relocating their operations overseas, investors retracting their capital from the development of European foundational models, and European AI in general.”</p><p>OpenAI has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/25/23737116/openai-ai-regulation-eu-ai-act-cease-operating">warned</a> about potentially exiting the EU if the conditions of the AI Act prove too restrictive. There are also indications that even major players are cautious when rolling out their latest services. The launch of Google Bard was delayed in the EU by two months due to compliance concerns with the General Data Protection Regulation. However, it was ultimately introduced with improved <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702768/google-bard-launches-in-eu-overcoming-data-privacy-concerns-in-the-region.html">privacy</a> safeguards, highlighting the EU’s role in shaping global data policies of such organizations.</p><p>For its part, the EU contends that the AI Act is designed to stimulate AI innovation and underscores key enabling measures included in the Act. These encompass regulatory sandboxes, which serve as test beds for AI experimentation and development, an industry-led process for defining standards that assist with compliance, and safe harbors for AI research.</p><p>Of course, the concerns from the industry about the AI Act’s impact on innovation, as well as the EU’s responses to these matters, represent an essential part of balancing the inevitable trade-offs inherent in regulating any emerging technology, and time will tell which direction the pendulum swings. During the trilogue negotiations, it is likely that the European Council will push back on some of the amendments from the Parliament. Indeed, there is merit in carefully weighing the benefits of introducing broad objectives such as democracy and the rule of law without concrete measures in place to support these goals. One might argue that efforts are better spent strengthening the safeguards for fundamental rights, which is crucial for safeguarding both democracy and the rule of law. Numerous civil society organizations have already emphasized the need for incorporating fundamental rights impact assessments and empowering individuals and public interest organizations to file complaints and seek redress for harms inflicted by&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Moreover, it would be beneficial to concentrate on tangible guardrails, such as facilitating researchers’ access to foundational models, data, and parameters. This approach is likely to be more effective in promoting accountability, democracy, and the rule of law compared to a general requirement to conduct risk assessments based on such broad concepts.</p><p>Regardless of the final form of the text, the AI Act is poised to significantly shape AI development and the regulatory landscape in the EU and beyond. Therefore, the AI community must prepare for its&nbsp;impact.</p><p>This essay is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary and transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence.

 Global Collaboration Creates Ethical Generative AI <p>Though the underlying technology was based on years of AI research by many individuals and organizations, the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November of 2022 captured the collective imagination in an extraordinary way. The release started an ongoing conversation about the potential of the technology to improve our lives, and to harm them. In the public consciousness, AI has remained confusing, overwhelming, and a bit scary — even its name can seem imprecise and distracting. And with generative AI, phrases like “hallucination” and “job replacement” only foment more fear. Yet beneath the hype, doomerism, and techno-utopianism sits the fundamental question of what kind of societies we want to live in — and what choices we should make to realize&nbsp;them.</p><p>One month after the release of ChatGPT, a group of collaborators — the Nordic Centre at BI Norwegian Business School, the Institute for Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro, the Technical University of Munich, and the Berkman Klein Center — decided it was time to discuss the implications of generative AI. We knew that if generative AI were to realize its true pro-social potential and to have its harms mitigated, then cross-sector, cross-disciplinary, and cross-national conversation was needed. Many in our community had already begun to explore use cases, governance, accountability, and the systems’ social impact broadly. It was time to rebuild bridges weakened by the COVID pandemic&nbsp;era.</p>Sabelo Mhlambi and Jenn Louie at “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI,” May&nbsp;2023.<p>In May 2023, the Berkman Klein Center hosted “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI” in Cambridge, USA, bringing together colleagues old and new with backgrounds from academia, civil society, government, and industry, from over two dozen countries and all of the continents other than Antarctica. We discussed the need for access to data for research purposes and the need for real&nbsp;study.</p><p>At the same time, many emphasized that policymakers do not have the time; they need to act now. Action and study need to happen in parallel.</p>Samson Esayas at “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI,” May&nbsp;2023.<blockquote>Today we introduce the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary, transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence, as seen by members of the Berkman Klein Center community.</blockquote><p>In the first set of essays, released today, <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-eu-ai-act-e73e1a35a843">Samson Esayas</a> addresses the potential implications of policy, speculating on the role the European Union’s AI Act may play in the governance and development of generative technologies. And <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/building-knowledge-about-generative-ai-with-mobile-populations-806c80e899b1">Petra Molnar</a> challenges us to consider the potential impact of generative AI on the surveillance of borders and of migrants, urging us to engage displaced people using participatory methods to understand their perspectives and protect their&nbsp;safety.</p><p>The second installment, to be released next week, addresses how generative AI challenges fundamental concerns about our experiences of being human. Alexa Hasse examines how generative AI tools might change trust in our human social relationships. Sameer Hinduja offers a deep dive into the sobering potential of generative AI tools to perpetuate online harassment at massive scale. And Bill Shribman brings the perspective of a children’s media producer as he explores how media literacy education may need to shift in light of advancements in AI technology.</p>Maroussia Lévesque and Petra Molnar at “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI,” May&nbsp;2023.<p>As members of our community continue to study generative AI, both the urgency and the need for deeper consideration persist. Policymakers are moving quickly towards substantial legislation in multiple regions across the world. The technology keeps improving. Technology innovators are finding new applications for generative AI, and we likely have only scratched the surface of what is to come. Researchers are publishing new findings about concerns regarding bias, data privacy, data ownership, disinformation, and vast inequities across regions and communities. And they urgently need more access to data. Looking forward, the necessity for continued collaboration across sectoral, national, and disciplinary boundaries seems all the more critical.</p><p>As Senior Director of Programs and Strategy at the Berkman Klein Center, I am committed to sustaining co-design efforts. We welcome fresh perspectives and opportunities for engagement from around the globe, and from new sectors and stakeholders.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/co-designing-shared-futures-3d15f9883773">Co-Designing Shared Futures</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>To defend against threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures, organizations need to identify, create, document, and test detection, investigation, prevention, mitigation, and remediation steps. These steps, when grouped together, form a cyber security playbook that can be used to protect organizational systems, networks, data, and users.</p>



<p>This specification defines the schema and taxonomy for cybersecurity playbooks and how cybersecurity playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions.</p>

<p>TORONTO, OCTOBER 31st, 2023 — There is a public trust gap in adopting digital trust capabilities that governments must close together with the private sector to amplify Canadian priorities in the global digital economy, according to a new report from DIACC.</p>



<p>Digital trust tools help verify a person or organization’s identity to enhance privacy, security, and transparency using people-centred design to operate digital credentials, digital wallets, networks, and modern authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report, Committed to Building Trust Together, found no strong call to action from the public to advance digital trust even though Canadians are increasingly frustrated by online scams and identity theft, among other high-profile security and data breaches that affect them. The lack of vocal public demand for digital trust is partly due to a need for education about what it is and, most importantly, how it can benefit and improve their lives.</p>



<p>“Hesitancy is often rooted in data privacy, security, and potential misuse of personal information concerns. People should rightly be concerned because there are often no easily understood rules around where their personal data lives, who owns it, or how others use it,” said Joni Brennan, president of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC). “In today’s digital world, trust remains at a premium, and the importance of identity verification is at an all-time high.”</p>



<p>Digital trust capabilities are critical — and long overdue — to support a secure and inclusive digital economy and society. From more efficient business tasks that save millions of dollars to getting the proper health records and making it easier to buy a house or board a plane, privacy and personal data control are potent tools that can help safely confirm a person’s identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report follows two Public Trust Forum sessions that brought together members from academia, non-profit organizations, private sector companies and provincial and territorial governments. Participants spoke in-depth about the challenges, opportunities, and considerations for creating the conditions to enable made-in-Canada solutions.</p>



<p>Public Trust Forum participants reached a consensus on the following key takeaways:</p>



 
 There will never be a universal consensus on acceptance of digital trust capabilities. Universal acceptance should not be the goal. 



 Use of government-issued digital credentials must be voluntary. People must have the choice to opt-out, as they can opt-out in the private sector. 



 There’s no strong call to action from the public to advance digital trust. There is a need for education about digital trust and, most importantly, how it can benefit and improve people’s lives. 



 An effective communications strategy should focus on real-life success stories in different use cases. That means practical examples of how digital trust capabilities improve service delivery, such as in the aviation and financial sectors. 



 Though it’s been around for a long time, the term “digital identity” may hinder the public’s understanding. 



 Terms such as “verify,” “authenticate,” or “credentials” may make it easier for those who are unsure about new technologies to see the benefits. 



 DON’T abandon the term “digital identity.” It’s a profession and a globally recognized definition; its use will depend on the audience and situation. 



 Jurisdictionally, with Canadian news removed from popular social media platforms, there may be a vacuum to spread mis and disinformation regarding digital modernization. 
 



<p>DIACC made five recommendations that all organizations should prioritize to inform public dialogue and build trust.</p>



 
 Don’t wait for a universal public consensus on adopting digital trust capabilities because it will never come. Commit and message that public adoption is voluntary. Individuals may choose to use digital trust services or not. 



 Make significant public education investments at municipal, provincial and federal levels and the private sector to inform the public about well-designed capabilities. Focus on easy use cases (i.e., digital parking or bus passes, obtaining a business licence). 



 Reduce the temperature by moving public messaging away from the confusing term “digital identity” in certain situations. Terms like “verify,” “authenticate,” and “credential” are more easily understood. 



 Communicate public safety importance as scenarios where digital services reduce response pressure and help get resources faster to those in need. Pandemic-related personal safety concerns accelerated the demand for modern digital services. 



 Break transformation down into manageable outcomes rather than trying to boil the ocean with a national or universal strategy. 
 



<p>“The bottom line is that organizations and governments must prioritize transparency, robust data protection measures, and ethical data usage while actively engaging with the public to address concerns and ensure that digital trust capabilities are developed and implemented to protect and enhance individual privacy and security and support organizations’ operational needs,” Brennan said. “Establishing safe and convenient use of digital ID services means establishing trust. People must have confidence and control over their identity data, and on the flip side, they must have evidence that their privacy, security and choices are secured.”</p>



<p>“Citizens and residents vocalize their frustrations with services that aren’t’ modernized, and they’re looking to governments and the private sector to lead the way in the global digital economy collaboratively,” said Giselle D’Paiva, Partner, Government &amp; Public Sector, Deloitte.</p>



<p>“Trust is local, and designing made-in-Canada solutions for digital access and verification will help build consumer confidence, trust, and broad adoption,” said Neil Butters, VP of Product, Interac Verified.</p>



<p>“Securing digital trust for the supply chain and global digital economy depends on local and international leadership and collaboration to advance frameworks and standards that ensure broad benefits,” said Don Cuthbertson, Chief Executive Officer of Portage CyberTech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re working to help the public understand that global standards increase trust, reduce fraud and make it safer and more convenient for our customers to transact,” said Marie Jordan, Senior Director at VISA, Global Standards and Industry Engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DIACC will reconvene the Public Trust Forum at intervals to review what’s transpired since the last forum, address critical thematic developments, and continue public literacy research to pinpoint how perception evolves among the public.</p>

We’ll also get into general tips. Like <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/radiating-confidence-at-change-org-9fbbe9f4fc2f">our first post</a>, we’ve pulled out the key questions you can ask yourself to help you&nbsp;prepare.</p> Running your&nbsp;session <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_12RxeZrt3k2PIqiKn3bi97od6bBxifBPIOR8VrXwlI/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part 3</a>&nbsp;(slides)</p><p>Start as you mean to go on, as they say. In order to create a positive atmosphere, be an enlarged version of yourself. If you’re funny, make people laugh. If you’re not, at least try to put people at their ease as best you can! That can be as simple as smiling&nbsp;:)</p> At the start of your&nbsp;session cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>There may be someone in the room in which you’re going to be running your session immediately before you. If the event planners did their job well, however, you will have at least a few minutes to get set up. If you feel like you’re rushing, just ask everyone to get acquainted with the person next to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Even if there’s a tech person on hand, don’t assume that everything is set up to your liking. Check the remotes. Check that the fonts on the slides you sent through look correct. Check the microphone works. Check everything. Twice.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Aristotle famously said that we become brave by acting like a brave person. If you smile, everyone assumes that you are confident and are enjoying the experience. Smiling is particularly infectious, so smile away at people as they arrive. Just not in a scary&nbsp;way.</p><p>Some questions to reflect&nbsp;on:</p>  What can you do to get set up or prepared even before you enter the&nbsp;room?  Have you got a backup copy of your slide deck? Could you run the session without&nbsp;them?  What kind of questions can you ask people as they arrive which will make them feel&nbsp;welcome?  What’s the worst that can&nbsp;happen?  If you’ve used a link shortener, have you checked it isn’t blocked on the event&nbsp;wifi?   During your&nbsp;session <p>Sessions at events can be a rollercoaster of emotions and energy, both for the whoever is leading the session (you!) and the audience/participants.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Preparation is important, but so is delivery, so make sure people and ideas have time to ‘breathe’. Mix up the pace of the session to keep it interesting. Even if you practise, it’s easy to run over due to people arriving late, a question derailing your flow, or just you being over-enthusiastic about a particular section. Keep track of timings using your watch, phone, or presenter display. Bonus points for vibrating alarms,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Questions to think&nbsp;about:</p>  Have you left enough time for questions?  Can you think of questions you are expecting to get and can prepare&nbsp;for?  Are there easy analogies you can use from everyday&nbsp;life?  Did you know that audience members with a ‘concentration face’ can also look like them frowning?  When people read they tend to use a monotone voice — have you practised modulating your voice (making it go up and down, faster and slower) to make it more interesting to listen&nbsp;to?  cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers At the end of your&nbsp;session <p>Just because you’ve informed your audience of the link to the slide deck once doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t do it again. Especially as they’ve now seen how good it is. Ensure it’s on the screen at the end of your session for a good&nbsp;while.</p><p>Questions to prepare you for the&nbsp;end:</p>  Can you make the link to your slides and agenda as easy to access as possible by ensuring there are no ambiguous characters (e.g. l vs&nbsp;1)?  Do you want to add your social media details to these resources as well? Which&nbsp;one(s)?  Are there particular ‘rabbit holes’ that people tend to want to go down with the topic of your&nbsp;session?   Recovering from&nbsp;sessions <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sz0OT0mp-_YWuy2AB4Jr125rf5lgPbVkxDuwcjXJLEw/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part 4</a>&nbsp;(slides)</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Congratulations! Your session is over and it’s time to relax a little. Instead of flopping into a heap in the corner or hitting the bar, take steps to look after yourself. Spending time outside, following-up with interesting people, and eating/drinking the right things are all ways to refresh your mind, body, and&nbsp;soul!</p><p>Don’t forget to take a moment to breathe and ask yourself these questions while you’re preparing:</p>  Are there spaces outside you can be by yourself for a while? (especially if you’re an introvert)  Can you take food and drink into the room you’re running your&nbsp;session?  What are you going to reward yourself&nbsp;with?  How can you make it so that people who missed your session can almost feel like they participated?  Is it worth putting your out of office autoresponder on during the&nbsp;event?  What does a minimum viable blog post look like for&nbsp;you?   General Tips <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17R7OWgy-8Cme_EphWHrlLu0eKf9QtgC8r0BGU2WqrbU/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part&nbsp;5</a></p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>When you attend events and conferences you should work to promote engagement. It helps everyone have a better time. Ask questions! Sometimes you’ve got all of the answers and you’re bestowing your wisdom. More often, you’re exploring an area, sharing your experience, and asking questions for your colleagues to grapple with along with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Remember nothing is irrelevant and you should share openly. The things that you find boring and mundane such as how you set something up or the problems you had recruiting someone to do X can be fascinating and gold dust to other people. So mention them! You can go into more detail in the Q&amp;A if&nbsp;asked.</p><p>People aren’t coming to your session because you’re a huge rockstar and they want to bask in your glory. Or maybe they are. Either way, your job is to help them with the things they are facing in their life, thanks to your insights.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Final question to have an epic presentation: If you step into the shoes of your audience, what could you add / remove /&nbsp;modify?</p><p>We hope these couple of posts have helped you feel prepared for your next big workshop, talk, session or presentation.

<p>In the latest Elastos Bi-Weekly Update, significant progress has been made across different areas of the project. On the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/mainchain/intro/">Elastos Main Chain</a>, the core teams have completed the development and testing phases for changing the BPoS voting consensus mechanisms via pledging. This development is expected to bring about greater flexibility and enhanced security to the voting system. Additionally, advancements in Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof verification are enabling more secure transactions and there have been direct network recovery features undergoing refinements through BPoS consensus logic, helping make the system more resilient. While the Elastos BTC Layer 2 solution is still under research,&nbsp; check out the <a href="https://blockchain.elastos.io/">Main Chain explorer</a> which has also seen an update that enhances data visualization, and a new <a href="https://blockchain.elastos.io/calculator">tool calculating staking rights and rewards</a> which has just been introduced.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/sidechains/intro/">Elastos Smart Chain (ESC)</a>, significant strides have been made in incentivising developer involvement. A new developer incentive mechanism has been implemented, and it’s currently in the testing and verification stage. In terms of transaction costs, there is an ongoing debate about adjusting the gas fees. While a consensus hasn’t been reached, it remains an important point of discussion for making Elastos more rewarding to stakeholders. A preliminary plan is in place that aims to redistribute block rewards to miners, contract developers, and the CR treasury through an adjusted gas fee mechanism.</p>
<p>For the ESC/EID intersection, SPV synchronisation stability has been notably improved, leading to a more consistent block generation speed for sidechains. Issues of unstable block generation due to node failures in the broadcasting mechanism have been effectively addressed, adding another layer of reliability to the network.</p>
<p>In the area of <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/dids/intro/">Decentralised Identifier (DID)</a> Web Service and <a href="https://kyc-me.io/">KYC-me</a>, there are plans for significant upgrades by the end of the year. These are aimed at integrating with KYC-me, which is extending its support for multiple eKYC providers. User experience enhancements are actively being worked on, following the trend of continuous improvement seen in the DID Web Service.</p>
<p>This comprehensive series of updates reflects Elastos’ commitment to advancing both its core infrastructure in blockchain technology and decentralised identity solutions.

<p>UBL v2.4 ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.4 from the OASIS Universal Business Language TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>UBL is the leading interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:<br>– A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.<br>– A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.<br>– A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.</p>



<p>UBL v2.4 is a minor revision to v2.3 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 93.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>

<p>In April 2023, the OpenID Foundation announced the 2023 Kim Cameron Award recipients. Today we’re pleased for the award recipients to share their experiences.</p>
<p>The goal of the awards is to increase representation from young people’s who’ve demonstrated an interest in subjects consistent with best practices and identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-henderson-76171a68/">Isaac Henderson</a><br>Senior Security Researcher at the University of Stuttgart IAT/Fraunhofer IAO</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am humbled and honored to express my gratitude to the OpenID Foundation for bestowing upon me the prestigious Kim Cameron Award. Through this, I had an opportunity to attend the Identiverse Conference in Las Vegas. In this blog post, I will take you through the highlights of my Identiverse experience and share my heartfelt appreciation for the recognition that has fueled my commitment to the world of digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Identiverse Conference has established itself as a global hub for identity professionals, and technologists. The core of Identiverse lies in its power-packed keynotes and parallel sessions. Visionaries from diverse industries took the stage to discuss the rapidly evolving landscape of digital identity. Each presentation was a mosaic of ideas, woven together to form a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. From discussions about Decentralized identity, secured authentication, and Zero Trust Architectures to the exploration of advancements in AI-driven security solutions, the keynotes painted a vivid picture of the possibilities awaiting us. And notably, deep dive sessions on Passkeys, Microsoft EntraID, and SPIFFE-based distributed workload for Zero Trust Architectures, Open ID sessions on OIX and GAIN were thought-provoking. These insights were not only intellectually stimulating but also profoundly impactful in shaping my perspective on the future of identity. Due to the many interesting sessions offered parallelly sometimes it was even tough to decide which one to attend. Also, I was able to witness how ideas originated in Identiverse sessions and later turned into standards in identity space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expo floor at Identiverse resembled a technological theme park. Booths showcased an array of cutting-edge solutions, each aiming to redefine how we perceive and manage digital identity. From secured authentication solutions, and passkey implementations to decentralized identity platforms, the expo was a testament to the relentless innovation in the identity space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kim Cameron Award paved the way to grow my knowledge in identity space and also allowed me to connect with a community of identity professionals. And also enabled me to meet OpenID Foundation members and also get to know the different working groups in person. This further encourages me to actively participate in the Foundation’s work and contribute to different Open-Source/ R&amp;D initiatives in the identity space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelle-a-sellung/">Rachelle Sellung</a><br>Senior Scientist Researcher in the Identity Management Competence Team at Fraunhofer IAO</p>
<p>After winning the Kim Cameron Award this year, I had the honor to join and present my work at the EIC 2023 this year. It was a great opportunity to present my work on User Experience Best and Worst Practices for Digital Wallets. I was pleasantly surprised at how many people were interested in hearing my talk. I received an overwhelming amount of positive and constructive feedback. It was valuable to receive this quality feedback from such a wide range of experts in the field of identity. In addition, I had the opportunity to reconnect and build new connections in this space of identity.</p>
<p>From those connections, I am working with OIX in the Global Interoperability working group and will have the opportunity to present at their IdentityTrust Conference 2023- Building Trust in Identity Event on the 28th&nbsp;of September.&nbsp; In addition, I was able have some interesting and rewarding conversations with the Women in Identity group and am finding more ways to be more involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-sharif-341a2b37/">Amir Sharif</a><br>Researcher in the Security &amp; Trust Research Unit of the Cybersecurity Center of Fondazione Bruno Kessler</p>
<p>When I learned that I had been chosen to be awarded the prestigious Kim Cameron Award from the OpenID Foundation, I felt a mixture of gratitude, excitement, and humility. Although I never met Kim Cameron in person, his impact and influence in the area of digital identification were well-known. The honor of being associated with his name was genuinely beyond words.</p>
<p>My digital identity path began with a strong interest in identity management protocols, which led me to become immersed in its subtle nuances. Over the course of more than 5 years, my passion prompted me to investigate the finer points of identity protocols with a focus on OAuth and OpenID Connect Standards, honing in on the design and security analysis of these solutions.</p>
<p>Stepping into the world of European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) 2023, facilitated by the Kim Cameron Award, was a transformative experience. The event brings together some of the brightest minds and industry experts in the field of Digital Identity and Cybersecurity. Throughout the event, I had the opportunity to attend several thought-provoking sessions and participate in enlightening discussions. Engaging with the élite of digital identity, I witnessed the pivotal shift towards a user-centric approach, ripe for exponential growth under the stimuli arriving from different perspectives including those of initiatives and foundations, such as the Open Wallet Foundation and the Kantara initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my highlights was the session I presented with Giada Sciarretta and Francesco Antonio Marino about the “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5325/2">Past, Present, and Future of the Italian Digital Identity Ecosystem</a>”. It is the output of a fantastic collaboration between the Center for Cybersecurity of Fondazione Bruno Kessler – FBK and the Italian Government Printing Office and Mint.&nbsp; At the time of writing, we are working on the Italian Technical Specification for Verifiable Credential Issuance and Presentation in the context of the European Digital Identity Wallet.&nbsp; This is exciting and there is still much to do in this fascinating journey.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most essential effect of attending EIC is the ability to physically reach out to many like-minded persons outside of academia who are interested in the difficulties of security and privacy in IAM. It left me not only with a bounty of fresh insights, new relationships, and a renewed feeling of purpose but also inspired me to contribute even more to the development of digital identity. I am grateful to the OpenID Foundation for this fantastic opportunity and forward to working with the identity community.</p>
<p><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlieharrysmith/">Charlie Smith</a><br>Doctoral Student at the Oxford Internet Institute</p>
<p>Attending Identiverse has been hugely beneficial for my research. As a political philosopher studying digital identity, a vital part of the job involves ensuring that my theorising remains grounded in the practical reality of our industry. By far the best way to do this is attending events like Identiverse—but without the OIDF’s support I would never have been able to fly to Las Vegas from the UK for a conference. I am therefore deeply grateful to the Foundation for its generous funding and mentorship via the Kim Cameron Award. Without the OIDF I would simply not have been able to broaden my network beyond the European context as effectively. The Award has added massive value to my doctoral degree.</p>
<p>This year I met many experts I’d only ever interviewed virtually before, allowing me to put faces to names and form far more meaningful connections. This has already resulted in several useful collaborations that will massively benefit my research and generate public value. Additionally, the access that Award winners get as a result of their association with the OIDF has opened numerous new doors to me. I hope these connections will only deepen throughout my career. Finally, the educational content of the conference has been essential for remaining up to date on developing industry trends and expert knowledge. Overall, I would encourage any academic interested in identity to make use of this fabulous resource.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Foundation also thanks our conference partners, the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC)</a> and <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a>, as award recipients receive complimentary access to these important industry events as part of their award. Awardees will participate in Foundation events at the respective conferences as well as introduced to the identity domain experts and industry leaders at the conferences while being welcomed by our colleagues in other industry organizations.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2023-kim-cameron-award-experiences/">2023 OpenID Foundation Kim Cameron Award Recipients Share Their Experiences</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>In this byline Andrew looks at the rise of generative AI and the increase in the threat of phishing, making attacks almost undetectable. For Andrew, AI-based malware tools such as FraudGPT are generating sophisticated phishing campaigns. Instead of simply detecting phishing emails, businesses need to rethink security, with a focus on eliminating passwords. He believes that passwordless authentication, such as passkeys, offers better protection, making credentials invulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>FIDO study shows: passwords to be replaced by better alternatives in the next few years<br>A study conducted by the FIDO Alliance (Fast IDentity Online) and LastPass shows that passwords in companies will largely be replaced by secure alternatives in the next few years. According to the survey, most IT executives believe that by 2028, less than 25 percent of logins will be through passwords. Already, 95 percent of respondents are using passwordless alternatives such as passkeys to increase security. The majority of IT managers plan to manage passkeys via third-party password managers.</p>

<p>Email teams being challenged with high cart abandonment rates should push back — the real problem is not bad personalization or copy, but passwords. People are fed up with them. And their behavior reflects it, judging by the 2023 Online Authentication Barometer, a global study by the Fido Alliance, conducted by Sapio Research. U.S. consumers abandon a purchase and stop accessing an online service because they can’t remember their passwords 4.76 times per day on average, up from 3.71 in 2022 — a 28.30% increase.</p>

<p>In the fight against a growing number of text-, phone-, and email-based phishing scams, speakers at the FIDO Alliance’s Authenticate Conference in California this week made a case for passwordless security options like the passkey over the oft-hacked password. “Any enterprise that’s using passwords or legacy forms of MFA is taking a gamble they will eventually lose,” Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the industry group known as the FIDO Alliance, told attendees.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce the <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/integrations/storage/ceramic-example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">integration of Lit Protocol and Ceramic</a>, enabling developers to store encrypted data on ComposeDB. This integration allows developers to build applications that provide users with more control over their data and privacy.</p> What is Lit Protocol? <p>Lit Protocol is a decentralized key management system that allows users to encrypt their data and control who has access to it. Lit Protocol’s access control system gives users granular control over who can access and use their data.</p><p>Along with flexible access control features, Lit also offers tooling around <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Secure_multi-party_computation?ref=spark.litprotocol.com">multi-party computation (MPC)</a>. MPC enables secure reading and writing of data between blockchains and off-chain platforms, such as programmable signing that allows developers to build distributed serverless functions that have event listening capabilities to create specific triggers for executing programmatic signing, and much more.</p> Why integrate Lit Protocol and Ceramic Network? <p>The integration between Lit Protocol and Ceramic allows developers to build applications that provide users with more control over their data and privacy.</p><p>The Ceramic protocol is built on decentralized event streams, where user accounts (enabled by decentralized identifiers, or&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/protocol/accounts/decentralized-identifiers/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDs</a>) cryptographically sign data events and submit them to the network. These events are stored in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) using the IPLD protocol, and organized into readable streams. Each stream is flexible enough to store many types of content. Therefore, Ceramic is home to a diversity of different data use cases such as user profiles, posts, relations to other entities and more.</p><p>Due to Ceramic's open readability, any participating node can read from any stream in the network. Therefore, encrypting data using Lit Protocol and saving it on Ceramic is a common (and necessary) integration for many teams.</p> A Peek Under the Hood <p>Given Ceramic’s architecture, Lit Protocol’s access control capabilities allow developers to gate access to content based on highly flexible conditions. For instance, developers may want to allow their users the ability to grant read access to all addresses that hold a specific NFT or ERC20 asset. With Lit Protocol, developers allow their users to assign <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/access-control/intro?ref=blog.ceramic.network">access control conditions</a> that are associated with the encrypted object when generated. The Lit nodes confirm those conditions have been satisfied using the user’s wallet signature when they request access. This offers a seamless user flow for the end user, whereas (without Lit Protocol) users might otherwise be required to manually decrypt or re-encode their encrypted data for other users they want to grant access to.</p> How to Use Lit Protocol to Encrypt Messages and Save Them to Ceramic <p>To use Lit Protocol to encrypt messages and save them to Ceramic using ComposeDB, you can follow the tutorial <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/integrations/storage/ceramic-example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>. This tutorial uses a message board example application to show you how to create encrypted messages using Lit Protocol and save message instances to the Ceramic Network using ComposeDB.</p> In the tutorial, you’ll learn how to:   Create ComposeDB schemas and deploy those models on a local Ceramic node  Authenticate users on Ceramic to allow them to author their own documents  Encrypt data with Lit Protocol and write mutation queries to save the encrypted data to ComposeDB using GraphQL  Decrypt data using Lit Protocol based on specific access control logic   What do you need to get started? <p>As outlined in the <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/integrations/storage/ceramic-example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a>, the only dependencies you’ll need are:</p>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Chrome Extension</a>  Node v16   Want to Learn More about Building on Ceramic?  <br>Build an AI Chatbot on Ceramic <p>Build an AI-powered Chatbot and save message history to ComposeDB by following this&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Tutorial</a>.</p> How to Use and Store Composable Attestations with Ceramic and Ethereum Attestation Service <p>Walk through a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a> on how to generate attestations (using Ethereum Attestation Service) and store them on ComposeDB.</p> ComposeDB API Sandbox <p>Use the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB API Sandbox</a> to test example queries on a real dataset.</p> Create a Social App on ComposeDB <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/EthDenver2023Demo?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Social App ComposeDB Starter</a> will help you get started building your own social app.</p><p>Let us know what you think about our integration with Lit Protocol on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/ba4a098b06e3437082430c5217bf501f?pvs=21&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>!</p>

  <p>By Santiago Lyon, Head of Advocacy and Education, CAI</p><p>We are thrilled to announce that industry-leading camera manufacturer Leica is officially launching the new M11-P camera — the world’s first camera with Content Credentials built-in. </p><p>This is a significant milestone for the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) and the future of photojournalism: It will usher in a powerful new way for photojournalists and creatives to combat misinformation and bring authenticity to their work and consumers, while pioneering widespread adoption of Content Credentials.&nbsp; </p><p>With manipulated content and misinformation more on the rise than ever, trust in the digital ecosystem has never been more critical. We are entering a new era of creativity, where generative AI is expanding access to powerful new workflows and unleashing our most imaginative ideas. The Leica M11-P launch will advance the CAI’s goal of empowering photographers everywhere to attach Content Credentials to their images at the point of capture, creating a chain of authenticity from camera to cloud and enabling photographers to maintain a degree of control over their art, story and context.</p>

  <p>Leica has implemented the global <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> (C2PA) standard in the M11-P camera so that each image is captured with secure metadata. This means it carries information such as camera make and model, as well as content-specific information including who captured an image and when, and how they did so. Each image captured will receive a digital signature, and the authenticity of images can be easily verified by visiting <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/verify">contentcredentials.org/verify</a> or in the Leica FOTOS app.</p><p>This is a watershed moment for trust and transparency for photographers and creatives – its significance cannot be overstated. This is the realization of a vision the CAI and our members first set out four years ago, transforming principles of trust and provenance into consumer-ready technology. </p><p>With the integration of the CAI framework, Leica will help combat the pervasive issues mis/disinformation and preserve trust in digital content and sources. Further, with this integration, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/10/10/new-content-credentials-icon-transparency">recent announcements at MAX</a>, and the broad availability of our free <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/">open-source tools</a> powering them, Content Credentials are seeing accelerated adoption around the world, including among photojournalists, news outlets, creative professionals, everyday consumers, social media influencers, artists and innovators.</p><p>Adobe co-founded the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) in 2019 to help combat the threat of misinformation and help creators get credit for their work. Today the CAI is a coalition of nearly 2,000 members, including Leica Camera, AFP, the Associated Press, the BBC, Getty Images, Microsoft, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal and more, all working together to add a verifiable layer of transparency and trust to content online – via secure metadata called Content Credentials. </p><p>Between the tremendous momentum in attracting new members and the growing adoption of Content Credentials by leaders spanning multiple industries, the CAI is ensuring that technological innovations are built on ethical foundations.</p><p>Snapshot: How Content Credentials Works </p>  <p>Transparency at the point of capture: We believe the chain of authenticity is strongest at the moment a piece of media is created — being able to verify the circumstances of an image’s origin is the foundation for knowing whether to trust it.</p>  <p>Get credit for your photography work: Content Credentials enable photojournalists and creatives to assert credit for their work, ensuring that wherever one of their images goes, their identity travels indelibly with it.</p>  <p>Bring trust to your digital content with a digital nutrition label: Content Credentials are the digital nutrition label and most widely adopted industry standard for content of all kinds, and the foundation for increased trust and transparency online.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Leica’s M11-P camera will be available globally at all Leica Stores, the Leica Online Store and authorized dealers, starting today.

<p>With the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decentralized-identity-foundation-dif-hackathon-tickets-727930769527?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Hackathon</a> starting on October 26, DIF caught up with Toby Bolton, Founder of .zkdid™ who is looking to collaborate on his innovative use case for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and other DIF work items.&nbsp;</p><p>What is .zkdid?&nbsp;</p><p>.zkdid is an acronym for Zero Knowledge Decentralized Identity. It’s a Decentralized Domain Name System (dDNS) protocol intended to empower the public. It’s also a registered trademark, it’s the name of the project, intended as a mark-of-trust and is a prospective Web3 top-level domain (like .com).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose is to establish a “.zkdid” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Zero Knowledge</a> (ZK) decentralized identity protocol for Web3 that is compliant with government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) requirements.</p><p>Each address with the .zkdid extension is a unique identifier in the form of a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Non-Fungible Token</a> (NFT) which is resistant to duplication. The goal is to use these identifiers to create a ZK<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood?ref=blog.identity.foundation#:~:text=The%20term%20is%20used%20in,to%20an%20investment%20of%20resources."> Proof of personhood</a> registry and NFT-gated community that is<a href="https://members.delphidigital.io/learn/sybil-resistance?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Sybil resistant</a>. Sybil resistance mechanisms aim to ensure that each participant in a network has a unique and singular identity.</p><p>This creates the basis for a secure, publicly owned/governed, decentralized, zero-knowledge<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Domain Name System</a> (DNS).&nbsp;</p><p>How did the .zkdid initiative come into being, and why are you doing it?&nbsp;</p><p>First and foremost, I worry about the future of my daughters, and how these novel identity technologies could possibly erode human rights and privacy if not deployed with due diligence and care. So I wanted to find the solution to such problems. I’ve been aware for quite a while that identity is a great use case for blockchain. Then zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) became a hot topic. That’s when I got onto the .zkdid path.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea for .zkdid initially came from an online chat where we were discussing the<a href="https://ens.domains/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Ethereum Name Service</a> (ENS). The question I had was, “what is the top-level domain of Web3?”, which sparked quite a debate.&nbsp;</p><p>I believed the top-level domain for Web3 would likely be an identity protocol, and possibly even .zkdid.</p><p>The aim is to connect the public to an identity layer that is not centrally controlled. The details of this decentralized governance identity protocol are still being researched.&nbsp;</p><p>How will .zkdid be different?&nbsp;</p><p>There are quite a few blockchain name services. I wanted to improve on what I had found. ENS is likely the best known dDNS protocol but uses tokenomics for its governance and can be owned anonymously which in my opinion doesn’t work for a proof of personhood protocol. In my view I’m developing an alternative. What I’m building is also an alternative to other proof-of-personhood protocols in the market like<a href="https://worldcoin.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Worldcoin</a> and<a href="https://proofofhumanity.id/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Proof of Humanity</a>.</p><p>The point of .zkdid is to create a decentralized DNS layer, one that is publicly owned by a not for profit foundation, which does not rely on tokenomics that can manipulate leadership of the protocol. These are areas I saw in other protocols that I believe need improving.</p><p>With .zkdid, the identity is the token. Your .zkdid domain name will enable you to prove who you are in the Web3 digital domain without needing to reveal any personal information about yourself. Each person is one token. You are the token.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you see this coexisting with current Identity and DNS systems?</p><p>DNS (Domain Name System) is one of the most widely used internet protocols, most of us use it daily and it’s possible that one day .zkdid can connect the Identity industry to a publicly owned dDNS protocol.</p><p>When I registered .zkdid, I knew it was important that it was secured from every dDNS registrar. Once I registered the domain name, I submitted a Trademark application in the United Kingdom, which was promptly published.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.icann.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">ICANN</a> do not govern decentralized DNS domain names, so a strategy is needed to protect them. However, I understand ICANN are looking into blockchain technologies and it would be a pleasure to have them involved in the project. We are also inline to become a Web3 Domain Alliance (W3DA) member, it’s an important initiative that intends to act as a foundation to inhibit possible dDNS collisions. We need to bring people together. No one should be excluded, .zkdid is meant to be a public good after all.&nbsp;</p><p>What are the next steps for the project?&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, I’ve been collaborating with a <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/essif-train-by-fraunhofer-gesellschaft/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">team at the Fraunhofer Institute</a> that is looking to use the traditional DNS system to create a trust registry of all humans and IoT devices. My vision is to use dDNS and for the public to be issued a .zkdid identifier through the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/discover-eidas?ref=blog.identity.foundation">eIDAS</a> initiative. This means if you are a European citizen, your .zkdid identifier could be connected to your government issued identity.</p><p>This was not the initial objective but as things progressed I learned the only way to achieve our ambitious goal is to integrate with government initiatives like eIDAS.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve now managed to build a great team of enthusiastic developers to work with me on this concept during the<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decentralized-identity-foundation-dif-hackathon-tickets-727930769527?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> DIF Hackathon</a>. To work within the Hackathon rules this first step is likely going to take advantage of the Open Source<a href="https://iden3.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Iden3</a> toolkit. I’m going to suggest we use that, plus relevant DIF work items such as the Universal Resolver, BBS Signature Scheme, DIDComm and Sidetree Protocol. We need to focus on making it multi-chain and interoperable.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m really pleased that Polygon ID is one of the sponsors of the Hackathon, because it was the PolygonID/Iden3 wallet that was the original inspiration for this project. When I first encountered PolygonID I thought it was impressive, very abstract but really clever technology.</p><p>During the Hackathon we will develop this concept into an initial functioning prototype. If the people who join me for the Hackathon subsequently want to team up to form a .zkdid Working Group at DIF to develop the specification, that would be brilliant.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m looking for team members who are pro freedom and human rights, who understand the importance behind decentralized technologies, and have an optimistic and balanced outlook.&nbsp;</p><p>Why have you chosen DIF to host this initiative?&nbsp;</p><p>The opportunity came out of the blue. When I first joined the DIF I was introduced to Andor Kesselman, who chairs the Technical Steering Committee. Andor said “You’ve got a great vision, now let’s start from the beginning.” He asked me to strip down the concept to the basics needed to commence a DIF working group.&nbsp;</p><p>And stripping it back to the bare bones we find a zero-knowledge decentralized DNS system. I always intended .zkdid to be a global mark of trust and an open standard that works with any kind of wallet, identity network and protocol. Now I’m in the DIF, I’ve got an opportunity to be part of the process of defining the specification that may actually become a standard.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like I've been thrown out of the frying pan into the fire, which is a bit overwhelming but exactly what I needed!&nbsp;</p><p>What should people do if they are interested in getting involved?&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, please provide feedback on the idea by contacting Toby on Slack, or via email at <a href="mailto:id@zkdid.io">id@zkdid.io</a> .&nbsp;</p><p>The next step is to join forces with Toby to participate in the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decentralized-identity-foundation-dif-hackathon-tickets-727930769527?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Hackathon</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, please let Toby know if you are interested in working with him to establish a new .zkdid Working Group at DIF.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>Quantum computing &amp; technologies present unique challenges that are not addressed by classical computing standards.</p>



<p>The development of open standards for quantum technologies is crucial for ensuring the interoperability, security, and reliability of quantum computing systems and facilitating collaboration and innovation across the quantum computing ecosystem.</p>



<p>One of the key challenges in developing open standards for quantum technologies is that quantum computing fundamentally differs from classical computing. Quantum computing relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, which allow for the creation of superposition states and entanglement, enabling quantum computers to perform certain types of computations much faster than classical computers. However, this also means that quantum computing systems require different hardware, software, and communication protocols than classical computing systems.</p>



<p>To address these challenges, standards bodies should and are working to develop standards for quantum technologies. For example, the Quantum Industry Consortium and the Quantum Economic Development Consortium, are working to develop standards and best practices for the quantum industry. But are those standards ‘open’, or should they be?</p>



<p>In addition to developing standards for quantum computing, it is also important to develop open standards for other quantum technologies, such as quantum cryptography and quantum sensing. These technologies also present unique challenges that require new standards and best practices to ensure their reliability and security.</p>



<p>Overall, the development of open standards for quantum technologies is crucial for ensuring the growth and success of this exciting and rapidly evolving field, and will play a critical role in enabling the development and adoption of quantum technologies in a wide range of industries and applications.</p>

<p>Our recent partnership with the Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (<a href="https://cipesa.org/" title="">CIPESA</a>) offers a lens into the workings of an organisation that is taking proactive steps to strengthen their internal practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based in Uganda, CIPESA&nbsp; focuses on decision-making that facilitates the use of ICT in support of good governance, human rights and livelihoods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within the framework of our 6-month Matchbox partnership, CIPESA had three main priorities:</p>



 
 Strengthening their digital communications and documentation infrastructure through guidance on implementation of self-hosted tools that enable autonomy and ownership. 



 Support in platform implementation through guidance on user testing, roll-out and maintenance plans design. 



 Capacity building around responsible data management and organisational security. 
 



 What we discovered 



<p>Our assessment of CIPESA’s current landscape of tools revealed a diverse technological framework consisting in a mix of tools, from conventional email and word processing to collaborative platforms, incorporating a blend of cloud-based and localised storage.</p>



<p>We also looked at CIPESA’s security frameworks and practices, which encompass multifaceted strategies, realised through a mix of practices and tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIPESA are cognisant of research ethics and data handling and were interested in strengthening their <a href="https://responsibledata.io/" title="">Responsible Data Management</a> and data handling practices to further ensure protection of data subjects and sensitive data. They were also interested in strengthening the security of their websites, email, and social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing contextual risk assessments, self-hosted tools, and Responsible Data frameworks&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Recognising the importance of keeping internal communications private, we suggested a shift to a self hosted video conferencing tool (<a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/" title="">Big Blue Button</a>). This platform would also provide resilience against potential restrictions and avoid over-reliance on a third party platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To further streamline CIPESA’s communication with its networks, CIPESA also looked at the adoption of a tool that would foster tailored communications with its large network of stakeholders. One of the platforms we recommended was <a href="https://suitecrm.com/" title="">SuiteCRM</a>, which is open source and can be self-hosted, which aligns with CIPESA values. It also has core features that the organisation&nbsp; is looking for, including creating groups of key stakeholders and setting up consistent targeted communications with them through the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also recommended a thorough contextual risk assessment, to offer clarity on pressing security concerns and ensure that a consistent internal policy is adopted to mitigate these risks. This would also aid in the implementation of tools and practices that will strengthen internal security&nbsp; – such as the adoption of <a href="https://1password.com/" title="">1password</a> for password management.&nbsp;</p>



 Aligning data management with organisational values&nbsp; 



<p>CIPESA wanted to ensure alignment of data management practices with both organisational values and regional data protection regulations. Drawing from resources like The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD!</a> guide, we provided guidance about data storage duration, disposal methods, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIPESA’s work environment relies on various tools and platforms, from cloud based tools to physical files. Amidst this diversity of platforms, the importance of data responsibility –&nbsp; the principle that information collected and generated should be handled responsibly with care and include ownership of organizational data on platforms. This value highlights the importance of self-hosted platforms and also choosing platforms aligned with this principle.</p>



<p>Our assessment helped identify areas and recommended steps to enhance both efficiency and security. CIPESA’s approach, which involves a mix of password protection, two-factor authentication, and data encryption, stands out as a model for organisations looking to navigate the digital space safely.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“The Engine Room’s Matchbox program has been instrumental in helping us identify and address various questions regarding how we handle and manage the data we collect. It has also reaffirmed the need to enhance internal practices especially in an evershifting digital terrain and in a growing community of practice when it comes to the work that we do in advancing digital rights and governance in Africa”</p></blockquote>

 Part 2: Building the workflow and&nbsp;platform CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>In our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-open-recognition-to-map-real-world-skills-and-attributes-1c1109c1b871">previous post</a>, we outlined a different way to do recognition. It’s a way which democratises the means of credentialing, and values each human as a part of community networks. Go and read that first, if you haven’t&nbsp;already.</p> Context <p>The original plan for Part 2 of this series was to show a real-world example of completing the last three steps of a 10-step process,&nbsp;namely:</p>  Come up with the metadata for Open Badges based on your&nbsp;skills  Create badges using an online&nbsp;platform  Ask contacts to endorse your&nbsp;badges  <p>However, after several conversations with badging platforms, we’re still a little early for that. Although they have plans for adopting <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/03/16/verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-whats-changed/">v3 of the Open Badges standard</a>, most are not currently planning to use it in the way we’re discussing in this series of&nbsp;posts.</p> Workflow <p>We see a need for a platform that aids individuals in identifying their skills and attributes, supported by their networks and communities. Mapping these attributes against relevant skills taxonomies can make them visible and endorsable, turning them into a form of ‘currency’.</p><p>One of the people we spoke to asked how we would build the system we envisage. We’ve come up with the following workflow (v0.1) to show how that might work technically, and below that there are wireframes showing a basic user&nbsp;journey.</p><p>One important thing to note is that by creating a standardised workflow, even the most introverted person with the smallest network can still find value in the approach.</p><p>A default process, customisable for endorsements, can boost user confidence, as not all are comfortable seeking endorsements.</p> Platform <p>The basic wireframes below show the first part of the workflow and how the individual would get&nbsp;started.</p><p>(Note: in this example we’re providing basic wireframes for the simplest version of the workflow)</p> User onboarding <p>Users sign up, answer three questions, and provide contact details for feedback. Once done, the system emails the contacts for their&nbsp;input.</p> Feedback <p>Contacts are asked to answer three questions similar to those posed to the&nbsp;user.</p> Synthesised Results <p>Users review their results, synthesised by AI. They then map their attributes against skills taxonomies of their&nbsp;choice.</p> Request for Endorsement <p>The next step is for the user to choose which of their attributes they’d like to have endorsed. They can then personalise an endorsement request to their contacts.</p><p>The system then emails contacts again, asking if they’re willing to endorse those specific attributes.</p><p>If they consent, then they are asked which attributes they would like to&nbsp;endorse.</p><p>They can also optionally choose to provide written or multimedia evidence.</p> Verified Profile <p>Users complete their verified profile, which can include any evidence provided by their contacts.</p><p>This verified profile can be shared online and updated over time. This includes the attributes, endorsements, and evidence it contains.</p> Conclusion <p>The possibilities for this kind of approach are far-reaching, as it brings a human-centric approach to credentialing. As you can see by comparing the flowchart and the wireframes, although there are some reasonably-complex things happening behind the scenes, what is presented to the user is relatively simple and straightforward.</p><p>In this post, we’ve outlined the benefits to end users. But there are also benefits to endorsers (who could themselves earn a badges). Perhaps that’s the subject for another blog&nbsp;post…</p><p>We would like someone to build this workflow.

<p>The demand for recycled content and sustainable business practices continues to grow rapidly. Join us as we chat with Jeremy Douglas, Director of Partnerships at Delterra, to learn more about reducing plastic waste, creating enhanced waste streams, and utilizing standards to track plastics throughout the supply chain.</p> <p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p>     <p>Traceability and transparency are crucial in the global effort to address plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. Delterra is focusing on establishing traceability for recycled plastic from collection to sale. By ensuring accurate measurement and preventing double counting, traceability can boost confidence in using recycled materials and support brands in tracking the origin of recycled plastic in their products.</p>     <p>Consumer pressure and advocacy have played a significant role in driving change in the waste and recycling systems. This has pushed brands to take action and seek alternatives, such as using more recycled materials. With consumers and stakeholders informed, companies are motivated to improve their plastic footprints and adopt more sustainable practices.</p>     <p>A global plastics agreement is being negotiated among 175 countries to address plastic pollution effectively. The agreement aims to create a binding document or instrument to end plastic pollution, similar to the structure of the climate change agreement. Themes such as eliminating unnecessary plastics and considering the impact on the informal sector are being discussed.&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guests:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremydouglas/?originalSubdomain=ca">Follow Jeremy Douglas on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p>If you’re well-versed or new to Web3 and considering a valuable contribution, Elastos offers a unique opportunity. The project not only presents a novel approach to blockchain consensus but also provides strong financial incentives for participating as a validator. By coupling Bitcoin’s security, community governance, and a DAO Council’s integrity, Elastos has created a validator ecosystem ripe for efficiency and scalability. Here’s what you stand to gain by joining this innovative network as an Elastos Consensus BPOS Validator!</p><p>The Currency: ELA<br>$ELA is the universal asset within Elastos, underpinned by a deflationary model. The currency has a current circulating supply of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/elastos">21,364,394</a> ELA with an issuance cap set at 28,219,999 by 2108. ELA comes from the Elastos Mainchain, a blockchain merged mined by Bitcoin. The next issuance halving is due in December 2025, supporting an increased potential for earning more ELA now rather than later.</p><p></p><p>The Incentives for Elastos Consensus BPOS Validators<br>Becoming as a BPOS validator means working with Bitcoin miners to validate transactions on the Elastos Mainchain, with distinct advantages. A full step-by-step guide can be found <a href="https://elastos.dev/nodes/requirements/">here</a>.</p>  APY: Up to 27% APY without BPOS staking incentives program added (see below). Validator Calculator available &nbsp;<a href="https://elastos.info/bpos-validators-calculator/">here</a>.  Low Entry Barrier: A 2,000 ELA pledge and a $6/month node maintenance fee are all it takes to start.  Revenue: Active BPOS validators are directly rewarded with 25% of the block rewards.  Yield: Calculated on the staking amount and pledge time, favouring both new and existing validators.  Staking Rights: 36 nodes are randomly selected every 36 blocks, ensuring equal opportunities for all.  Rewards Distribution: Automatically handled by Elastos’ mainchain.  <p>“Setting it up according to the guide was quick and easy. I’m hosting it on a Contabo BOS at $6/month. It’s been running flawlessly since the beginning of BPOS. Rewards are distributed instantly, and on top of that, I regularly receive early rewards from the Elastos Foundation”. – <a href="https://twitter.com/iggispopis/status/1714224962729370068">Iggis Popis</a>, BPOS Validator</p><p>Staking Rights<br>In Elastos’ BPoS system, participants stake ELA tokens for periods of time using the Essentials Wallet and receive equity tokens to vote on validators. This allows stakers to also earn ELA rewards. Higher yields are found with nodes with fewer votes, and periodic re-voting is necessary once pledge times expire to continue earning rewards, helping revolve validator nodes. A full step-by-step guide can be found <a href="https://elastos.info/tutorial/bpos-staking-and-voting-guide/">here</a>.</p>  ELA Staking Duration: 10 to 1000 days.  Equity Tokens: One staked ELA = One equity token for voting.  Reward Calculation: Proportional to ELA amount and time.  Pledge Time: Fixed but extendable, within node expiration limits.  Real-time Adjustment: Benefits updated if pledge time extended.  Profit Sharing: Node owners 25%, Stakers 75%.  Special Nodes: 12 CR Council nodes are off-limits for voting.  Re-Voting: Required at the end of each pledge period.  <p>Special Staking Incentive Program<br>The Elastos Foundation (EF) has launched a <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/bpos-validator-incentive-program/">program</a> allocating 1 million ELA for staking on community nodes, designed to aid nodes in attaining the 80,000 staking rights required for activation. This initiative further distributes staking profits to stakers and validator nodes monthly, enhancing your potential earnings.</p><p>Staking Rewards Partnership.<br>Elastos has teamed up with <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/">Staking Rewards</a> to highlight the advantages of our consensus system.&nbsp;The Elastos Growth Team will be present at the <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/summit">Staking Summit</a> in Turkey on November 10th. They aim to connect with attendees and showcase the unique features of Elastos’ validator system, as well as the opportunities it offers for earning ELA. Other speakers at the event will include Justin Sun, Founder of <a href="https://tron.network/">Tron</a>, and Anton Bukov, Co-founder of <a href="https://app.1inch.io/">1inch</a>.</p><p></p><p>The Power of Elastic Consensus<br>So how does everything work and come together? Elastos employs a threefold consensus mechanism. A comprehensive technical overview can be found <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastic-consensus-technical-overview/">here</a>.</p>  Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuXPoW): Leverages Bitcoin’s existing computational power to secure the Elastos mainchain.  Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS): Allows stakeholders to lock ELA assets and gain voting rights, based on which BPoS nodes work with Bitcoin miners to validate transactions.  Proof of Integrity (PoI): An additional governance layer for validating sidechains, from identity to smart contract chains, administered by a community-elected council using ELA for voting and collateral.  <p></p><p>Pioneering Innovation<br>Five years since its launch, Elastos has made <a href="https://elastos-wiki.netlify.app/">remarkable strides</a> in:</p>  Identity Management: Through Decentralized Identifiers with Zero/Knowledge Proofs (DID).  Data Storage: Enabled by HIVE, integrating IPFS and personal cloud hosting.  Networking: via Ethereum-compatible Smart Chain and decentralised ‘Carrier’ data and messaging communications.  Security: Using Runtime for secure execution environments for decentralised applications.  <p>Partnerships include <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/elastos-and-tencent-cloud/">Tencent Cloud</a> and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/alibaba-cloud-partners-with-elastos-to-spur-adoption-of-open-source-tech/">Alibaba Cloud</a>, with ecosystem teams like <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/the-access-economy-decentralized-identity-digital-rights-and-ownership-in-the-age-of-web3/">Elacity</a> building a digital capsule marketplace for Web3 digital asset monetisation.</p><p>Become a Elastos Consensus BPOS Validator today!<br>The Elastos ecosystem offers not only consensus opportunities for validators and stakers but also possibilities beyond the Mainchain.

<p>Dear Mr. President<br>
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>We want to thank you for the profound votes and preparations for the comprehensive revision of the Federal Electronic Patient Dossier Act (EPDG) and for the opportunity to comment.</p>
<p>The board of the DIDAS association has discussed the proposals with its members as well as with other organizations and takes a position on them.</p>
<p>The association DIDAS welcomes many elements of the EPDG revision to address identified weaknesses, in particular the approaches for opt-out and secondary use of health data (provided the sustainable protection of privacy), the obligation of all service providers to participate, the use of the E-ID as a unique and full-fledged means of identification, the addressing of structured data and their semantic interoperability through open standards, better central coordination and control, the possibility of data exchange for health applications with patient consensus and the creation or use of a data room.</p>
<p>These measures will significantly contribute to improving our healthcare system, especially through better use of digitalization.</p>
<p>DIDAS also supports the statements of the Conference of Health Directors (GDK) with the proposal for central coordination and financing of the basic infrastructure as well as the Association Health Data Space Switzerland (GdS) with the proposals for renaming and expert systems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the present preliminary draft takes insufficient account of some important points. Further necessary improvements are discussed below.</p>
<p>As requested, you will find the detailed comments on relevant articles and sections in the enclosed response form.</p>
<p>We would be pleased if DIDAS and its members could continue to contribute to the process in a value-creating way. Thus, the present statement is to be regarded as a joint effort of all members of the DIDAS Association under the leadership of the Board and the following members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>«Leading from the emerging future»&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revision is primarily a backward-looking correction of previous weaknesses, just as the original EPDG focused primarily on the now widely criticized storage of PDF documents.</p>
<p>The question must rather be where the “medicine of the future” and thus our healthcare system should stand in 5, 10, and 15 years, and which decisions must be made today for a future-oriented system in order to enable a healthcare system under the premise of “high-value care” in an iterative and participatory manner – this in particular against the background of long-lasting legal adjustments and rapid developments in medicine and technology.</p>
<p>In this context, questions such as personalized medicine, pay-for-performance, better prevention instead of “repair”, balanced incentive and tariff systems, etc. arise. These future challenges require evidence-based decisions based on analyzable data. The digital basic infrastructure plays a central role in this.</p>
<p>The target image of this basic infrastructure to be achieved is to be formulated in a participatory manner with the involvement of civil society, patient organizations, industry, and research. Milestones are to be documented and communicated on a roadmap and regularly reviewed for their relevance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital health literacy</p>
<p>For the desired digital transformation of our healthcare system, pure (technical) digitization is not enough. All stakeholders – citizens and healthcare professionals – must be able to deal competently with both health-related and digital topics, regardless of the level of education.</p>
<p>The digital transformation of healthcare can therefore only be successful if, in addition to the technical solution, those involved are also “taken along” on the journey, for example with further training as part of accreditation (for healthcare professionals) or explanatory platforms (for citizens).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Person-centeredness</p>
<p>Health data is person-centered, and it fundamentally belongs to the individual (see also “health account,” GdS). The revised EPDG also takes too little account of person-centeredness. Thus, due to the unclear legal basis, many service providers still assume that they are the owners of their patients’ health data. Person-centeredness should also include the right to data portability, i.e. citizens can transfer, copy, and manage their health data without having to rely on a central system.</p>
<p>Service providers – especially primary care physicians – nevertheless have a responsible fiduciary role with regard to the health data of their “customers”.</p>
<p>In particular, person-centeredness enables process innovation for all “stakeholders” in the healthcare ecosystem. For example, inefficiencies created by expensive intermediary services can be eliminated where they do not create value for the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology Neutrality</p>
<p>Prof. Dr. C.A. Zehnder of ETH stated already in the 1980s “Hardware lives a few years, software about 10 years, data survives decades.” These different cycles must be taken into account in legislation.</p>
<p>It is imperative to avoid dependencies on current technologies. Rather, the law must allow for emerging future technologies and adopt methods that take into account the continuous evolution of the technological landscape.</p>
<p>This is especially true for the proposed solution of a central repository – the required goals of person-centric health data (e.g., for medication plans) can also be achieved in the future with decentralized, (e.g., wallet-based) solutions, e.g., taking into account the principles of Self Sovereign Identity (SSI). These solutions also offer very high security through integrated cryptographic processes (privacy-by-design).</p>
<p>The following graphic illustrates that the proposed revision envisages a transition from PDF documents to structured health data in central databases. However, the graphic also shows that wallet-based solutions for person-centric structured health data are emerging – all the more so as the planned new E-ID has already taken this path. It is to be expected that the various technological solutions will coexist with transition periods of several years.</p>
  
<p>In accordance with the hierarchy of norms under the rule of law, the “important” provisions are to be laid down in-laws – in a generally abstract manner. In the present case, basic technical questions on principles and paradigms are to be mentioned. Ordinances, on the other hand, are intended to supplement legal provisions or to implement and thus concretize them. In the present case, this means that forces subject to change, such as implementation issues in particular, should be regulated at the ordinance level with the necessary flexibility. Only in this way can the dynamics of medical and technological development be taken into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposal – the filing is to be regulated at the ordinance level. Openness and standards</p>
<p>The necessity of open standards as a prerequisite for the often-demanded semantic interoperability is now widely recognized and also taken into account in the revision proposals. In addition, a few concretizations are listed below.</p>
<p>With digitization, the explicit non-discrimination and technological neutrality of electronic health documentation and records, as well as their verifiability, are gaining in importance:</p>
<p>Electronic health documentation shall not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability or discriminated against solely on the basis of its electronic form, so long as it is verifiably authentic.<br>
The principle of technological neutrality must be upheld in the recognition and handling of electronic health documentation so that determinations and evaluations must be neutral with respect to the technology used.</p>
<p>Specifically, this means that open standards are needed not only for the health data itself but also for its verification.</p>
<p>Also in the interest of openness, transparency, and trust, efforts should be made to design the basic infrastructure according to open-source principles, among other things to support the following objectives:</p>
 
 Innovations 
 Continuous development 
 Interoperability 
 Security 
 General sustainability 
 
<p>This also reduces dependencies on providers and particular interests.</p>
<p>Proposal – Open standards are to be anchored in the law and a sustainable innovation ecosystem is to be created by means of open-source principles.</p>
<p>Health instead of patients</p>
<p>The term “patient” in the name of the EPD insufficiently expresses the objective of improving the healthcare system. Austria refers to the solution as “Electronic Health Record” (ELGA), while in the English-speaking world “Electronic Health Record” (EHR) is used. Also in the text, the term “patient” should be replaced by the term “citizen” or “individual” to reflect the intended health orientation (which also includes prevention). The revision provides an opportunity to replace the increasingly loaded term “EPD” with a more health-oriented term, for example “health dossier”.</p>
<p>Proposal – The term “patient” is to be replaced by the term “health” where possible under the aspect of a health data space.</p>
<p>Immediate measures until the revised law comes into force</p>
<p>If the current unsatisfactory situation is not addressed with coordinated immediate measures by 2028, confidence in a beneficial EPD solution will continue to decline. As a result, further non-interoperable and monopolized data silos will emerge.</p>
<p>In order to avoid such developments, all measures permissible and possible with the current legal basis must be exhausted in order to prepare and implement the improvements sought with the revision as early as possible. This concerns in particular the enabling of additional services and access through digital health applications.</p>
<p>Further implementation based on agile and LEAN principles is to be ensured, especially since the procedure of parallel legislation and technical validation successfully practiced for the e-ID to prevent further overregulation is a recipe for success in such complex undertakings. The planned, participatory steps should be communicated transparently by means of a roadmap. To this end, the necessary financial and human resources should be made available as part of the transitional funding, because these resources have a substantial positive leverage effect by creating the conditions for rapid implementation of beneficial use cases.</p>
<p>The expense of an information campaign should be questioned as long as the EPD generates little discernible benefit. These funds should rather be linked to clearly defined and monitored (benefit) goals in the form of concretely implemented use cases (e.g. GdS initiative). In order to counteract “dispersal”, annual focus topics are to be examined based on the roadmap (e.g. medication).</p>
<p>Motion – By the time the revised EPD law comes into force, all measures for benefits in the healthcare system in the form of implemented use cases should be exhausted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We thank you for your consideration of our concerns.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT: Schnorr signatures have been a long time coming, but now that <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1716919363729801494">they’re finally here</a>, they open up broad new cryptographic frontiers, including the improved privacy of signature aggregation and blind signatures, the improved power of threshold signatures and adapter signatures, and much more. This article explores some of those frontiers and also offers a simplified look at how Schnorr works.</p>



 What’s Sigs Got To Do With It? 

<blockquote>
  <p>I was introduced to prime numbers in the third grade, when I “discovered” them accidentally, and a great teacher encouraged me to explore them further. Conversely, I learned about finite fields between my Junior and Senior years of High School, when I was offered the chance at taking a college course over the summer and had to find something that didn’t depend on Calculus, which I hadn’t yet taken.</p>

  <p>I didn’t know it at the time, but I was delving into the mathematical foundations of two powerful signature systems: RSA and Schnorr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the  world of digital communication, a pressing question often arises: how can we trust and authenticate digital messages? The answer is to use digital signatures.</p>

<p>Digital signatures function similarly to a seal of authenticity on a physical document, but for digital content. They assure the recipient of the message’s integrity and the sender’s authenticity. There are many methods for signatures, with RSA and Schnorr being the best known. They mostly rely on public-key cryptography: a signer uses his private key for a signature, which can then be verified with a public key.</p>

 The Schnorr Legacy 

<blockquote>
  <p>I discovered RSA, which secures its signatures using prime numbers, in college. But it was when I later encountered Schnorr, built on finite fields, that I met the first cryptography that I truly fell in love with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claus-Peter Schnorr introduced Schnorr signatures in the early 1990s. They were not the first digital signature, but they had a strong mathematical foundation:&nbsp;they were provably secure under specific assumptions. They were invented later that other systems like RSA, but they provided a number of new benefits including:</p>

 
   Compactness —&nbsp;Schnorr signatures are small, even when there are multiple signers. 
   Signature Aggregation — Multiple signatures can be aggregated together and look exactly like a single signature. 
   Faster Verification — Because of their small size (and the fact that aggregating multisigs doesn’t increase that size), Schnorr signatures can be verified quickly. 
   Threshold Signatures — Multisignatures requiring a certain quorum of participants are possible. 
   Blind Signatures — Signatures can be made while hiding the content. 
   Adapter Signatures — Signatures can be hidden by other values. 
 

 Beyond the Fields We Know 

<blockquote>
  <p>Beyond all of their new benefits, I fell in love with Schnorr signatures because they were elegant. The aggregation of signatures was done with simple mathematical operations. You added two signatures together and they were aggregated! Or, you could subtract any signature from an aggregate sum! But perhaps I shouldn’t say “simple” mathematical operations: Schnorr signatures depend on finite field math.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of finite fields as domains where numbers play by a unique set of rules. Each field is constrained to only contain certain numbers, usually defined by the letter <code>p</code>. The field then defines basic mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication such that if the operands are within the finite field, then the result of an operation on those operands will also lie within the finite field.</p>

<p>As it happens, the elliptic curves used for most modern cryptography are defined over finite fields. The finite fields act as a modulo to the curve, ensuring that the results of all operations on the curve fall within the field.</p>

 
   Bitcoin’s <code>secp256k1</code> works within the bounds of:
     
       <code>[ p = 2^{256} - 2^{32} - 977 ]</code> 
     
   
   Curve25519, popular in key exchanges, operates around:
     
       <code>[ p = 2^{255} - 19 ]</code> 
     
   
 

 Schnorr like an Eagle 

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was working as CTO of Certicom, I contacted the holders of the Schnorr patent about licensing it, but they wanted impossible terms. I assume it was the same for others who tried to use the cryptography at the time.</p>

  <p>Those patent restrictions ultimately held back Schnorr signatures from broader acceptance until their expiration in 2008. Even afterward, there wasn’t a quick move to Schnorr, despite its advantages, because ECDSA was mature, while there wasn’t yet any good code for Schnorr. I sometimes wonder where we might be today if Bitcoin had mined its Genesis block four or five years after the expiration of the Schnorr patents, rather than a scant 11 months later.</p>

  <p>When I was working at Blockstream, following the expiration of the Schnorr patent, I pestered our engineers about Schnorr. I was happy to then be at the conference where the MuSig multiple-signature system was first rolled out, using Schnorr and a multi-stage signing system that addressed some of the challenges of the powerful signature technology. The security was quickly broken, but that was just a first step, before the release of next-generation Schnorr systems such as MuSig 2 and FROST.</p>

  <p>It’s taken a few decades, but due to their simplicity and robustness, we are at last in a future where Schnorr signatures are possible. We can at last implement the many possibilities that I couldn’t even imagine when I first met finite fields, in that summer class years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a new technology, Schnorr has pitfalls and “footguns” that even now might not be fully understood. They need to carefully reviewed before the technology can be safely used.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest challenges of Schnorr have included:</p>

 
   Naive Aggregation:
 Merging signatures without verification is risky. Combining known good signatures with an adversary’s signature can actually nullify a signature as a whole because of the additive nature of Schnorr signatures. Advanced measures can prevent such issues. 
   Replay Attacks:
 Without unique transaction data, a valid signature can be maliciously reused. The solution? Incorporate distinct transaction information within signatures. 
   Malleability:
 An adversary might slightly alter a good signature while maintaining its validity. Contemporary protocols ensure signatures are consistent and resistant to changes. 
 

<p>Today, two major solutions address the challenges of Schnorr signatures, allowing users to take advantage of their many features:</p>

 
   MuSig2: A scheme focusing on multi-signatures. It addresses the issue of naive aggregation by ensuring individual participants cannot manipulate the combined public key. It only requires two rounds of communication to be completed between the parties. However, it restricts itself to N-of-N signatures, disallowing threshold schemes (except perhaps in a variant that creates a Merkle tree of MuSigs). Major advantages includes accountability and  key generation being noninteractive. 
   FROST: A versatile Schnorr threshold signature strategy, allowing a quorum to sign without revealing which members did so, increasing privacy and efficiency. It however, requires the completion of three rounds of communication by the parties before use. Major advantages include the ability to use Shamir protocols for refreshing shares, repairing lost shares, and enrollment and disenrollment of participants. The <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/">Zcash Foundation implementation of FROST</a> has recently received a successful <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/10/23/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">security assessment</a>. Their <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/frost.html">Understanding FROST article</a> is also a nice, brief overview of the technology. 
 

 Schnorr in a Nutshell (8 Bits) 

<p>The following examples offer a layman’s explanation of Schnorr and its operations using an 8-bit model, which is to say an imaginary finite field that ranges from 0 to 255. This sort of finite field is easily managed by applying a modulo to all the operations. In this example, addition and subtraction operations would be finalized by applying “modulo 256”, ensuring that the result remains within the field.</p>

<p>Obviously, practical cryptographic applications work with much larger numbers, which helps to ensure their security, but these small numbers can make examples much easier to read and understand.</p>

 Generating Public Keys 

<p>For any signature, the first requirement is generating a public key from a secret private key. Here’s a simplified 8-bit example:</p>

 
   Private Key: Start with a private key, for example, Alice’s private key is <code>50</code>. 
   Constant: Multiply it by a constant number, say <code>5</code>. 
   Public Key: The result, (<code>50 x 5 = 250</code>), becomes Alice’s public key. 
 

<p>Seems straightforward, right? The catch is that the mathematical definitions of the actual finite fields and the operations used by Schnorr ensure that division is almost impossible: if someone only has the public key (<code>250</code>) and the constant (<code>5</code>), working backwards to figure out our private key is more challenging than the reverse because of this special math.</p>

<p>This difficulty to reverse is what makes this cryptography “asymmetric”, which is crucial for security. It’s like baking a cake; once you have the final product, it’s very difficult to determine the exact ingredients and their quantities.</p>

 Creating Signatures 

<p>Imagine Alice wants to send Bob a secure message. Here’s how she would do it using the Schnorr signature system:</p>

 
   Private Key: Alice has a secret number, which she never shares with anyone. Let’s say this number is <code>50</code>. 
   Message: Alice has a message. It could be anything, from a simple greeting to a bank transaction. In the digital world, this message can be represented as a number. 
   Random Figure: Alice picks a random number for each new message she wants to sign. Let’s say she picks <code>20</code> for this particular message. 
   Signature Calculation: She then uses her private key, the random number, and her message to do some special math, which creates a unique signature for that message. In our 8-bit example, this math might lead to a signature like <code>150</code>. This signature is unique to the message and Alice’s private key; even a small change in the message would produce a vastly different signature. 
   Sending: Alice sends her message and the signature (<code>150</code>) to Bob, but keeps her private key and random number secret. 
 

 Verifying Signatures 

<p>Now, let’s say Bob receives Alice’s message and the signature she produced. To be certain that it’s truly from Alice and hasn’t been tampered with, he needs to verify the signature:</p>

 
   Public Key: Everyone knows Alice’s public key (like a public email address). In our example, this is <code>250</code>. Alice would’ve previously derived this public key from her private key using some more special math and made it publicly available. 
   Verification: Using the signature Alice sent (<code>150</code>), her public key (<code>250</code>), and the original message, Bob does his own math. (Though a private key can’t be easily calculated from a public key, it is easy to determine that a signature matches a known public key using Schnorr’s special math.) If Bob’s calculations match the signature Alice sent, then he knows two things for sure: the message truly came from Alice (because she’s the only one with the private key that matches the public key that Bob tested against); and the message hasn’t been tampered with (because the signature matched perfectly). 
   Outcome: Since Bob’s math using the public key and the message matched Alice’s signature, he’s assured of the message’s legitimacy. 
 

<p>In a nutshell, Alice uses her private key to “stamp” a message, and Bob uses her public key to verify that “stamp.” The beauty of Schnorr signatures is that these calculations are simple (compared to other digital signature methods), yet remain secure, making them a favorite in many cryptographic applications.</p>

 Creating Sequential Multisigs 

<p>Imagine a scenario where endorsements need to be made in a particular order, much like a relay race where one athlete passes the baton to the next. This is a simple form of multisignature that any signature system is likely to support.</p>

 
   Initial Endorsement: Alice wants to sign a document, let’s say a declaration. She does her special math with her private key and the message to produce a signature, which for simplicity, we’ll say is <code>150</code>. 
   Subsequent Endorsement: Bob, having seen Alice’s endorsement, decides he wants to endorse her action. He takes Alice’s signed declaration and adds his signature to it. Bob’s endorsement, perhaps, produces a signature of <code>75</code>. 
   Sequential Result: Now, the document carries both signatures, <code>150</code> from Alice followed by <code>75</code> from Bob, indicating a clear sequence: first Alice, then Bob. 
 

 Creating Aggregate Multisigs 

<p>However, Schnorr signatures can be much more powerful than most traditional signature systems. They allow for aggregate signatures, where parties can sign in any order they want and jointly endorse a message.</p>

 
   Individual Signatures: Alice and Bob both want to co-sign a document. Alice, with her special math and private key, creates a signature, say <code>150</code>. Bob, independently, generates his signature, which might be <code>75</code>. 
   Aggregation: Using Schnorr’s unique properties, these two signatures can be combined. Instead of appending one after the other, Schnorr adds the two together, possibly producing a single value of <code>225</code>. 
   Aggregate Result: The document now has one composite signature, <code>225</code>. Anyone verifying this knows both Alice and Bob endorsed it, but there’s no distinction about who signed first. 
 

 Creating Threshold Signatures 

<p>In scenarios where a group decision is required, threshold signatures (or quorum signature aggregation) shines. It allows a subset of a larger group to sign a document, indicating a collective endorsement.</p>

 
   Group Dynamics: Imagine a council of five members. For some decisions, the endorsement of all members isn’t necessary. Instead, only a majority, say three members, is sufficient. 
   Individual Signatures: Three members, Alice, Bob, and Carol decide to endorse a statement. Their signatures might be <code>150</code>, <code>75</code>, and <code>30</code> respectively. 
   Aggregation: With Schnorr, these signatures can be aggregated into a single composite signature, possibly <code>255</code>. 
   Collective Result: This single signature, <code>255</code>, stands testament that a quorum of the council endorsed the statement. Verifiers don’t necessarily know which three members endorsed it, only that at least three did. 
 

 Advanced Schnorr Techniques 

<p>Because of the power of Schnorr, there are even more possibilities:</p>

 
   Blind Signatures:
Vital for preserving privacy. Bob wants Alice’s signature without revealing the message (let’s say <code>50</code>). By altering it slightly, like by adding <code>5</code>, he disguises it. Alice then signs this modified message (<code>55</code>), and Bob later extracts the initial signature. 
   Key Aggregation:
Combines multiple public keys into one. With Alice’s key at <code>250</code> and Bob’s at <code>5</code>, the combined key might be <code>255</code>. 
   Adapter Signatures:
This combines secret communication with validation. Alice holds a confidential number, say <code>20</code>. Bob communicates with her, and as she signs, she discloses her secret as part of the signature. 
 

<p>Even this just skims thes surface of possibilities. Further complexities include the use of hashes, commitments, challenges, and more complex threshold schemes.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Schnorr is an incredibly powerful toolbox. Techniques such as signature aggregation, collective multisigs, blind signatures, key aggregation, and adapter signatures demonstrate the flexibility of Schnorr while maintaining its ease of use and efficiency as well as the integrity and authenticity of the messages. The result is a wide variety of endorsement dynamics that will support many different use cases.</p>

<p>Now that MuSig and FROST are increasingly mature, these many dynamics and use cases, which have been waiting in the wings for more than 20 years, can finally be a reality.</p>

<p>I believe that it’s truly a cryptographic revolution, as important as many of the ones that have come before.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>You would have heard digital wallets mentioned almost every week, if not every day, over the past couple of years. They formed part of the discussion on this&nbsp;<a href="https://lnkd.in/eXsn7Pb2">International Panel</a>&nbsp;I participated in very early one morning last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As conversations build on each other and as we increasingly use banking apps, Apple Pay or Google Pay when shopping, you might ask yourself how hard can it be when I see how many apps I have on my smartphone? Right there, is a challenge around scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most phone apps have a 1:1 relationship with the job they do – an app for our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anz.co.nz/banking-with-anz/ways-to-bank/gomoney/">bank</a>, our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newworld.co.nz/app">supermarket,</a>&nbsp;our<a href="https://kiwiaccess.co.nz/">&nbsp;photo ID,</a><a href="https://covid19.govt.nz/testing-and-isolation/contact-tracing/nz-covid-tracer-app/">contact tracing</a>&nbsp;and so on. We don’t carry 50 wallets each with one physical credential in each of them. That’s why the digital equivalent seems a bit ridiculous! This cannot scale to deliver you a great consumer experience for a future where for many people, their interactions will be mostly digital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another challenge is around security, data protection and privacy. How secure is the binding between you and your smartphone and the apps and wallets contained within it? That starts with high quality digital identification but extends into managing situations like coercion, or how to nullify the features on the phone if it’s lost or stolen. These problems can be complex, expensive and time consuming to mitigate against, meaning that developing and operating a commercially viable universally trusted digital wallet will not be for the faint-hearted (global platforms excepted but with the related considerations they may bring).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consequently, alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daon.com/products/verifly/">specifically purposed</a>&nbsp;private sector wallets we may see the public sector in some jurisdictions<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/france-germany-launch-works-on-eu-digital-wallet-in-paris/">&nbsp;taking a role in aspects of their development</a>&nbsp;– be it interoperable open standards and code libraries or a completely built digital wallet – for its people. This&nbsp;<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/showcase/">demo</a>&nbsp;from global thought leaders the Province of British Columbia peeks into the possible future (you need to download the BC Wallet app from the App Store or Google Play and read the privacy notice and terms &amp; conditions).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an aside, Digital Identity NZ was amongst the first associate sponsors of the&nbsp;<a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, the only sponsor in this part of the world, to promote OWF’s outputs in Aotearoa for adoption as we travel the world. While not the only approach, the fact that the state often holds the authoritative identity data (e.g. date and place of birth, citizenship etc) and commercial viability of digital wallets could be a lower priority by considering it a public good, the state may be best placed to provision these high trust cryptographically protected attributes onto a smartphone’s private or public sector developed digital wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, it will have to be trusted by us and by relying parties to be useful across a wide range of online transactions transcending our daily lives. Of course to maintain trust and integrity, the system will have to be architected in a way that after the authoritative attributes are provisioned to the smartphone’s digital wallet, the issuer doesn’t see or know where they are used. So where the state is the issuer, its responsibility ends there except for the rare instances of revoking or restoring compromised attributes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might ask why you should care? You should care because in return for having determination over your personal data in a digital wallet on your smartphone you will have to use it thoughtfully.&nbsp;Since your smartphone’s digital wallet will hold the attributes and you decide when and to whom you release them, there will be very few parties to hold responsible if things go wrong.

<p>Before the Internet as we know it came into existence, there was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)</a>, a project funded by the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/">United States Department of Defense</a>. Conceived in the late 1960s, ARPANET was designed to provide a system for researchers and military personnel to share information easily. At this time, computing resources were expensive and siloed. Researchers often had to physically go to the machine’s location to perform computations. Therefore, a set of rules that allowed different types of computers to communicate was developed was initially developed called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Control_Protocol_(ARPANET)#Network_Control_Program">Network Control Protocol (NCP)</a>, later to be superseded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP protocol suite</a> in 1983. This was a key innovation for military and research institutions, as it demonstrated that a network of multiple, interconnected computers could effectively communicate, optimising resource utilisation and enhancing productivity. As technological advancements in networking continued beyond the early 80’s, various institutions and individuals worldwide played crucial roles in shaping the Internet’s development. Rong Chen’s experience provides an insightful perspective on this collaborative effort and the milestones that followed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>‘I worked as an intern with another person at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/">National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a>&nbsp;(NCSA) in 1987 at the&nbsp;<a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois</a> to implement data rendering algorithms on the SUN Workstations while the data came from two Cray Supercomputers a few hundred yards away. Two other fellow students worked on implementing the first TCP/IP ever for IBM PCs at the same time. It was planned to interconnect 6 supercomputers in 5 universities’ supercomputer centers in the US at the time of 1987. I had heard that the <a href="https://home.cern/">European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)</a> joined the scientific research network later. And Tim Berners-Lee worked at the CERN and invented the WWW web in 1989 on top of the network that we had built. <a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/mosaic">Mosaic</a> from NCSA came later in the early 1990s as the first useable internet browser product inspired by Tim’s work.‘ – Rong Chen, Elastos Founder</p>
<p>Less than a decade before the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp">Dot-Com Bubble</a> of the ’90s, Rong Chen’s 1987 internship at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) offers a fascinating glimpse into a crucial period into the transformative era of the internet. Rong’s work on optimising communication between computers designed for very different kinds of tasks laid the groundwork for interoperability across divergent systems. The standardisation later of TCP/IP for IBM PCs was a seminal step in mainstreaming internet access. This development set the stage for Tim Berners-Lee’s 1989 invention of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WWW/">World Wide Web</a>, which revolutionised data organisation, allowing pages from different server locations to be linked together and explored in one universal environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The foundational networking by Rong Chen and colleagues enabled subsequent developments like the Mosaic browser, a user-friendly platform that evolved the Internet’s reach from academic and military circles into consumer households. But Mosaic was just the start; it inspired the creation of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Netscape-Communications-Corp">Netscape</a> in 1994, one of the first commercial web browsers. Netscape’s success demonstrated the internet’s economic potential and spurred the “browser wars,” such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer">Microsoft’s Internet Explorer</a> which was instrumental in embedding the Internet into the fabric of everyday life, driving global markets and commercial opportunities. Being inside the exponential growth phase of a company like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> at this time tells an exciting story full of innovative milestones, filled with lessons and warnings in architectural principles.</p>
<p>‘I worked at Microsoft from June 1992 to April 2000. I was with the multimedia framework team for 6 months, Then joined the multimedia operating system team around the end of 1992. The multimedia OS team merged with the MS Research OS team in 1993. The Research OS became the Interactive TV set-top-box OS in 1994, and became part of the Advanced Consumer Technology Division’. – Rong Chen</p>
<p>At its core, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">Operating System</a> manages hardware resources, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> and memory, to maximise the utility of the physical hardware. However, it also manages internet connectivity for external communication and data exchange, disk storage for data integrity and efficient retrieval, and identity management for authentication and system security. These functionalities are integrated, not isolated. A failure or inefficiency in one could have a domino effect across the system, underscoring the essential role of the OS in harmonising hardware and software.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Early advancements in OS design have been catalysts for innovations defining subsequent generations of internet technologies. In 1995, a few months before Microsoft pivoted away from private Internet technologies, Rong Chen joined the Internet Explorer team as its 10th member. Microsoft’s embrace of open internet standards wasn’t just a policy shift; it recognised an industry trend favouring open ecosystems over exclusive standards for widespread adoption. Rong Chen and teams work on OS resource management, connectivity, and security—across different contexts from multimedia frameworks to specialised consumer technologies—put Microsoft in a position to innovate rapidly. But they were not confined to one niche; they were exposed to a cross-pollination of ideas. This made them a hub of innovation.</p>
<p>Rong’s passion would see him transition to the OLE Automation team, which simplified the integration of different software components, such as embedding a Microsoft Excel graph into a Microsoft Word document. This technology formed half of the programming paradigm architecture that all Microsoft projects would subsequently have to follow, shaping the foundational architecture of Microsoft’s OS software. The other half of the Microsoft programming paradigm architecture was the OLE “New Technology” team, providing the essential framework to enable efficient communication within Windows OS. These two Microsoft teams merged to form the COM Core team, which became essential in developing early versions of <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/">.NET</a>—a framework setting the stage for future Windows versions and enabling various application types.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, a pivotal moment arose when Microsoft decided to shut down the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/component-object-model--com--portal">COM</a> Core team and narrow their focus and invest in one particular software development approach. Rong disagreed with this single-track focus. He believed that both should co-exist and be developed in parallel, as each has its unique advantages and use cases. His rationale also included security considerations; specifically&nbsp;arguing that the OS should ensure a secure environment to protect user data from third-party apps.</p>
<p>“Due to the fact that Microsoft decided to dissolve the COM Core (C/C++) team and embrace only the C# intermediate bytecode framework, I believed that both should be supported and working in parallel. 3rd-party apps must be sandboxed in their own computing execution environment so that they cannot abuse the 1st-party user’s data, the operating system, as the 2nd party, is responsible for providing such a secure computing environment. So I resigned in April 2000 to build my own C++ version network operating system <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a>.” – Rong Chen</p>
<p>What Rong articulated around 2000 aligned closely with what we now recognise as the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a>. His move from Microsoft to found <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a>, a Network OS platform, emphasises the catalytic power of divergent visions for spawning new initiatives. But divergent visions don’t emerge in isolation; they often stem from user demands for new capabilities. In the case of Microsoft and similar entities, a centralised structure, once established, became the path of least resistance for subsequent advancements. This approach enabled effective commercialisation during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> era, regardless of inherent limitations. Economies of scale in data centres and cloud services not only attracted more users but also contributed to the emergence and increasing value of platforms like Facebook and Google.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, such architecture generated a growth feedback loop but also increased critical setbacks. Systems like identity management and social media that initially fuel growth also introduce security vulnerabilities, censorship issues, and biases. The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and complex AI algorithms intensify these vulnerabilities, expanding the number of avenues for potential attacks. This segues naturally into the principles Rong advocated, fostering a new internet or network OS cycle that safeguards first-party user data from third-party abuse.</p>
<p>In Part 2, we’ll explore Elastos in-depth, the vision that prompted Rong to leave Microsoft. This decentralised network OS introduces a paradigm shift in internet ownership, addressing current Web 2.0 limitations and forming the foundation for a third-generation web, or Web3. These principles find their expression in the Elastos SmartWeb concept, which encompasses sandboxing, peer-to-peer communication between these sandboxes, and the trust-based, decentralised features intrinsic to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a> technology.</p>

 Digital identity application developed by Elia Group and Energy Web, which will support interactions between flexible assets and the grid, adopted as a new project by OpenWallet Foundation <p>Together, Elia Group and Energy Web have developed an application which can be seamlessly integrated into digital wallets, making it easily adoptable by a wide range of companies</p><p>Brussels, Berlin, Zug, Switzerland — October 23, 2023 — The OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) has officially adopted a digital identity application which was developed by Elia Group and Energy Web as a new project. The application, which can be used to securely transfer identity information between different parties (including details about their flexible assets), can be easily integrated into digital wallet technology. Digital wallets are set to become commonplace; indeed, the European Union aims to provide all its citizens with access to a digital ID solution by&nbsp;2030.</p><p>Flexible consumption demands secure identification<br>Our energy systems are becoming increasingly decentralised, driven by the rise in renewable energy sources and electrical assets. Flexible assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles will enable consumers to adapt their energy use in line with the needs of the system: consumers will be able to charge these when affordable green electricity is available, store it for later use, and (in the case of electric vehicles and home batteries) feed it back into the grid when needed. In so doing, consumers will help to keep the grid in balance and will support the integration of renewable energy into the system, so accelerating the energy transition.</p><p>Secure and efficient methods will be required to safely integrate electrical assets into the system and allow them to interact with the grid in a trusted manner. Extensive information exchange will need to take place, with data relating to personal details, technical specifications, contracts and charging tariffs being swapped between individuals, assets, and companies. Digital wallets, which are on the verge of becoming commonplace across Europe, are expected to be key enablers of this data exchange.</p><p>Elia Group and Energy Web have been collaborating on projects related to the integration of electrical assets into electricity systems for a number of&nbsp;years.</p><p>A digital wallet for every citizen<br>In line with its digital goals for Europe, the European Commission is working towards ensuring that all of its citizens will be able to use a personal digital wallet. One technology that can facilitate the design of these digital wallets is self-sovereign identity (SSI), a highly secure approach that enables identity-related information to be safely verified and exchanged between different parties.</p><p>SSI systems typically involve three core&nbsp;roles:</p>  the holder, who manages data related to their identity by storing it in their digital&nbsp;wallet;  the issuer, who is responsible for issuing the holder with identity-related data, often in the form of ‘verifiable credentials’;  the verifier, or party which requires access to identity-related data.  <p>Recognising the potential power of SSI, Elia Group and Energy Web began collaborating on the design of a digital identity application based on a pre-existing specification: the verifiable credential application programming interface (VC API) specification. Their software enables signed identity documents (stored on digital wallets as verifiable credentials) to be exchanged between an individual’s digital wallet and a third party. Elia Group and Energy Web chose to design their application based on a pre-existing specification that is familiar to a majority of companies. This means their solution can be easily integrated into a wide range of existing IT frameworks as companies design different digital wallets. Elia Group and Energy Web’s aim is to encourage energy companies, particularly small- and medium-sized energy companies, to adopt&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>“To ensure network security and stability, the integration of renewable energy sources into our energy systems will require household and industrial flexibility to be activated. SSI will be an important tool for creating a registry of decentralised and flexible assets that will allow us to monitor the state of the network and steer these decentralised assets.” Kris Laermans, Innovation at Elia&nbsp;Group</blockquote><p>OWF adopts Elia Group and Energy Web’s innovative solution as a new project<br>Once the application was ready, Elia Group and EnergyWeb approached OWF, an organisation which promotes the implementation and use of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet technology. The OWF then adopted the application as an OWF project, making it the fourth time such a solution has been accepted by the organisation since its formation in February 2023. This will help the application to be widely used by companies as they design digital&nbsp;wallets.</p><blockquote>“This collaborative effort between Elia Group, Energy Web, and the OpenWallet Foundation represents a significant step toward revolutionising the digital wallet landscape. By officially accepting this project, OWF is empowering the future of secure and interoperable digital wallets. Together, we’re advancing technology that will not only benefit the energy sector but also drive innovation beyond its boundaries, setting the stage for a more interconnected and secure digital world.” John Henderson, Senior Solution Architect at Energy&nbsp;Web</blockquote><p>GitHub documentation, which includes the code for the project, can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/vc-api-owf">here</a>.</p><p>Elia Group<br>Elia Group is an international energy company that comprises two transmission system operators.

             <p>Products in the construction sector have very specific and intricate characteristics. It is a sector that is too large, with information that is too fragmented and, above all, with little process digitalisation. But this is about to change, thanks to the first official GS1 document on Construction.</p>

<p>It is a document that results from the work done by the GTIN Management Rules under the supervision of the Swedish GS1 User Group Construction and the GS1 GSMP. A tool that simplifies the language and makes this topic more easily understandable for the community, through specific examples for the construction sector, under the GTIN Management Standard.</p>

<p>The GTIN Management Guideline for Construction Products is designed to help industry make consistent decisions on the unique identification of construction products in open supply chains and comply with the General GTIN Management Standard. In general, costs are minimised when all stakeholders throughout the life cycle of a product adhere to the GTIN Management Standard. Furthermore, this could simplify CO2 footprint calculations, trace products and their content to simplify the circular economy, reuse, recovery as well as compliance with different green building certification schemes.</p>

<p>The OpenID Connect Working Group recommends the approval of Errata corrections to the following specifications:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0-33.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>&nbsp;– Defines the core OpenID Connect functionality: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of Claims to communicate information about the End-User 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0-36.html">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</a>&nbsp;– Defines how Relying Parties dynamically discover information about OpenID Providers 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0-38.html">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</a>&nbsp;– Defines how Relying Parties dynamically register with OpenID Providers

<p>An Errata version of a specification incorporates corrections identified after the Final Specification was published. This would be the second set of errata corrections for Core, Discovery, and Dynamic Client Registration and the first Back-Channel Logout. This note starts the 45 day public review period for the specification drafts in accordance with the OpenID Foundation IPR policies and procedures. This review period will end on Tuesday, December 5, 2023. Unless issues are identified during the review that the working group believes must be addressed by revising the drafts, this review period will be followed by a seven day voting period during which OpenID Foundation members will vote on whether to approve these drafts as OpenID Errata Specifications. For the convenience of members who have completed their reviews by then, voting will actually open a week early on Wednesday, November 29, 2023, with the voting period still ending on Wednesday, December 13, 2023.

<p>A new working group has been accepted by the OpenID Foundation (OIDF) <a href="https://openid.net/specs-council/">Specs Council</a> that will focus on increasing interoperability of authorization systems. The new working group, called&nbsp; Authorization Exchange (AuthZEN), resulted from a series of conversations at the two most recent Identiverse conferences. After this year’s event, it was recognized that there was considerable interest in authorization as a topic, but that several constraints existed that were limiting widespread adoption of industry best practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AuthZEN will focus on specific areas of interoperability by documenting common authorization patterns, define standard mechanisms, protocols and formats for communication between authorization components, and recommend best practices for developing secure applications.</p>
<p>AuthZEN will hold weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 9am PT via Zoom with the following link: <a href="https://zoom.us/j/92150123981?pwd=YnhuSXNxU2w4Z3VGc3lrUjRNSTBUZz09">https://zoom.us/j/92150123981?pwd=YnhuSXNxU2w4Z3VGc3lrUjRNSTBUZz09</a>. The first AuthZEN Working Group meeting will be Tuesday, October 24, 2023. Co-chairs for the working group will be confirmed at the first meeting.</p>
<p>Those new to the OpenID Foundation and interested in participating in the AuthZEN WG, will need to complete a <a href="https://openid.net/intellectual-property/openid-foundation-contribution-agreements/">Contribution Agreement</a>.

 Background: Co-leadership 



<p>At the end of this year, The Engine Room’s Executive Director, Julia Keseru, will be leaving after being at the organisation for the last eight years. The Engine Room’s Board of Directors is excited to announce that going forward The Engine Room will formally adopt a model of co-leadership based on the learnings and work of the current leadership team.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a title="">Read letters from the board and from Julia </a>  



 <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/learning-from-co-leadership/" title="">Read more about The Engine Room’s experience with co-leadership</a>. 
 



<p>The Engine Room is a non-profit organisation with a distributed global team of experienced and committed activists, researchers, technologists and community organisers. Working alongside frontline organisations, we use the power of technology, data and research to advance our vision. We build evidence, strengthen capacity, and connect movements.&nbsp; Learn more about us and our work at <a href="http://www.theengineroom.org" title="">theengineroom.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-leadership looks different for every leader and every organisation. While the norm is still the single-leader model — whether in a corporate setting or small local NGOs — we believe that for The Engine Room, a shared-leadership approach can be more responsive to context, leverage the skills and capacities of individuals, and result in a more resilient organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a formal process, The Engine Room’s Board of Directors has offered one of the co-ED positions to Paola Mosso, a Deputy Director at TER. Paola has been with The Engine Room for eight years. She is embedded in various local and global activist communities and has deep expertise in digital ecosystems, online infrastructures, emerging and justice-focused technologies and feminist approaches to digital resilience. She brings a journalistic eye to how we talk about our work and is an integrator of approaches when it comes to creating local change. She is deeply committed to the co-leadership model and championed its implementation at TER.</p>



 Role Description 



<p>The Engine Room is soliciting applications for a Co-Executive Director. If you apply, we will want to engage with you as a person and hear your vision as it connects to our mission and our defining measures of success. For us this is more important than a list of characteristics and skills. In addition to our core mission and current work, a few key issues are important to our future:</p>



 
 The intersection of research and social justice is important to us. TER is looking to shift its approach to research so that it is tied more closely to its community work and honouring a strong local point of view.&nbsp; 



 Our latest approach to fundraising is working for us. We are committed to balancing project-specific, fee-for-service funds and grants, program funding, and unrestricted support for the organisation. 



 It is&nbsp; fundamentally important for us to align organisational development with shared leadership, and to document&nbsp; and share the learning that comes with this approach, for both ourselves and our partners.&nbsp; 
 



<p>To grow and thrive, it is critical that the new co-ED possess these qualities:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Brings academic-level research skills, and writes and thinks beyond disciplinary silos. 



 Experience and connections for business development, and capacity for fundraising. 



 Defining fields of interest and experience, such as&nbsp; environmental justice or emerging technologies. Relevant experience can be as a social activist, writer, researcher, campaigner, or networker in the given area. 



 Experience in any capacity with social justice and community building in the majority world. 



 Experience working with or for US-based nonprofits. 
 



<p>At The Engine Room, we prioritise care, well-being, flexible collaboration and clear communication. We look for colleagues who bring:</p>



 
 A constructive and opportunistic approach to confronting challenges and building strategies for the future. 



 A commitment to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C17CtaYtoLbdBg3MUFBC5QEc4KtYN3EqsZTbl13WG0I/edit" title="">our values</a> of making space, thinking critically and acting intentionally, embracing complexity, and holding everyone high. 



 A readiness to experiment, especially as we navigate journeys of shared leadership, and adapting the ways our teams collaborate and define areas of interest. 
 



 Please apply via <a href="https://engineroom.hrpartner.io/jobs/co-executive-director-qjjam" title="">this application form</a> (incl. CV and cover letter). Applications close 28 November 2023, midnight EST

<p>A letter from The Engine Room’s Board, and a message from our Executive Director, Julia </p>



 



<p>Letter from the TER Board </p>



<p>October 18, 2023</p>



<p>Dear Friends, Partners, and Supporters of The Engine Room,</p>



<p>Today we are announcing that Julia Keseru is leaving The Engine Room at the end of this year. We are deeply grateful to Julia for the work she has done and the legacy she built during her tenure. With Julia’s leadership The Engine Room expanded its services and support portfolio, attracted diverse funding and partnerships, and deepened its impact in multiple regions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julia joined the team in 2015 and has been our Executive Director since 2018. You can read more about the reasons for her transition and what she is going to do next in her letter below. We thank Julia for her passion and investment that helped The Engine Room grow into what it is today, and we wish her the best in her future endeavours. While she will be greatly missed, we are eager to see what she does next!</p>



<p>Moving forward, we are excited to announce that TER will formally adopt a model of co-leadership based on the learnings and work of the current leadership team, who have cultivated a shared leadership approach since Julia’s health crisis two years ago. This started when we brought in Gillian Williams as our Interim Executive Director during Julia’s medical leave. As Julia eased back into work, Gillian and Julia developed a model for sharing leadership. Together with co-Deputy Directors Paola Mosso and Laura Guzmán, they formed a committed, diverse, thoughtful senior leadership team who dug deep into feminist and shared leadership. They’ve written about it in a recent <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/learning-from-co-leadership/" title="">blog</a>.</p>



<p>We have spent time reflecting on co-leadership and the future of the field, and engaged in developing the core tenets of what we are looking for in leadership for the organisation. Over the summer we created a process of candidate recruitment, interviewing, and selection. We were excited when Paola expressed interest in co-leading The Engine Room, and she formally interviewed with us through this process. We are pleased to announce that we have selected her as one of the two co-Executive Directors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paola has been with The Engine Room for eight years. She is embedded in various local and global activist communities and has deep expertise in digital ecosystems, online infrastructures, emerging technologies and justice-focused technologies. Please join us in congratulating her for this new role and wishing her the best!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we are also announcing our formal search for the co-Executive Director. You can learn more about it in the <a title="">posting here</a>. We’re excited about this search, and look forward to hearing from all of you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Best regards,</p>



<p>Ivan Sigal, Chair <br>Elizabeth Lindsey <br>Maria Baron<br>Elizabeth Eagen<br>Isabela Fernandes</p>



 



<p>Message from our ED, Julia </p>



<p>Eight years ago I joined a team that I admired from afar but didn’t know deeply – the one thing I was certain of was that The Engine Room was doing things very differently than others. Under Alix Dunn’s visionary and compassionate leadership, I found myself in a completely distributed global team that was functional and fun to be a part of. From the first moment I knew that this was going to be a long-term relationship and that I came across something rare and magical: a team that makes me motivated and happy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a few years, I found myself at the&nbsp; wheel of the same team. Leading an organisation like TER was a dream come true for me. And little did I know how transformative the past five years were going to be.</p>



<p>Two years into my tenure the pandemic hit and while The Engine Room weathered the storm of the global health crisis, it was not without scars – my own personal ones included. My daughter was only one when I became ED and I learned the hard way how difficult it is to be an involved parent and a responsible leader at the same time. Then two years ago I was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and had to step out of the work to go through a series of invasive treatments and surgeries. I am happy to report that my health is in great shape right now, but the past two years have dramatically changed my perspective on life.</p>



<p>Most importantly, I realised that I care deeply about how people exist in the world as physical entities – what our true bodily boundaries are, how we can meaningfully coexist with each other in ways that uphold our dignity, and how we create systems that support autonomy and integrity. As I dove deeper into corporeal philosophy, bioethics, bodily integrity and cyberfeminism, I developed a tremendous appetite to learn new things, venture into new arenas and experiment with new ideas and ways of being and working. I also learned that I have meaningful things to say about how our bodies exist in a digital era – things that significantly build on The Engine Room’s legacy but that might go beyond its mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this period I also fully comprehended that time is precious and our existence on this planet is very short – which led me to my decision to transition out of The Engine Room by the end of the year, and pursue my dreams in different avenues. I feel incredibly proud of the things we have achieved in the past decade, bittersweet about saying goodbye to this team, and massively inspired by the potential and resilience of The Engine Room as an institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while I know I contributed to that potential in significant ways, I am also deeply aware that individuals alone can never make long-lasting change. The Engine Room is a rare gem because of the collaboration, dedication and diverse viewpoints that make up our DNA – thinking in communities and ecosystems is ingrained in our work and makes us who we are today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I consider myself extremely lucky to have been able to work with the smart, sweet and thoughtful individuals who made up The Engine Room and I owe special thanks to Alix, Anneke, Zara, Laura, Paola and Gillian for their brilliance, comradery, compassion, ethics and comedic timing. I found tremendous intellectual and emotional inspiration in these women and I wish every leader had the opportunity to share the joys and burdens of leadership with such partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I feel calm, proud and relieved to be able to leave the organisation in the fantastic hands of Paola and her co-leader to come. Continuing the co-leadership model is something I believe is right for TER and for the field.&nbsp; Paola and I joined The Engine Room almost the same time and we worked together in many different variations. We supported organisations with their tech platforms, designed myriad projects together and raised funds successfully. We organised events and facilitated conversations and co-wrote proposals, strategies and hundreds of other documents. Most importantly, we spent quality time together in random Airbnbs, airports and trains, talking and talking and talking endlessly about the world we want to live in, the work that needs to happen to get there, and all the things in life that motivate us to get up each day with passion and diligence.</p>



<p>In the past eight years I got to know Paola as a thoughtful, creative, value-driven and incredibly visionary person, someone whose thinking is both inspiring and grounding in my own work. I am beyond excited to see where she and the team are going next, and routing for their success all along the way.</p>



<p>And what will I do next? Like I said before, I am in an experimental mode and very much enjoying it. Next year I will dedicate my time to pursue the DataBody Integrity – my research oriented fellowship at the Mozilla Foundation that allows me to dig deeper into the politics of bodies in the digital era. Besides that, I am trying to support more organisations in my home country, Hungary, flex my coaching muscles, and grab every opportunity to have fun with my family and explore the world. When we get closer I’ll share more about my work! </p>

 In the midst of the city of Vancouver, a company stands, unwavering and bold. Lions Gate Digital. The sun rises, casting a golden light on the future they aim to shape. They have a prospectus. It’s not just any piece of paper. It’s a promise. A commitment. $2.2 million USD from 10,000 shares. Tokenized. A Security Token Offering (STO). Each share a beacon for what’s coming.

<p>In the midst of the city of Vancouver, a company stands, unwavering and bold. Lions Gate Digital. The sun rises, casting a golden light on the future they aim to shape. They have a <a href="https://lionsgate.io/prospectus/">prospectus</a>. It’s not just any piece of paper. It’s a promise. A commitment. $2.2 million USD from 10,000 shares. Tokenized. A Security Token Offering (STO). Each share a beacon for what’s coming.</p>



<p>The landscape of the digital world is vast, sometimes treacherous. Yet, this company does not waver. They’ve seen the horizon, the potential of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). It’s the future, and they aim to harness it. An army is forming, not of soldiers, but of believers. Believers in a decentralized world. The Lions Gate Digital Army.</p>



<p>Self-sovereign. The word resonates. It speaks of independence, of control. In a world overflowing with data, with information, one’s identity is paramount. And to control it, to truly own it, is power.</p>



<p>The enlistment is open. To join is to believe. To see the potential, the vision. The company seeks pioneers, adventurers. Those willing to embark on this digital journey. For they know the path won’t always be easy, but it will be worth it.</p>



<p>With the dawn, there’s hope. The company’s vision, their mission, is clear. They’re not merely introducing a STO. They’re inviting the world to see what they see, to dream what they dream.</p>



<p>In the end, it’s more than just an investment. It’s a movement. A call to arms in a digital age. The Lions Gate Digital Army. The future is theirs to shape, and they’re inviting all to join.</p>



<p>To the brave, to the visionaries: the prospectus is ready. The future awaits.</p>

 Insights into WAO’s coaching techniques for effective presentations and workshops <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of our work is collaborating with organisations that are passionate about making a positive impact in the world. Earlier this year, we had the opportunity to work with Change.org to support them with workshop design and presentation development. In this post we’ll share some of the techniques we used to help, so you can use them in your organisation, too!</p>change.org logo<p><a href="https://change.org">Change.org</a> is a global platform that empowers people to create change in their communities and beyond. Their mission is to build a world where no one is powerless and where creating change is a part of everyday life. With this mission, it’s no wonder that they wanted the workshops and presentations of their 2023 offsite to empower&nbsp;people.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<blockquote>At Change, we have a unique opportunity to give a more powerful voice to hundreds of millions of people in order to build more participatory and responsive democracies. We want to live up to our mission and incorporate these principles into everything that we do so that we can create tools and resources that are authentic for people using our platform. We know that being involved in digital activism takes courage, intention and planning, many of the soft skills that we hope to strengthen internally amongst our Product Team. — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamjessklein/">Jess Klein</a>, Director of&nbsp;Design</blockquote><p>We’ve created slide decks for <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16jvdbbTHuRtbA72seHwrI48tckcgyvxHhf00sHTQvLs/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">creating</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MIVsO5kaMiN8bhSwdF9vYMliC5klFKzl63jCpzil_y0/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">preparing</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_12RxeZrt3k2PIqiKn3bi97od6bBxifBPIOR8VrXwlI/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">running</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sz0OT0mp-_YWuy2AB4Jr125rf5lgPbVkxDuwcjXJLEw/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">recovering from</a> sessions as well as one for <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17R7OWgy-8Cme_EphWHrlLu0eKf9QtgC8r0BGU2WqrbU/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">general tips</a>.

So your aim should be to create a session that is participatory, so that you can co-design solutions and outputs with others. “Participatory” means that a workshop invites input. Instead of “presenting” information, the facilitator asks participants to help solve problems.</p><p>Using participatory practices leads to better solutions, more inspiration and more collaboration. Creation isn’t passive, and “participatory” does not mean formless. A structure we like to use in workshops can be summarised as “Future, Present, Past”. You say what you’re going to do (future), do what you’re going to do (present) and then say what you did&nbsp;(past).</p><p>Here’s a list of questions to ask yourself when you are creating your session&nbsp;plan:</p>  How do you want people to feel in your&nbsp;session?  What outputs do you want and why do these outputs matter to&nbsp;others?  How can you ensure that everyone is able to contribute equally?  How can you use your presentation or introduction to get people thinking?  What can people DO that will help you move your work&nbsp;forward?  What instructions can you give that guide the conversations and help your participants produce valuable insights?  How can you time-box share outs so that each group gets a chance to&nbsp;share?  How will you model this reflective activity for your participants?  What can people do to stay involved with you and your&nbsp;work?   Create your slide&nbsp;deck <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MIVsO5kaMiN8bhSwdF9vYMliC5klFKzl63jCpzil_y0/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part&nbsp;2</a></p><p>Even in a participatory session, you’ll want to have some visual guidance. This will help people remember the reason they’re there and what problems they should be trying to solve. What you put on your screen isn’t there to prompt you but rather to prompt your audience.</p><p>Use stories, anecdotes, and analogies to bring your talk to life. Keep things visual as a picture paints a thousand words (and makes it easier for you to remember what you wanted to&nbsp;say!)</p><p>Question to think about for good deck of&nbsp;slides:</p>  What is essential for people to understand about your problem area so that they can contribute solutions?  How can your slide deck serve your colleagues after the&nbsp;session?  What questions do you want the audience to ask after you’re done presenting?  cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO Promote your&nbsp;session <p>Now that you’ve spent so much time crafting your session, now you need to get people to attend. The more minds, the merrier! The best collaborative sessions include diverse perspectives to ensure that solutions and ideas speak to the broadest range of&nbsp;people.</p><p>You’ll want to tell people about your session, so that you get lots of input and lots of output. Don’t be afraid to promote your excellent planning!</p><p>Questions to consider:</p>  Who are your&nbsp;allies?  Can you summarise the context, need and outcome in just 3&nbsp;bullets?  How can your entire organisation or sector benefit from the outputs of your&nbsp;session?   Run a mini pre-mortem cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>There are some things we can control and some things that we can’t. Thinking about what could go wrong in advance is a good way to prepare yourself for different eventualities. Some things we can prevent, whereas some things we can only mitigate. For example, we might be able to prevent the session running over, but we would only be able to mitigate a problem with the room we’re scheduled to be&nbsp;in.</p><p>Running a mini ‘pre-mortem’ creates a psychologically-safe space to take a look at your session and inherent risks. All you do is imagine it’s after the session is over and imagine that the session was a failure. The job of the pre-mortem is to identify in advance why that might&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Questions to help you create backup&nbsp;plans:</p>  What will you do if your slides are corrupt or there’s no paper in the&nbsp;room?  Who can you call on to help remove / calm down someone who is exhibiting (sustained) problematic behaviours?  How can you structure your slide deck to make sections skippable?   Take care of&nbsp;yourself <p>Every session needs at least one leader, and that’s you! So take care of yourself so you can help lead everyone through the&nbsp;session.</p><p>What that looks like in practice can depend on specific circumstances, but in general means a calm, well-rested person, with a plan and the resources to carry it out. If you’re part of a team running the session, then you should encourage them to be calm and well-rested, too.</p><p>Help yourself find&nbsp;calm:</p>  Are there particular things (e.g. coffee, energy drinks) that you know you should avoid directly before the session because of the effect they have on&nbsp;you?  How long will each part of the session take, realistically?  Do you need to factor in transition time?  cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO Next steps… <p>In this post we’ve talked about planning, preparing, and promoting your session, as well as thinking about what could go wrong, and looking after yourself. What resonates with you? What do you need to work on in particular?</p><p>In our next post, we’ll talk about running and recovering from your session. We’ll also give you some general tips for a kick-ass workshop or presentation.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/radiating-confidence-at-change-org-9fbbe9f4fc2f">Radiating Confidence at Change.org</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Engaging GenZ with Voice and Choice to Promote Digital Literacy</p>
<p>“The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report lists Technology Use as one of their top 10 skills for 2025. Across industries, skills in visual design, digital storytelling, and video production are in high demand, as digital communication dominates the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin this session, we will introduce Generation Z and explain their needs and expectations for the classroom environment. Driven by sense of purpose, Gen Z students will connect with learning experiences that emphasize creativity, voice, equity, and utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will present an assignment that engages students in course content while developing their digital literacy in preparation for the professional demands that lie ahead. While traditional essays and discussion forums can be perceived as irrelevant and impersonal, this authentic assignment capitalizes on students’ impetus to create something that has real-world meaning.</p>
<p>All participants will receive a prompt and rubric, which includes a list of potential, student-created digital artifacts and corresponding instructions. We’ll discuss considerations for implementation, including ways to customize the assignment to meet the needs of virtually all instructional modalities and course delivery formats. Instructors can also tailor the list of options to leverage available institutional technology and resources without bearing responsibility for learning, teaching, and supporting new software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of this assignment, we’ll discuss how giving students “voice and choice” bolsters their resilience and empowers them to persevere through challenges. Research is conclusive that student investment and performance skyrocket when they are given agency in determining how to demonstrate proficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session will conclude with a hands-on activity in which participants use the provided rubric to evaluate real student work samples. We will finish with a question-and-answer session and scannable QR code that leads to downloadable materials and a cited list of the research that informed this presentation.”</p>

HyFlex: Creating Opportunities for Success as a Community College</p>
<p>After the pandemic, Ocean County College was looking to create more flexibility for students in how they receive their education. In the summer of 2022, the college launched its first set of fully HyFlex courses allowing students to choose on any given day whether they came to class in person or logged in remotely to the live class session. Data was collected over the course of the 2022-2023 Academic year to see how students performed and to see if there were any advantages students perceived to using the modality. Many positive outcomes were discovered. This session will go over the results from the qualitative and quantitative data as well as walk participants through the process of implementing HyFlex classes in a community college setting.</p>

Crafting Campus Connections with Oral History and Adobe Premiere Rush</p>
<p>This presentation discusses how student-created videos using Adobe Premiere Rush contribute to campus connectivity—we will provide examples that demonstrate the community-building nature of the assignment in a post-pandemic era and conclude with a reflection on how the final project submissions (which were donated to the university’s archives) used a new technology to create inspiring content that benefitted not only students, but also members of the Seton Hall University community in the present moment and, as we will explain, future community members as well. In our ever-changing technological world, collaborative projects between college students, faculty, and staff must ensure individuals from different backgrounds can work together to benefit their university communities. The disconnects that exist between these groups, however, present challenges for determining what productive collaborations and connections might look like. An oral history assignment used at Seton Hall University in Spring 2023 reflects one such innovative approach. First we will discuss how oral history presents a unique and engaging way for students to learn about history from those who have lived it and then we outline the assignment itself. Finally the audience will see how the creation of an oral history using Adobe Premiere Rush was the ideal way for students to practice several skills including various research techniques (reading primary and secondary sources), interpersonal communication (interviewing), and video creation (Adobe Premiere Rush).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Using Bite-sized Videos to Layer Nurse Practitioner Content</p>
<p>Educators are constantly exploring innovative strategies to assist students in retaining salient course material. Educational research has established that students need to refocus in under a minute, their attentiveness diminishes throughout a class, and they focus more effectively when student-centered pedagogies are integrated (Blake, 2023). Specifically, Gen Z nursing graduate students have shorter attention spans and, as digital natives (Prensky, 2001), expect to learn through a variety of modalities (Chicca &amp; Shellenbarger, 2018; Singh &amp; Dangmei, 2016). Today’s nurse practitioner students are digitally grounded and often prefer information in bite-sized chunks. To address this need, the presenters created a series of health assessment bite-sized videos highlighting important lecture content to reinforce nurse practitioner student course content. The presenters found this tailored approach can effectively engage nurse practitioner students and leverage the most important content for retention beyond the didactic classroom. This presentation will emphasize the process used in developing and refining the videos with a look forward to adapting the format to other subject areas.</p>

Preparing to Teach Online: From Learner to Teacher 
<p>Learning and teaching in the online environment often look very different than in face-to-face classrooms. For novice instructors, understanding how students experience the online classroom can feel like a daunting task. Through the Online Teaching Certificate (OTC) Program offered by Rutgers Teaching and Learning with Technology, instructors take on the role of online students for themselves. As they learn about key principles of online pedagogy and instructional technology usage, they also build empathy for their students, reflecting on their own experiences, challenges, and discoveries as online learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will provide an overview of the design of the OTC program, highlighting one course in detail. We will demonstrate how the structure and content of this course, Universal Design and Accessibility for Online Teaching, facilitates both skill-building and metacognitive reflection about participants’ experiences as online learners. Attendees will focus on key challenges related to online learning contexts as well as strategies supporting online student success.</p>

Making Art with Embedded Poetry from Human and ChatGPT Sources</p>
<p>I published a book in 2011 titled “3D Haiku and Tanka” in Apple Books which explored how writing poetry in 3D space was different from traditional ways of writing on flat 2D surfaces. When 3D printing strategies became available, now it was possible to make 3D real world models of assembled poetic lines which also contained audio buttons that could be pressed for a line of poetry to be read aloud. The appearance of laser cutters made possible the use of multicolored acrylic sheets cut into patterns such as squares, rectangles and pentagons and held together with wood veneer and nuts and bolts. The text of poems are laser cut into the acrylic sheets with QR codes placed nearby for reading by patrons who may be blind or visually impaired. The appearance of ChatGPT now permits the possibility of asking ChatGPT to write poetry in Haiku or Tanka format and include the selected poetry in the mixed media art piece. An example of a Tanka poem made from asking ChatGPT follows.</p>
<p>Silent algorithms,<br>
AI ponders the unknown,<br>
Unraveling truths,<br>
The quest for understanding,<br>
Guided by digital minds.</p>
<p>This raises questions about copyright as ChatGPT utilizes what is available in its captured database to write poetry so any art I make with ChatGPT-inspired poetry pays credit to ChatGPT when its generated poetry is used in an art piece and in that way can be viewed as a virtual collaborator and listed as so in the information describing the art piece.</p>

The appearance of laser cutters made possible the use of multicolored acrylic sheets cut into patterns such as squares, rectangles and pentagons and held together with wood veneer and nuts and bolts. The text of poems are laser cut into the acrylic sheets with QR codes placed nearby for reading by patrons who may be blind or visually impaired. The appearance of ChatGPT now permits the possibility of asking ChatGPT to write poetry in Haiku or Tanka format and include the selected poetry in the mixed media art piece. An example of a Tanka poem made from asking ChatGPT follows.</p>
<p>Silent algorithms,<br>
AI ponders the unknown,<br>
Unraveling truths,<br>
The quest for understanding,<br>
Guided by digital minds.</p>
<p>This raises questions about copyright as ChatGPT utilizes what is available in its captured database to write poetry so any art I make with ChatGPT-inspired poetry pays credit to ChatGPT when its generated poetry is used in an art piece and in that way can be viewed as a virtual collaborator and listed as so in the information describing the art piece.</p>

<p>Ceramic recently launched a new course on LearnWeb3, a leading platform for Web3 education. The course, ‘<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Build an AI Chatbot on ComposeDB and the Ceramic Network,</a>’ will teach developers how to build powerful and scalable AI chatbots using Ceramic’s decentralized data infrastructure.</p><p>AI chatbots are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of industries, from customer service to healthcare to education. However, building and maintaining AI chatbots can be complex and expensive, especially for small businesses and startups. Ceramic's new course aims to make AI chatbots more accessible to developers of all skill levels.</p><p>If you've used AI chatbots like <a href="https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Agent GPT</a>, you've probably noticed that they're more efficient and effective when they have the relevant context for your conversation. This is because the chatbot is able to factor in previous messages, as well as other relevant information when generating its response. Ceramic gives developers a new way to build applications, and in this example chatbots, by storing data in a reusable format. Ceramic allows developers to benefit from the data that other developers have already created—overcoming the cold-start problem of populating applications with data.</p> What Will You Learn? <p>The course covers the following:</p>  What is Ceramic and how does it work?  What is ComposeDB and how does it make it easier to build applications on Ceramic?  Setting up your node and brief context on different node configurations  Data modeling corresponding to an AI-chatbot use case  Authenticating users  Conversing with the chatbot  How to use filters to efficiently read data from your node  How to write mutations  How to stream AI responses to your frontend UI   What Do You Need to Get Started? <p>You can sign up for an account on the <a href="http://learnweb3.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">LearnWeb3.io</a> website (with a blockchain wallet or email address) and follow along in the <a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial’s link</a> to gain points for answering quiz questions and completing the tutorial.</p><p>As outlined in the tutorial, the only dependencies you’ll need are:</p>  MetaMask Chrome Extension  Node v16  An OpenAI API key   Want to Learn More about Building on Ceramic? <p>While this course on LearnWeb3 describes a specific use case for ComposeDB, there are other developer examples and tools that you might find helpful as you build on Ceramic:</p> How to Use and Store Composable Attestations with Ceramic and EAS <p>Walk through a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a> on how to generate Attestations (using Ethereum Attestation Service) and store them on ComposeDB.</p> ComposeDB API Sandbox <p>Use the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB API Sandbox</a> to test example queries on a real dataset.</p> Learn How to Encrypt and Decrypt Data on ComposeDB <p>Visit the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/tutorial-encrypted-data-on-composedb/">tutorial</a> for one methodology you can use to encrypt data and decrypt data on ComposeDB.</p> Create a Social App on ComposeDB <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/EthDenver2023Demo?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Social App ComposeDB Starter</a> will help you get started building your own social app.</p><p>Let us know what you think on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/ba4a098b06e3437082430c5217bf501f?pvs=21&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>!</p>

<p>Revised OASIS Standard now available</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OSLC Open Project are pleased to announce the approval and publication of OSLC Change Management Version 3.0 Errata 01.</p>



<p>This document incorporates Approved Errata for the OASIS Standard “OSLC Change Management Version 3.0.” The specific changes are listed in Appendix C of Part 1, at&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/cm/v3.0/errata01/os/change-mgt-spec.html#errata">https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/cm/v3.0/errata01/os/change-mgt-spec.html#errata</a>.</p>



<p>The nine currently published Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) specifications, along with several informative Project Notes, collectively define a core set of services and domain vocabularies for lifecycle management including requirement, change and quality management.</p>



<p>This specification defines the OSLC Change Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>



<p>The documents and related files are available here:</p>

<p>In Chile, where <a href="https://laneta.cl/primer-informe-de-mujer-y-politica-en-twitter-el-67-de-las-candidatas-recibieron-mensajes-violentos-durante-la-campana/" title="">67% of women candidates receive violent messages</a> during campaigns, <a href="https://toma-partido.fes.de/" title="">#TomaPartido</a> published a <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/chile/19251-20220914.pdf" title="">digital security guide</a>, written by <a href="https://pazpena.com/" title="">Paz Peña</a>, that takes a feminist approach for people and organisations facing digital political violence. The guide offers information about some of the most common attacks as well as practical steps for improving digital security. It’s available in <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/chile/19251-20220914.pdf" title="">Spanish</a> and <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/chile/19535-20221220.pdf" title="">Portuguese</a>.</p>



 Colombia&nbsp; 



<p>In Colombia, where <a href="https://efeminista.com/colombia-ley-violencia-politica-mujeres/" title="">recent legislation was created</a> to fight political violence against women, Fundación Karisma has been doing research to <a href="https://web.karisma.org.co/las-violencias-digitales-pueden-disuadir-a-las-mujeres-de-postularse-a-cargos-publicos/" title="">define digital violence against women politicians </a>in the country and understand its consequences for their work and life. In <a href="https://web.karisma.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Resumen-Ejecutivo-Acoso-Soledad-y-Desprestigio-Agosto_2023.pdf" title="">this publication</a>, they offer recommendations for political movements on how to navigate digital violence against women in politics.</p>



 Brazil 



 
 The initiative <a href="https://azmina.com.br/reportagens/como-acontece-violencia-politica-de-genero-exemplos/" title="">MonitorA</a>, from <a href="https://azmina.com.br/" title="">Azmina</a> and <a href="https://internetlab.org.br/" title="">InternetLab</a>, looks at the different forms that gendered political violence takes in the country to keep women and trans people out of politics. In its mapping of misogyny and online attacks against women in politics, MonitorA has found staggering evidence: in the first week of electoral campaigning in 2022, <a href="https://azmina.com.br/reportagens/monitora-2022-misoginia-ofensas-candidatas/" title="">almost 4.5k attacks or insults were directed at women candidates on Twitter</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 The project coLAB at Universidade Federal Fluminense created the <a href="https://colab-uff.github.io/ddoslab/project/report-gender-violence" title="">Mapa da Violência Política de Gênero em Plataformas Digitais</a>, highlighting the intensity, type and various forms of political gendered violence on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. 
 



 
 Since 2020, <a href="https://www.institutomariellefranco.org/en" title="">Instituto Marielle Franco</a> has been researching and monitoring <a href="https://www.violenciapolitica.org/" title="">political violence in Brazil</a>, and showing how gendered and racialised it is. They have mapped 8 types of political violence suffered by over 140 Black women candidates in the country, and their work has consistently shown that whether Black women are elected or not they remain unprotected against these forms of violence. Through “<a href="https://www.naoseremosinterrompidas.org/" title="">Não Seremos Interrompidas</a>”, they’ve been advocating for local authorities to act against political violence that has kept Black women and LGBTQIA+ from accessing and safely occupying political power.&nbsp; 
 



 
 <a href="https://internetlab.org.br/pt/noticias/como-enfrentar-a-violencia-politica-de-genero/" title="">InternetLab and Redes Cordiais</a> published a guide to help women candidates who face gendered political violence. <a href="https://mulheresnegrasdecidem.org/" title="">Mulheres Negras Decidem</a>, a movement working to strengthen Brazil’s democracy by supporting Black women in politics, wrote a <a href="https://mulheresnegrasdecidem.org/guia-de-cuidados-digitais/" title="">Digital Care Guide</a> to support activists and politicians and Coalizão Direitos na Rede and <a href="https://codingrights.org/en/" title="">Coding Rights</a> published this mini <a href="https://www.marialab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/eleicoesinternet-2.pdf" title="">digital protection guide for elections</a>.

<p>89% of IT leaders expect passwords will represent less than a quarter&nbsp;of their organization’s logins within five years or less</p>



<p>CARLSBAD, California and BOSTON, Massachusetts – October 16, 2023 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> and <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;esheet=53518663&amp;newsitemid=20230809614908&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=LastPass&amp;index=1&amp;md5=77c9b141f704e56ec2c9543ec95bc3d7">LastPass</a> released the 2023 Workforce Authentication Report today, which gauges IT decision makers’ attitudes and plans for removing passwords in favor of easier and more secure passwordless authentication. The verdict? Businesses are actively moving to eradicate passwords from employees’ lives, with 89% of surveyed IT leaders expecting passwords to represent less than a quarter of their organization’s logins within five years or less.</p>



<p>Top findings from the 2023 Workforce Authentication Report:</p>



 
 Businesses are ready to embrace a passwordless future, with 92% having a plan to move to passwordless technology and 95% currently using a passwordless experience at their organization.&nbsp; 



 Businesses believe passkeys will help make them more secure: 92% believe passkeys will benefit their overall security posture, and 93% agree that passkeys will eventually help reduce the volume of unofficial (i.e., “Shadow IT”) applications. 



 However, many recognize that work still needs to be done: A majority of businesses surveyed are still using phishable authentication methods, such as passwords (76%) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) (43%) when it comes to authenticating users within their organization.&nbsp; 



 The majority recognize that this transition will take time and education: 55% of IT leaders surveyed feel they need more education on how passwordless technology works and/or how to deploy it, and 28% cited concerns that users may be resistant to change or using a new technology. 



 When making this transition, businesses made it clear they want to choose where they store passkeys, with 69% of IT leaders anticipating storing them in a third-party password manager.&nbsp; 
 



<p>“The move towards passwordless authentication has gained steam over the past few years as an increasing number of organizations have moved to eliminate the risk and liability of passwords as they are the source of the vast majority of data breaches,” said Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Today’s report backs up this trend by illustrating that global IT leaders are rapidly aiming to reduce their reliance on legacy forms of authentication in favor of passkeys for user-friendly, phishing-resistant sign-ins.”</p>



<p>“These survey results demonstrate that businesses are excited about the prospect of a passwordless future, and all the benefits that future will bring. And the clear majority also recognize that a password manager plays an important role in that future,” said Mike Kosak, Senior Principal Intelligence Analyst at LastPass. “While the adoption of passwordless authentication will take some time and coaching, LastPass is proud to support forward-thinking leaders like these on that journey – ushering their organizations toward security that is stronger and more effortless than ever.”</p>

<p>Increased desire for biometrics and awareness of passkeys increases imperative on service providers to enable stronger, more user-friendly sign-ins</p>



<p>Summary of key findings:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Password usage without two-factor authentication (2FA) is still dominant across use cases – consumers enter a password manually nearly 4 times a day, or 1,280 times a year 



 But when given the option, users want other authentication methods – biometrics is both the preferred method for consumers to log-in and what they believe is most secure, while awareness of passkeys continues to grow 



 Online scams are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated, likely fuelled by AI – over half (54%) have seen an increase in suspicious messages and scams, while 52% believe they have become more sophisticated 



 The impact of legacy sign-in methods is getting worse – the majority of people are abandoning purchases and giving up accessing services online – this is 15% more likely than last year at nearly four times per month per person 
 



<p>October 16, 2023 – <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today publishes its third annual <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/barometer-2023/">Online Authentication Barometer</a>, which gathers insights into the state of online authentication in ten countries across the globe. New to the Barometer this year, FIDO Alliance has also begun tracking consumer perception of threats and scams online in a bid to understand anticipated threat levels globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key findings&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2023 Online Authentication Barometer found that despite widespread usage of passwords lingering on, consumers want to use stronger, more user-friendly alternatives. Entering a password manually without any form of additional authentication was the most commonly used authentication method across the use cases tracked – including accessing work computers and accounts (37%), streaming services (25%), social media (26%), and smart home devices (17%). Consumers enter a password manually nearly four times a day on average, or around 1,280 times a year. The only exceptional scenario to this trend was financial services, where biometrics (33%) narrowly beat passwords (31%)* as the most used sign-in method.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is especially interesting considering biometrics’ rising popularity as an authentication method. When asked what authentication method people consider most secure and the method they most prefer using, biometrics ranked as favourite in both categories, rising around 5% in popularity since last year. This suggests that consumers want to use biometrics more but don’t currently have the opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This year’s Barometer data showed promising signs of shifting consumer attitudes and desire to use stronger authentication methods, with biometrics especially proving popular. That said, high password usage without 2FA worryingly reflects how little consumers are still being offered alternatives like biometrics, resulting in lingering usage,” commented Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO at FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scams are getting more frequent and more sophisticated – likely fuelled by AI&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year’s Barometer also unearthed consumer perception of threats and scams online. 54% of people have noticed an increase in suspicious messages and scams online, while 52% believe these have become more sophisticated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Threats are seen to be active across several channels, but primarily email, SMS messages, social media, and fake phone or voicemails. The increased accessibility of generative AI tools is a likely driver of this rise in scams and phishing threats. Tools like FraudGPT and WormGPT, which have been created and shared on the dark web explicitly for use in cybercrime, have made crafting compelling social engineering attacks far simpler, more sophisticated, and easier to do at scale. Deepfake voice and video are also being used to bolster social engineering attacks, tricking people into thinking they are talking to a known trusted person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar added: “Phishing is still by far the most used and effective cyberattack technique, which means passwords are vulnerable regardless of their complexity. With highly accessible generative AI tools now offering bad actors the means to make more convincing and scalable attacks, it’s imperative consumers and service providers listen to consumers and start to look at non-phishable and frictionless solutions like passkeys and on-device biometrics more readily available, rather than iterating on ultimately flawed legacy authentication like passwords and OTPs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys, which provide secure and convenient passwordless sign-ins to online services, have grown in consumer awareness despite still being live just over a year, rising from 39% in 2022 to 52% awareness today. The non-phishable authentication method has been publicly backed by many big players in the industry – <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/">Google recently announced that passkeys are now available for all its users</a> to move away from passwords and two-step verification, as has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305">Apple</a>, with other brands like PayPal also making these available to consumers in the last twelve months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impact of legacy sign-ins worsens for businesses and consumers&nbsp;</p>



<p>The negative impact caused by legacy user authentication was also revealed to be getting worse. 59% of people have given up accessing an online service&nbsp; and 43% have abandoned a purchase in the last 60 days, with the frequency of these instances rising year on year to nearly four times per month, per person, up by around 15% on last year. Poor online experiences are ultimately hitting businesses’ bottom lines and causing frustration among consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>70% of people have had to reset and recover passwords in the last two months because they’d forgotten them, further highlighting how inconvenient passwords are and their role as a primary barrier to a seamless online user experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Increased desire for biometrics and awareness of passkeys increases imperative on service providers to enable stronger, more user-friendly sign-ins</p>



<p>Summary of key findings:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Password usage without two-factor authentication (2FA) is still dominant across use cases – consumers enter a password manually nearly 4 times a day, or 1,280 times a year 



 But when given the option, users want other authentication methods – biometrics is both the preferred method for consumers to log-in and what they believe is most secure, while awareness of passkeys continues to grow 



 Online scams are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated, likely fuelled by AI – over half (54%) have seen an increase in suspicious messages and scams, while 52% believe they have become more sophisticated 



 The impact of legacy sign-in methods is getting worse – the majority of people are abandoning purchases and giving up accessing services online – this is 15% more likely than last year at nearly four times per month per person 
 



<p>October 16, 2023 – <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today publishes its third annual <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/barometer-2023/">Online Authentication Barometer</a>, which gathers insights into the state of online authentication in ten countries across the globe. New to the Barometer this year, FIDO Alliance has also begun tracking consumer perception of threats and scams online in a bid to understand anticipated threat levels globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key findings&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2023 Online Authentication Barometer found that despite widespread usage of passwords lingering on, consumers want to use stronger, more user-friendly alternatives. Entering a password manually without any form of additional authentication was the most commonly used authentication method across the use cases tracked – including accessing work computers and accounts (37%), streaming services (25%), social media (26%), and smart home devices (17%). Consumers enter a password manually nearly four times a day on average, or around 1,280 times a year. The only exceptional scenario to this trend was financial services, where biometrics (33%) narrowly beat passwords (31%)* as the most used sign-in method.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is especially interesting considering biometrics’ rising popularity as an authentication method. When asked what authentication method people consider most secure and the method they most prefer using, biometrics ranked as favourite in both categories, rising around 5% in popularity since last year. This suggests that consumers want to use biometrics more but don’t currently have the opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This year’s Barometer data showed promising signs of shifting consumer attitudes and desire to use stronger authentication methods, with biometrics especially proving popular. That said, high password usage without 2FA worryingly reflects how little consumers are still being offered alternatives like biometrics, resulting in lingering usage,” commented Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO at FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scams are getting more frequent and more sophisticated – likely fuelled by AI&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year’s Barometer also unearthed consumer perception of threats and scams online. 54% of people have noticed an increase in suspicious messages and scams online, while 52% believe these have become more sophisticated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Threats are seen to be active across several channels, but primarily email, SMS messages, social media, and fake phone or voicemails. The increased accessibility of generative AI tools is a likely driver of this rise in scams and phishing threats. Tools like FraudGPT and WormGPT, which have been created and shared on the dark web explicitly for use in cybercrime, have made crafting compelling social engineering attacks far simpler, more sophisticated, and easier to do at scale. Deepfake voice and video are also being used to bolster social engineering attacks, tricking people into thinking they are talking to a known trusted person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar added: “Phishing is still by far the most used and effective cyberattack technique, which means passwords are vulnerable regardless of their complexity. With highly accessible generative AI tools now offering bad actors the means to make more convincing and scalable attacks, it’s imperative consumers and service providers listen to consumers and start to look at non-phishable and frictionless solutions like passkeys and on-device biometrics more readily available, rather than iterating on ultimately flawed legacy authentication like passwords and OTPs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys, which provide secure and convenient passwordless sign-ins to online services, have grown in consumer awareness despite still being live just over a year, rising from 39% in 2022 to 52% awareness today. The non-phishable authentication method has been publicly backed by many big players in the industry – <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/">Google recently announced that passkeys are now available for all its users</a> to move away from passwords and two-step verification, as has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305">Apple</a>, with other brands like PayPal also making these available to consumers in the last twelve months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impact of legacy sign-ins worsens for businesses and consumers&nbsp;</p>



<p>The negative impact caused by legacy user authentication was also revealed to be getting worse. 59% of people have given up accessing an online service&nbsp; and 43% have abandoned a purchase in the last 60 days, with the frequency of these instances rising year on year to nearly four times per month, per person, up by around 15% on last year. Poor online experiences are ultimately hitting businesses’ bottom lines and causing frustration among consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>70% of people have had to reset and recover passwords in the last two months because they’d forgotten them, further highlighting how inconvenient passwords are and their role as a primary barrier to a seamless online user experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee – APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Welcome</p>



<p>As we usher in the participants of Authenticate 2023, we aim to provide a snapshot of various corners of the globe. Today, we’re privileged to bring together our esteemed members—industry luminaries from Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Mainland China, Korea and Japan. Together, we’ll navigate the present landscape, confronting the challenges and celebrating the opportunities inherent in adopting phishing-resistant authentication methods across APAC.</p>



<p>Introducing Our Experts:</p>



<p>Khanit Phaton, Thailand: Senior Management Officer at ETDA</p>



<p>Karen Chang, Taiwan: VP at Egis Technology / Chair of FIDO Taiwan Forum</p>



<p>Simon Trac Do, Vietnam: CEO &amp; Founder at VinCSS</p>



<p>Henry Chai, Mainland China: CEO at Uni-ID Technology, Lenovo / Co-Chair of FCWG</p>



<p>Jaebeom Kim, South Korea: Principal Researcher at TTA / Sub-Group Leader of FKWG</p>



<p>Masao Kubo, Japan: Manager, Product Design Department at NTT DOCOMO</p>



<p>Crafting an inclusive approach to online authentication in Thailand</p>



<p>Joon: Given Thailand’s rich diversity in many aspects, how does this influence the approach to and adoption of new online authentication systems for its citizens?</p>



<p>Khanit: As online services have become primary channels and gained popularity among the Thai population, coupled with the increasing number of cybersecurity threats, it’s crucial for both the public and private sectors to address this issue. Secure authentication is a key consideration. Given our diversity in aspects like culture and socioeconomic status, it’s essential to adopt an approach that’s inclusive and accessible for all. We’re exploring various methods for authentication; for instance, the Thai government’s introduction of the ThaID digital ID system, which utilizes both facial and fingerprint recognition, ensuring robust accessibility for all citizens. Meanwhile, Fintech companies and banks are developing mobile banking apps tailored to a wide range of mobile devices, incorporating online face verification services.</p>



<p>Reflecting on Taiwan’s recent strides with FIDO</p>



<p>Joon: Taiwan has showcased impressive FIDO deployment cases in recent years. Karen, as the chair of the FIDO Taiwan Regional Engagement Forum, can you offer insights on this journey?</p>



<p>Karen: The FIDO Taiwan Regional Engagement Forum (FTF) was formed in 2021, with members spanning IC chip, device, software, system, and application services. As of August 2023, we boast over 25 members and 80 FIDO-certified products. The government’s role in adopting and promoting FIDO standards cannot be understated. The Ministry of Interior joined the FIDO Alliance in 2020 and launched the Taiwan FidO (TW FidO) service. By September 2023, TW FidO was integrated into more than 170 government department systems, encompassing a wide array of services. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) also emphasized the “Research and Development of Standardized Financial Mobile Identification Mechanisms” in the Financial Technology Development Roadmap released in 2020, known as “Financial FIDO”. This allows users to bind their mobile devices with physical financial cards, eliminating the need for traditional physical cards or account/password logins. Several financial institutions are currently piloting this Financial FIDO initiative. Established in August 2022, the Ministry of Digital Affairs (moda) joined the FIDO Alliance in January 2023. Moda has been actively promoting international digital trust standards, like FIDO User Authentication and W3C Decentralized Identifiers, to industries like e-commerce, telecom services, online gaming, semiconductors, and manufacturing, ensuring a seamless and secure authentication experience. In many Asian countries, directives or guidelines from public organizations play a pivotal role in positioning a nation at the forefront of technology adoption. Today, it’s FIDO’s moment. I believe the FTF is on the right trajectory, and FIDO’s popularity is set to soar.</p>



<p>Vietnam’s Path to Simpler and Stronger Online Authentication</p>



<p>Joon: With many members in Vietnam being relatively new to the FIDO Alliance, how do you assess Vietnam’s readiness and the challenges it faces in adopting simpler and stronger online authentication methods?</p>



<p>Simon: Vietnam, like other nations, grapples with an intensifying phishing crisis that poses significant risks to users, agencies, and organizations. Although there are initiatives in place, such as the Anti-Scam Center, which aims to counteract these threats promptly and take down scam sites, their effectiveness is somewhat curtailed due to manual operations and heavy reliance on user awareness. On a brighter note, an increasing number of Vietnamese entities are engaging in the FIDO Alliance’s drive to minimize password reliance. Leading the charge in this passwordless movement in Vietnam are tech frontrunners like VinCSS and MK Group.</p>



<p>Mainland China’s Digital Landscape: Balancing Scale and Security</p>



<p>Joon: Mainland China has one of the largest digital user bases in the world. What unique challenges does this present when considering the adoption of novel simpler and stronger online authentication methods?</p>



<p>Henry: Indeed, in Mainland China, the sheer size of our digital user base brings about unique considerations. For any new security technology to be deployed, there’s an imperative need to consider the diversity in device capabilities. This ensures an optimal user experience for all, especially during the earlier times, before 2019, when not all smartphones were FIDO-enabled. During that period, any deployment of FIDO had to ensure that every user, regardless of their device’s capabilities, had a viable authentication alternative. Additionally, while authentication is a foundational layer, its adoption must align with business returns. When weighed against traditional, albeit less robust, authentication methods such as SMS and OTP, the decision to transition to FIDO becomes multifaceted. In many cases, the end solution is a mix of methods, balancing compatibility with business benefits. Presently, over 90 banks in Mainland China have adopted FIDO technology, and we anticipate this number to grow across different sectors soon.</p>



<p>Discussing South Korea’s technological advancements</p>



<p>Joon: South Korea is renowned for its advanced technological infrastructure. Jaebeom, how does this influence the nation’s approach to adopting new online authentication methods?</p>



<p>Jaebeom: It’s imperative for our country to integrate new authentication methods to facilitate seamless online identity verification for the public. In this quest, the South Korean government and associated agencies prioritize two critical aspects:</p>



<p>Technical Standards and Service Guidelines: We aim for consistent user experiences across platforms, irrespective of the service providers involved. This demands clear technical standards and robust service operation guidelines.</p>



<p>Legal Framework: Many online services require a solid legal basis for identity verification. Thus, legislative amendments and continued dialogues across the private sector, government, and academia are essential to formulating appropriate legal frameworks. Even if it is time-consuming, this step is indispensable. While our focus leans towards new online authentication methods, it’s equally important to ensure stability in both legacy and new systems, guaranteeing that all citizens can access online identity verification without hitches.</p>



<p>Japan – On the rise and acceptance of passkeys</p>



<p>Joon: Given the unified efforts of the FIDO Alliance Japan Working Group and its members, Japan leads in passkey deployments. Kubo-san, can you discuss the current trend and acceptance of passkeys in Japan?</p>



<p>Kubo-san: This year, I’ve observed several RPs deploying synced passkeys. While some organizations have long supported FIDO technology and embraced synced passkeys, others began their FIDO journey with synced passkeys only in 2023. This dynamic suggests that the momentum for passkey deployment is only set to accelerate. From a user perspective, awareness of passkeys is gradually heightening in Japan. Tech enthusiasts frequently discuss passkeys on social media, and according to Google Trends, search queries related to passkeys have surged. We’re in the early stages of a passwordless era in Japan, and I eagerly anticipate the broader acceptance and deployment of passkeys.</p>



<p>Delving deeper into phishing-resistant solutions in Thailand</p>



<p>Joon: Khanit, how can Thailand ensure that its authentication strategy remains robust and beneficial for online users? Would adopting phishing-resistant authentication solutions be advantageous?</p>



<p>Khanit: To bolster online security, Thailand has undertaken multiple strategies. We’re raising awareness through collaborative efforts with global bodies like the FIDO Alliance and defining digital ID standards that embed secure identity proofing and authentication methods. This lays down a foundational benchmark for users and service providers alike. Additionally, we’ve amended the Electronic Transaction Act to clearly delineate the responsibilities of service providers in guaranteeing authentication security and quality. Undoubtedly, integrating phishing-resistant authentication solutions, which use cryptographic techniques over vulnerable methods like PINs or passwords, would be a strategic advantage. Such solutions inherently offer heightened protection against phishing threats and pose a more formidable challenge for attackers compared to conventional methods.</p>



<p>Discussing Taiwan’s firm stance on cybersecurity</p>



<p>Joon: Could you provide an overview of the cybersecurity landscape in Taiwan and identify any notable trends?</p>



<p>Karen: In Taiwan, the zero-trust network security approach has become a pivotal national strategy. The sixth “National Information Security Development Plan (2021-2024)” was announced in February 2021, advocating for the Zero-Trust Architecture across government agencies and industries. The Taiwanese government has mapped out a comprehensive plan for implementing the zero-trust architecture, piloting validation and deployment mechanisms in 2021-2022. Central to this plan are three core mechanisms: identity authentication, device authentication, and trust inference. We place a significant emphasis on multi-factor authentication mechanisms that leverage the FIDO2 standard, allowing passwordless logins using physical security keys or mobile apps. By the end of August 2023, 12 vendors had cleared the government’s Zero Trust Architecture Identity Authentication Compliance Program. All these vendors deploy FIDO-certified solutions for user authentication. In 2023, numerous government agencies and businesses adopted this zero-trust framework in collaboration with these vendors. By incorporating phishing-resistant user authentication mechanisms, like FIDO’s standards, we have enhanced the security of online services, spanning national critical infrastructure, government services, and key industries. Moreover, FIDO’s certification program fosters trust between service providers, vendors, users, and the general populace.</p>



<p>Reflecting on the importance of FIDO certifications in Korea</p>



<p>Joon: Over the years, FIDO’s certification programs have been instrumental in globally promoting standardized technology adoption. Jaebeom, given that Korea is seen as an early FIDO authentication adopter, can you share your observations?</p>



<p>Jaebeom: Authentication essentially certifies a product’s fitness for its intended purpose, which means it’s more about validating product quality than being a mere badge of honor. As new technologies emerge and mature, the relative importance of certification programs wanes. This is primarily due to the initial imperfections in technology specifications and the lack of testing tools and products during the nascent stages. Certification programs then play a crucial role in harmonizing standards, products, and policies while ironing out these issues. As technology matures, these initial challenges are naturally addressed through iterative processes, and certification programs fulfill their designated roles more organically.</p>



<p>Lessons from Early FIDO Adopters: Mainland China</p>



<p>Joon: Henry, as the Co-Chair of one of the very first regional working groups, what insights can you offer the audience regarding early FIDO adoption, ecosystem cultivation, and so on?</p>



<p>Henry: FIDO is a novel authentication technology with clear benefits in security and user experience, but it also requires consumer devices like smartphones to be compatible. It takes time for the whole ecosystem to gradually embrace FIDO and incorporate its capabilities. The FIDO China Working Group collaborated closely with domestic phone OEMs in Mainland China to promote the FIDO concept and accelerate its implementation on devices. Simultaneously, we worked with the FIDO Alliance to establish the world’s first accredited certification lab at CAICT, Mainland China.</p>



<p>Recap of the FIDO APAC Summit 2023 – Vietnam</p>



<p>Joon: Simon, you co-hosted the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/fido-apac-summit-2023/">FIDO APAC Summit 2023 in Vietnam</a> back in August successfully. Can you reflect on the event and share any insights or observations you took away from the experience?</p>



<p>Simon: The inaugural FIDO APAC Summit 2023 truly exceeded our organizing committee’s expectations. Drawing a diverse crowd with over 300 attendees spanning 12 countries, it was heartening to witness such a convergence of perspectives and expertise. With 29 eminent speakers from diverse sectors, the summit facilitated rich discussions, paving the way for meaningful collaborations. A particularly noteworthy highlight was Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) joining the ranks as the 10th government-level member of the FIDO Alliance, underscoring our collective dedication to elevating digital authentication standards. This resonated beyond the venue, with our summit receiving comprehensive media coverage across multiple prestigious platforms. Having proudly co-hosted this foundational event, VinCSS is eager to continue endorsing, supporting, and championing its future iterations, as we envisage it becoming a cornerstone event in the APAC digital landscape.</p>



<p>Envisioning the collective journey with FIDO in APAC</p>



<p>Joon: Looking at the broader APAC region’s push towards harmonized phishing-resistant online authentication, how do you view the role and contributions of FIDO Alliance members?</p>



<p>Kubo-san: For years, our collective aim has been to realize a phishing-resistant, passwordless world through FIDO. But achieving this vision is not a solitary endeavor. It requires collaboration with diverse stakeholders to foster a world where everyone recognizes and effortlessly uses passkeys. FIDO alliance members can spearhead this initiative by sharing their deployment experiences and persuading yet-to-adopt service providers. Additionally, a joint effort is required to amplify consumer awareness and understanding of passkeys. FIDO technology, especially passkeys, boasts a remarkable retention rate. Once users experience it, they appreciate its intuitive usability. Therefore, it’s imperative for us, as proponents of passkeys, to emphasize that FIDO isn’t just about phishing resistance—it’s also about enhancing user experience. And that’s not just a marketing spiel—it’s the reality.</p>



<p>Closing</p>



<p>To every attendee of Authenticate 2023 reading this, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for your dedication to making online authentication simpler and stronger. As we navigate this ever-evolving domain, we warmly encourage you to continue these conversations by connecting with the FIDO members featured in this dialogue, ensuring our collective discussions remain fruitful and dynamic.</p>

<p>Background</p>



<p>From the beginning we have asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. We ask that you do so again this year.&nbsp; The power of that diversity continues to shine through in the new working groups this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti, equity and inclusion in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.<br><br>The Council has identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those organisations involved in kaupapa Māori, civil liberties and business and service sectors are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. As an NZTech Association, Digital Identity NZ adopts its Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy which&nbsp;you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cd211649fd1d09c759c0112f&amp;id=747df7db4d&amp;e=de1fb60f09">here</a>.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 5pm on 06 November 2023. </p>

<p>Technologies often experience what is called an “adoption S-curve”,&nbsp; a <a href="https://www.stratechi.com/adoption-curves/">model</a> on how innovation spreads through a population over time.&nbsp; They struggle through an initial period of low adoption, gain traction as they resolve their primary challenges, and finally saturate the market. The steepness and length of the curve can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the technology and societal readiness. <a href="https://elastos.dev/">Elastos</a> represents a comprehensive attempt at decentralising not just financial transactions but the entire internet experience, from how we communicate to how we control our digital assets. It’s built to facilitate the creation of decentralised applications (dApps) that run on a network of peer-to-peer nodes rather than centralised servers.</p>
<p>When we each found out about Elastos, we were inspired to be a part of something meaningful. Individuals globally should have sovereignty over their data. Communication channels should be secure and free from unauthorised surveillance. Ownership and transfer of digital assets should be clear and indisputable and economic systems should fairly reward contribution and value generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Converging external factors—ranging from technological advancements and data growth to economic inequalities and global interconnectedness—are amplifying the need for Elastos to enhance human agency, the capacity to make choices, and the ability to exercise control over one’s digital environment. Inflection points arise when a unique confluence of factors disrupt existing feedback loops or create new ones. This is not possible without perseverance to persist in actions that are aligned with achieving specific goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of everyone’s hard work over the past 5 years, Elastos is reaching a moment where we can show its vision in unison, and the world feels increasingly more ready for it, a breakthrough moment. As ecosystem teams and the community work hard to move us into this new paradigm, effective exchange of information is crucial. Official communication channels serve as the primary means of circulating accurate and timely information to both internal and external stakeholders. Managing official publications and socials allows for a unified messaging strategy that represents the brand identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a testament to our increasing technological power, 12 community-elected individuals under the <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic Council</a>—who operate on one of Elastos’ dedicated, decentralised identity blockchains with transparency and traceability—voted our team, Infinity, to represent Elastos’ communications and maintenance. You can read our on-chain proposal <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/65174f5bfbb72400849f38df">here</a>&nbsp;and learn more about us and our goals. Starting today, we will provide professional publishing and maintenance across Elastos channels. We will represent the community; we come from the community; we understand the technology; and we are fully aware of the responsibility and professional representation Elastos needs. Here is our team;</p>
<p>Team Infinity</p>
 
 Team Lead: Ahmed, CRC Council Member and Elastos Guardian, oversees the entire operation, coordinates the team, and ensures alignment with strategic objectives. Also responsible for external communication and comprehensive proofreading. 
 Writer/Editor: Sash, CRC Council Member and CEO of Elacity writes and edits articles, collaborates on content strategy, and ensures SEO optimisation. 
 Graphic Designer: Napatr, Web3 Graphic and UI/X Designer creates visual elements that align with the Elastos brand, and content strategy. 
 Social Media Manager: Remedy, active since 2018, continues to manage and curate content across various social media platforms, including captioning and headline writing. 
 Technical Support Advisor: Mbutcho, CRC Council Member and Elastos Guardian, maintains the technical aspects of the Elastos.info website, ensuring it is functional, secure, and up-to-date. 
 
<p>We would like to thank all those who came before us for their high standard of work. These teams include CR News Team, CR Press Team, The Moderators, Info Team and Digerati; Elastos’ journey would not be the same without you. Infinity represents an unbounded or limitless quantity which can have a direction, positive or negative when discussing sequences or series. We will be transparent, educational, bold and collaborative. We are here to serve you, to work with ecosystem teams, to provide leadership and to listen to your feedback and support. Elastos is moving into the next phase of its adoption S-curve, it will be exciting, and our plan is to bring a new, refreshed approach to how we communicate and brand Elastos, starting now. Onwards. Upwards. Elastos!<br>
<br>
“Elastos SmartWeb has recently made significant progress, including a blockchain public chain, EVM-compatible sidechains, a W3C-compliant and EVM-compatible DID-specific sidechain, personal storage (Data Vault) required for network computers, decentralised public storage based on IPFS, personal micro-websites, and decentralised (Virtual Circuit) communication from person-to-person. In other words, Elastos SmartWeb has essentially completed the Internet computer vision. Thanks to the Elastos community and its dedicated developers.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/chen2rong2">Rong Chen</a>, Elastos Founder</p>

<p>New policy addresses how OASIS receives and responds to reported vulnerabilities</p> 


<p>Responsible investigation and reporting of known or potential software vulnerabilities is a crucial part of protecting systems and users from hacks and cyberattacks. While open standards are not typically sources of software vulnerabilities, we believe that OASIS should follow best industry practices and provide channels and processes for reporting and addressing possible flaws in the work of our technical communities.</p>



<p>In this spirit, the Board of Directors has approved and adopted the OASIS Vulnerability Handling &amp; Disclosure Policy (https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-vulnerability-handling-disclosure-policy/). The policy governs how OASIS committees and staff receive and address reports of potential flaws.</p>



<p>The companion Vulnerability Handling &amp; Disclosure Process (https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-vulnerability-handling-disclosure-process/) explains how the policy works in practice.</p>

 OriginTrail’s 1st DKG Conference brings together Internet, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain pioneers to harness trusted AI across industries DKGcon 2023: Fireside chat with Dr. Bob Metcalfe, Internet pioneer and Ethernet inventor, and Branimir Rakic, Co-Founder of the OriginTrail ecosystem, moderated by Ivan On Tech, Founder of Moralis&nbsp;Academy.<p><a href="https://dkgcon.origintrail.io/">The international DKGcon — Decentralized Knowledge Graph Conference</a> gathered pioneers in Internet and blockchain technologies, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on Monday, October 9, 2023. They discussed how to distinguish between credible and fictitious information and knowledge in the era of generative AI, and what is the role of new technologies in this (such as blockchain and decentralized knowledge graphs). They also discussed how these technologies will impact the economy and society in general in relation to&nbsp;AI.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekG1Bl-tCjc">DKGcon</a> the conference participants shared practical examples of how to create connected information and credible knowledge from fragmented data and how to connect this with generative AI for various purposes. They shed light on how these technologies are already changing the operations and businesses across various sectors — from supply chains, pharmaceuticals, construction, and consumer products, to education, media, and the metaverse.</p><p>The forefront of the conference was the open-source <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)</a> that has <a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a> as core developers. Solutions based on OriginTrail DKG are breaking new ground in establishing digital trust, increasing transparency, optimizing business processes, enabling new ways of consumer interaction with products, as well as new ways of creating using advanced technologies such as blockchain, decentralized knowledge graphs, and&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The innovation, transformative nature, and effectiveness of the developed solutions are endorsed by global organizations such as the British Standards Institution, the World Federation of Hemophilia, GS1, the Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN), and others. Together with Trace Labs, these organizations and other business partners, as well as members of the open-source OriginTrail community, also presented various solutions at the conference.</p><p>One of the distinguished speakers at DKGcon 2023 was Wes Levitt, Co-Chief Investment Officer at Alpha Transform Holdings, who shed light on the recently launched solution based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ekG1Bl-tCjc?si=wTxohkIBe842BQ6e&amp;t=17820">OriginTrail Trusted Knowledge Foundation that brings trust to the financial industry</a>. This solution, called chatAnalyst.ai, is set to revolutionize how financial services companies can develop their business lines while eliminating the current AI solutions pitfalls by allowing financial businesses to access quality data with verifiable provenance.</p><p>While demoing the solution live Wes Levitt said, “If I’m an investment professional presenting to my investing committee I will get laughed out of the room if I say ‘I got the information out of a bot; don’t worry, for sure it’s correct’. My manager will expect me to have highly sourced content before making million-dollar investment decisions. In the case of chatAnalyst.ai we can see the source content of the answers provided by the chat interface. By going to the OriginTrail DKG Explorer we can easily explore the underlying documents and the on-chain activity of when it was stamped on blockchain which makes it immutable. Not only do we have the source content to confirm, but also the provenance of when it was put there. This solution will change the way financial analysts work immensely.”</p>Wes Levitt, Co-Chief Investment Officer at Alpha Transform Holdings, presenting chatAnalyst.ai, which is set to revolutionize how financial services companies can develop their business&nbsp;lines.<p>Another esteemed speaker at the conference was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ekG1Bl-tCjc?si=_SlnLKayp47M9ICa&amp;t=29311">Dr. Bob Metcalfe, Internet pioneer, and Ethernet inventor</a>, also the recipient of the Turing Award, often referred to as the Nobel Prize for Computing, who discussed: “The hunch is that a mixture of connectivity, decentralized knowledge graphs, and blockchains are converging. This convergence is important because it is going to help us with one of the biggest problems we have nowadays, which is the truth. All over the connectivity space people are having trouble deciding what is true. This is where the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) comes in; it feeds the truth to the AI systems we put on top of the&nbsp;DKG.”</p>Dr. Bob Metcalfe, Internet pioneer, Ethernet inventor, and the recipient of the Turing Award (Nobel Prize for Computing).<p>The day after the conference took on a more informal tone as all the speakers and conference attendees engaged in networking activities. Against the picturesque backdrop of the Ljubljana skyline, a special “proof-of-steak” picnic was organized, during which the esteemed guests were treated to a delectable culinary experience featuring dishes crafted from premium local ingredients.</p><p>At this gathering, participants had the unique opportunity to delve into the origin and background of products offered by a prominent Slovenian poultry producer, Perutnina Ptuj, and the Slovenian farm association, KZ Šaleška dolina. This exploration was made possible through the utilization of OriginTrail technology as the underlying framework.

             There are increasing efforts to promote and implement the use of UDI for medical devices in China, but the scale involved is challenging. 
     

 
             <p>In Shenzhen alone, three separate regulatory departments are involved (Shenzhen Administration for Market Regulation, Shenzhen Health Commission and Healthcare Security Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality).</p>

<p>Adding to the complexity in that in Shenzhen city there is a total of 1,549 medical device manufacturers (14,095 medical device SKUs), 75,975 medical device distributors and 5,780 healthcare providers. This means the medical device supervision and traceability chain is long and challenging. Shenzhen Administration for Market Regulation has established one data platform for UDI, collected data from two sources (suppliers and healthcare providers), in a project led by three departments.</p>

<p>Lovesh Harchandani from Dock presents their approach to anonymous credentials and dives in on the various predicates that can be proven in zero knowledge. In over 90 minutes of discussion, we cover what these cryptographic techniques are, how they enable several important use cases for digital identity credentials, and we stretch James Monaghan’s ability to keep up as interviewer by taking a look at the source code which makes it all possible! We show how various zero knowledge primitives we’ve built can be used in a modular fashion to solve real-world use cases. We cover privacy-preserving signature schemes, zero knowledge attribute equalities, range proofs, and verifiable encryption based on ZK-SNARKs, expressing arbitrary predicates as Circom programs and creating ZK proofs for them and blinded credentials (issuer is unaware of all attributes). For anyone interested in the technical underpinnings of this new frontier of digital identity, this episode is a must!<br></p>

<p>The Engine Room is among the initial cohort of 10 organisations that form the Global Network for Social Justice and Digital Resilience, an initiative supported by the Ford Foundation and <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/news-and-stories/news-and-press/news/ford-foundation-launches-first-global-south-network-to-strengthen-the-digital-resilience-of-civil-society/" title="publicly launched this week">publicly launched this week</a>. </p>







<p>The mission of the network is to ensure social justice organisations across the Global South can better leverage the benefits of technology while minimising its harms. Funding is provided for each member to work on strengthening their own tech capacity, as well as to provide technical support to civil society organisations in the contexts we work within.</p>



<p>We’re excited to be part of this initiative: In our work supporting organisations fighting for social justice around the world, we’ve seen that these groups need all the tools and support that they can get – especially from technical experts who also understand the contexts they’re working in, and who are dedicated to transferring technical capacities and knowledge. </p>



<p>A <a href="https://digitalresilience.network/" title="website built by network members">website built by network members</a> was launched alongside the official announcement – you can read more about the network (and <a href="https://digitalresilience.network/how-do-we-define-digital-resilience/">how we define digital resilience)</a> there, as well as stay up to date on our activities, news and reflections.  </p>



 What digital resilience means to us  



<p>For us, fostering digital resilience goes hand by hand with restructuring systems of oppression and promoting liberatory, justice-driven and sustainable technology ecosystems. </p>



<p>As our Deputy Director, Poala Mosso, <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/news-and-stories/news-and-press/news/ford-foundation-launches-first-global-south-network-to-strengthen-the-digital-resilience-of-civil-society/" title="">notes</a>: “Digital resilience holds equity at its core. It points to the ability of organisations to design digital ecosystems where everyone can participate in meaningful ways by keeping infrastructures human and environment-centered, safe, and adaptable to ever-changing contexts.”</p>

<p>The OASIS Board of Directors are integral to the organization's success. Read our Q&amp;A to gain a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community. </p> 


<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/santosomar/">Omar Santos</a>, a renowned cybersecurity thought leader who leads several collaborative, industry-wide initiatives to enhance the security of critical infrastructures. With a prolific portfolio of more than 20 books, numerous academic papers, video courses, and technical articles, Santos has established himself as a preeminent authority in the field, significantly impacting the industry’s knowledge landscape. </p>



<p>Can you tell us about your current role?<br>I’m a Distinguished Engineer at Cisco; I work at the Security and Trust Office, leading AI security research, incident response, vulnerability research, and disclosure. Our organization helps protect Cisco and Cisco customers by researching, investigating, and disclosing vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud services. Our organization also has an offensive security team that researches advanced attack techniques, as well as a forensics team.</p>



<p>What inspired you to join the OASIS Board of Directors?<br>I was drawn to the OASIS Board of Directors due to its exemplary work in developing, converging, and promoting open standards for the global information society. The prospect of working alongside like-minded professionals dedicated to creating a secure and integrated digital ecosystem was extremely appealing for me. I was inspired by the opportunity to contribute my expertise in cybersecurity and AI towards shaping robust standards that can significantly enhance digital security and interoperability. Through my role on the board, I aspire to further the mission of OASIS in facilitating the development and adoption of open standards, and to drive meaningful advancements in cybersecurity, AI, and many other emerging technologies.</p>



<p>What has been your involvement at OASIS?<br>I serve as the chair for the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=csaf">Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Technical Committee</a> (TC) and am the convener of the <a href="https://openeox.org/">OpenEoX TC</a>, described <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2023/09/13/introducing-openeox/">here in my recent blog post</a>. Over the past several years, my involvement and contributions have extended to numerous other TCs.</p>



<p>What types of skills/expertise do you bring to the OASIS Board, and how do you hope to make an impact as a board member during your term?<br>With a background in cybersecurity operations, I bring a deep passion to open standards that help accelerate a secure and interoperable digital ecosystem. My experience in these areas provides a practical perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing organizations when promoting innovation. My ongoing learning journey in Artificial Intelligence (AI) empowers me with insights into why open standards are more important than ever with these emerging technologies. This blend of expertise positions me to contribute significantly to the strategic discussions and initiatives of the OASIS Board.</p>



<p>I am particularly keen on collaborating with other OASIS board members and stakeholders, while advocating for the broader adoption of open standards across industries. During my term, I hope to drive initiatives that amplify the role of OASIS in advancing cybersecurity, AI implementations, and other technologies through open standards, and in promoting a culture of shared knowledge and collaborative problem-solving. My aim is to support OASIS in achieving its mission and in making a tangible impact on the global digital community.</p>



<p>What sets OASIS apart from other organizations?<br>I am exhilarated by OASIS’ commitment to the development, convergence, and adoption of open standards that drive today’s and the future digital transformation. OASIS brings together a diverse community of experts from different fields to work on common goals. OASIS promotes a highly collaborative and inclusive environment that encourages the convergence of ideas and expertise from a diverse range of stakeholders. This inclusivity enables the creation of robust and widely-accepted open standards that are crucial for addressing the complex digital challenges of our time.</p>



<p>OASIS operates with a high degree of transparency, ensuring that the process of standards development is open, democratic, and accessible to all parties. This transparency builds trust and consensus among stakeholders, which is fundamental for the widespread adoption and success of the standards developed. OASIS has a remarkable ability to engage with a broad spectrum of industries and sectors. OASIS is also revered for its technical excellence and the high-quality standards it produces. The rigorous technical review and consensus-building processes ensure that the standards developed are robust, scalable, and able to meet the evolving needs of the future.</p>



<p>OASIS has a rich history and a proven track record in developing and promoting open standards that are used by everyone nowadays. By bringing projects to OASIS, entities can leverage the collective expertise and experience of a global community of professionals dedicated to advancing our world and making a difference. All interested parties have an opportunity to contribute and have their voices heard. This openness promotes trust and encourages the broader adoption of the standards developed.</p>



<p>The cross-industry engagement allows for a holistic approach to problem-solving and standards development. The global footprint of OASIS and the recognition it enjoys in the international community ensure that the standards developed have a wide reach and a significant impact. OASIS’s adaptability to emerging technologies and its forward-thinking approach ensure that projects remain relevant in the face of rapidly evolving technologies. I am thrilled by the prospect of contributing to an organization that is at the forefront of shaping the digital future through open standards.</p>



<p>Do you have an impact story regarding your work in open source or open standards, or work that you’ve done at OASIS?<br>I brought the Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) to OASIS from ICASI under a new name: the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). This is now an OASIS standard and in the middle of being introduced as an ISO standard. CSAF is used by numerous organizations around the world, including vendors, governments, and many other organizations.</p>



<p>What trends or changes do you see in the industry that are most exciting to you? How can OASIS position itself for what’s coming?<br>The integration of AI in all sectors, from healthcare and finance to cybersecurity, is revolutionizing how we analyze data, make decisions, and interact with digital systems. The potential for AI to drive efficiency and innovation is immense. We are seeing it every day. At the same time, there are a lot of risks. The European Union and the United States are increasingly acknowledging the evolving regulatory and policy framework concerning AI. A surge of guidelines around AI security, privacy, and ethics has been rolled out to ensure societal oversight over this technology. These regulatory measures are deemed essential not only to promote AI innovation but also to address the risks associated with it. Beyond mere regulation, it’s extremely important for organizations to create and implement AI technologies that are trustworthy and assume responsibility to alleviate the associated risks.</p>



<p>OASIS is actively engaging with emerging technology communities to stay ahead of the curve and influence the development of open standards from the early stages. OASIS is also launching educational initiatives to raise awareness about the implications of these trends and the crucial role of open standards in navigating them. We are engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders to address the challenges and opportunities presented by these trends.</p>



<p>What’s a fun fact about you?<br>I love playing the piano and guitar. It’s a great way to relax and think differently, especially after spending a lot of time in front of the computer. Music helps me come up with new ideas and see things from a different angle, plus it’s just really enjoyable!</p>

<p>By Jean-Philippe Salles, VP Product, Filigran</p> 


<p>Founded in 2022, <a href="https://filigran.io/">Filigran</a> is a European cybertech that offers open solutions encompassing threat intelligence, adversary simulation, and crisis response. At Filigran, we believe that embracing open standards, fostering information sharing, and putting the general interest first are pivotal to advancing cybersecurity. This dedication has led us to an exciting juncture: we’ve become a member of OASIS Open, where we’re fully dedicated to the future advancement of the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/csprd01/stix-v2.1-csprd01.html">STIX standard</a>.</p>



<p>Since Filigran’s inception, we’ve been tenacious in our implementation of the latest STIX data model within OpenCTI, Filigran’s open threat intelligence platform. Because CTI’s dynamic landscape requires an agile approach, &nbsp;we’ve strived to ensure OpenCTI consistently remains ahead of the curve. Our ongoing collaboration with the broader community has enriched the STIX 2.1 model, embedding it further within OpenCTI to address niches that the current model may not cater to comprehensively.</p>



<p>As we’ve grown — with a great team of over 20 experts and an impressive <a href="https://blog.filigran.io/filigran-series-seed-5-million-to-build-the-next-generation-open-source-extended-threat-5d2dce26d85e">seed funding of $5 million</a> —we are translating our hands-on experience and rich insights into direct contributions to the evolution of the STIX standard within our Extended Threat Management portfolio.</p>



      



<p>The OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee (TC) &amp; Filigran: A Perfect Synergy</p>



<p>Through collaboration with other members in the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti">OASIS CTI TC</a>, we aim to actively infuse our proficiency in technical standard implementation, expediting the inclusion of new iterations within our products.</p>



<p>A notable example is the exemplary work by the OASIS CTI TC on a STIX extension, laser-focused on incident handling. OpenCTI has concurrently been reflecting on this theme, meticulously refining our <a href="https://blog.filigran.io/opencti-case-management-is-ready-for-takeoff-what-is-available-and-whats-next-23f44cc7aa70">case management</a> modules. This synchronicity provides an opportune moment for collaboration. As a member of the TC, our dual goal is to share our learnings and to assimilate insights from OASIS, ensuring our products evolve seamlessly with the standard’s progression.</p>



<p>Our CEO, Samuel Hassine, summed this enthusiasm, stating, “Common language is the keystone for collaboration among CTI and blue teams. It’s a fundamental principle for our product line, especially for OpenCTI. Participating actively in the evolution of STIX is exhilarating, plus, there are more extension horizons to delve into, so the CTI community can expect exciting announcements soon!”</p>



<p>Beyond STIX: Filigran’s Expanding Vision</p>



<p>Our partnership with OASIS doesn’t end with STIX. Filigran’s broader vision encompasses proactive contributions to TAXII and other emergent cybersecurity standards. By consistently straddling the realms of theory and application, we intend to provide practical feedback from the front lines, helping shape policies and protocols that are both rigorous and implementable. Moreover, given our European heritage and reach, we’re uniquely positioned to bring a blend of global and regional perspectives, augmenting the universality of the standards.</p>



<p>The Road Ahead</p>



<p>Looking forward, we anticipate a flurry of synergistic activities. Regular workshops, cross-collaborations with other industry stalwarts, and participatory development are in the cards. Our experience with entities such as the European Commission, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), and the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) equips us with nuanced understandings that we’re eager to share.</p>



<p>In conclusion, through collaborative efforts with like-minded OASIS members, we’re determined to strengthen cybersecurity’s foundational pillars. We aim to foster a more secure digital future for all, enriched by shared expertise and powered by innovation.</p>

<p>The digital realm has witnessed a groundbreaking evolution in recent years, giving birth to a new buzzword capturing users’ imaginations worldwide: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-socialfi-a-beginners-guide-to-the-social-network-of-the-future">SocialFi</a>. It’s not just a buzzword; it’s a game-changer redefining how we interact with social media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll dive deep into the SocialFi phenomenon, exploring its immense potential and the unparalleled demand it’s generating. Furthermore, we’ll introduce you to <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/feeds-an-introduction/">Feeds</a>, a platform that empowers content creators to leverage the power of SocialFi and monetize their creative endeavors.</p>
 The Emergence of SocialFi 
<p>SocialFi, or Social Finance, is a paradigm shift in the world of social media. It represents a transformative departure from the traditional platforms where profits predominantly flow into the coffers of giant corporations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, SocialFi empowers users to directly benefit from their content and interactions, ushering in a new era of financial inclusion. At the forefront of this revolution is <a href="https://twitter.com/friendtech?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Friend.Tech</a>, an innovative platform that’s making waves with its impressive financial figures.</p>
 The Friend.Tech Phenomenon 
<p>Friend.Tech has not merely entered the social media arena but disrupted it. With an eye-popping <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/friend.tech">$313 million revenue run rate</a> and a staggering $156 million profit run rate, Friend.Tech is not just making headlines; it’s setting new standards. Even more remarkable is that this extraordinary financial success is achieved with a relatively modest user base of fewer than 15,000 individuals. Friend.Tech is redefining the rules of engagement in social media by allowing users to monetize their contributions to the platform directly. This was all illustrated very well by Crypto Social Media Influencer <a href="https://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1708519769379311779">Spencer Noon</a>.</p>
 The Power of Feeds 
<p></p>
<p>Now, let’s shift our gaze to <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-feeds-a-place-of-free-thought/">Feeds</a>, a revolutionary dApp based on the Elastos platform that seamlessly integrates into the SocialFi trend and empowers content creators in unprecedented ways. Feeds isn’t just a social media platform; it’s a dynamic ecosystem that allows content creators to monetize their work like never before.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At its core, Feeds facilitates tipping in ELA tokens, enabling users to support their favorite influencers and content creators directly. Unlike traditional Web2 platforms, where content creators often miss out on a significant portion of their revenue, Feeds ensures that creators reap the rewards of their hard work. It’s a win-win for both content creators and their dedicated followers.</p>
 Decentralized and Uncensorable 
<p>One of the most significant advantages of Feeds is its decentralized nature. It guarantees that content remains uncensorable, providing an ideal sanctuary for free expression. In an era where Web2 platforms have faced criticism for censoring content and stifling free speech, Feeds emerges as a beacon of hope. Your thoughts and ideas are your own, and they won’t be tampered with or taken down by external forces.</p>
<p></p>
 Ownership of Data 
<p>On traditional social media platforms, the content you create often becomes the property of the platform itself. This dynamic limits your control and affects the long-term ownership of your data. In contrast, Feeds empowers you with the capability to own your data, all thanks to the transformative power of <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/dids/intro/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> and Hive. These DIDs and Hive offer complete control over your data, allowing you to decide when and where it’s used or posted. It’s a game-changing shift that ensures your digital identity remains firmly in your grasp.</p>
 NFT Integration 
<p></p>
<p>Feeds takes its commitment to further empowering content creators by turning channels into NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This unique infrastructure not only validates the value of your content but also opens up exciting opportunities. Your channels are viewable on the <a href="https://pasarprotocol.io/">Pasar NFT Marketplace</a>, setting the stage for a future where you can potentially trade your channels and monetize your brand’s popularity in a decentralized marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other social media realms, accounts are often sold offline; Feeds offers a decentralized marketplace to facilitate these transactions more seamlessly. While it’s true that DIDs are tied to the original channel’s user, preventing the transfer of these NFTs. The Feeds team is actively working on enabling customizable DIDs, eventually allowing users to transact channels with one another. Once DIDs become transferable, the possibilities for monetization will be limitless.</p>
 Seamless Sharing 
<p></p>
<p>Feeds understands the importance of expanding your reach. It provides a platform for your content and ensures that your voice is heard far and wide. Feeds allows you to effortlessly share your content across various platforms, engaging with your audience and reaching new followers easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, or Twitter, Feeds is your ally in ensuring your content reaches its full potential. This seamless sharing functionality is a game-changer for content creators who seek to amplify their impact.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>As the SocialFi trend continues to gain momentum, platforms like Friend.Tech and Feeds promise to be the driving force behind a paradigm shift in social media. The rise of SocialFi is not just a buzzword; it’s a revolution in the making, and Friend.Tech is leading the way with its astounding financial success. While Friend.Tech sets the bar high, Feeds takes it a step further by empowering content creators to leverage the power of SocialFi, offering a platform where they can freely express themselves, monetize their creative work, and engage with their audience on their terms.</p>
<p>In a world where centralized platforms have often wielded too much power, SocialFi, and Feeds are reshaping the digital landscape, allowing users to express themselves, monetize their work, and engage with their audience without the fear of censorship or loss of control. The SocialFi wave is here, and Feeds is your surfboard. Are you ready to ride it to the next level of social media empowerment? The choice is yours, and the opportunities are boundless.</p>

<p>Background</p>



<p>In the world of user-controlled digital credentials, one thing has become clear – it’s not a question of if these technologies will be adopted, but when. Decision-makers from both public and private sectors around the world are increasingly inclined to integrate digital credentials into their organisations and ecosystems.</p>



<p>Once the choice to adopt user-controlled digital credentials is set, a fresh challenge pops up: navigating the sea of standards and tech options out there. Diving into the technical details of specifications can be overwhelming, especially when trying to weigh business requirements and other contextual factors against the many options available. The mountain of documentation doesn’t help either. It’s all too easy to get swamped by the choices and feel lost. Plus, grasping the subtle differences and trade-offs between specifications can be quite the hurdle.</p>



<p>So, is there a solution to simplify the process of selecting credential exchange protocols? Can we make it easier for individuals to choose the right option based on their specific context and requirements?</p>



<p>The Credential Exchange Protocols Task Force</p>



<p>At the Internet Identity Workshop, IIW 36, held in April 2023, we called a session titled “Creating a Credential Exchange Protocols Comparison Matrix”.</p>



<p>The concept arose from the need to address a prevalent issue and the desire to develop something akin to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4cYfjbbE-rABcfC-xab8miocKLomivYMUFibOh9BVo/edit#gid=1590639334">credential profile comparison matrix</a>, created by various contributors over the past year or so. The goal was to explore the possibility of achieving similar outcomes with credential exchange protocols. The session garnered significant interest, indicating a genuine commitment to advancing this effort.</p>



<p>To ensure a solid foundation for this initiative, we decided to find a home for it. The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation emerged as the ideal host, thanks to its community of experts, its welcoming and open culture, and its alignment with our goals. This effort primarily aims to enrich documentation around ToIP Layer 3 Trust Tasks related to credential exchange, which are among the most discussed trust tasks today. For the vision of digital trust within the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP architecture</a> to be realised, we need to streamline the process for those building trust applications that rely on digital credential exchanges.</p>



<p>Consequently, a dedicated Task Force within the Technology Stack Working Group was founded: The Credential Exchange Protocols Task Force. This group convenes weekly with a shared goal of driving this crucial work forward.</p>



<p>What has the Task Force accomplished to-date?</p>



 
 Since forming the task force, we have created a first version of the comparison criteria for digital credential issuance and presentation protocols: 
 



CategoriesSub-categories1. Protocol Objective(s)A. Protocol Objective(s)2. Protocol GovernanceA. Specification Link and Versioning<br>B. Specification Status/Maturity<br>C. Specification Body<br>D. Open Source / Intellectual Property Rights3. FeaturesA. Architecture Model<br>B. Support for Additional Trust Tasks<br>C. Communications Context<br>D. Security<br>E. Privacy<br>F. Performance/Scalability Constraints<br>G. Initiation Mechanism(s)<br>H. Transport Mechanism(s)<br>I. Authentication<br>J. Identifiers Types Supported<br>K. Credential Formats Supports<br>L. Compliance to Data Privacy Laws<br>M. Static Endpoint Discovery Process<br>N. Dynamic Endpoint Support<br>O. Additional Features4. Use CasesA. Use Case Flexibility<br>B. Offline/Online Support<br>C. Designed for Mobile Device Use<br>D. Designed for Web Browser Use<br>E. Support for Cross-device Flows<br>F. Rigidity and Flexibility of Protocol5. AdoptionA. Technology Readiness Level (TRL)<br>B. Deployment Viability<br>C. Current Implementations<br>D. Education Requirements<br>E. Deployment Complexity<br>F. Implementation Standards



 
 The group has fully documented these four issuance protocols against the above comparison criteria: 
 



 
 ACDC 



 ISO 23220-3 



 Issue Credential v2 



 OpenID4VCI 
 



<p>Here’s a sneak peek at what the comparison matrix is looking like:</p>







<p>The first version of the documentation is available here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_KKQZmmNRnEME96fZCPbMW-TC9j0tQ-dVuk5zzKa8U8/edit#gid=1229620925">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_KKQZmmNRnEME96fZCPbMW-TC9j0tQ-dVuk5zzKa8U8/edit#gid=1229620925</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that for the first version of the comparison matrix, we wanted to select a small number of protocols based on where the working group is seeing market demand. Since this effort is a lot of work, we also wanted to start small so that we could achieve a realistic version 1.</p>



<p>IIW 37</p>



<p>Because this effort was started by a session at the last <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a>, it made sense that we reconvene at IIW 37, this in October 10-12 at the Computer Science Museum in Mountain View, California.</p>



<p>During this event, we will call a session to provide an overview of the progress achieved so far. We will seek feedback from the community and implementers of digital credentialing infrastructure. This input is invaluable as it guides our task force toward the most beneficial direction for all stakeholders.</p>



<p>What are we working on next?</p>



 
 We will continue to refine the issuance protocols matrix. Our vision is to create a lightweight ‘cheat-sheet’ type of document, that will refer to further documentation underneath for anyone wishing to go deeper. 



 We will start working on documenting the presentation protocols against the same common set of criteria. 



 We want to start involving any architect or technical product owners that are decision makers or make recommendations on digital credential strategy, so that we can ensure that we’re creating a valuable document for them. 
 



<p>Want to get involved?</p>



<p>Our Task Force holds meetings every Wednesday at NA/EU: 09:00-10:00 ET / 15:00-16:00 CET. You can find the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings/">calendar event here</a>. Please feel free to join our next meeting on October 18, 2023.</p>

<p>Founded in 2017 with a vision of empowering organizations and individuals with verified data, Dock has established itself as a pioneer in the <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.identity.foundation">decentralized identity</a> space. </p><p>Dock’s <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Verifiable Credential platform</a> makes any data fraud-proof and instantly verifiable. It comprises the Certs API, the Certs no-code web app, an ID wallet, and a dedicated blockchain.</p><p>While the company’s decentralized identity solutions can be implemented for a variety of use cases, Dock is currently focused on identity verification, health and safety, finance, education, and workforce sectors.</p><p>Why Decentralized Identity Matters for Organizations and Individuals</p><p>In today's digital age, managing and safeguarding identity data is essential. For organizations, decentralized identity represents a transformative approach that enhances data security, improves compliance to data regulations, and reduces operational costs associated with traditional identity management by eliminating the manual verification of physical documents, which speeds up the verification process.<br></p><p>For individuals, decentralized identity enables people to move towards reclaiming control of their data, reducing the risks of data breaches, and simplifying their online interactions. </p><p>The State of Verifiable Credential Adoption<br></p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Verifiable Credential</a> is a digital document that proves something about you, such as your identity, qualifications, or membership in a group. It's issued by a trusted source, like a school or government agency, and you can use it online to prove things about yourself. A variety of documents can be issued as Verifiable Credentials including educational certificates, driver’s licenses, passport, and professional licenses.<br></p><p>There is a global shift in the identity sector as private organizations and governments around the world are implementing digital identity initiatives. Examples include:<br></p>  <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/driving-licence/digital-driver-license?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Digital driver's license</a> projects (also known as mobile driver's licenses) are implemented in the US, Korea, UK, Australia, Denmark, and the Netherlands among others.  Electronic identification (eID) systems are becoming the standard in various parts of the world.  The total addressable market for reusable identity in 2026 is estimated to be somewhere between <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/market-opportunity-for-reusable-identity/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">$133B and $533B globally.</a> <br>  <p>These digital identity initiatives boost the demand for Verifiable Credentials because the technology enables users to prove their identity, qualifications, and claims securely in a privacy-preserving manner to efficiently access a variety of services and products. <br></p><p>How Verifiable Credentials Add Business Value</p><p>1. Reduced Organizational Costs<br><br>Merit Protocol is a platform that connects employers with financial service companies to enable employees to get better access to financial services. The company <a href="https://blog.dock.io/merit-protocol-and-dock-partnership/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">integrated Dock’s Verifiable Credential technology</a> to enable employers to issue fraud-proof credentials that can instantly verify employment history and income data. Alex Lyashok, Merit Protocol’s CEO and Co-Founder, anticipates that this will reduce the cost of the loan application process by up to ten times while preserving employees’ privacy.<br></p><p>In terms of reduced data storage expenses, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlHBqssIMtM&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dock interviewed Marie Wallace</a>, the Managing Director and Digital Identity Lead at Accenture, she spoke about the benefits she experienced by using a decentralized data architecture with the implementation of IBM’s Digital Health Pass. Digital Health Pass was one of the biggest IBM projects she was involved in with the least number of issues, which she attributes to the decentralized data architecture. <br></p><p>Marie said, “We were issuing millions of these credentials and hundreds of millions of verifications, and our systems were super lightweight. You didn’t have these situations where you were concerned about servers going down or the internet glitching because that just never ever was an issue.” <br></p><p>2. Instant Credential Verification<br></p><p>Traditional verification processes often take days, weeks, or even months. In the US for example, thousands of <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2022/03/11/nurse-licenses?ref=blog.identity.foundation">nurses waited for months, often over 6 months</a> to get their nursing licenses after they completed their program as a result of delays in the verification and issuance processes. Verifiable Credentials enable healthcare employers to instantly verify credentials in seconds which can significantly speed up the hiring process.<br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Hh9kq29bPSA?feature=shared&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dr. Wendy Charles from BurstIQ</a>, Dock’s customer, explained why she wishes more employers and training institutions would issue Verifiable Credentials. <br></p><p>She had to hire research staff with very specific qualifications and all of the resumes she looked at claimed these qualifications. Because there was no way she could really know if they had the right skills, sometimes she ended up hiring people that were ultimately unqualified. She said, “My greatest concern was that an unqualified person could harm their patients. If there were two candidates that had comparable presentations in their resumes and interviews, I would hire the one with verified credentials.” <br></p><p>3. Efficient Credential Issuance<br></p><p>SEVENmile, an entrepreneurial program in Australia that connects high school students with business owners to learn problem-solving techniques, used Dock to issue <a href="https://www.dock.io/use-case-sevenmile?ref=blog.identity.foundation">hundreds of digital graduation certificates</a> as Verifiable Credentials.<br></p><p>“At SEVENmile Ltd., we believe that the move to ownership of our personal data will help transform how the internet functions and how our data will be protected. We’re applying this philosophy by working with Dock to secure the credentials of students we train,” said Greg Twemlow, SEVENmile’s CEO.<br></p><p>4. Enhanced Privacy and Security With Fraud-Proof Credentials<br></p><p>Verifiable Credentials are designed to enhance privacy by giving individuals full control of their data. With decentralized identity, personal data is securely stored with the individual’s digital identity wallet rather than being scattered across multiple company databases. Users can choose who they share their identity with and to what extent. <br></p><p>Centralized databases are prime targets for hackers because they can access a large amount of user info at once. By decentralizing identity data, the "honeypot" effect is minimized, making large scale breaches less likely. <br></p><p>Gravity Training is a leading training provider of commercial work-at-height solutions in South Africa with international locations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and India. The organization uses Dock to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1jUoQXNHFU&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">eliminate health and safety certificate fraud</a>. Fake health and safety certificates is a big problem in South Africa and creates a huge risk when companies hire unqualified people with high-risk construction work. <br></p><p>Before using Dock’s certification platform, the organization had to manually issue thousands of certificates, which took a lot of time and resources. Employers and inspectors had to contact the issuer directly to ensure the certificates were valid. With Dock, Gravity can now automate the issuance of thousands of fraud-proof certificates a year that can be instantly verified. <br></p><p>5. Enhanced Compliance<br></p><p>In an era where data privacy and security are essential, Verifiable Credentials can play a key part in an organization’s compliance toolbox, by providing a secure and standardized method for handling sensitive information.<br></p><p>While Verifiable Credentials alone don’t necessarily guarantee compliance, they can be used as a tool as part of a larger compliance program and it depends on how they’re implemented. For example, Verifiable Credentials makes it easier for BurstIQ to comply with data regulations including GDPR and HIPAA while <a href="https://www.dock.io/use-case-burst-iq?ref=blog.identity.foundation">making health data verifiable, secure, and portable</a>. <br></p><p>6. Interoperability<br></p><p>Interoperability ensures that our systems, services, and data can seamlessly connect and communicate with one another. In the context of credentials, this means that individuals, organizations, and institutions can exchange verified information and credentials across various platforms, applications, and systems without encountering compatibility issues. <br></p><p>Credentials that follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">W3C Verifiable Credential standard</a> are interoperable, which enhances efficiency, reduces friction, and unlocks new revenue streams for businesses.

<p>By Mark Haine &amp; Drummond Reed</p>



<p>This blog post is being published jointly by the ToIP Foundation and the OpenID Foundation because it addresses a key piece of the interoperability puzzle on which we collaborate to achieve our mutual missions. We hope it is an example of the increasing synergy we will need to achieve globally interoperable decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



<p>A persistent goal of digital identity technology is to enable relying parties to reach the level of identity assurance they need to proceed with any specific interaction. Although there are many descriptions of “identity assurance levels”, such as the three levels defined in the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST SP 800-63</a> series <a>(1)</a>, the goal itself is technology-independent, i.e., it remains the same no matter what technology is used to achieve it.</p>



<p>For the past three years, the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group</a> at the<a href="https://openid.net/"> OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) has been working on a specification called OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance as an extension to<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html"> OpenID Connect</a>. This specification has had contributions from a wide range of countries and industries as well as multiple early implementations.</p>



<p>More recently, the verifiable credentials (VC) community has begun to discuss how digital wallets and VCs could convey the information necessary to achieve different levels of identity assurance. But they have not yet converged on the specifics.</p>



<p>Given the universal need for identity assurance, the underlying meaning of the terms we use should be the same regardless of the specific technology used to convey the assertions. That was exactly the conclusion reached by the OIDF<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/"> eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group</a>. They decided to modularize the OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance draft, separating out the schema definition for an element called “verified_claims”. They realised that this JSON structure could be, in their words, “re-usable across many different contexts and application layer protocols including but not limited to OpenID Connect and Verifiable Credentials”. The separated schema definition will also be available to the newly formed <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">Digital Credential Protocols Working Group (DCP WG)</a>, that is working on OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations drafts.</p>



<p>The new specification is called OpenID Identity Assurance Schema Definition. The schema it defines allows representation of the wide variety of semantics defined in different identity assurance standards such as NIST SP 800-63, ISO/IEC 29115, UK GPG45, and eIDAS. It includes a significant number of optional elements to allow for any depth of description (from minimised to very verbose) of the identity assurance level, process and evidence that underpin the digital identity in question.</p>



<p>This new specification reflects the advice of a recent white paper from the Open Identity Exchange (OIX) called<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/networks/87/item.html?id=700"> Data Standards for Digital ID Interoperability</a>. Regarding international interoperability of higher assurance digital identity, it says:</p>



<p>“A single protocol independent data standard must be created. It must allow core ID information and evidence to be communicated consistently, regardless of the protocol used to securely exchange it (e.g.OIDC, Verifiable Credentials). The OIX view is that this should be based on the<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html#section-appendix.b"> OIDC for Identity Assurance</a> standard.”</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation welcomes this new specification and looks forward to reviewing and commenting because it fits perfectly into the goal of ToIP architecture: enabling universal interoperability of decentralized digital trust infrastructure, including digital wallets and VCs. Any standard that helps ToIP achieve this goal is a step in the right direction, especially one that addresses the real, quantifiable market need for faster, easier, stronger digital identity assurance.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the need for higher levels of identity assurance is a signal that a digital trust ecosystem is mature enough to need the governance tools and models such as the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/02/01/the-toip-foundation-releases-its-first-official-governance-specifications/">ToIP Foundation has been developing</a> over the past three years. Policies that clearly specify the level of identity assurance required for a particular transaction—together with the digital wallets and credentials that can satisfy those policies—are the oil that can make the flow of commerce easier and faster for all participants.</p>



<p>The next step is for the OIDF to advance their suite of identity assurance specifications to the final approval stage. After this, market forces are expected to drive the development of a set of re-usable profiles of these standards that meet the needs of different digital trust ecosystems across many different industries and jurisdictions. At that point we should finally begin seeing the market traction for digital identity assurance, whether centralized, federated or decentralized, that has long been one of the holy grails of our industry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In today’s digital age, a surprising portion of the world — <a href="https://2020.internethealthreport.org/slideshow-internet-health/#10">only half, according to Mozilla </a>— are considered to be online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, connectivity measures often only highlight basic access to the internet. Research has shown that <a href="https://a4ai.org/research/advancing-meaningful-connectivity-towards-active-and-participatory-digital-societies/">meaningful connectivity</a> – “a measure of whether someone can regularly access the internet on an appropriate device with sufficient data and a fast connection” – lags far behind official measures of internet connectivity. Urban internet users and men were found to be more likely to have access to meaningful connectivity, and those with access were found to have increased participation in online activities and political awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lack of meaningful connectivity is a hurdle faced by many civil society organisations globally, and from our work with a variety of organisations, we’ve noted a recurring challenge: the high cost of reliable internet and modern equipment. According to a <a href="https://connecthumanity.fund/digital-inequity-report/">survey by Connect Humanity and TechSoup</a>, while 95% of organisations recognise the internet’s importance, a substantial 78% feel limited by inadequate internet access and a lack of digital tools. This issue impedes many civil society organisations from <a href="https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/are-barriers-to-digital-technology-preventing-civil-society-organisations-from-achieving-their-potential/">achieving their full potential</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, the pandemic exacerbated digital gaps, especially in areas like Latin America where marginalised groups, including Brazil’s indigenous communities, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/">were most affected</a>. A recent study by Derechos Digitales highlights how this lack of connectivity hinders access to fundamental rights like <a href="https://www.derechosdigitales.org/amazonia/">education, health, and freedom of speech</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognising these challenges fuels our commitment to helping to bridge the digital divide. We regularly interact with partners in regions with low connectivity and many times we find ourselves working from these regions as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we often resort to asynchronous work when working remotely, nothing can substitute a call when we need to discuss projects or share knowledge. For this reason, we’ve put together some guidance on what to do before and during calls that has helped us navigate these low connectivity issues over the years. We hope you find these useful and are open to hearing what else you’ve tried.</p>



 Tips for better calls in low connectivity situations  



 Before the Call 



 Make sure you have a good connection 



<p>Dealing with low internet connectivity can be frustrating, but there are several strategies you can try out before the call to increase your chances of having a successful call:</p>



<p>1. Check connection speed: Regularly test your internet connection speed using websites like www.speedtest.net. Ensure that your speed meets the minimum requirement of at least 8 Mbps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Adjust your router : Adjust your wifi router for better performance. Place it in the center of the room, on a table or shelf (not on the floor) to improve signal distribution. Keep the router away from electronic devices like televisions, telephones, and Bluetooth devices, as they can interfere with the signal.</p>



<p>3. Boost your wifi signal: Enhance your wifi router’s signal by wrapping the antenna with an empty aluminum can or empty Pringles container. The aluminum in the containers will help focus your wifi toward the selected direction, effectively boosting the strength of the signal. Cutting the top and bottom of the container allows for easy attachment to the antenna, boosting the signal’s range and strength.</p>



<p>4. Reboot your router: Reboot your router to prevent potential connectivity issues caused by continuous usage.</p>



<p>5. Optimise wifi Channel: Like radios, routers transmit your wifi connection over one of fourteen available channels which are determined by their frequency. Quite often, routers are preset to the same channel out the box which means many of your neighbors are also using the same one.&nbsp; To change the channel that your router uses, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/197268/how-to-find-the-best-wi-fi-channel-for-your-router-on-any-operating-system/">check for neighboring wifi networks</a> and switch your router’s wifi channel to one that isn’t being used by your neighbors. This reduces interference and can lead to a more stable connection.</p>



 Make sure your device is optimised 



<p>Sometimes connectivity issues are related to individual devices rather than the internet connection itself. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve device-related problems:</p>



<p>1. Check your Device Connection: Ensure that the device you are using to access the internet is <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/check-network-connection-status-of-wireless-devices-818268">properly connected to the wifi network</a> or Ethernet cable.</p>



<p>2. Update Software: Keep your devices, including computers and smartphones, up to date with the latest software and firmware updates. Updates often contain bug fixes and improvements that can enhance device performance and stability.</p>



<p>3. Clear Cache and Cookies: Over time, your devices’ cache and cookies can accumulate, slowing down internet performance. Regularly <a href="https://its.uiowa.edu/support/article/719">clear these temporary files</a> to optimise your browsing experience.</p>



<p>4. Optimise Device Settings: Adjust your device’s settings to prioritise internet performance. For example,when your internet connectivity is slow you can allocate more bandwidth to essential tasks by closing other apps that are using the internet.</p>



<p>5. Use a Backup Device: If your primary computer or device experiences issues, consider having a backup device that you can switch to temporarily while troubleshooting the problem.</p>



 During the call 



<p>1. Turn off video: Video generally requires more bandwidth than audio. In situations where your internet connection is low, it may be worth turning off your video to minimise the load on your internet connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Optimise Device Usage: Limit the number of devices that are connected to your wifi. Temporarily disconnect devices that are not in use or that can go without a constant internet connection, such as smart TVs, tablets, and cell phones. This can free up bandwidth and improve overall connectivity.</p>



<p>3. Take shared notes: Using collaborative documents such as <a href="https://pad.riseup.net/">EtherPad</a> or Google Docs and keeping detailed notes as you go will make it easier for all call participants to follow the conversation, even if they get disconnected. Bonus: You can then share these same notes with others after the call!</p>



<p>4. Communicate more than usual: When cameras are off,&nbsp; you can’t see things like who enjoyed the joke, or simply who wants to speak. In those instances, we recommend making sure that people feel seen by <a href="https://www.trainingforchange.org/training_tools/low-bandwidth-strategies/">inviting them to share their thoughts and verbalizing what you’re seeing</a> on the screen or in the chat.&nbsp;</p>



 However&nbsp; 



<p>We firmly believe that the challenges of navigating poor connectivity and limited access to the internet should not solely fall on the shoulders of civil society. It’s unfair to expect social justice organisations to address these issues without support. In an ideal world, access to the internet would be considered a fundamental right, equitably available to all. However, until that vision becomes a reality, we are committed to sharing strategies and tips. We do this because we hold that every organisation, irrespective of its size or mission, deserves robust infrastructure. Such a foundation is essential for organisations to organise their daily work and operations effectively.</p>The post <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/ensuring-communication-for-social-justice-organisations-with-unstable-internet/">Ensuring Communication for Social Justice Organisations with Unstable Internet&nbsp;</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org">The Engine Room</a>.

<p>A few weeks ago, we shared that we’re starting a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-working-towards-a-healthier-and-more-robust-information-ecosystem-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/">new project</a> aimed at contributing to a healthy and robust information ecosystem in Latin America and the Caribbean, supported by the Latin America Program at Open Society Foundations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To kick off this project, we’re hosting a community call on October 26 to talk about the challenges civil society is facing in the information ecosystem in Latin America and the opportunities we see for action. This will be the first of a series of calls that we’ll host throughout this project (so keep an eye on our blog to learn about upcoming events!).&nbsp;</p>

 Join our conversation 



<p>We would love for digital rights activists, internet movement builders, civic technologists, data protection experts, transparency activists, human rights defenders, philanthropic institutions, tech developers, and academics from Latin America and the Caribbean who are interested in sharing their perspectives and ideas with us.</p>



<p>Our community call is happening on Thursday, October 26, starting at 9am Mexico City, 10am Bogotá, 11am Port-au-Prince, 12pm Santiago.

 Highlights from Season 7 of The Tao of WAO&nbsp;podcast <p>We’ve recently wrapped the seventh season of our podcast where we explored the complex and ever-evolving world of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>From ethical considerations and societal implications to the nuances of AI literacy, the season offered a comprehensive exploration that went beyond the technical jargon. Laura and Doug engaged in critical conversations that aimed to demystify this transformative technology, offering listeners a balanced perspective on its potential and pitfalls.</p><p>This blog post serves as a retrospective, highlighting key moments and insights from a season dedicated to understanding AI in all its dimensions.</p> Relevant links   <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/">Season overview&nbsp;page</a>  <a href="https://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:938068006/sounds.rss">RSS feed</a>  <a href="https://pod.link/1568662122">Pod.link</a> (provides links to subscribe via your favourite platform)   Episode 1 — Curiosity is&nbsp;Human <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e01-curiosity-is-human/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>We discuss concept of curiosity with guests Paul Ashcroft and Garrick Jones. The conversation explores the historical evolution of curiosity, its role in innovation, and its impact on emotional and physical well-being. The guests explore into how curiosity can be nurtured like a muscle and its significance in the age of AI and digital transformation.</p>  Paul Ashcroft: “Essentially you can hack your own biological system just by being curious.”  Garrick Jones: “It’s fascinating how I think the curious and the innovative were relegated to the ninth level of hell, which is the worst hell in Dante’s Inferno. And because they want to mess with the structures.”   Episode 2 – Credentials &amp;&nbsp;AI <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e02-credentials-ai/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Tim Riches and Omid Mufeed join us to discuss the evolution and future of Navigatr, a platform focused on skills recognition through Open Badges. They highlight the role of AI in simplifying the badge creation process and its potential to personalise learning pathways. The platform aims to bridge the gap between skills and employment opportunities, offering a live jobs feed linked to&nbsp;badges.</p>  Omid Mufeed: “Why can’t we have the technologies that tell us what to learn next to change our&nbsp;lives?”  Tim Riches: “It’d be great if you could just kind of switch the app on wherever you were…and it could start to show you things which just got you interested first and got you engaged in learning and then started to open up opportunities for&nbsp;work.”   Episode 3 — Cognitive Liberty <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e03-cognitive-liberty/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Laura and Doug tackle the ethical and societal implications of AI. They discuss its potential as a ‘thought partner’ in decision-making, the concept of cognitive liberty, and the risks of AI entrenching existing power structures.</p>  Laura Hilliger: “How do we ensure that people keep cognitive liberty if they’re being manipulated by these algorithms or by&nbsp;AI?”  Doug Belshaw: “Our democratic and civic infrastructure is being replaced by decision-making tools which are beholden to a small&nbsp;elite.”   Episode 4 — Public Service and&nbsp;AI <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e04-public-ai/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Matt Jukes comes on the podcast to discuss his career journey, which spans various roles in the public sector, including his current (at the time) position at the Office for National Statistics. He talks about the challenges of digital transformation in the public sector, emphasising the importance of user needs and data. Matt also shares his views on leadership, AI, the role of blogging, and the need for a supportive culture to drive&nbsp;change.</p>  Matt Jukes: “Ministers particularly are fascinated with [AI] and are pushing departments and and digital teams and their policy people across every corner of government to to see how it can be&nbsp;used.   Episode 5 — Workforce development <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e05-workforce-development/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Prof. Krystal Rawls joins to advocate the importance of community involvement in technology adoption, particularly in bridging the digital divide. She emphasises that solving community issues is not just about providing devices but also about removing the fear of innovation and technology. Krystal argues for a more holistic, respectful approach to community needs, advocating for the use of AI and other technologies as tools for empowerment. She also touches on the ethical considerations of technology adoption, stressing the need to respect different cultures and perspectives.</p>  Krystal Rawls: “And so from my lens, things as simple as right, I have to train people on how to use this technology. How about I provide you with some prompts of AI and a training in AI and let you go and learn for yourself and interrogate for yourself the things that you need to know. And so I can be used in some really innovative ways to help close the digital&nbsp;divide.”   Episode 6 — AI&nbsp;Literacy <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e06-ai-literacy/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Doug and Laura wrap up the season by exploring the complexities of AI literacy, and emphasising the need for critical thinking and mentorship when interacting with AI tools. They discuss the limitations of AI, likening it to a “competent intern,” and discuss the ethical and societal implications of AI’s lack of transparency and potential for bias. The conversation also touches on the need for collective decision-making in AI governance and the importance of understanding the data on which AI models are&nbsp;trained.</p>  Doug Belshaw: “It’s interesting because one of the things that people have said is that it means that everybody gets a tutor now, but. Everyone doesn’t get a tutor as much as a research assistant.”  Laura Hilliger: “You know, when the when the printing press was was invented, it’s the time between the printing press being invented and like the masses being able to read because there is huge cultural and societal shift during like during these kind of in-between times. And I feel like with tech, we’ve been in that in-between time for 20, 30 years and with AI moving faster and faster, it feels like being web literate, information literate, media literate, tech literate, AI literate, anything that puts the literacy on it is, you know, is a it’s a moving target.&nbsp;Right?”   Next season <p>We’ve already begun recording Season 7 and are in the planning stages of Season 8, which will focused on Shaping a Media Literate Society: Exploring the Future Landscape of Media and Information Literacy.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shaping-media-literate-society-exploring-future-landscape/">Read more about Season 8&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/a-deep-dive-into-the-ethics-literacy-and-application-of-ai-8536e1814017">A Deep Dive into the Ethics, Literacy, and Application of AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>                <p>This lecture took place on 18 October 2023. </p>
<p>There is a growing unease about technology and its impact on our lives. Tech giants have grown too powerful. Our privacy is undermined. Social media is hurting our kids. Creators are not getting paid fairly. Disinformation and polarization are the norm.</p>
<p>While the solutions to these problems are largely human, (perhaps ironically) a new set of technologies can help to put us back on course: Blockchains, which enable individuals and businesses to move and store value, automate complex business processes are the first digital medium for value. AI is pushing the boundary of human and machine capability.  The Internet of Things connects everyday objects, robots and even self-driving cars to the web, forming an intelligent network for our connected world.  Augmented and virtual realities, extends our 2D web into a spatial web.</p>
<p>In this webinar, Alex Tapscott, author of the new book “Web3: Charting the Internet’s Next Economic and Cultural Frontier” explains how these technologies are not separate but related.  The Web is entering a new era and with it bringing a new internet and a new platform for the other technologies of a new digital age.   In much the same way as the term “Internet” has expanded from its original narrow inter-networking technical definition to describe an era that included many technologies, business models and social behaviors, so too is the term Web3 evolving to describe the next era with these technologies playing the defining role.</p>

<p>The following is part of an ongoing series by Elastos community leaders sharing key trends and takeaways from Token2049 and crypto events in and around Singapore. <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/hot-topics-at-token-2049/">Check out the last post</a> by Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Business Development at Elastos. In this edition we hear from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashmitchell/">Sasha Mitchell</a>, Founder of <a href="https://ela.city/home">Elacity</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the get-go, as soon as I landed at the Changi airport in Singapore, I had little time to spare before heading straight to the Bitcoin Layer 2 event hosted by <a href="https://elastos.info/digital-destiny/">Elastos</a>. Over the week, I came to learn extensively about the Web3 space at Token2049. This collective knowledge helped paint a picture of a future where data management is far more user-centric, secure, and efficient, and where governance can be transparent and accountable. For five key takeouts of Token 2049, you can read my article <a href="https://medium.com/@elacity2822/se-asia-is-pioneering-web3-five-key-take-outs-from-singapore-5135d212cd01">here</a>, in this piece, let’s discuss a little about Bitcoin Layer 2 and Elastos. Blockchain at its core is about bringing trust back into the system and creating trust in a trust-less environment, and I believe Elastos can deliver this alongside Bitcoin’s security, so let’s dive in!<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bitcoin remains the market leader with a $500 billion market cap, doubling its closest rival, Ethereum. Bitcoin’s hash rate measures the network’s computational power, serving as an indicator of its security and efficiency. It’s rising hash rate over the years signifies increased mining activity, making the network more resilient against potential attacks, despite price volatility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year, Bitcoin Ordinals has revolutionised non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by using Bitcoin’s architecture to transform “Satoshis” into unique assets through “inscriptions”. These shifts signal a future where Bitcoin’s role extends beyond a simple financial asset to become a versatile platform for various applications. This transformation is enabled by smart contracts and decentralized data management systems, which are components of scalable Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network and Elastos, which can settle back into the secure mainchain.</p>
<p>Something new I learnt about was Ricardian Contracts, which integrate legality and cryptographic verification, providing a digitally secure and legally binding agreement. By hashing the contract and providing a unique identifier, we can ensure that all parties can easily verify the most current and authentic version of the agreement. This approach addresses issues of document versioning and legality, thereby revolutionising the digital contract landscape. Ricardian Contracts blend smart contract features with traditional legal agreements, allowing for preset, executable actions across multiple blockchain architectures, including Bitcoin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It became clear to me that Elastos can redefine Bitcoin’s ecosystem with its <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/decentralized-identifiers-transforming-digital-identity-management/">DID</a>, <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/hivehub-evolving-decentralized-storage-in-the-elastos-ecosystem/">Hive</a>, and <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/carrier-2-0-an-evolution-in-connectivity/">Carrier</a> technologies, serving as the foundation for “Personal Knowledge Containers.” This next-gen Layer 2 storage solution surpasses traditional methods like NAS and Dropbox, using a robust tech stack including Istio, Docker, IPFS, Tor, and libp2p to enable peer-to-peer trading using Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols and decentralised web nodes. The objective is to categorise data assets hierarchically into files, pages, and services, thereby enabling peer-to-peer trading alongside Bitcoin Layer 2 payment protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elastos can help facilitate this environment through its <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/how-dids-solve-issues-of-digital-identity/">decentralised identifier sidechain</a> which acts as a control hub, and support storage solutions through Hive, and Carrier for peer-to-peer networking. With <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/the-access-economy-decentralized-identity-digital-rights-and-ownership-in-the-age-of-web3/">Elacity DRM</a> enabling data packaging and <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/runtime-the-missing-piece-of-web3/">Runtime</a> innovation for secure playback, Elabox’s plug-and-play OS service, and <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/essentials-wallet-adds-bittorrent-chain/">Essentials</a> SuperWallet’s toolsets that incorporate Elastos and already support the Lightning Network, it becomes evident our ecosystem and innovations are all capable of converging to a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution.</p>
<p>To further explore Bitcoin Layer 2, it’s worth noting that Elastos’ mainchain is secured by Bitcoin miners’ hash power. This architecture enables a secure, decentralized ecosystem in which ELA, Elastos’ native currency, plays a pivotal role. ELA serves not only as gas to pay for transactions across the ecosystem but also as collateral and voting power to annually elect 12 DAO council members for governance. These council members vote on wide-ranging proposals, from funding to infrastructure, and also become supernodes that power Elastos’ sidechains. ELA-elected council nodes enhance the platform’s security beyond the mainchain and facilitate infinitely horizontally scalable solutions, such as its EVM sidechain for smart contracts.</p>
<p>Being directly connected to Bitcoin, our main chain offers additional avenues for innovations like Ordinal NFTs. These could alleviate congestion in Bitcoin’s NFT network through the potential use of sELA inscriptions. With a limited coin supply of 28.22 million and built-in halving mechanisms, ELA shares strong similarities with BTC. It leverages its role as a ‘Queen’ in security, complemented by a suite of innovative supporting services, DAO governance and sidechains.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Amidst past upheavals like FTX and Three Arrows Capital, the prospect of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs injects the tech space with much-needed liquidity and optimism. As traditional systems falter, the emerging Web3 landscape offers a parallel economy rooted in freedom. The excitement in Singapore showcases fresh thought leadership, transformative tech, and new economic models. I had the chance to meet many interesting people from many different fields. With continuous innovations, the sector inches closer to realizing Web3’s promise of a digitally interconnected world. And for Bitcoin and Elastos, don’t underestimate the power these two technologies and communities can bring as a merged mined solution. </p>
<p>All signs indicate that 2024 will be a pivotal year for the space!</p>

<p>This article describes the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/post-mortem-ceramic-discord-breach/">problem of session hijacking</a> and how you can create a more secure session by combining <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Sign-in with Ethereum</a> and non-extractable keys from the WebCrypto APIs.</p> The Problem <p>A session is established in essentially all applications where users sign in. These sessions typically rely on cookies, JWTs, or similar technologies. The way they are established is roughly as follows: a user arrives at an application and authenticates in some way, usually through signing in with a username and password. The application's backend server verifies the login and creates a valid session for the user.</p><p>The session itself is stored locally in the user’s browser as a cookie or JWT. Unfortunately, this client-side data can be stolen. This is normally referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking?ref=blog.ceramic.network">session hijacking</a>—and this exact attack recently caused a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/post-mortem-ceramic-discord-breach/">breach of the Ceramic discord server</a>.</p><p>Session hijacking works when a hacker is able to intercept the user's JWT (or other session ID). They can then use this locally on their computer to fool the application backend server into thinking that they are in fact signed in as the user. Once they are signed in, they could take all kinds of malicious actions not approved by the user.</p><p>An unfortunate fact is that in many cases, Sign-in with Ethereum is also vulnerable to this because the suggested way sessions are established is <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/sign-in-with-ethereum/quickstart-guide/implement-sessions?ref=blog.ceramic.network">through cookies</a>. So, what can we do about this?</p> Non-Extractable Session Keys <p>The main problem with the sessions outlined above is that the data that authenticates the session can be stolen. What if there was a way to have a session where this information was impossible to copy? Well, in fact, the &nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web Crypto API</a> provides provides such functionality. This API can (among other things) be used to generate cryptographic key pairs. By default, both the public and the private key for these key pairs live in memory on web pages, which wouldn't improve the situation at all.</p><p>However, the private key can be made “non-extractable” by setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CryptoKey/extractable?ref=blog.ceramic.network">extractable property</a> to false. This makes it impossible for any JavaScript code or browser extension to access the private key material, effectively making it impossible to steal it. These keys can also be persisted in your application by storing them in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IndexedDB</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that this solution is not perfect. If a malicious script somehow gets injected into the client, it may still use the user's key while they have their tab open. However, as soon as the tab is closed, the hacker could no longer use this key, which is a significant improvement from complete loss of a session.</p> How to use DIDSession <p>Ok, so how can we use this to make our Sign-in with Ethereum sessions more secure? <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/introduction?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDSession</a> is an open-source library that we created at Ceramic to make it easy to use non-extractable keys to secure Sign-in with Ethereum sessions. This library treats your Ethereum address as a <code><a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">did:pkh</a></code>and the non-extractable session key as a <code><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">did:key</a></code>. A SIWE signature is used to delegate permissions from your Ethereum address to the session key. A server can then verify that a message originated from a session key that has been granted permissions from the Ethereum account. To use DIDSession, you first need to install it in your application.</p> Creating a session <p>First we create a session. The code below will prompt the user to sign a SIWE message and finally a session will be created. This session will automatically be persisted in IndexedDB.</p> <code>import { DIDSession } from 'did-session'
import { EthereumWebAuth, getAccountId } from '@didtools/pkh-ethereum'

const ethProvider = window.ethereum // Metamask, WalletConnect or similar
const addresses = await ethProvider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })
const accountId = await getAccountId(ethProvider, addresses[0])
const authMethod = await EthereumWebAuth.getAuthMethod(ethprovider, accountId)

const session = await DIDSession.get(accountId, authMethod)
</code>  Sign a message and send to server <p>Using the session, the application can now sign any arbitrary message and send this message and the object-capability (SIWE message) along to a server. All signed messages will happen in the background without any further action required by the user.</p> <code>const jws = await session.did.createJWS({ hello: 'world' })

const request = {
  capability: session.did.capability
  jws,
}

// send the request object to your backend server
</code>  Validate user action on server <p>Once the request is received on a server, its signature can be verified; simply looking at the object-capability we can see which user took the given action.</p> <code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import * as KeyResolver from 'key-did-resolver'

const did = new DID({ resolver: KeyResolver.getResolver() })

const result = await did.verifyJWS(request.jws, { capability: request.capability })

console.log('User account:', request.capability.p.iss)
console.log('User action:', result.payload)
</code>  Benefit of Using Ceramic <p>While DIDSession can improve security of SIWE, when interacting with a backend server, we can take applications one step further by storing user data on a decentralized network. This is the reason we built Ceramic, and DIDSession is the native way to write data into the protocol. You can read more on <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">our docs site</a>.</p>

<p>Dear Community Members,</p>
<p>We have an important update regarding a class action settlement related to a securities lawsuit involving Elastos Foundation, Rong Chen, and Feng Han. This lawsuit alleges that these parties violated federal securities laws by selling unregistered securities in the form of ELA tokens during Elastos’ Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2018, as well as through their Lock-In Program and on secondary markets between January 1, 2018 and July 27, 2023.</p>
<p>The good news is that the parties involved have reached a proposed settlement of $2 million to resolve these claims. This means that you, as members of the community who purchased or acquired ELA tokens during the specified timeframe, may be entitled to a share of this settlement.</p>
<p>To claim your share of the settlement, here’s what you need to do:</p>
 
 Submit a Claim Form: You must complete and submit a claim form, which is available at <a href="http://www.elastossecuritieslitigation.com">www.ElastosSecuritiesLitigation.com</a>, before the deadline on December 6, 2023. This form is essential to ensure that you are included in the distribution of settlement funds. 
 Opt Out or Object: If you have concerns or wish to opt out of the settlement, you have until December 1, 2023, to take action. This is your opportunity to voice any objections or decide not to participate. 
 Stay Informed: Mark your calendars for the settlement hearing scheduled for December 22, 2023. This is where the final decisions regarding the settlement will be made. 
 
<p>The proposed allocation plan for distributing the net settlement funds to authorized claimants is also outlined in the notice, providing transparency about how the funds will be divided among eligible community members.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that class counsel intends to seek attorney’s fees and costs, which will not exceed 30% of the total settlement amount. This fee will be deducted from the settlement funds before distribution.</p>
<p>In essence, this is your opportunity to secure your rightful share of the settlement if you purchased or acquired ELA tokens during the specified period. You are welcome to take the necessary steps and visit <a href="http://www.elastossecuritieslitigation.com">www.ElastosSecuritiesLitigation.com</a> to access the claim form and stay updated on the proceedings.</p>

<p>Almost a year ago, we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/11/07/introducing-hyperledger-cacti-a-multi-faceted-pluggable-interoperability-framework">announced the creation</a> of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/cacti">Hyperledger Cacti</a>, which resulted from the merger of two pre-existing projects, Hyperledger Cactus and Weaver, a Hyperledger lab, both of which had similar missions and goals, and which offered complementary feature sets to handle a wide variety of cross-ledger interoperability scenarios. Since then, Cacti has been in an&nbsp;<a href="https://toc.hyperledger.org/governing-documents/project-lifecycle.html#incubation">Incubation state</a>, a status it inherited from Cactus. Now we are thrilled to announce that the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger-hip/blob/gh-pages/HIPs/graduated/cacti.md">Hyperledger TOC has approved</a> Cacti’s&nbsp;<a href="https://toc.hyperledger.org/governing-documents/project-incubation-exit.html">exit from incubation</a> to the&nbsp;<a href="https://toc.hyperledger.org/governing-documents/project-lifecycle.html#graduated">Graduated state</a>, which marks the highest status a Hyperledger project can achieve.</p>

		<p>Despite evidence of the positive impact of female participation in leadership roles of corporations, women remain consistently under-represented in business ventures, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. For the U.S. economy to expand and produce jobs at an accelerated rate, women must account for a much higher percentage of entrepreneurial leaders throughout all phases of the innovation life cycle. Female academicians face disproportionately low engagement in the technology transfer process, both in the initial invention disclosure submission as well as in the patenting process (1-4). This investigation sought to both establish a baseline for measuring U.S. academic institutions’ tracking of inventors by gender and gain insight about the barriers keeping technology transfer offices (TTOs) from tracking gender in commercialization-related areas. The researchers also conducted an initial analysis on the leading software tools currently being utilized to track gender in academic TTOs. Raising awareness of this issue on a national level will help institutional leaders create strategies and mechanisms to help address the issue of gender disparity and increase the inclusion of women in the innovation lifecycle, particularly at the university disclosure and patenting level.</p>

		<p>Diversity is a key driver of innovation and a critical component of success on a global scale. Countries that deploy strategies to foster greater inclusion of all inventors in the innovation lifecycle will ultimately be best positioned to maximize their gross domestic product and ensure economic prosperity. The U.S. is losing ground because it is not fully engaging a significant portion of the inventive talent pool. According to a 2019 report from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the share of women among all U.S. inventor-patentees is only 12.8%.<br>
In an effort to understand factors that encouraged and discouraged academic women’s participation in technology commercialization, a group of technology transfer professionals conducted a survey of academic women involved in innovation, invention and/or entrepreneurship. The 168 respondents were from public and private research institutions of varying sizes from all regions of the U.S. This paper outlines the key findings from the qualitative and quantitative data around the themes that emerged. It also puts forth a set of recommendations based on the survey feedback, follow-up interviews, and the collective experience of technology transfer professionals who work daily with academic innovators. It is our hope that these recommendations will provide valuable insights into concrete actions that can be taken to ensure systemic changes that foster greater engagement of academic women and other under-represented populations in all stages of the innovation lifecycle.</p>

<blockquote><p>NIST’s Digital Guidelines are respected and referenced throughout the world so why does New York leave open the potential for ambiguous technology implementations which could be based on standards which are not parallel with efforts to support RON?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Michael Magrath, Director of Identity Policy and Industry Relations, Easy Dynamics Corporation</p>
<p></p>
<p>New York State, the financial capital of the world, undoubtedly sits at or near the top of most cyber criminals’ “hit list”. But it has fallen short when it comes to recent regulatory acts pertaining to identity and authentication.&nbsp; Two recent actions in different departments are alarming during this age of deep fakes and nation-state cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Identity Proofing for Remote Online Notarization (RON)</p>
<p>While RON has been available for a few years, the pandemic was the catalyst for wider spread adoption and use throughout the U.S.&nbsp; New York is no exception and recently revised its RON regulation.&nbsp; On January 25th the New York Department of State amended Title 19 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR), Chapter V, Subchapter E, Part 182 as it relates to RON. Section 182.7.a reads, “Identity proofing must meet, at minimum, the Identity Assurance Level 2 standard as outlined in the Digital Identity Guidelines of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as referenced in subdivision (b) of this section, or any industry accepted standard that is at least as secure, or more secure, than that standard.”</p>
<p>“Or any industry accepted standard at least as secure, or more secure, than that standard?”&nbsp; Huh?!! “Secure” according to which certification body?&nbsp; NIST’s Digital Guidelines are respected and referenced throughout the world so why does New York leave open the potential for ambiguous technology implementations which could be based on standards which are not parallel with efforts to support RON? In addition, unforeseen risk and exposure may occur due to lack of “uniformity” needed for both RON service providers and all relying parties.</p>
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2, commonly referred to as IAL2 is defined in NIST’s the Special Publication 800-63-3 suite of documents, specifically 800-63a, which is part of the SP 800-63-3 suite of documents last revised in 2017 and currently in the process of being updated.&nbsp; Federal agencies must comply with NIST’s guidance and over the years many state, county and local governments as well as commercial entities have embraced 800-63-3.&nbsp; Many have written 800-63-3 certification as a requirement for vendors into RFPs.</p>




<blockquote><p>Regulations should be “black and white”, as far as is possible.&nbsp; In the case of IAL2 for RON, black and white was possible, but NY regulators opted for gray leaving vendors, state agencies and commercial organizations with questions</p></blockquote>








<p>No doubt, the regulation caught the attention of all RON vendors given New York’s population and position in the financial industry.&nbsp; To date, states that have enacted laws permitting RON have for the most part written portions of MISMO’s RON standards into their laws, which have no requirement to comply with NIST’s IAL2. MISMO is short for the Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization, according to its Wikipedia entry, MISMO is “a not-for-profit, wholly owned subsidiary of the Mortgage Bankers Association responsible for developing standards for exchanging information and conducting business in the U.S. mortgage finance industry.”&nbsp; With all due respect to the MBA, RON laws and regulations should not be developed by a trade organization’s subsidiary.</p>
<p>Most vendors meet IAL2 by combining the scan of a government issued identity document such as a driver’s license or a passport, a bank statement or utility bill, with a selfie that can be checked for liveness. This provides assurance that it is really a live person’s face and not a recording or a mask that simply looks like someone else that is compared using biometric algorithms.&nbsp; The documents are also checked to be authentic and verified to provide confidence in the asserted identity’s validity.</p>
<p>Regulations should be “black and white”, as far as is possible.&nbsp; In the case of IAL2 for RON, black and white was possible, but NY regulators opted for gray leaving vendors, state agencies and commercial organizations with questions.</p>
<p>Proposed Amendments to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Cybersecurity Regulation </p>
<p>The regulation, 23 NYCRR 500, places cybersecurity requirements on all Covered Entities (financial institutions and financial services companies).&nbsp; Last November, NYDFS <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/cybersecurity">proposed a second amendment</a> to 23 NYCRR Part 500 the regulation regarding cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies (the Second Amendment). After a public comment period, on June 28, 2023, a revised proposed Second Amendment was published in the New York State Register. Although the regulation still requires MFA, it is not so restrictive as to mandate a specific NIST Authenticator Assurance Level as defined in NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines. Financial services organizations may select from a variety of authentication solutions.&nbsp; Under the proposed Second Amendment changes to multi-factor authentication (Section 500.1) include “Multi-factor authentication means authentication through verification of at least two of the following:</p>
 
 knowledge factors, such as a password, 
 possession factors, such as a token [or text message on a mobile phone]; or 
 inherence factors, such as a biometric characteristic” 
 
<p>Passwords?&nbsp; SMS?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; At a time when federal agencies are mandated to implement zero trust and use phish-resistant authenticators (passwords, one-time password tokens and SMS are not), New York is amending a cybersecurity regulation to include phishable authenticators.&nbsp; Why do this when modern phishing-resistant authentication is available?&nbsp; Sorry New York. In 2023 no cybersecurity regulation pertaining to authentication should include passwords and SMS.</p>
<p>Due to security issues in 2017 NIST classified SMS OTP as a ‘restricted’ authenticator meaning organizations or users would be taking a risk using SMS as part of two-factor authentication, exactly how the proposed Second Amendment is written.&nbsp; Why take such a risk especially when we are talking about accessing financial systems? I would encourage the NYDFS to join the FIDO Alliance and Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; FIDO standards are mature and recognized and adopted across the world. Moreover, FIDO has a stringent product certification program and maintains a certified products list which will enable Covered Entities to procure phish-resistant authentication.</p>
<p>As with RON, NYDFS should leverage NIST’s Digital Identity Guidance – Special Publication 800-63B applies to Authentication and Lifecycle Management.&nbsp; As with enrollment and identity proofing, NIST has defined three authenticator assurance levels: AAL1, AAL2, AAL3.&nbsp; AAL1 does not require MFA (passwords are acceptable) and while AAL3 is per NIST, “is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. AAL3 authentication requires a hardware-based authenticator and an authenticator that provides verifier impersonation resistance”, aka phishing resistant.</p>
<p>For some industries AAL3 may be too cumbersome. However for financial services, I would argue, AAL3 met with a FIDO certified security key would be appropriate.&nbsp; For many organizations, AAL2 is acceptable based on the level of risk should the account be compromised.&nbsp; Per NIST, “AAL2 occurs by the use of either a multi-factor authenticator or a combination of two single-factor authenticators. A multi-factor authenticator requires two factors to execute a single authentication event, such as a cryptographically secure device with an integrated biometric sensor that is required to activate the device.”</p>
<p>Trustmarks and Certified Products Differentiate the “Haves from the Have Nots” </p>
<p>NIST defines guidance but does not assess and certify vendors. &nbsp;The federal government no longer maintains an approved products list of credential service providers and instead recognizes Kantara Initiative, a globally recognized, non-profit certification body for NIST’s SP 800-63-3 under the Kantara Assurance Program.&nbsp; Kantara’s five-person Assurance Review Board (ARB) even includes a representative from NIST. &nbsp;The ARB is the body that reviews assessments and awards the 800-63-3 Trustmark to vendors.</p>
<p>I will note there is a distinct difference between a vendor claiming they meet IAL2 for RON or AAL2 or AAL3 in what I hope would be in the final version of the revised NYDFS cybersecurity regulation and being assessed and awarded a Trustmark.&nbsp; I have been employed by vendors that could claim that they technically met the IAL2 and AAL2 requirements but were never assessed or awarded a Trustmark.</p>
<p>Kantara’s Assurance Program goes well beyond technical requirements and includes non-technical requirements that vendors must first self-attest to and later provide evidence to a Kantara-accredited, independent, third-party assessor. They confirm that the service can actually do what the vendor claims. Some examples include:</p>
 
 Is the vendor financially solvent? 
 How long do they retain personally identifiable information (PII)? Where is it stored and how is it secured? 
 How do they obtain user consent? 
 Do they have a privacy policy in place? When was it last revised? 
 Does the vendor have a Security Awareness and Training Policy applicable to all employees? 
 Do they have an Information Security Management Plan? When was it last revised? 
 
<p>While many RON vendors may qualify for Kantara Trustmark, as of today, none have been approved directly. Some may, however, be partnered with credential service providers that have been certified.&nbsp; One exception is Proof (formerly Notarize) which was recently awarded a Trustmark and is listed on Kantara’s <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-status-list/">Trust Status List. </a>To thwart the ambiguity in identity and authentication regulations, I recommend that procurement officers in New York (and the other 49 states) require a Kantara Trustmark to meet the intent of the regulation.</p>

 Part 1: From Folksonomy to&nbsp;Taxonomy CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p><a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open Badges</a> exist to democratise the means of credentialing: anyone can issue a badge for anything. The trouble is that it can be difficult to do so, because people tend to describe things using folksonomies: “Oh yeah, they’re a good listener”</p><p>This article expands on our recent posts about endorsement, offering a method for aligning <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Open_recognition">Open Recognition</a> with skills taxonomies. For example, “good listener” is reframed as “active listening”.</p><p>The approach we outline helps you gather useful information by talking to people you know, both personally and professionally. It also helps you use an AI assistant to do some of the laborious work and do what machines do best: pattern-matching.</p><p>Here’s the 10-step&nbsp;process:</p>  Come up with questions for your contacts and put them in an online&nbsp;form  Share the online form with relevant&nbsp;people  Organise the answers you get in a way that’s easy to understand  Ask an AI assistant to review the answers and give you a&nbsp;summary  Instruct the AI assistant to review skills taxonomies  Compare the skills you’ve identified with taxonomies to see how they match&nbsp;up  Summarise your skills using a&nbsp;table  Come up with the metadata for Open Badges based on your skills (coming in Part&nbsp;2!)  Create badges using an online platform (coming in Part&nbsp;2!)  Ask contacts to endorse your badges (coming in Part&nbsp;2!)  <p>In our experiment, we gathered 20 responses within a 24-hour time period by explaining the process via social media posts. We’ll use this example to bring the process to&nbsp;life.</p><p>We’ll cover steps one through seven in this post and save steps eight to ten, which deal with turning skills into badges, for Part&nbsp;2.</p> 1. Come up with questions for your contacts and put them in an online&nbsp;form <p>The simpler the better. For this experiment, we started off with one contextual question which used checkboxes. We followed this with three diagnostic questions that allowed for free text&nbsp;entry.</p><blockquote>In what context do you know this&nbsp;person?</blockquote><blockquote>Tick all that&nbsp;apply</blockquote><blockquote>Professional — we have worked together&nbsp;directly</blockquote><blockquote>Professional — we have interacted but not worked&nbsp;together</blockquote><blockquote>Professional — other</blockquote><blockquote>Personal — I am a family&nbsp;member</blockquote><blockquote>Personal — I am a&nbsp;friend</blockquote><blockquote>Personal — other</blockquote><blockquote>What do they know a lot&nbsp;about?</blockquote><blockquote>This could be a subject area (e.g. ‘Geography’) or something more specific (e.g. ‘Identifying rare books’). Feel free to go into&nbsp;detail.</blockquote><blockquote>What are they particularly skilled&nbsp;in?</blockquote><blockquote>This could be a hard skill (e.g. ‘coding in Python’) or a human skill (e.g. ‘facilitation’). Feel free to give examples and&nbsp;context.</blockquote><blockquote>What behaviours do they exhibit which you, or others, find&nbsp;useful?</blockquote><blockquote>This is a catch-all for everything else that makes this person different/valuable to others. You might want to talk about their impact on the work you’ve done, or something you’ve observed that doesn’t fit elsewhere.</blockquote><p>We used <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms">Google Forms</a> to collect answers. Make sure the form is visually appealing and straightforward. Specify who should complete it, like people who know you well, and include links to any privacy policies.</p><p>Based on our experience, people are more willing to fill out forms if they’re anonymous, and this approach tends to yield better feedback.</p> 2. Share the online form with relevant&nbsp;people <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">LinkedIn</a> is a good platform for sharing the survey, but we also posted on the Fediverse via our <a href="https://mastodon.social/weareopencoop">Mastodon&nbsp;account</a>.</p><p>You might want to email the form to certain people or groups as well. If you’re using LinkedIn, consider tagging individuals you’d like to hear from, especially those you’ve worked with recently.</p> 3. Organise the answers you get in a way that’s easy to understand <p>Google Forms has a handy way to export to a spreadsheet:</p><p>Go to ‘File / Download’ and generate a PDF which can be referenced by an AI assistant such as&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>Ensure that you’ve turned word wrapping on so that none of your data gets&nbsp;hidden.</p> 4. Ask an AI assistant to review the answers and give you a&nbsp;summary <p>You can view the conversation I had with ChatGPT 4 at <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e51b8ffa-a564-4ca8-9afa-09c66b7825cc">this link</a>. However, we’ll break it down and give you the prompts and if you want to use them yourself.</p> Give some context and upload your&nbsp;PDF <p>We used the <a href="https://askyourpdf.com/">AskYourPDF</a> plugin for ChatGPT. Here is the prompt we&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>I’m going to share a PDF with you, so I’ll need an upload link. The contents of a PDF are responses to an online form. Here is the introductory text:</blockquote><blockquote>— — —</blockquote><blockquote>Open Recognition in your network [EXPERIMENT]</blockquote><blockquote>👋 Hello! Thanks for filling out this form, which should take less than 5 minutes. This will form an example for an upcoming article showcasing how Open Recognition can work in practice, mapped against skills taxonomies. We do not capture your name or identifiable details, so any words you enter will not be attributable to&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>Please complete this form as honestly as possible. Your results will be captured using this Google Form (privacy policy), combined with those from other people, and fed into ChatGPT (privacy policy) to map against skills taxonomies. WAO may also store the data on other platforms, in accordance with our own privacy&nbsp;policy.</blockquote><blockquote>We appreciate you taking part. This example is for Doug Belshaw. If you know and have interacted with Doug in a personal or professional context, please continue to fill out this form. If not, thanks for your interest but please do not continue. All questions are optional. 🙂</blockquote><blockquote>— — —</blockquote><blockquote>Once you’ve given me the upload link and I’ve given you the doc_id, we’re going to analyse the responses to the questions to:</blockquote><blockquote>1. Synthesise results</blockquote><blockquote>2. Discover&nbsp;patterns</blockquote><blockquote>3. Match attributes against skills taxonomies</blockquote><p>After you input this text, you should get a link to the AskYourPDF website, where you’ll be asked for the document ID of the PDF you upload. Just copy/paste it into the chat&nbsp;window.</p> Check the&nbsp;summary <p>AI assistants sometimes get things wrong, so check the summary ChatGPT generates. Ours looked like&nbsp;this:</p><p>You could ask ChatGPT for deeper analysis — for example, segmenting what your personal contacts said about you, compared with what your professional contacts indicated.</p> 5. Instruct the AI assistant to review skills taxonomies <p>To compare skills, we need a reference list. In this experiment, we used a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-skills-taxonomies-may-2022">review of skills taxonomies</a> on the UK government website. A direct link to the relevant PDF can be found <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1078099/Review_of_skills_taxonomies_report_prepared_for_the_SPB_May_2022.pdf">here</a>. It references the <a href="https://data-viz.nesta.org.uk/skills-taxonomy/index.html">O*NET</a> (USA), <a href="https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/about-esco/what-esco">ESCO</a> (EU), and <a href="https://data-viz.nesta.org.uk/skills-taxonomy/index.html">Nesta</a> (UK) skills taxonomies.</p><p>To upload the PDF, do as you did earlier: use ChatGPT to get a link that lets you upload the document through the AskYourPDF plugin. Here is the prompt we&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>I need another PDF upload link. This is from the GOV.UK website and is an “Independent report. Review of skills taxonomies: May 2022. This paper, commissioned by the Skills and Productivity Board, assesses the usefulness of existing skills taxonomies in relation to the work of the&nbsp;board.”</blockquote><p>ChatGPT then summarises the paper, explaining what the different skills taxonomies are useful&nbsp;for.</p><p>We’re interested in all of the skills taxonomies, as O*NET focuses on skills at a higher level than ESCO and&nbsp;Nesta.</p> 6. Compare the skills you’ve identified with taxonomies to see how they match&nbsp;up <p>ChatGPT can now see data from two PDFs. The first has feedback from your contacts about your strengths. The second contains data about skills taxonomies. We can now use this information to match what people say you’re good at with lists of skills used by different organisations and platforms.</p><p>Here’s the prompt we&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>So now that we’ve got some examples of skills taxonomies, I’d like you to take what we learned about Doug Belshaw from the online form and match it against a list of work-related skills.</blockquote><blockquote>List them all in bullet-point form with a justification for&nbsp;each.</blockquote><p>ChatGPT produced the following:</p><p>Some of these are obvious, but others are perhaps less so. It’s useful to have the specific terminology to use to describe your&nbsp;skills.</p> 7. Summarise your skills using a&nbsp;table <p>Having the list from the previous step is helpful, but it’s even better to compare the data in a table format. Here’s the prompt we used to do&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>Now create a table from this data in a way that I can copy/paste</blockquote><p>ChatGPT produced the following:</p><p>While we’re more than just words in boxes, having a structured way to be able to talk about our skills with people and systems is incredibly impactful.</p><p>Listing your ‘top 10 skills’ just became a whole lot&nbsp;easier.</p> Conclusion <p>Completing this process is highly valuable for understanding the skills your network attributes to you. However, sometimes people struggle with the confidence to reach out even to people they know and trust. So, ideally, the above workflow would consist of automated prompts for you and messages to your contacts.</p><p>The second post in this series will outline ways in which you can convert these skills into Open Badges. By doing this, you can showcase skills using any platform using skills taxonomies that are readable by both humans and machines.</p><p>If you use this approach, please share your results with us and your network! We’d love to see how this works for&nbsp;others.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-open-recognition-to-map-real-world-skills-and-attributes-1c1109c1b871">Using Open Recognition to Map Real-World Skills and Attributes</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Specifications 

<p></p>

<p>Creating specifications is one of the most important things we do at Blockchain Commons, because it allows developers to work together in interoperable ways, and thus creates a more resilient ecosystem for all of our digital assets.</p>

<p>IETF. In July we attended IETF 117 with the goal of advancing some of our specifications into standards that will allow their wider use.
We had a meeting on Gordian Envelope as well as a slot for talking about dCBOR as part of the CBOR meeting, and both allowed for notable advancement of those specs.</p>

<p>dCBOR. Our Internet-Draft for dCBOR has been changed from being “implementation details” to being an “application profile”, which makes it a description of how an application might implement a subset of CBOR —&nbsp;in this case to produce deterministic results. With this understanding in place we have released <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/05/">v05 of our dCBOR draft</a> and feel confident that we are zeroing in on a spec that will be accepted by the CBOR community.</p>

<p>More recently we also wrote a very short research paper on our preferred encoding of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-008-dcbor-date.md">dates in dCBOR</a>.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our discussions at IETF 117 also allowed us to finalize negotations for which CBOR tags we can receive from IANA. As a result, we’ve been able to tighten up the Envelope spec in a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/">new draft</a> by simplifying the core of Envelope and minimizing the tags we used. Simultaneously, we received the registration of <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">CBOR Tag #200</a> for Gordian Envelope. Note this was a breaking change, but because of the official IANA recognition and the IETF guidance and support, we feel quite comfortable with the newest iteration of Gordian Envelope going forward.</p>

<p>The updated spec also trimmed a lot of features from Gordian Envelope, to allow for its more general use. However, we’re reintroducing those features through new research papers, which cover <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-003-envelope-known-value.md">known values</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-004-envelope-symmetric-encryption.md">symmetric encryption</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-005-envelope-compression.md">compression</a>.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope Attachments. We’ve also developed a major new feature for Gordian Envelope: <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-006-envelope-attachment.md">attachments</a>. These encode vendor-specified data, allowing for the inclusion of specific, typed data, either in an open and interoperable way or in a private way, as an individual vendor prefers.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope Keys &amp; Seeds. Finally, we published two more research papers, covering the storage of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-007-envelope-output-desc.md">Bitcoin output descriptors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-009-envelope-seed.md">seeds</a> in Gordian Envelopes. We think these will again improve interoperability, and as a result Envelopes are now the preferred method for exchanging keys, seeds, and output descriptors in our reference apps.</p>

<p>If it’s not obvious, nailing down the fundamentals of Gordian Envelope allowed for a very creative period of expansion and extension for the format. We’re very grateful to IETF for working with us to reach this spot and are thrilled to have extended the community of Gordian developers to this larger organization.</p>

 Code &amp; Libraries 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyICk0lwL0#t=3143s"></a></p>

<p>Our specifications become reality through reference libraries and reference apps that we make available to developers interested in implementing our protocols. In addition to all our work on dCBOR and Gordian Envelope, we were able to make notable expansions here as well.</p>

<p>Rust Libraries. We have been developing new versions of all of our core cryptography libraries (including Envelope and SSKR) for Rust. Besides performance and type safety advantages, this also allows for easy usage on Android. The libraries are now in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/116">community review</a>. We’re looking to see if they meet your needs, so please let us know!</p>

<p>Rust Envelope CLI Tool. Using our Rust libraries, we are also working on a new version of our Envelope CLI written in Rust. It’s a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">Rust crate called <code>envelope</code></a>. It’s very similar to our existing Swift CLI, but without default commands, requiring more precise usage. We’ll be continuing to work on this for full release next quarter.</p>

<p>GST 1.6. We also have done some continued work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool</a> to support both the changes in the Envelope spec and the ability to exchange Envelopes containing metadata with our <code>envelope-cli</code> as a proof of concept for how third-party developers can interchange data. An example of the functionality can be found in the video of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyICk0lwL0#t=3143s">July Developers Meeting</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/"></a></p>

<p>We supplement our specs and apps with a variety of documents and articles, explaining our philosophies and documenting ways to support them.</p>

<p>Return to SSI. Self-sovereign identity was one of our first pushes, even prior to the incorporation of Blockchain Commons. Its ideals of independence and privacy remain some of our most important goals. This quarter Christopher followed up on his foundational <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” article</a> with a new look at <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">“The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>. Seven years on, self-sovereign identity has prospered and spread, but in some cases it’s moved away from its original intents, which the new article discusses. Christopher also penned a piece on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/">“Self-Sovereign Computing”</a> which talks about self-sovereignty in the larger computing ecosystem, and how we can be the captains of our own vessels on the digital seas.</p>

<p>The concepts of self-sovereign identity aren’t just philosophical musings. They’re very important ideals that affects the safety of their users. In the past, incorrectly used identity has literally led to genocide. Working to prevent this sort of misusage is another of the origins of self-sovereign identity, which Christopher wrote about in an advance reading for Rebooting the Web of Trust 12, called <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot12-cologne/blob/main/advance-readings/ssi-echoes-from-history.md">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>.</p>

<p>Return to Musings. The article on “The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity” was part of Christopher’s “Musings of a Trust Architect” column, where he writes about many of the architectural, security, and privacy decisions underlying our work at Blockchain Commons. This quarter also saw the publication of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Least-Necessary/">“Least &amp; Necessary Design Patterns”</a>, where he discussed a few different ways to look at the protection of data through minimization. Varying viewpoints in this way is important because it can give us new insights into tough security problems.</p>

<p>Return to #SmartCustody. #SmartCustody is a cornerstone of self-sovereign identity because it supports the resilient control of self-sovereign assets. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">multisig scenario</a>, which describes how to use simple tools to maintain digital assets using a multisignature, received an update this quarter to integrate it with the newest versions of <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/passport/">the Passport wallet</a> and <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">the Sparrow coordinator</a>.</p>

 Web Site Revisions 

<p></p>

<p>Websites help us to organize our documentation and make it easily available. They saw two major expansions in Q3.</p>

<p>Developer Website. We have created a new website at <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/">developer.blockchaincommons.com</a> that collects together all of our info on eleven different specifications and other projects, plus our architectural overviews — all of which was previously scattered across several different repos. The overviews of the specs are supplemented by FAQs, test vectors, use cases, and developer documentation. Take a look! And, if there’s a category of documentation that you want for a specific page, and it’s not there <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/issues">let us know!</a>.</p>

<p>As part of this work, we also created new pages for some of our specifications that had previously received less description. This includes pages on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/dcbor/">dCBOR</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/lifehash/">LifeHash</a>, and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/oib/">Object Identity Blocks (OIBs)</a>.</p>

<p>Life with Alacrity. Some of the foundational concepts behind Blockchain Commons were originally written for Christopher Allen’s <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Life with Alacrity blog</a>. That’s where “The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” was originally published as well as articles on Dunbar’s Number, community sizes, collective choice, and more. This last quarter we converted the old site over to a GitHub Page using Minimal Mistakes, to make sure it remains a great resource for the future. (There’s still some clean-up of tags to do, and we want to make it look a little nicer!)</p>

 Coming Next 

<p>For the coming quarter we’re going to by trying out a new salon style similar to our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a> and <a href="http://www.tokenethics.com/">#TokenEthics</a> meeting: Expert Round Tables. These round tables will allow experts to both answer and ask questions about a specific area of expertise, to improve our joint understanding of the topic.</p>

<p>Our first Expert Round Table will be on Schnorr. We’ve already got a few experts lined up, but if you are currently studying or implementing Schnorr, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us</a> to apply to participate. (The whole Round Table will of course be open for viewing too, just be sure you’re signed up to our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/">Signal channels or mailing lists</a> to receive notice when we lock down the date and guest list.)</p>

<p>For the fourth quarter we also plan to finalize the Rust envelope-cli, move GST 1.6 to release (mainly pending an update to restore PSBT compatibility with Sparrow), and continue work on our reference tools for Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR).</p>

 Three lenses to improve your digital&nbsp;strategy Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>“You’ve got to have a system”, as they say. At WAO, we’ve got one that we often apply to strategy projects of all shapes and sizes. Especially digital ones. And it’s easy to remember! 3Ps: People. Process. Product*.</p><p>In practice, the 3Ps are a series of lenses we use with clients to ensure that we’re thinking through projects holistically. Below, we give an introduction on how to use it in practice.</p><p>*A note on the ordering — when we’re talking, we find it easier to say “People. Product. Process” rather than “People. Process. Product”, don’t you? But you can put them in any order, it’s up to&nbsp;you!</p> The Power of&nbsp;People <p>The foundation of any successful organisation is the people who are a part of it. When we talk about ‘People,’ we’re talking about the individuals who make up organisational teams, along with your stakeholders (such as your board), as well as the audience you serve. We also make sure to think about community members and volunteers who are furthering an organisation’s mission through their engagement. We place people at the heart of our approach to prioritise the building of meaningful relationships and also to promote diversity. After all, if we’re not working to strengthen connections and help people find purpose, what are we&nbsp;doing?</p><p>We find that people&nbsp;need:</p>  Common language — there are often too many buzzwords in business, so clear and effective communication ensures that everyone understands one another. Having a shared understanding of a problem or a solution starts with the language we use.&nbsp;Synergy!  Bias towards open — create a more inclusive and engaging environment by encouraging open communication and embracing diverse perspectives. That means not just letting your files languish in unshared folders and making sure people have an opportunity to engage with the&nbsp;work.  Established trust — improve decision-making by creating a positive working environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and supported. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">Nonviolent communication</a> strategies help here, even though the name is a bit&nbsp;weird.  <p>The anthropologist Margaret Mead is credited with&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever&nbsp;has.”</blockquote><p>Behind every good project, initiative, and product are a group of talented people, working together. To harness the creativity and innovation of that group, we need to remember that they are humans with thoughts and feelings, as well as biases and complexities. Every group of people is different, so listening to the individuals you are working with and for is priority number&nbsp;one.</p> Streamlining Processes <p>By ‘Process,’ we mean the workflows and approaches that enable organisations to work effectively and sustainably. Efficient and well-structured processes play a crucial role in achieving an organisation’s strategic goals. It also leads to a more satisfying, productive, working environment.</p><p>We think that the following leads to better processes:</p>  Adaptability in teams — the world is always changing, so organisational processes should be flexible and adaptable enough to change with them, to respond to new opportunities and new people. Flexibility isn’t just for gymnasts.  Challenge assumptions — it’s important for us all to reassess our existing beliefs, assumptions, and practices so that we can identify areas for improvement and innovation. Just because you’re used to doing things one way doesn’t make it the best&nbsp;one.  Data driven decision making — while Gary from Marketing might have a great idea, what does the data say? Organisation should base decisions and strategies on objective data and evidence rather than relying on intuition or guesswork.  <p>A hugely important piece of developing effective processes is ensuring that they work for the people who will use them. More often than not, this includes documentation. Potentially boring? Yes. Skippable? No.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that you have to have rigid processes. In fact, adaptability is the key to all of this, and there should be an expectation that an organisation’s knowledge base is kept up-to-date by whoever used it&nbsp;last.</p> Embracing Innovative Products <p>The ‘Product’ component of our approach refers to the software platforms and tools we use and develop to support collaboration among internal and external stakeholders. You’re reading this on a screen thanks to several products. We use them all of the time, so it’s important to get the right&nbsp;ones.</p><p>The best products&nbsp;support:</p>  Iterative strategies — organisations have to evolve to keep pace with changing circumstances, so the tools you use should enable you to continuously improve processes and outcomes. If you feel like you’re having to fight your tools, then perhaps they’re no longer the best&nbsp;ones?  Distributed power / Autonomy — every tool has one or more ‘default’ ways of being used. So we should both use and make tools available that enable users to make decisions as independently as possible.  Learning by doing — the tools we use and develop should solve real-world problems rather than create new ones for users. I’m looking at you,&nbsp;Clippy.  <p>It should be fairly easy to find products that support processes that help people work well together. Sometimes, though, it involves taking multiple products and linking them together in new and interesting ways.</p><p>Although salespeople would like to tell you otherwise, there’s likely no ‘one platform to rule them all’, so we recommend making use of other techniques. You might like our <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">Architecture of Participation</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/content-is-king-queen-and-everything-inbetween-3c2fc4b1e19c">System Ecosystem</a> tactics to help make sure your bases are&nbsp;covered.</p> Getting Started with this&nbsp;approach <p>If you want to use the ‘People, Product, Process’ approach within your organisation, consider the following steps:</p>  First, take a step back and have a good look at your organisation’s culture. Think about how you can improve things like people management, communication, and teamwork. This might involve taking your digital strategy out of the desk drawer. Or, indeed, writing&nbsp;one.  Next, check out your current processes and workflows. Find any points of friction and opportunities to make things smoother. A diagram might come in handy to visualise all the&nbsp;things.  Now it’s time to explore some tools and tech to help boost your team’s collaboration and productivity. Give them a test run and see which ones might work. Let other people try them&nbsp;out.  Following this, it’s all about crafting a plan to bring those changes and improvements to life. Make sure your team’s in the loop and excited about the process by being open and keeping them in the&nbsp;know.  Last but not least, keep an eye on how things are going with your new approach. Embrace the iterative mindset and tweak things as needed to keep things moving&nbsp;forward!   Conclusion <p>This approach provides a really simple but powerful series of lenses to unlock your digital strategy’s true potential. It’s designed to be a versatile approach, catering to organisations of all shapes and&nbsp;sizes.</p><p>So, if you’re ready to embark on this transformative journey and could use some guidance, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">let us know</a>!

<p>Steering Committee Elections<br>
DIF’s new Steering Committee has been elected! The results will be revealed on the DIF Blog on 2 October and our new members will be invited to join the upcoming Steering Committee meeting on 5 October. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Human-Centric Digital Identity<br>
DIF is thrilled to contribute to a landmark paper, <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Human-Centric_Digital_Identity_Final.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Human-Centric Digital Identity for Government Officials</a>, published this week.</p>
<p>The paper was announced during the OECD Panel on Recommendations for Digital Identity Governance on 26 September. It was commissioned by The OpenID Foundation and edited by Elizabeth Garber and Mark Hainewith, with input from 12 contributing organizations including DIF.</p>

<p>DIF's Executive Director, Clare Nelson, commented: "DIF is honored and delighted to be a contributor to the Human-Centric Digital Identity white paper. Many DIF members work on national identity programs, and need a single source that spans everything from policy to threat modeling. We thank OpenID for taking leadership to commission and organize this effort, including collection of input from numerous industry experts."</p>
<p>ID Day<br>
DIF joined dozens of other organisations to celebrate Identity Day (ID Day) on 16 September. The campaign by ID4Africa seeks worldwide recognition of the fundamental right and practical necessity of having proof of identity in today’s digital age. The chosen date symbolizes UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9, which aims to provide legal identity including birth registration to all individuals by 2030.</p>
<p>DIF is delighted to become an Official Coalition Partner of ID4Africa and is committed to supporting Executive Chairman Dr Joseph Atick and his team to raise awareness of ID Day, decentralized identity and key use cases.</p>

<p>Next Generation Authentication Workshop<br>
Members of the DIF Korea SIG and Steering Committee member Markus Sabadello were among attendees at the 2023 Next Generation Authentication Research Society Workshop in Yongsan, Seoul earlier this month.</p>
<p>The event was hosted by the Korea Institute of Information Security and Cryptology (KIISC). Strong interest in Decentralized Identity was evident, with Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials, eIDAS, Digital Wallets, Selective Disclosure and Multi-Sig Credentials among the topics presented and discussed.</p>

<p>JP Morgan Onyx Hackathon<br>
DIF is supporting a Digital Identity Hackathon sponsored by Onyx by JP Morgan. This 4 week innovation sprint challenges participants to reinvent the future of online identity security and privacy, with prizes for helping to improve the Onyx SSI SDK in 5 areas: add support for a new DID method or support the Universal Resolver, provide support for JSON-LD Credentials, implement a new Credential Revocation scheme, implement the SD-JWT spec for selective disclosure, implement support for OIDC, DIDComm or Presentation Exchange.</p>
<p>Our thanks to Steering Committee members Markus Sabadello and Sam Curren, who inspired many participants to dive into relevant DIF tools and protocols with workshops on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gKJDGKX21Q&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Universal Resolver / Universal Registrar</a> and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4Xtn1xWxfw&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Introduction to DIDComm</a> (you can view the workshops on YouTube by clicking the links).</p>
<p>GSM Association adds its support to BBS<br>

<p>The GSM Assocation, which represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide, has declared its support for the <a href="https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">BBS Signature Scheme</a>. GSMA Europe highlighted the need for accelerated standardisation of BBS and definition of its end-to-end use in its <a href="https://www.gsma.com/gsmaeurope/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GSMA-Official-Response-Privacy-for-eIDAS-June-2023.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Official Response on eIDAS 2.0 and Privacy</a></p>
<p>Here is an exerpt from the paper: "In the context of eIDAS 2.0 this translates as follows: 1. Identification of “strictly necessary” information: there is a need for the definition / standardisation of requests and the acceptable attributes to be requested for each purpose (i.e., for each use case). We would welcome and participate to an EC initiative tackling this point.2. Technical means to provide only the “strictly necessary” information: protocols or technologies need to support the minimisation of shared information, including supporting Yes/No questions. To our knowledge, the only current technology that can achieve this is ZKP (particularly combined with a ZKP-enabled signature scheme of the BBS+ family)."</p>

    <blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This approach to VCs is innovative because it brings together different elements from several of the existing approaches to VCs. It is based on the usage of <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">BBS+ JSON-LD Signatures</a>, which is a subclass of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">LD Signatures</a>, in combination with a JSON-LD credential schema. The cryptography behind this mechanism is BBS+ Signatures, which require what’s called a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03">pairing-friendly</a> curve. Existing implementations in the VC ecosystem use the elliptic curve <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In order to request attributes from the credentials JSON-LD frames are used. The credentials and the proofs created by BBS+ signatures are self-describing and do not require a ledger(unlike CL signature based systems like Hyperledger Indy).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This specification defines a set of cryptographic suites for the purpose of creating, verifying and deriving proofs for BBS+ Signatures in conformance with the Data Integrity [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY] specification.</p>

      <p>In general the suites uses the RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm [RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION] to transform an input document into its canonical form. It then uses the statement digest algorithm to digest each statement to be signed individually, finally the digested statements are signed using the defined signature algorithm.</p>

      <p>BBS+ signatures [CFRG-BBS-SIGNATURE] are compatible with any pairing friendly elliptic curve, however the cryptographic suites defined in this document elect to only allow the usage of the BLS12-381 for interoperability purposes.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   [Literature] <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/275.pdf">Revisiting BBS Signatures</a> 2023, Stefano Tessaro and Chenzhi Zhu
    <blockquote>
      <p>BBS signatures were implicitly proposed by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham (CRYPTO ’04) as part of their group signature scheme, and explicitly cast as stand-alone signatures by Camenisch and Lysyanskaya (CRYPTO ’04). A provably secure version, called BBS+, was then devised by Au, Susilo, and Mu (SCN ’06), and is currently the object of a standardization effort which has led to a recent RFC draft. BBS+ signatures are suitable for use within anonymous credential and DAA systems, as their algebraic structure enables efficient proofs of knowledge of message-signature pairs that support partial disclosure.</p>

      <p>BBS+ signatures consist of one group element and two scalars. As our first contribution, we prove that a variant of BBS+ producing shorter signatures, consisting only of one group element and one scalar, is also secure. The resulting scheme is essentially the original BBS proposal, which was lacking a proof of security. Here we show it satisfies, under the q-SDH assumption, the same provable security guarantees as BBS+. We also provide a complementary tight analysis in the algebraic group model, which heuristically justifies instantiations with potentially shorter signatures.</p>

      <p>Selective disclosure via BBS+ signatures […]</p>

      <p>Like monoclaim credentials allow users to share specific claims from a VC, BBS+ Signatures is a multi-message digital signature scheme (named after its creators Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham) that gives users the possibility of sharing VCs with only specific attributes revealed. How does it work?</p>

      <p>BBS+ signatures allow a VC holder to derive proofs from the original signature:</p>
       
         Deriving a proof: When a holder takes the signed VC and hides one, several, or none of the containing claims, creating a new signature (a derived proof) using the Issuer’s public key. This derived proof can prove that the holder knows all of the original claims contained in the VC but chooses only to reveal the required ones. 
         Verifying a proof: The verifier validates the derived proof using the Issuer’s public key. This process enables the verifier to confirm the validity of the proof, proving that the subset of claims was part of an original message signed by the Issuer.

      <p>BBS+ LD-Proofs use JSON-LD schemas, so credentials that use them can have a rich, hierarchical set of attributes. Instead of the heavy-handed mechanism for the encoding and canonicalization of attributes values that we’d imagined for Rich Schemas, they use RDF canonicalization and a hash function. Rather than expanding the credential definition, they discarded it, taking advantage of some properties of BBS+ keys which allow for deterministic expansion.</p>

      <p>Blum Blum Shub (BBS) is used as a pseudo-random number generator (it is pseudo as it is not a truly random number, and where its randomisation depends on a random seed). It was created by Lenore Blum, Manuel Blum and Michael Shub in 1968. Blum Blum Shub uses the form of xn+1=x2n(modM), and where x0 is a random seed. The value of M is equal to pq, and where p and q are prime numbers. These values of p and q are both congruent to 3 mod 4 (p=q=3(mod4)). The security of the method involves the difficulty in factorizing M. It is slow, but is the strongest proven random number generator. For each step, we extract some of the information from xn+1, and which is typically the least significant bit. It would not be used within a cipher application, but could be used in key generation.</p>

      <p>Certainly, the idea of a (fast) deterministic mechanism producing such non-deterministic behavior seems contradictory: by observing its outcome over time, we could in principle eventually detect the determinism and simulate such a generator.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Digital signature schemes are a fundamental cryptographic primitive, of use both in its own right, and as a building block in cryptographic protocol design. In this paper, we propose a practical and provably secure signature scheme and show protocols (1) for issuing a signature on a committed value (so the signer has no information about the signed value), and (2) for proving knowledge of a signature on a committed value. This signature scheme and corresponding protocols are a building block for the design of anonymity-enhancing cryptographic systems, such as electronic cash, group signatures, and anonymous credential systems. The security of our signature scheme and protocols relies on the Strong RSA assumption. These results are a generalization of the anonymous credential system of Camenisch and Lysyanskaya</p>

      <p>To summarize the most salient points:</p>

      <p>JSON is an older standard, officially recognized as a standard in 2013. JSON-LD 1.0 was formally standardized in 2014. The version and standard was updated to JSON-LD 1.1 and ratified in 2020.</p>

      <p>That being said, one can use JSON libraries to process JSON-LD objects/documents, and conversely, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#interpreting-json-as-json-ld">interpret JSON documents as JSON-LD</a> by providing a context.</p>

      <p>Linked Data Signatures provide a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. They are built to compactly represent proof chains and allow a VC to be easily protected on a more granular basis; per-attribute, instead of per-credential. These features support a much more robust security model which has broader implications downstream from VCs, especially in terms of size and efficiency.</p>

<p>This blog was updated on September 28, 2023 to include an updated link that includes the session recordings.</p>
<p>OECD hosted a launch event on September 26, 2023 on the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/digital/digital-government/oecd-recommendation-on-the-governance-of-digital-identity.htm">Recommendation on the Governance of Digital Identity</a>, (note the session recordings at the bottom of the page) as adopted by the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/about/">OECD Council</a> in June 2023. The Recommendations guide its Adherents to develop and govern digital identity systems as digital public infrastructure. The launch event drew upon government officials in Japan, Brazil, Canada, India, and Italy, as well as experts from the OECD, UNDP, the EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium (EWC) and the OpenID Foundation (OIDF) to comment on the Recommendations and the path ahead.</p>
<p>In OIDF Chairman Nat Sakimura’s comments, he applauded the comprehensive approach of the OECD Recommendations and the compass the Recommendations offer to digital identity standards bodies.&nbsp; Nat also announced the “<a href="https://openid.net/human-centric-digital-identity-whitepaper/">Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials</a>” whitepaper (cobranded by twelve non-profits) as a paper grounded in the OECD Recommendations and human rights that:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Explains the current global landscape and the values underpinning emerging models&nbsp; 
 Provides insights on how to enable inclusion, equity, privacy and security&nbsp; 
 Encourages a shift in the focus of design from organisations to humans&nbsp; 
 Offers a starting point on how the OECD recommendations may be delivered technically and operationally, while respecting domestic sovereignty&nbsp; 
 
<p>Furthermore, Nat called upon the OECD to be transparent in the scope of its role, and he called upon the global community to collaborate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We call upon the global community to participate collectively in a global dialogue to deliver on the OECD Digital Identity Recommendations, and close policy and standards gaps through coordinated plans and shared goals. Together we hope to see Digital Identity reach its full potential to be of service to 8 billion people, and not the privileged few.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The OECD provided a link to the whitepaper for reference. Nat Sakimura’s interventions from the panel discussion can be found in full below.</p>
<p>As context, the OECD Recommendation supports its Adherents’ efforts to ensure reliable and trusted access to digital identity for natural and legal persons that is portable across locations, technologies and sectors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Being able to prove who you are underpins access to a variety of essential services across the public and private sectors. As these services move online, digital channels have emerged to handle identity verification processes, proofs, and authentication of verified identity claims. As people increasingly access essential services online and even across borders, improving the governance and implementation of digital identity systems in line with user needs becomes ever more important.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Recommendations also advise officials to future-proof policies, promote cross-sector coordination, pursue international collaboration, and facilitate a healthy market for identity solutions among these key pillars</p>
 
 Develop user-centered and inclusive digital identity systems
 
 Design and implement digital identity systems that respond to the needs of users and service providers 
 Prioritise inclusion and minimise barriers to access to and the use of digital identity 
 
 
 Strengthen the governance of digital identity
 
 Take a strategic approach to digital identity and define roles and responsibilities across the digital identity ecosystem 
 Protect privacy and prioritise security to ensure trust in digital identity systems 
 Align their legal and regulatory frameworks and provide resources to enable interoperability 
 
 
 Enable cross-border use of digital identity
 
 Identify the evolving needs of users and service providers in different cross-border scenarios 
 Co-operate internationally to establish the basis for trust in other countries’ digital identity systems and issued digital identities 
 
 
 
<p>The OIDF Foundation thanks the OECD Council for inviting Nat to participate in this important discussion, as well as moderator Allen Sutherland and fellow panelists, Michael Goit, (Director of Policy, Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat)&nbsp;and David Magård (Coordinator of the EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium and Senior Advisor at the Swedish Companies Registration Office).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenID Foundation Chairman Nat Sakimura’s Intervention During OECD Panel</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>Thank you, chair. Let me first congratulate OECD for the launch of this excellent recommendation and praise the secretariat for putting much effort into it. I am Nat Sakimura, the chairman of the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>OpenID Foundation is a standardisation organisation in the field of digital identity. We are not a consumer brand, so you may not be aware of it, but the likelihood is that you are using standards we have developed without knowing. Industry giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google use them in consumer and enterprise identification, enabling billions of people to assert their identity and gain access to services online. Similarly, many governments offer identity and open data systems using our protocols. In fact, the FAPI family of security profiles are the most commonly selected by governments and private sector leaders of Open Banking and Open Data.</p>
<p>Our members are spread across the world and build standards by consensus. They are open standards that you can access freely and use without any licensing fee. We strive to make them globally relevant and interoperable. They may be selected and deployed for a single implementation, a national ecosystem, or enable national systems to interoperate globally.</p>
<p>Currently, we are developing a new generation of identity protocols for wallet-mediated identity transactions, among other things. This OpenID for Verifiable Credentials family of specifications have been adopted as the remote presentation method of verifiable credentials in the EU Digital Identity Architecture Reference Framework, TrustedWeb demonstration experiments that the Japanese government is backing, and the NIST NCCoE project on Accelerate Adoption of Digital Identities on Mobile Devices Project. That said, the OpenID foundation recognises that no one standards body, country, company or non-profit will be able to lead the world to a globally interoperable digital identity on their own. We recognise it is vital to bring the public and private sectors closer together with a shared vision and approach.</p>
<p>To that end, the OpenID foundation has developed a series of whitepapers, many of which are co-branded and developed with partner organisations. Today I am proud to announce the “Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials” published in partnership by 12 non-profit partners. The paper takes the OECD Digital Identity Recommendation and expands it by</p>
 
 explaining the current global landscape and the values underpinning emerging models 
 insights on how to enable inclusion, equity, privacy and security 
 encouraging a shift in the focus of design from organisations to humans 
 offering a starting point on how the OECD recommendations may be delivered technically and operationally while respecting domestic sovereignty 
 
<p>We hope this paper will serve as a key input to the Digital Identity Interoperability Summit November 28th amongst non-profit and government thought leaders. The whitepaper is available now at OpenID.net.</p>
<p>We are fully aligned with the OECD Digital Identity Recommendations and it’s vision. We call upon the global community to participate collectively in a global dialogue to deliver on the OECD Digital Identity Recommendations, and close policy and standards gaps through coordinated plans and share goals. Together we hope to see Digital Identity reach its full potential to be of service to 8 billion people, and not the privileged few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nat shares his views on how the OECD Recommendation can help bridge issues with interoperability across borders:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will start at a 10K meter altitude view, then come to more specifics.</p>
<p>When creating a globally interoperable standard, the first hurdle is to come to a consensus on the comprehensive requirements. What I like about the OECD Recommendation is that it is really comprehensive and it achieved consensus among OECD members. Appendix B of the Human-centric Digital Identity whitepaper maps recommendations from several digital identity reports and highlights how the OECD Recommendations contain all the current global best practices.&nbsp; Such a comprehensive framework achieving consensus among OECD nations will be our guiding light when creating standards for cross-border identity transactions.</p>
<p>Specifics:</p>
 
 Every subclause of clauses VI, VII, VIII is spot on, but I would like to first Highlight subclause VI-2 to demonstrate how it helps. 
 
<p>VI.RECOMMENDS that Adherents align their legal and regulatory frameworks and provide resources to enable interoperability. <br>2. Ensure that digital identity solutions are technology and vendor neutral as long as they comply with all relevant security requirements, and promote the use of internationally recognised technical standards and certification;</p>
 
 To achieve this goal, it is vital for public and private entities to adopt robust, global standards that have been formally and mathematically analysed to be secure and that offer test suites and certification.
 
 Our experience tells us that formal analysis finds holes in protocols. So, it is better to do it proactively identify and fix security gaps before standards move to final, and the installed base is too entrenched to migrate to more secure protocols. The importance of security analysis led the Australian government to co-fund some of our FAPI security profiles to support their Consumer Data Rights objectives. 
 Furthermore, test suites and certification are essential. Implementors often claim that they are compliant with standards when they are not. A test suite can demonstrate conformance to standards very quickly, and self-certification can do so at a low cost. Without a test suite and certification scheme, it is extremely difficult to achieve interoperability at scale, and our shared goal of globally interoperable digital identity. 
 To push member countries towards these directions, the recommendation helps a lot. 
 
 
 There is a related subclause II-1. It says: Take into account the domestic context, including digital maturity and existing digital identity developments when considering the design, implementation or iteration of a digital identity system;
 
 It is important to note that all jurisdictions will not choose the same standards and architectures and will continue to do so. However, like a passport, people will expect their digital identity credentials to work when they cross borders in person or conduct online transactions. This means there will probably be a need for the global community to come together to do a few concrete things
 
 Agree on global, shared goals in the model of an OECD Recommendation and a shared target in the model of a UN Sustainable Development goal 
 Consider the minimum viable requirements to enable global interoperability and governance across diverse domestic implementations. 
 Consider how to enable capacity building and close geographic gaps to ensure no country is left behind. 
 
 
 The rest of clause II guides us in this respect. 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nat’s responses to the questions, “What do you consider being the biggest challenges and opportunities ahead for realising the full potential of digital identity worldwide? What is the role of the OECD?”: </p>
<p>Opportunities: In the Human-centric digital identity whitepaper, we have categorised the opportunities and benefits into three buckets.</p>
 
 Access to economic opportunities: McKinsey estimates that 3 to 13% of GDP can be unlocked by it, removing friction from everyday lives and allowing those on the fringes of society to participate in the formal economy more easily. 
 Access to government resources: for those who were challenged to access government resources physically, digital identity can facilitate equity and inclusion. 
 National security: The EU Cybersecurity Act and US National Cybersecurity Strategy cite DI as a key enabler, and more recently at FedID, US Treasury/ FinCEN attributed $212B in 2021 financial crime to flaws in identity infrastructure. 
 
<p>Challenges:</p>
 
 Coming to an agreement at the policy level
 
 Technology is the easy part. Ensuring that, as appropriate, domestic policies, laws, rules and guidelines for the digital identity system cover issues such as governance, liability, privacy, resilience, inclusion and security, to encourage and facilitate interoperability and portability in terms of location, is hard. 
 
 
 Tweaking of standards seems to be very attractive.
 
 I have seen many jurisdictions trying to do so. Even though the tweak seems small, at the technical level, it breaks the interoperability. If you want to tweak, then do not do it on your own, but come to the standardisation organisations and find the common solution. 
 
 
 
<p>Role of OECD</p>
 
 Foster multi-stakeholder dialogue
 
 As the OECD Recommendation testifies, OECD is very good at creating consensus. Building further consensus as divergent details emerge is expected. 
 
 
 Monitor the progress.
 
 A framework is only as good as it is implemented. 
 
 
 Develop the processes, guidance and tools to support the implementation of this Recommendation
 
 It may be unrealistic for OECD to do everything. In this case, I am pretty sure that many entities are there to help. So, to be transparent and pragmatic on what the OECD can take a leadership role on and what it will not in the next 3-5 years and sharing the work with other organisations may be a good idea. This will help inform and align OECD’s work with those of the UN, regions, and emerging public/ private coalitions as well.

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the final article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">Photo forensics for AI-generated faces</a></p><p>Part 4: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-from-lighting-environments">Photo forensics from lighting environments</a></p><p>Part 5: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-from-lighting-shadows-and-reflections">Photo forensics from lighting shadows and reflections</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>In the past few posts, I have described representative examples of passive forensic techniques. This category of tools for distinguishing the real from the fake assumes no explicit knowledge of the content source or specialized recording equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefit of these techniques is that they are applicable to a broad category of content. The drawback, however, is they sometimes require manual intervention. The shadow and reflection analysis, for example, requires identifying corresponding points on an object and shadow or reflection. While this is a relatively simple step for a human analyst, it is still out of reach of automation. As a result, these techniques cannot be applied to the torrent of daily online uploads.</p><p>Active forensic techniques, on the other hand, operate at the source of creation, embedding into or extracting from an identifying digital watermark or signature. There is a long history of marking content to prove authenticity, indicate ownership, and protect against counterfeiting. For example, Getty Images, a massive image archive, adds a visible watermark to all digital images in their catalog. This allows customers to freely browse images while protecting Getty’s assets.&nbsp;</p><p>An “invisible” or steganographic watermark can be added to a digital image by, for example, tweaking every 10th image pixel so that its color (typically a number in the range of 0 to 255) is even-valued. Because this adjustment is so minor, the watermark is imperceptible. And, because this periodic pattern is unlikely to occur naturally, it can be used to verify an image’s provenance.</p><p>The ideal watermark is one that is imperceptible and also resilient to basic manipulations like cropping or resizing. Although the above pixel manipulation is not resilient to, for example, image resizing, many robust watermarking strategies have been proposed that are resilient — though not impervious — to attempts to remove them.</p><p>The benefit of watermarks is that identifying information is directly associated with a piece of content before it is released into the world, making identification fast and easy. The drawback to this approach is that watermarks are vulnerable to attack, where an adversary can digitally remove the watermark while leaving the underlying content largely intact.</p><p>Therefore, in addition to embedding watermarks, a creator can extract an identifying fingerprint from the content and store it in a secure centralized ledger. (This fingerprint is sometimes called a perceptual hash —&nbsp;see article 2 in Further Reading below.) The provenance of a piece of content can then be determined by comparing the fingerprint of an image or video that is out in the world to the fingerprint stored in the ledger. Both watermarks and fingerprints can be made cryptographically secure, making it very difficult to forge.</p><p>This type of watermarking and fingerprinting is equally effective for actively tracking AI-generated and human-recorded content. The benefit of this approach is that it can efficiently scan the billions of online daily uploads. The drawback is that it requires specialized hardware or software to be used at the point of creation and recording. It also requires downstream platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok to respect the watermarks, and it requires browsers to display the accompanying content labels. Although not perfect, these combined technologies make it significantly harder to create a compelling fake and significantly easier to verify the integrity of real content.</p><p>Importantly, this active approach is agnostic as to the truthfulness or value of content. The goal of this approach is simply, but critically, to distinguish between human-recorded and AI-generated content.</p>

  <p><a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">I started this series</a> by talking about my initial journey some 25 years ago into the world of media authentication and forensics, and so I'll end with some thoughts of what may lie ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>A combination of many factors has contributed to a complex and at times chaotic online information ecosystem. With democratized access to powerful editing and creation software, the widespread deployment of generative AI is poised to significantly complicate this environment. Harms ranging from the creation of non-consensual sexual imagery to small- and large-scale fraud and disinformation have already emerged even in these early days of this AI revolution.&nbsp;</p><p>Legitimate concerns have also been raised regarding creators' rights and their very livelihoods. Here we can draw on some historical analogs. The introduction of photography did not — as some 19th-century artists feared — destroy art or artists. It disrupted some aspects like portrait paintings, but it also liberated artists from realism, eventually giving rise to Impressionism and the Modern Art movements.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, the digitization of music did not kill music or musicians, but it did fundamentally change the way we produce and listen to music, and it spawned new genres of music. This history suggests that generative AI does not necessarily have to lead to the demise of creators, but that it can, with proper care and thought, be a new enabling medium.&nbsp;</p><p>There is much to be excited about during these early days of the AI revolution. At the same time, there are legitimate and real concerns as to how these new technologies are being weaponized against individuals, societies, and democracies, and how they might disrupt large sections of the workforce. Advances in AI do not need to lead us into an unrecognizable dystopian future. But, technologists, corporate leaders, and regulators need to carefully consider how they develop and deploy technologies, and build in proper safeguards from the point of conception through rollout.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] H.

<p>The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) and Ceramic are excited to share an integration that allows developers to easily store EAS attestations on Ceramic. We’ve seen a marked increase in awareness and interest in using attestations to express flexibly-defined, verifiable data about online activity. Attestations are a building block for creating and working with this data.</p><p>EAS is an open-source, permissionless, and token-free public good for making on-chain or off-chain attestations. It runs on two elegantly simple smart contracts, one for registering schemas and one for making attestations on those schemas. Developers can use EAS to create, issue, and manage attestations with options to store on-chain, off-chain, and now, on Ceramic.</p><p>Ceramic is a decentralized data network for managing data at scale and with trust, making it easy for developers to build applications that rely on verifiable data. It can be used to store a wide variety of data types, including profiles, badges, credentials, attestations, and stamps.</p> EAS + Ceramic: How to Use and Store Composable Attestations <p>Attestations play a crucial role in building trust and ensuring data accuracy in various decentralized applications and platforms. EAS offers a straightforward standard that simply works, agnostic of the nature of the attestations themselves or where they are stored. As such, it’s important for communities that rely on attestations to consider the benefits and trade-offs relevant to the attestation frameworks they use, which technical standards those frameworks rely on, and how to safely and efficiently store them for later use.</p><p>This blog post will explore the advantages of storing attestations on Ceramic and includes references to a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">new tutorial for storing off-chain attestations using EAS</a>.</p> Understanding Attestations <p>Before diving into Ceramic and EAS, let's briefly recap what attestations are and the key differences between on-chain and off-chain attestations.</p><p>Attestations are like digital seals of approval, signed by one entity (the attester) about another entity or a piece of data. The attester cryptographically signs the attestation to ensure its authenticity and immutability. Attestations are basically reputation primitives and therefore only matter based on the context it’s being represented in and the reputation of the attester. For example, a credit score attestation from a credit bureau is more credible than a credit score attestation from a friend. But it’s only relevant if you need to provide a sense of your financial stability. Our friends at EAS go into greater detail on attestation examples <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/core--concepts/onchain-vs-offchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p><p>Attestations enable the verification and validation of information. When viewed in aggregate, attestations provide an integral building block to the broader manifestation of identity and contextual reputation.</p><p>On-chain attestations are stored directly on the Ethereum blockchain, which makes them secure, decentralized and immutable. They are ideal for scenarios where attestations need to be read by smart contracts or when guaranteed availability is essential. On the other hand, if privacy, high-volume throughput, or cost efficiency are important to your need for attestations, then purely on-chain attestations might not be the best option for your use case.</p><p>Off-chain attestations are stored off the Ethereum blockchain, often in decentralized storage solutions like IPFS or even in ephemeral cold storage. They are linked to the blockchain through cryptographic signatures but do not reside on it. This makes them great for maintaining attestations privately and sharing them when necessary.</p><p>However, some use cases may require the scalability and efficiencies related to off-chain attestations together with the myriad of qualities corresponding to on-chain guarantees. To help meet these needs, there are solutions that don’t fall cleanly into the on vs. off-chain binary, but instead share qualities of both—granting benefits like better scalability with on-chain assurances.</p><p>Ceramic, with its unique approach to storing data, serves as an attractive third option for projects seeking a combination of both on-chain and off-chain characteristics.</p> Ceramic Acts as a Data Ledger <p>Ceramic can be understood as a middle ground between on-chain and off-chain attestations. It offers a decentralized data network that combines the security and transparency of on-chain transactions with the scalability and cost efficiency typically associated with off-chain solutions.</p><p>Ceramic’s underlying protocol is built on decentralized event streams. Users can benefit from a variety of verifiable DID methods (including using their existing digital wallet to incur a did:pkh instance with no additional configuration) to cryptographically sign data events and submit them to the network. Ceramic stores these events in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), using the IPLD protocol to organize them into readable streams. This flexibility allows developers the ability to store any data types one could expect to find in a traditional SQL/NoSQL database (along with several additional scalars to support decentralized identifiers and account types) needed to create rich user experiences—including attestations, which can be used to reflect users’ experience and reputation on Ceramic.</p><p>Ceramic, together with the tools built on the network, provides data-streaming and querying capabilities familiar to developers experienced with tools like Kafka, GraphQL, and relational databases. However, it is built on a fully decentralized and open-source protocol, using the IPLD content addressing protocol within IPFS, which is periodically anchored to the Ethereum blockchain in the form of a Merkle tree. This architecture preserves global consensus, immutability, and transparency while delivering faster performance, lower costs, and straightforward traversal capabilities, making it an attractive option for projects dealing with high volumes of attestations.</p><p>Developers can also take advantage of ComposeDB, a graph database built on Ceramic. ComposeDB enhances composability and ease of querying, offering native support for GraphQL and optimizing read/write load distribution for improved performance. This allows developers to define their own data models using GraphQL or leverage existing community-defined models.</p> Create Your Attestations <p><a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow along in this tutorial</a> to learn how to generate simple off-chain attestations representing a “met in real life” claim. This guide uses a preexisting attestation schema already deployed on the EAS schema registry and therefore is designed to focus on the core processes and attributes available to developers using the EAS SDK.</p><p>You will learn how to generate off-chain “met in real life” attestations, allow users to generate referenced attestations confirming the original attestation, and verify attestations instances—all within the context of using ComposeDB to store and query attestations.</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance FDO Certification program will allow users to mix and match FDO solutions from different vendors with confidence</p>



<p>Mountain View, Calif., September 26, 2023 – The <a href="http://www.fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance’s</a> FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) technology allows edge and IoT users to quickly and securely onboard devices, thereby reducing cost, time and risk. Today the FIDO Alliance announced the launch of its FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) Certification Program, enabling edge node and IoT device vendors to prove that their solutions adhere to the security and interoperability requirements of the FDO specifications. Achieving certification allows vendors to demonstrate their products are high quality and at low risk of cyberthreats, while deploying companies can ensure devices will interoperate more seamlessly and securely within IoT and distributed computing infrastructures.</p>



<p>Leading vendors around the world, including Dell Technologies, IBM, Intel, Red Hat and VinCSS&nbsp; have already begun to include the FDO specification in products and services, which are being utilized by customers in a variety of settings and applications. [Media note: see quotes from FDO vendors at end of press release].</p>



<p>According to Markets and Markets in their June 2023 report, the “Edge Computing Market size is expected to grow from $53.6 billion in 2023 to $111.3 billion by 2028.”(1) They go on to say that “despite the benefits, the edge computing architecture is susceptible to cyberattacks with the addition of vulnerable edge nodes and IoT devices.” The FIDO Alliance’s FDO technology has been specifically defined by leaders including Infineon, Intel, Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm and ARM to address these concerns so that users in areas such as enterprise and industrial can fully take advantage of edge computing opportunities.</p>



<p>The FDO protocol is a freely available standard that champions a ‘zero trust’ approach to remove these barriers, enabling devices to quickly and securely onboard to cloud and edge management platforms. As a Dell Technologies <a href="https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/p/dell-nativeedge-speeds-edge-deployments-with-fido-device-onboard-fdo/">white paper</a> explained, “The installation of these systems must prioritize simplicity and must be zero-touch once plugged in and powered on. Secure operations require the ability to bring edge devices into your environment with zero touch in mind.”(2)</p>



<p>FDO Certification, testing for which will take place in early October provides conformance and interop testing, a security risk analysis, and assurance that a company’s device meets FDO Specification and Security and Privacy Requirements. Certification testing builds trust among device owners, as devices are validated as meeting a high level of security by a third-party. Companies interested in taking part in the FDO Certification interop test can register for free and get more information <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fdo-functional-certification/">here</a>.</p>



<p>“Edge nodes and IoT devices are bringing transformative benefits to a whole range of industries but overcoming the security risks that exist today is critical to enable more organizations to take the leap,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “The appetite we’ve seen for the FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) standard since we launched last year is a testament to how urgent the business need is to secure the edge in a way that’s quick and cost-effective. Launching the certification program marks another step towards fostering trust in the edge and IoT space and taking mass deployments to the next level.”</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance brings together 250+ of the most influential and innovative companies and government agencies from across the globe to deliver unrivaled security specifications that offer strong security, are free to use and easy to deploy. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/internet-of-things/">FDO Specification</a> is an important pillar in the expansion of the Alliance’s core vision: to boost global cyber security levels, help eliminate data breaches and enable secure online experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The business benefits of the FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) standard include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Simplicity&nbsp;– Businesses no longer have to pay more for the installation and onboarding process than they do for the actual hardware devices themselves. The highly automated FDO process effectively brings ‘plug and play’ to the world of onboarding edge nodes and IoT devices. 



 Flexibility&nbsp;– Businesses can choose which cloud or edge platforms they want to onboard devices to at the point of installation (as opposed to when devices are manufactured). A single device SKU can be onboarded to any platform (edge or cloud), thereby greatly simplifying the device supply chain.&nbsp; 



 Security&nbsp;– FDO leverages an “zero trust” approach, which means the installer no longer needs – nor has access to – any sensitive infrastructure/access control information.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Developers can view and download the FDO Specification <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download-iot-specifications/">here</a>. Higher levels of security certification are planned for the program in future, and interested parties are encouraged to join the FIDO Alliance and contribute to the evolution of the FDO standard. For more information or help, please contact: <a href="mailto:certification@fidoalliance.org">certification@fidoalliance.org</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance will be hosting a <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/session/fido-device-onboard-fdo-showcase/">workshop</a> on FDO on the opening day of its annual Authenticate conference, which takes place October 16-18 in Carlsbad, CA.

<p>26 September 2023</p>



<p>The not-for-profit, Digital Identity NZ, is calling for any future Government to ensure they focus on supporting the uptake of digital identity for the benefit of all New Zealanders.</p>



<p>In their recently released manifesto, the New Zealand digital identity ecosystem seeks to remind Government of the importance of digital identity as a way to revolutionise the lives of all New Zealanders by enabling them to fully participate in the digital economy safely and confidently.</p>



<p>“If people don’t have trust in the safe and secure use of their identity in a digital world, they will not participate, and will miss many opportunities,” says Colin Wallis, executive director of Digital Identity NZ.</p>



<p>“We believe the Government must focus on building a resilient digital identity ecosystem in order to address digital inclusion, and establish trust and security across New Zealand’s economy and society.”</p>



<p>“Our Manifesto outlines four key areas to enable such an environment – how to establish trust and security, empowering digital inclusion, enabling user-centric design and promoting interoperability and standards.”</p>



<p>“The expertise needed to get the right outcomes from Digital Identity for New Zealanders is found less in government and more in industry. As a nation we need to face this reality and change the way we set policy and regulation for technically complex domains, for example biometrics,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/22/why-its-too-early-for-biometrics-regulation-in-aotearoa/">which I opinioned recently</a>,” says Wallis.</p>



<p>The manifesto calls for increased focus on bridging the digital divide to ensure equitable access to digital identity solutions for all New Zealanders – people and organisations – taking into account Māori tikanga and Māori data sovereignty, and social inclusion for the disadvantaged in our society.</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZ is the voice of digital identity in Aotearoa, a not-for-profit formed to help New Zealand’s transformation as a digital nation, where everyone should have the right and ability to prove who they are in a secure and trusted way. Digital Identity NZ is a part NZTech, the umbrella tech association for New Zealand.</p>

<p>Published September 25, 2023, revised October 13, 2023.</p>
<p>Version 1.1 of this paper was published October 13, 2023 as we are pleased to confirm MOSIP was added as a co brand partner of the paper. Revision history is available upon request.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce that the <a href="https://openid.net/Human-Centric-Digital-Identity-Final">“Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials”</a> whitepaper is now available, with this final version co-branded by twelve non-profit organisations.</p>
<p>This paper offers a broad view of the global digital identity landscape, key considerations for government officials, and the path ahead to global interoperability. Importantly, the paper is grounded in the role of digital identity in the wider international human rights agenda and the recent OECD Digital Identity Recommendations.</p>
<p>The paper started with many months of due diligence including public listening sessions at FIDO’s Authenticate in 2022, OIDF’s workshop in 2022, and two Internet Identity Workshops (IIWXXXV-XXXVI) as well as interviews with subject matter experts. The draft paper was subject to public review this summer with numerous contributions from individuals and non-profits. Contributors over time included technologists working on digital identity standards, government officials, policymakers, legal scholars, human rights advocates, and civil society thought leaders. The twelve organizations that support and co-branded the whitepaper are:</p>
 
 Decentralized Identity Foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Identity Defined Security Alliance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 IDPro&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 ID4Africa 
 Kantara Initiative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 MyData&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 OpenID Foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Open Identity Exchange 
 Secure Identity Alliance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Trust Over IP Foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 UN Refugee Agency&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Women in Identity 
 MOSIP 
 
<p>Part 1 of the paper explores the opportunities and risks inherent in Digital Identity technologies, with motivations that can vary considerably by country from economic drivers, to enabling access to social services, to national security. The paper then moves into Part 2, which analyzes Digital Identity paradigms across markets, and identifies common trade-off decisions. &nbsp;For example, the paper references a sister whitepaper, “<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/05/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-final.pdf">Government-issued Digital Credentials and the Privacy Landscape</a>” (Flanagan, 2023), which delves deeply&nbsp; into challenges of creating a globally viable privacy-preserving Digital Identity landscape. Part 3 builds upon existing principles-based literature, especially the recently published OECD Recommendations on the governance of Digital Identity, to help government officials navigate through these decisions.</p>
<p>The paper recognizes that no one size fits all nations, that no technology or architecture will be the default model for all countries. Multiple systems will co-exist, and in some cases, there may be multiple systems in a single jurisdiction. However, the paper argues that there are design practices and strategic approaches that will guide government officials and their stakeholders towards Digital Identity Systems that sustain and promote human rights. The paper also highlights the potential for global digital identity infrastructure to empower the ability of all people to assert their identity in person and remotely cross borders, while respecting domestic sovereignty.</p>
<p>Although this is the final version of the paper, we are still at the start of critical domestic conversations on digital identity, and a global conversation on how to enable global interoperability across these domestic systems.&nbsp; The editors would like to thank all the individuals who took part in listening sessions, interviews, and provided written feedback, as well as the co-branding partner organizations. The editors would also like to give a special thanks to the contributors who challenged the paper to give voice to the challenges of vulnerable populations, including stateless people, and migrant families.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/human-centric-digital-identity-whitepaper/">Announcing the “Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials” Final Whitepaper</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID Foundation</a>.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: The principles of least privilege and least authority are core computer security principles that can minimize attacks. Not only can they be extended to the realm of digital data with a new principle of least access, but they can also be flipped on their heads, to address what privilege and authority (and access) are required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the roots of computer security can be traced back to the military and intelligence communities, where the focus was on protecting information and assets from enemies and adversaries, I prioritize the protection of individuals, who are uniquely due respect and dignity, and who are likely to be more vulnerable and less resilient than groups such as tribes, corporations and goverments.</p>

<p>I’ve already written about design patterns such as <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">Data Minimization and Selective Disclosure</a> that protect those individuals, but I want to share some thoughts on related design patterns that talk not about what data to release, but instead what permissions to grant. And moreso, I want to talk about how those design patterns can provide even more insight into protecting the data of indvidiuals when we turn them inside out.</p>

<p>So let me introduce the least design patterns followed by their reverse, the necessary design patterns.</p>

 The Principle of Least Privilege 

<p>The concept of “least privilege” has been around in computer security for several decades. Though its origins are not entirely clear, the design pattern was popularized in the mid-1970s by Jerry Saltzer and Michael Schroeder in their influential paper, <a href="https://bitstreamllc.com/assets/documents/the-protection-of-information-in-computer-systems-saltzer-schroeder.pdf">“The Protection of Information in Computer Systems”</a>. Since then, the “Principle of Least Privilege” has become a cornerstone of modern computer security design.</p>

<p>At its core, the principle of least privilege is all about limiting the damage that can be caused by a security breach. This principle stipulates that each user, program, or system component should have only the minimum set of permissions required to perform their respective functions. In other words, if a user does not need access to a particular file, system resource, or network device to perform their job, then they should not have access to it. By limiting the access of each user or component to only what is necessary, the system as a whole becomes more resilient to attack.</p>

<p>“It also reduces the number of potential interactions among privileged programs to the minimum for correct operation, so
that unintentional, unwanted, or improper uses of privilege are less likely to occur. Thus, if a question arises related
to misuse of a privilege, the number of programs that must be audited is minimized.”<br><a href="https://bitstreamllc.com/assets/documents/the-protection-of-information-in-computer-systems-saltzer-schroeder.pdf">—Jerry Saltzer &amp; Michael Schroeder, “The Protection of Information in Computer Systems”</a></p>

<p>The principle of least privilege can be applied to a wide range of security domains, including access control, network security, and application security. In access control, for example, least privilege means that each user should be granted only the permissions necessary to perform their job functions, and no more. In network security, least privilege means that each network device should be configured to only allow the traffic that is necessary for its specific function, and no more. In application security, least privilege means that each application should be designed to only access the resources and data that are necessary to perform its intended function, and no more.</p>

 Principle of Least Authority 

<p>The principle of least privilege has evolved and grown over the decades. In particular, it has been refined as the principle of least authority, which expands on how a user (or device) might gain access to a resource. It is perhaps best described in Chapter 8 of Mark S. Miller’s dissertation, <a href="http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis/markm-thesis.pdf">“Robust Composition: Towards a Unified Approach to Access Control and Concurrency Control”</a>. Whereas least privilege focuses on individual permissions granted to a user, least authority instead recognizes that a user and a resource are part of a larger ecosystem that can include transitive authority: even if a user doesn’t have the privilege to access a resource, he might have the privilege to access a program (or some other object) that itself has the privilege to access the resource. It’s a recognition that privileges are part of a larger web, which when seen together becomes authority.</p>

<p>“It is unclear whether Saltzer and Schroeder’s Principle of Least Privilege [SS75] is best interpreted as ‘least permission’ or ‘least authority.’ As we will see, there is an enormous difference between the two.”<br><a href="http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis/markm-thesis.pdf">—Mark S. Miller, “Robust Composition:
Towards a Unified Approach to Access Control and Concurrency Control”</a></p>

<p>The concept of least authority has become a standard principle in many modern security designs. In a least privilege system, a user might have been granted privileges to access a file or to utilize a database program; but a least authority system is more likely to additionally consider the access to files that the user might receive through access to the database.</p>

<p>Many modern discussions of least privilege conflate it entirely with least authority, but that should only be done if least privilege has been expanded to incorporate the larger ecosystem of interwoven privileges recognized in Miller’s paper.</p>

 A New Principle of Least Access 

<p>The least privilege and least access design patterns focus on the permission to do things, which is the standard for security on computing systems. However within the world of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials, we instead need to focus on data access.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">“data minimization” and “selective disclosure”</a> design patterns already outline methods for reducing access to data. Combining that with “least privilege” and “least authority” reveals a larger, related design pattern that we can apply more specifically to digital data:&nbsp;”least access”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Data Minimization is the practice of limiting the amount of shared data to the minimum necessary: just enough for parties to successfully transact, accomplish a task, or otherwise meet a goal with each other, while minimizing risks to all parties by omitting unnecessary content.”<br><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">—Christopher Allen, “Musings of a Trust Architect: Data Minimization &amp; Selective Disclosure”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Data minimization mitigates the following threats: surveillance, stored data compromise, correlation, identification, secondary use, and disclosure.”<br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6973/">—IETF RFC 6973</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than just minimizing data, least access minimizes data access. We can state the principle as follows: In order to protect privacy, respect individual entitlements, and maintain human dignity, only the minimum amount of data access necessary to achieve a specific goal should be granted.</p>

<p>In practical terms, this new “least access” principle can be applied in a variety of contexts. For example, in the case of online transactions, this principle would go beyond the idea of data minimization, which says that only the minimum identifying data necessary to complete the transaction should be collected, and no more, to say that a merchant should not have any ability to access data he shouldn’t have — and perhaps even that a datastore shouldn’t be able to reveal data that the merchant shouldn’t have access to. Consider a more coerceive situation where an LEO might demand personal data from a citizen: if the citizen’s datastore refuses to grant the LEO access to information that they shouldn’t have, then the threat of coercion is negated.</p>

<p>To further enhance privacy and security, a “least access” principle should be extended to minimize opportunities for correlation. This refers to the process of linking different pieces of data together to identify an individual, even if that data was collected separately. Limiting access to data through the Principle of Least Access (and especially through the Principle of Least Authority that it’s built upon) should help to minimize data more than just selective disclosure alone, because it looks at the whole data ecosystem. This in turn can help protect individuals’ privacy and prevent the misuse of their personal data.</p>

 Turning Design Patterns Inside Out 

<p>Once I discover a useful design pattern, I often find utility in turning it inside out. This results in a different mindset that can provide new insights into security design.</p>

<p>For instance, selective disclosure is a part of my architectural tool box, and also a goal and byproduct of least access. Turning it inside out creates the idea of “selective correlation” instead: you think about what to purposefully disclose to enable correlation, rather than what to minimize to avoid correlation. It’s built on the idea that correlation is not always a bad thing, and that in some cases it is necessary to achieve specific security goals.</p>

<p>Thus, with the inside-out design pattern of selective correlation, you: identify the specific pieces of data that need to be correlated in order to achieve a particular security objective; and then design systems and applications that allow for this correlation to occur while minimizing the risk of privacy violations.</p>

<p>A similar methodology can be applied to the “Least” design patterns.</p>

 Necessary Privilege, Authority, and Access 

<p>To turn the design patterns of “least privilege”, “least authority”, and “least access” inside out, we focus on the positive aspects of granting access to resources and data in a way that enables effective and efficient operation, rather than simply limiting access. We could call this “necessary privilege”. The idea actually goes back to Saltzer’s original design for least privilege in <a href="https://bitstreamllc.com/assets/documents/protection-control-info-sharing-multics-saltzer.pdf">“Protection and Control of Information Sharing in Multics”</a> when he said: “Protection mechanisms should be based on permission rather than exclusion.”</p>

<p>Fundamentally, necessary privilege and necessary authority systems should focus from the start on what will be necessary for a user to do their job, rather than just how to limit them. This allows for the boundaries of design for a project to be reset. Rather than trying to tamp down all possible abuses, which is potentially an endless task, it instead concentrates a designer’s attention on the positive. Once a designer fully understands the boundaries for what are necessary, their design task becomes easier and their work more proficient.</p>

<p>If this job is done well, then designers can create systems and applications that scale and that are more flexible and adaptable to changing user needs, because everything is proactively flagged for usage, rather than being negatively limited, with access then added after the fact. This approach may also help to minimize the burden on system administrators by reducing the need for constant permission updates and access control changes. And it’s all done while still maintaining a high level of security.</p>

<p>Besides improving administrator workload, the system can also create better user experiences: if a user prooactively has access to everything that they need, they’ll never bump up against barriers in a system. This can help to reduce the risk of human error and increase user satisfaction by empowering users with the authority they need to perform their tasks effectively. It creates a more “humane” and thus more resilient system.</p>

<p>A necessary access system can extend these necessary privilege and necessary authority advantages to digital data. It does so by defining what data each system needs to operate rather than what data each individual is willing to release. Now perhaps a user won’t be willing to release the data in question, but this creates the foundation needed for a negotiation, where a user can decide whether he wants to use a system or not. It also ensures that the user knows what data he’s releasing, thanks to the improved user experience of the positvely oriented system. Since this sort of negotiation is crucial for credential systems, necessary access offers the potential of improving the whole space.</p>

 A Summary in Brief 

<p>The differences between these six design patterns can be subtle. Here’s how each one offers a slightly different way to consider computer security:</p>

 
   Least Privilege. Minimize permissions to what’s necessary for a task. 
   Least Authority. Minimize permissions, but consider transitive authority. 
   Least Access. Minimize data access to what’s necessary for a task, considering transitive authority. 
   Necessary Privilege. Provide permissions necessary for a task. 
   Necessary Authority. Provide permissions and consider transitive authority. 
   Necessary Access. Provide data access necessary for a task, considering transitive authority. 
 

 One Last Flip-Flop 

<p>Turning design patterns inside out forces us to think differently and creates new insights into how to solve security problems.</p>

<p>Turning the “least” design patterns inside-out involves a shift in focus from limiting access and authority to enabling access and authority in a controlled and strategic way. It allows us to identify the specific needs of users and applications and to grant access and authority accordingly, creating security designs that are more effective, efficient, and user-friendly.</p>

<p>In case you think that radio is still one of the few media where you’re safe from surveillance, here is what <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/author/6389/ray-schultz/">Ray Schultz</a> says in <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/388956/can-radio-time-be-bought-with-real-time-bidding-i.html">Can Radio Time Be Bought With Real-Time Bidding? iHeartMedia is Working On It</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>HeartMedia hopes to offer real-time bidding for its 860+ radio stations in 160 markets, enabling media buyers to buy audio ads the way they now buy digital.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have the capabilities to do real-time bidding and programmatic on the broadcast side,” said Rich Bressler, president and COO of iHeart Media, during the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, according to Radio Insider.</p>
<p>Bressler did not offer specifics or a timeline. He added: “If you look at broadcasters in general, whether they’re video or audio, I don’t think anyone else is going to have those capabilities out there.”</p>
<p>“The ability, whenever it comes, would include data-infused buying, programmatic trading and attribution,” the report adds.</p>
<p>The Trade Desk lists iHeart Media as one of its programmatic audio partners.</p>
<p>Audio advertising allows users to integrate their brands into their audiences’ “everyday routines in a distraction-free environment, creating a uniquely personalized ad experience around their interests,” the Trade Desk says.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trade_Desk">The Trade Desk</a> “specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users.” Translation: surveillance-based and privacy-hostile ad targeting, which we’ve been hating in the online world <a href="https://doc.searls.com/the-adblock-war/">at least since 2008</a>.</p>
<p>But radio, one might think, is basically an offline medium. Most radio listening is to radios, not to computers or phones. Sure, some listening is online; but relatively speaking, not much. For example, here is the bottom of the <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb009">current radio ratings for the San Francisco market</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb009"></a></p>
<p>Those numbers are fractions of one percent of total listening in the market. And the Bay Area is a very streaming-oriented market.</p>
<p>So how are iHeart and The Trade Desk going to personalize radio ads?&nbsp; Well, here is a meaningful excerpt from<a href="https://www.insideradio.com/free/iheart-to-offer-real-time-bidding-for-its-broadcast-ad-inventory/article_95861ff4-4e19-11ee-b044-b346721c7d1f.html">&nbsp;iHeart To Offer Real-Time Bidding For Its Broadcast Ad Inventory</a>, which ran earlier this month at&nbsp;Inside Radio:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest challenge at iHeartMedia isn’t attracting new listeners, it’s doing a better job monetizing the sprawling audience it already has. As part of ongoing efforts to sell advertising the way marketers want to transact, it now plans to bring real-time bidding to its 850 broadcast radio stations, top company management said Thursday.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have the capabilities to do real-time bidding and programmatic on the broadcast side,” President and COO Rich Bressler said during an appearance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference. “If you look at broadcasters in general, whether they’re video or audio, I don’t think anyone else is going to have those capabilities out there.”</p>
<p>Real-time bidding is a subcategory of programmatic media buying in which ads are bought and sold in real time on a per-impression basis in an instant auction. Pittman and Bressler didn’t offer specifics on how this would be accomplished other than to say the company is currently building out the technology as part of a multi-year effort to allow advertisers to buy iHeart inventory the way they buy digital media advertising. That involves data-infused buying and programmatic trading, along with ad targeting and campaign attribution.</p>
<p>Radio’s largest group has also moved away from selling based on rating points to transacting on audience impressions, and migrated from traditional demographics to audiences or cohorts. It now offers advertisers 800 different prepopulated audience segments, ranging from auto intenders to moms that had a baby in the last six months…</p>
<p>Advertisers buy iHeart’s ad inventory “in pieces,” Pittman explained, leaving “holes in between” that go unsold. “Digital-like buying for broadcast radio is the key to filling in those holes,” he added…</p>
<p>…there has been no degradation in the reach of broadcast radio. The degradation has been in a lot of other media, but not radio. And the reason is because what we do is fundamentally more important than it’s ever been: we keep people company.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Most AM-FM radios in homes are not connected to the Internet, so they don’t work for tracking individual listeners. Cars, however, are another story. In <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/">Privacy Nightmare on Wheels’: Every Car Brand Reviewed By Mozilla — Including Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota — Flunks Privacy Test</a>, Mozilla pulls together a mountain of findings about just how much modern cars spy on their drivers and passengers, and then pass personal information on to many other parties. Here is one relevant screen grab:</p>
<p><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/what-data-does-my-car-collect-about-me-and-where-does-it-go/"></a></p>
<p>As for consent? When you’re on a browser or an app, you’re on the global Internet, where the GDPR and to a lesser degree the CCPA and other privacy laws apply, meaning that websites and apps have to make a show of requiring consent to what you don’t want. But cars have no UI for that. All their computing is behind the dashboard where you can’t see it and can hardly control it. So the car makers can go nuts gathering fuck-all, while you’re almost completely in the dark about it.</p>
<p>Here is how Mozilla describes the situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many car brands engage in “privacy washing.” Privacy washing is the act of pretending to protect consumers’ privacy while not actually doing so — and many brands are guilty of this. For example, several have signed on to the automotive <a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/innovation/Automotive%20Privacy/Consumer_Privacy_Principlesfor_VehicleTechnologies_Services-03-21-19.pdf">Consumer Privacy Protection Principles</a>. But these principles are nonbinding and created by the automakers themselves. Further, signatories don’t even follow their own principles, like Data Minimization (i.e. collecting only the data that is needed).</p>
<p>Meaningful consent is nonexistent. Often, “consent” to collect personal data is presumed by simply being a passenger in the car. For example, Subaru states that by being a passenger, you are considered a user — and by being a user, you have consented to their privacy policy. Several car brands also note that it is a driver’s responsibility to tell passengers about the vehicle’s privacy policies.</p>
<p>Autos’ privacy policies and processes are especially bad. Legible privacy policies are uncommon, but they’re exceptionally rare in the automotive industry. Brands like Audi and Tesla feature policies that are confusing, lengthy, and vague. Some brands have more than five different privacy policy documents, an unreasonable number for consumers to engage with; Toyota has 12. Meanwhile, it’s difficult to find a contact with whom to discuss privacy concerns. Indeed, 12 companies representing 20 car brands didn’t even respond to emails from Mozilla researchers.</p></blockquote>
<p>And, “Nineteen (76%) of the car companies we looked at say they can sell your personal data.”</p>
<p>To iHeart? Why not? They’re in the market.</p>
<p>And, of course, you are not.</p>
<p>Hell, you have access to almost none of that data. There’s what the dashboard tells you, and that’s it.</p>
<p>As for advice? For now, all I have is this: buy an old car or keep the one you’ve got.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Exploring badge endorsements in cooperative communities  Background and&nbsp;context <p>In 2017, We Are Open Co-op (WAO) <a href="https://goo.gl/XzLWso">presented</a> groundbreaking ideas on building and credentialing ‘cooperative character’ at the Cooperative Education and Research Conference. Fast forward to today, and we find ourselves revisiting this concept, driven by three key developments that we’ll delve into in this post. We’ll also outline the exciting directions we’re considering for future&nbsp;work.</p> 🎨 1. Interdisciplinary Focus <p>As highlighted in our previous post, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/finding-the-others-1f43b48ceff1">Finding the Others</a>, we’re keen on awarding badges to individuals and organisations that intersect with WAO’s five core priority&nbsp;areas:</p> 🌱 2. New Partnerships <p>Our recent collaboration with <a href="https://workers.coop">workers.coop</a>, a new federation of worker cooperatives, has rekindled our interest in badging for cooperative character. Together, we aim to foster collective economic, social, and cultural progress, guided by the <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity/">seven foundational cooperative principles</a>:</p>  Voluntary and Open Membership  Democratic Member&nbsp;Control  Member Economic Participation  Autonomy and Independence  Education, Training, and Information  Cooperation among Cooperatives  Concern for Community   💡 3. Technological Advances <p>The <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/03/16/verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-whats-changed/">latest version</a> of the Open Badges standard has matured, offering a <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/09/08/the-role-of-endorsement-in-open-badges-and-open-recognition/">transformative approach to endorsements</a>. Specifically, badges can now be endorsed retrospectively, adding a new layer of credibility and flexibility to the ecosystem.</p> Rethinking trust networks through badge endorsements <p>If you’re familiar with LinkedIn, you’ll know that the platform allows you to ‘recommend’ colleagues by writing brief testimonials about their performance or approach to work. Similarly, you can ‘endorse’ them for specific&nbsp;skills.</p><p><a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> take this concept a step further by making learning and skills visible. As we highlighted in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/endorsement-practices-using-open-badges-and-community-recognition-d0bfd96a4799">previous post</a>, the evolving Open Badges standard now enables retrospective endorsements, adding an extra layer of credibility to the skills, knowledge, or behaviours your organisation values and wishes to&nbsp;promote.</p><p>Our approach to badge endorsements is straightforward. We aim create categories based on universally accepted rules within a given group or professional body. For federations of co-operatives, these categories are naturally aligned with the well-established co-operative principles we’ve discussed earlier.</p><p>The above image comes from our <a href="https://goo.gl/XzLWso">presentation</a> to the Cooperative Education and Research Conference In 2017. Reflecting on that work, especially in light of recent advancements in the Open Badges ecosystem, opens up exciting avenues for future exploration.</p> Exploring Badge Endorsement scenarios <p>Guiding principles in professional networks serve to encourage specific behaviours. In the context of co-operatives, the aim is to cultivate global cooperation. To better understand deeper into how badges can facilitate this, we introduce a 2x2 grid that categorises badge endorsements from simple to complex, capturing the essence of co-operative behaviour.</p><p>Within this framework, national or international co-operative organisations like <a href="https://www.uk.coop/">Co-ops UK</a>, <a href="https://workers.coop">workers.coop</a>, or the <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en">International Cooperative Alliance</a> (ICA) have the capacity to issue badges to individual co-operatives. These badges can subsequently be endorsed by any people or organisations that engage with the&nbsp;co-op.</p><p>Our goal extends beyond merely recognising ‘membership.’ Such a narrow focus doesn’t adequately reflect a co-op’s alignment with co-operative principles. Instead, our grid aims to offer a more nuanced view, encouraging visibility, collaboration, and proactive engagement.</p><p>Starting at the bottom-left quadrant of the grid, we have the ‘enduring membership’ model. Here, a single badge is issued once to each federation member. The ideal evolution is towards the top-right quadrant, labelled ‘time-limited principles.’ In this advanced model, co-operatives receive annual badges endorsed by their collaborators, demonstrating ongoing commitment to co-operative principles.</p><p>Let’s break down each quadrant for a more detailed understanding.</p> 1. Enduring membership badges <p>A federation such as workers.coop issues a single ‘membership’ badge to its member organisations when they become a member. This badge can be endorsed by other individuals and organisations in the federation with which they collaborate.</p><p>✅ Pros: Simple to implement and offers a snapshot of network membership.</p><p>❌ Cons: Lacks focus on actions or behaviours, offering no incentive for members to actively embody federation values.</p> 2. Time-limited membership badges <p>A federation such as workers.coop issues a single ‘membership’ badge to its member organisations for each year they’re a member of the federation. This badge can be endorsed by other individuals and organisations in the federation with which they collaborate.</p><p>✅ Pros: Provides an annual overview of active participation, without revoking badges from departed&nbsp;members.</p><p>❌ Cons: Increased administrative burden due to yearly badge&nbsp;issuing.</p> 3. Enduring principles-based badges <p>A federation such as workers.coop issues seven different badges to its member organisations when they become a member. Each badge represents one of the seven cooperative principles. This badge can be endorsed by individuals and organisations with which they collaborate, either inside or outside the federation.</p><p>✅ Pros: Encourages a focus on specific co-operative principles, enhancing network alignment..</p><p>❌ Cons: Potential for confusion with multiple badges; risk of neglecting some principles.</p> 4. Time-limited principles-based badges <p>A federation such as workers.coop issues seven different badges to its member organisations for each year they’re a member of the federation. This badge can be endorsed by individuals and organisations with which they collaborate, either inside or outside the federation.</p><p>✅ Pros: Offers an annual update on active principle adherence, aiding in the search for like-minded collaborators.</p><p>❌ Cons: High administrative effort for yearly updates and potential for ‘badge fatigue.’</p> Conclusion <p>In summary, our 2x2 grid provides a sophisticated framework for badge endorsements in professional and cooperative networks. Transitioning from a singular ‘membership’ badge to annually updated, principles-based badges enables a more dynamic and transparent ecosystem.

<p>Condatis delivers bespoke Identity and Access Management solutions designed to simplify onboarding, enhance security, and boost overall business efficiency for clients globally.<br></p><p>The company is a leading systems integrator for Microsoft Azure in the UK, and is one of the partners involved in delivering the National Health Service (NHS) Digital Staff Passport for the past three years. <br></p><p>We caught up with founder and CTO, Chris Eckl, to hear about how the service began life in the midst of the pandemic, and how it is evolving to support broader NHS objectives and use cases. &nbsp; <br></p><p>The NHS Digital Staff Passport has an interesting history. How did the project come about? <br></p><p>Staff onboarding can take a long time in the NHS. There are hundreds of Trusts (local healthcare organizations) and senior staff have many credentials. Doctors were turning up with briefcases full of paper every time they needed to move to a new location. <br></p><p>We were planning some hackathons in December 2019 together with our sister company Sitekit and Interopen (a group aiming to accelerate interoperability in the UK healthcare sector) to explore how decentralized identity could help address this. </p><p>Then the pandemic hit. <br></p><p>Suddenly, the NHS was facing hotspots of high demand around the country. They needed to move staff around a lot quicker, and to have them working in the new organization from Day One. <br></p><p>We saw that a decentralized approach was the right direction. Give the doctor or nurse their own data and they can share it directly with the new employer, without the need for Human Resources (HR) to manage everything.<br></p><p>What solution did you implement initially and how has it evolved?<br></p><p>Because of our long experience building Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, we suggested we could stand something up quickly. First, we went through this legal exploration of how to do the staff onboarding in a new way. The base system was built in six weeks and the COVID-19 Digital Staff Passport went live in summer 2020. <br></p><p>Every NHS Trust that opted in got their own instance. At first the aim was to ensure COVID hotspots had enough staff. The ‘sending’ Trust’s HR team put the staff member’s credentials into a Verifiable Credential (VC), then physically visited the ‘receiving’ Trust to authorize the secondment.<br></p><p>Later in the project, it became more about ensuring all immunization facilities are staffed. We also moved from face-to-face governance meetings to Skype, and connected to the Electronic Staff Record (ESR), a common HR system. &nbsp;</p><p>We’ve built in a lot more automation since the early days. <br></p><p>Please can you describe the key technology pieces that sit behind the NHS Digital Staff Passport, and Condatis’ role in delivering these &nbsp;<br></p><p>Microsoft Entra is now being used to issue and verify credentials, but the NHS wants to ensure staff are not forced to use any particular wallet. Condatis developed an OpenID Connect (OIDC) bridge we call the Credentials Gateway, that can communicate with many wallet providers and allows the NHS to work with a single integrator partner, as well as enabling users to choose their wallet. <br></p><p>A key piece is the trust layer that underpins communication between wallet and verifier. The issuers’ Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) were initially anchored on the Sovrin network. This is now moving to did:web, as credential holders don’t need their own identifiers (Editor’s note: this method works by hosting an issuer’s DID document on a company website domain, proving the DID’s owner controls the domain and is affiliated with the company). &nbsp; <br></p><p>There’s also a need for a trust register and a revocation register, so verifiers know they can trust the issuer of a credential, and that it is still valid. Condatis is working on both of those pieces. <br></p><p>What is the current status of the project, and what’s the future direction? <br></p><p>We have a successful system in place that’s been used since summer 2020, and was really helpful in enabling the COVID-19 immunization program to be delivered. <br></p><p>The NHS has used this experience to create a framework for a long-term Digital Staff Passport.<br></p><p>The program is moving into a public Beta phase over the autumn (Editor’s note: a full roll-out is expected by August 2025*). The current system will be decommissioned and replaced with a new solution encompassing the full identity lifecycle of a healthcare professional, from when they graduate and do placements, to getting registered with their professional body, right-to-work checks and continuing professional development, all using Verifiable Credentials. It’s also moving into access credentials for digital services used by NHS staff. <br></p><p>The ecosystem is expanding (for example, enabling more wallet providers to participate) and Condatis and Sitekit have been retained as partners. <br></p><p>What lessons have been learned during this journey? <br></p><p>The current program has provided a lot of insight about how to do things better. For example, we ended up with a lot of data fields in the credentials. Now we’re looking to use more specific credentials and combine them in compound proofs. We’ve also done important work with Microsoft, Evernym (now part of Gen Digital) and Yoti on how different wallets can interoperate. <br></p><p>Another learning has been around the governance process for staff secondments. There are many legal and HR challenges, such as who needs to agree to what in a secondment. &nbsp;<br></p><p>There’s also the question of how to establish trust between issuers and verifiers. Each identity platform only goes so far. We’re aiming to codify the trust framework in the Credentials Gateway and to make it more modular, so it’s replicated on all partner nodes.<br></p><p>How has DIF membership helped? <br></p><p>We’ve been a DIF member for a long time. The work on Presentation Exchange (PE) in particular is important to us, and has helped us address some of the interoperability challenges around exchanging credentials. </p><p></p><p>*Source: NHS Long Term Workforce Plan <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan-v1.2.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan-v1.2.pdf</a><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>We’ve been in an uphill fight to empower people—customers—in online markets where the prevailing belief is that captive customers are more valuable than free ones. (The value of free customers is well-understood, though not always respected, in offline markets.) And we’ve been in this fight for more than seventeen years.</p>
<p>But now AI is&nbsp;<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en">all the craze</a>.</p>
<p>Question: Can AI help VRM? And vice versa?</p>
<p>Think about&nbsp;what would happen if people had their own AI systems, working for them and not for companies whose business is selling you something (e.g. Amazon), pushing advertising at you (e.g. Google), or trapping you in their walled garden (e.g. Apple)? Why not have our own AI, to help us make better sense of our contacts, our calendars, our health, financial, property, travel, and other kinds of data? And then, when the need arises, have our personal AI help us make well-informed decisions about what to buy, how, and where, without being biased by marketers and their bots on the other side?</p>
<p>Those are just a few questions we’ll be visiting two Mondays from now, October 9, at VRM Day in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The time frame will be 9am to 4pm. There is also plenty of parking (the Museum is otherwise closed on Mondays).</p>
<p>We’ll visit other questions that come up, of course. And participants with something to show off are free to do that as well. And some will, especially with <a href="http://iiworkshop.org/">IIW</a>&nbsp;happening the following three days, also at the Computer History Museum.</p>

<p>The world moves. Technology advances. We find ourselves standing at crossroads, staring at paths paved by Big Gov and Big Tech. Both promise the same thing: a digital ID for the new age. But the truth? It’s found somewhere else – in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Here’s why.</p>



<p>Big Gov has strength. It has power. But with that power comes weight. The heavy bureaucracy makes change slow, like an old bull trying to keep pace with sprightly calves. Big Gov means centralized control. It means data housed in a single barn, a target for those with ill intentions. It’s a single point of failure in a vast digital landscape. Too risky.</p>



<p>Then there’s Big Tech. Sleek. Modern. But with its shine comes opacity. Behind the gleaming surface, data gets traded, often without consent. With Big Tech, control is elsewhere, not with the individual. The profits, the power, they flow upward, leaving the user, the real owner of the data, out in the cold.</p>



<p>SSI? It’s different. It’s like the open plains. Vast. Decentralized. SSI gives control back to the individual. It’s your identity, your data. You decide who sees it, who doesn’t. It’s not stored in one barn or controlled by one entity. It’s spread out, secure, like stars scattered across the night sky.</p>



<p>With SSI, trust is inherent. Transactions are transparent. You know where your data goes, and who’s knocking at your digital door. There’s no middleman. No ulterior motives. It’s just you and your identity, standing strong.</p>



<p>The world is complex. Digital identity shouldn’t add to that complexity. It should be straightforward, transparent, and secure. It should be in the hands of the one it belongs to. That’s the simple truth.</p>



<p>In the end, it’s a matter of trust. Do you trust a heavy system, slow to change, susceptible to breaches? Do you trust shiny corporations, with their hidden motives and centralized power?</p>



<p>Or do you trust yourself?</p>



<p>The answer seems clear. The world moves. And as it does, may it move towards the simplicity and truth of Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>

<p></p>      DENSO, Honda, and Nissan to Co-Chair New MOBI Working Group           <p>Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport Working Group unites efforts to drive solutions for comprehensive circularity in global supply chains.</p>
          <p>MOBI is proud to introduce the co-chairs of our highly anticipated Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport (CE-GBP) Working Group (WG). The WG aims to set interoperability standards and build the foundational infrastructure for comprehensive circularity in global supply chains, with an initial focus on building a decentralized Global Battery Passport System (GBPS).</p>
<p>As organizations worldwide strive to meet global sustainability goals, enhance energy efficiency, and pave the way for long-term supply chain resilience, it is critical to drive the adoption of circular business practices from product sourcing to manufacturing, use, end-of-life, and beyond. This transformative shift towards end-to-end circularity represents a pivotal moment in our collective efforts to address urgent environmental and economic challenges.</p>
<p>Circularity in the battery industry remains a pressing concern for supply chain stakeholders as battery usage proliferates in various industries — including EV production and renewable energy storage. Emerging regulations worldwide emphasize battery traceability and highlight the need for a standardized approach to promote circularity, safety, and quality assurance throughout the battery supply chain.</p>
<p>Global policies regarding batteries, like the US Treasury’s Section 30D Guidance on EV Tax Credits and the EU Battery Regulation, mandate digital recordkeeping to track battery life cycles, underscoring the need for a global battery passport — a digital credential containing key information about the battery’s composition, state of health, history, and more.</p>
<p>Ensuring battery supply chain circularity requires a new system built on global interoperability standards — one that enables verifiable, end-to-end information traceability throughout a battery’s lifecycle and permits privacy-preserving coordination between supply chain stakeholders (public and private). MOBI and its members are developing a decentralized GBPS to facilitate seamless communication in production management, maintenance, safety, second and third-life uses, and recycling while meeting consumer demands and ensuring regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Released in June 2023, MOBI’s Guideline for Implementation of a Decentralized Global Battery Passport System marked a critical milestone towards this goal. The CE-GBP Working Group is set to build on this foundation through the creation of new standards and the development of GBPS infrastructure. Members of the WG will also focus on implementation of the GBPS and defining the next steps for interoperability and industry adoption.</p>
<p>The CE-GBP Working Group is supported by our dedicated working group members: Anritsu, ASJade Tech, Aucnet, AWS, BMW, CEVT, Dana, DENSO, Ford, Hitachi America Ltd, Honda, HIOKI, ITOCHU, Mazda, Nissan, Orico, Politecnico di Torino, ParkyMyFleet, Quantstamp, Reply, Stellantis, SyncFab, State Farm, Toyota Industries Corporation (TICO), Tradelog, Vitesco, and Vinturas.</p>
           Meet the CE-GBP Co-Chairs   <p>Roger Berg — Vice President, DENSO North America R&amp;D: “I embrace the prospect of collaborating once more with industry experts in crafting a universally adaptable sustainability battery passport solution for the evolving electric vehicle (EV) landscape. MOBI stands with its members at a pivotal juncture, and all of us are acutely aware of the profound significance of this work for the broader industry.”</p>
<p>Christian Köbel — Sr. Project Engineer, Honda R&amp;D Europe: “Web3 principles and blockchain hold the potential to facilitate the implementation of upcoming battery regulations, such as reporting CO2 emissions embedded in a battery, or providing a battery product passport with verifiable stakeholders and data. The time is now right to evaluate this potential and exploit it further, towards future interoperable ecosystems for battery passports and data sharing.”</p>
<p>Yoshinori Suzue — Sr. Manager, Nissan North America Inc.: “I am honored to serve as a CE-GBP Working Group Co-chair with MOBI, which is helping to drive mobility innovation toward Circular Economy and create an automotive industry ecosystem that is more sustainable for all.”</p>
<p>About MOBI</p>

<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the approval and publication of new Approved Errata by the members of the OASIS Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) TC.</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>Software developers use a variety of tools to assess the quality of their programs. These tools can report results on qualities such as validity, security, performance, compliance with legal requirements, etc. To form an overall picture of program quality, developers often need to aggregate the results produced by all of these tools, a task made difficult when each tool produces output in a different format.</p>



<p>SARIF defines a standard format for the output of static analysis tools in order to:<br>– Comprehensively capture the range of data produced by commonly used static analysis tools.<br>– Reduce the cost and complexity of aggregating the results of various analysis tools into common workflows.<br>– Represent analysis results for all kinds of programming artifacts, including source code and object code.</p>



<p>This publication includes:<br>– The errata, in the form of a list of changes. (sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os)<br>– The OASIS Standard with the errata changes applied and highlighted. (sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-redlined)<br>– The OASIS Standard with the errata changes applied, and not redlined. (sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete)<br>– The SARIF v2.1.0 JSON schemas.</p>

<p>‘<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Response_-Biometrics-discussion-document-2023.pdf">Digital Identity NZ’s submission</a>&nbsp;to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/publications/guidance-resources/biometrics-and-privacy/">potential code of practice for Biometrics</a>&nbsp;is possibly the most comprehensive response to a submission on Biometrics ever done in Aotearoa in recent times’. In my message to DINZ’s Executive Council to confirm the submission, that was my assessment of the depth and quality of the mahi produced by DINZ’s Biometrics Special Interest Group (SIG) and two further experts – one an indigenous rights advocate working with Māori data experts in this space, the other with deep knowledge and insights into Māori tikanga and Māori Data Sovereignty – both of whom hugely informed this submission. Our subsequent&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/11/digital-identity-new-zealand-dinz-advocates-for-a-thoughtful-approach-to-potential-biometric-regulation-in-new-zealand/">press release</a>&nbsp;was picked up by RNZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/businessnews/audio/2018906570/midday-business-news-for-12-september-2023">Midday Business News</a>&nbsp;at 1’56” and a further post on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/497828/biometric-industry-warns-that-regulation-may-bring-unintended-consequences?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=0eab72ff5e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-0eab72ff5e-">website</a>.</p>



<p>Our submission maintained that the Privacy Act 2020 remains the most appropriate regulatory instrument for all personal information, provided Privacy Impact Assessments are made mandatory and that definitions are clear. Standards based clear guidance co-created with industry would both improve education, provide confidence for industry, and maintain convenience and benefits for people while avoiding unintended consequences for them such as increased friction in their online experience and hampering technological improvement for industry. It’s far better to regulate the rare exceptional use cases than regulate the whole domain and have a plethora of exceptions. To follow up our submission, one DINZ member has a blog/podcast in the works on how Privacy Enhancing Technologies can retain the benefits of biometrics while protecting people from potential harm. Look out for it in the coming months.</p>



<p>All of our submissions, reports and other mahi are published&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=0eab72ff5e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-0eab72ff5e-">on our website under Our Work</a>&nbsp;including yesterday’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Submission-Targeted-Engagement-DISTF-Regulations.pdf">submission</a>&nbsp;to the Department of Internal Affairs’&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DISTF-Regulations-Discussion-Paper.pdf">Discussion Paper on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Regulations</a>.</p>



<p>While the topic above is a case in point, it’s clear that in recent years there’s been a downward trend across public sector agencies in retaining deep technical expertise and operational experience in their respective knowledge domains they are responsible for. It’s understandable given the pressure to reduce public spending. Even workarounds to bring in experts on short-term contracts are caught up in spending cuts. Election rhetoric around public sector cuts oversimplifies the expertise vs budget challenge that agencies face. As a consequence we see high level material developed in-house by agencies put out for public consultation with the ensuing submission-consultation-submission back and forth. It’s not a great way to develop anything because it wastes all parties’ precious time and effort typically ending in suboptimal outcomes and unintended consequences. But it’s the symptom of a deeper cause rooted in how we have traditionally developed and implemented policy in Aotearoa. Simply put, we have to start ‘right-sizing’ for the reality of our public expenditure budget. The public sector co-creating with industry (just as more effort has been made in recent years to co-create with Māori) would motivate people and organisations to step up and deliver better outcomes for all. Of course this challenges long standing public sector policies to avoid conflicts of interest and bias that have led to the current approach but we simply have to think in more modern terms about how we deliver really good outcomes in technically complex domains with minimal budgets. It’s not just an issue and opportunity for digital identity and its related technical domains such as Biometrics. It’s a macro-economic issue though most easily observed in digital contexts. The NZTech Alliance, of which DINZ is a part, continues to press for change. Please support us to drive a co-creation agenda for better outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

It sets Blockchain Wire on the path of creating a global inclusive platform for gathering and accessing company data and investor insights.</p><p>“The Alpha Transform Holdings’ team has been involved in the industry for the last 2 decades and the combination of AI and Web3 technologies are presenting an unprecedented opportunity in this field. It empowers companies to share more verifiable information about their business, empowers other stakeholders (e.g. auditors, certification bodies, government agencies) to share their claims and gives investors or analysts seamless access to this entire body of knowledge. We’re very excited to see the impact this technology can deliver.” Enzo Villani, Co-founder at Blockchain Wire</p><p>The new capabilities are based on OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and will be built in partnership with Trace Labs (core developers of OriginTrail DKG). The DKG is a mature technology, already in use by Fortune500 companies in multiple industries (global trade, pharmaceuticals, construction industry, metaverse).</p><p>“We are proud to work with the Blockchain Wire team on an industry breakthrough solution they’re bringing to the market. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to leap-frog many industries and the corporate news and investor research fields are definitely high on the list of the most impactful ones. We’re looking forward to seeing the solution get in the hands of users and help Blockchain Wire achieve their vision.” Žiga Drev, Founder at Trace&nbsp;Labs</p><p>Blockchain Wire made the first sneak peek demo available <a href="https://blockchainwiredemo.origintrail.io/">here</a>, where you can use the interface to pose questions about this press release.

 CarbonEnfo, a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlanta-based Empower Energy Technology, will leverage Energy Web’s ecosystem and Web 3 infrastructure solutions to develop and launch a range of blockchain-enabled energy data&nbsp;services <p>Zug, Switzerland, 21 September 2023— CarbonEnfo, a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlanta-based Empower Energy Technology, a leader in direct generation solar as well as renewable energy measurement/management, has joined the Energy Web Foundation’s established ecosystem of energy majors and IT service providers by validating Energy Web’s decentralized operating system.</p><p>The move comes as <a href="https://www.carbonenfo.com/">CarbonEnfo </a>seeks to extend its expertise in renewable energy data by developing and launching a range of enterprise and consumer-facing solutions for the U.S. market.

<p>The Open Wallet Foundation has accepted a proposal by Findynet and TNO to take ownership and control of the open-source digital wallet and agent comparison matrix and establish a new special interest group to maintain it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital wallet and agent overview is a framework that enables the comparison of digital wallets based on their characteristics, such as the technical capabilities they support. Digital wallets enable the holder to store credentials and to make presentations to verifiers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/wallet-overview/">SSI wallet overview</a> of the comparison framework, hosted in TNO’s Github repository, is focused on cloud and mobile applications for holders that can be used to store, manage, and present verifiable credentials. The <a href="https://findyfi.github.io/wallet-overview/">SSI agent overview</a>, forked into Findynet’s Github repository, extends the scope to include agents that can issue and verify&nbsp;verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>The overview was born when the Dutch research organization for applied science (TNO) began evaluating various digital wallets. One driver was to prioritize the development of connectors in the <a href="https://eassi.ssi-lab.nl/">TNO EASSI gateway</a>, but also to provide an independent and transparent overview. TNO invited SSI wallet vendors to fill in the data for the overview in order to keep the data as correct and up-to-date as possible.</p>
<p>The second version was developed when Findynet needed to evaluate SSI solutions for enterprise use. Findynet added more characteristics and functionality to the framework. Some of the Findynet additions are also merged into TNO’s version.</p>
<p>Together, TNO and Findynet <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/tac/issues/56">proposed</a> that the OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) adopt the repository. We also proposed a new Special Interest Group (SIG) to be formed to further develop and maintain the digital wallet and agent overviews. The proposals were <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18fnNIsJSsyLVghINBK4iTqFP6UYacCJjP7jnDjxZcGw/edit#slide=id.g27a1c9067e9_0_0">accepted</a> on September 20th, 2023 in the OWF Technical Advisory Council meeting.</p>
<p>The new group should discuss the terminology and the scoping of the overview – whether the holder wallets and the issuer and verifier agents should be contained in one overview, or be split up into two.</p>
<p>TNO is an independent research organization making knowledge serve the common good.</p>
<p>Findynet Cooperative is building infrastructure for trusted communications and self-sovereign identity in Finland.</p>
<p>The OpenWallet Foundation is a consortium of companies and non-profit organization collaborating to drive global adoption of open, secure, and interoperable digital wallet solutions as well as providing access to expertise and advice.</p>

		<p>Newark, NJ, August 28, 2023 – Edge, the region’s nonprofit research and education network (REN)&nbsp; and technology partner, is pleased to welcome Bucknell University as its first connected member in the state of Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Bucknell University, a private liberal arts college in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, discovered Edge while searching for a REN that could offer a converged solution encompassing internet services, Internet2 services, and AWS Direct Connect as well as a service provider with industry-leading service reliability and 24/7/365 customer support. Enter Edge, a REN able to provide access to all three of those solutions across one 100 gig circuit.</p>
<p>“The solution we constructed for Bucknell created an exciting challenge due to the level of complexity and distance from our network,” explained Bruce Tyrrell, Associate Vice President Programs &amp; Services, Edge. Continued Tyrrell, “With the connections now fully operational and functioning in accordance with Bucknell’s specification, the solution we constructed is the largest Layer 2 VLAN environment Edge has built for an institution to date–a true landmark achievement.”</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar is quoted in the lead story of The Green Sheet: “Simply put, verification is the process of confirming someone’s identity. Authentication is the process of recognizing someone’s identity,” he said. “The easiest way to think about it is that you verify someone’s identity less often—usually at the point of account creation—to confirm they are who they say they are. You then authenticate them at subsequent sign-ins to confirm the person logging in is the person who created the account.”</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Where there is light, there are shadows. The relationship between an object, its shadow, and the illuminating light source(s) is geometrically simple, and yet it’s deceptively difficult to get just right in a manipulated or synthesized image. In the image below, the bottle's cast shadow is clearly incongruous with the shape of the bottle. Such obvious errors in a shadow are easy to spot, but more subtle differences can be harder to detect.</p>

  <p>Below are two images in which the bottle and its cast shadow are slightly different. (The rest of the scene is identical). Can you tell which is consistent with the lighting in the rest of the scene?</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>The geometry of cast shadows is dictated by the 3D shape and location of an object and the illuminating light(s). This relationship is wonderfully simple: A point on an object, its corresponding shadow, and the light source responsible for the shadow all lie on a single line.</p><p>Because (in the absence of lens distortion) straight lines in the 3D scene are imaged to straight lines in the 2D image, this basic constraint holds in the image. Locate any point on a shadow and its corresponding point on the object, and draw a line through them. Repeat for as many clearly defined shadow and object points as possible, and for an authentic image, all the lines will intersect at one point — the location of the illuminating light.</p><p>Below are the results of this simple geometric analysis applied to the two images above, clearly revealing the fake.</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>From shadows to reflections</p><p>As a student taking the subway to work each morning, I would stare out the window and watch the tunnel walls whiz by superimposed atop reflections of my fellow passengers. On occasion someone’s reflection would catch my eye, and I would look back into the subway car to get a better view. But I would invariably not see them where I thought they would be given the position of their reflection on the window. As a budding image and vision scientist this really bothered me — how could it be that it was so hard to reason about something so simple as a reflection in a window?</p><p>Below are two images of the same basic scene. The reflection of the table and garbage can are slightly different; everything else is the same. Can you tell which is correct? </p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>The geometry of reflections is fairly straightforward. Consider standing in front of a mirror and looking at your reflection. An imaginary straight line connects each point on your body with its reflection. These lines are perpendicular to the mirror’s surface and are parallel to one another. When photographed at an oblique angle, however, these imaginary lines will not remain parallel but will converge to a single point. This is the same reason why railroad tracks that are parallel in the world appear to converge in a photograph.</p><p>This geometry of reflections suggests a simple forensic technique for verifying the integrity of reflections. Locate any point on an object and its corresponding point on the reflection, and draw a line through them. Repeat for as many clearly defined object and reflection points as possible. As you do this, you will find that all the lines should intersect at one point.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are the results of this simple geometric analysis, which clearly reveals the second reflection to be the fake.</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  



  



  <p>Notice that this geometric analysis is exactly the same as that used to analyze shadows. The reason is that in both cases we are exploiting basic principles of perspective projection that dictate the projection of straight lines.</p><p>In practice, there are some limitations to a manual application of this geometric analysis. We must take care to select appropriately matched points on the shadow/reflection and the object. We can best achieve this when the object has a distinct shape, like the corner of a cube or the tip of a cone. Depending on the scene geometry, the constraint lines may be nearly parallel, making the computation of their intersection vulnerable to slight error in selecting matched points. And, it may be necessary to remove any lens distortion in the image that causes straight lines to be imaged as curved lines that will then no longer intersect at a single point.</p><p>From Adobe Photoshop to generative AI</p><p>When we first developed these techniques, we were primarily concerned with images that were manipulated with Photoshopto, for example, digitally add a person or object and its shadow or reflection. Because our own visual system is not particularly sensitive to inconsistent shadows and reflections (see item 1 in the Further Reading section below) and because it is difficult to precisely match the 3D scene geometry within 2D photo editing software, this technique has proven quite effective at uncovering fakes.</p><p>Classic computer-generated imagery is produced by modeling 3D scene geometry, the surrounding illumination, and a virtual camera. As a result, rendered images accurately capture the geometry and physics of natural scenes, including shadows and reflections. In contrast, AI-generated imagery is produced by learning the statistical distribution of natural scenes from a large set of real images. Without an explicit 3D model of the world, it is natural to wonder how accurately synthesized content captures the geometry of shadows and reflections.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we are still early in the age of generative AI, today's AI-generated images seem to struggle to produce perspectively correct shadows and reflections. Below is a typical example, generated using OpenAI's DALL-E2, in which the shadows are inconsistent (yellow lines), the reflections are impossibly mismatched and missing, and the shadows in the reflection are oriented in exactly the wrong direction. (See item 2 in the Further Reading section below for a more detailed analysis.</p><p>Even in the absence of explicit 3D modeling of objects, surfaces, and lighting — as found in traditional CGI-rendering — AI-generated images exhibit many of the properties of natural scenes. At the same time, cast shadows and reflections in mirrored surfaces are not fully consistent with the expected perspective geometry of natural scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The trend in generative AI has been that increasingly larger synthesis engines yield increasingly more realistic images. As such, it may just be a matter of time before generative AI will learn to create images with full-blown perspective consistency. Until that time, however, this geometric forensic analysis may prove useful.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>1. S.J. Nightingale, K.A. Wade, H. Farid, and D.G.

Citopia and the ITN services are business-to-business (B2B) only. Together, Citopia and the ITN provide the necessary infrastructure for node operators to build out secure, seamless, globally compliant web services and applications. MOBI membership is required to operate a node on Citopia and/or the ITN. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/participate/">Contact us to learn more about becoming a node operator</a></p>
     <a></a>         Overview of the Pilot and the Problem It Solves           <p>The eTitling/eRegistration Automation Pilot (“Pilot”) is spearheaded by MOBI’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contract (FSSC) Working Group (WG)</a> with contributions from Accenture, Altaventure, Amazon Web Services, BMW Bank, CEVT, Connections Insights, CO-OP Financial Services, ConsenSys, D.E. Consulting, DENSO, DMI, Ford Credit, Global Debt Registry, GM Financial, Honda, IOTA, Itochu, National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), Nissan Motor Acceptance Company, On the Road Lending, Orrick, Quant Network, Quantstamp, Reply, RouteOne, Southeast Toyota Finance, Spring Free EV, Stellantis Financial Services, Tezos Foundation, Toyota Industries Corporation, Trade Log, and USAA.</p>
<p>Across the U.S., there are hundreds or even thousands of jurisdictions with unique databases and processes for handling registration and titling. While organizations in some of these jurisdictions have begun digitizing certain processes, it is difficult to automate eTitling/eRegistration across state lines with existing centralized platforms and databases. The sheer amount of stakeholders involved means that the frictional cost of trust is extremely high, and centralized solutions lack the interoperability and data security needed to address the challenges facing the ecosystem. Solving these pain points requires a secure solution that can be easily and cheaply adopted across all jurisdictions rather than one that functions at a state, county, or municipal jurisdiction level. </p>
<p>MOBI leverages standards-based <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins™ (SSDTs)™</a> — decentralized universal translators — for ecosystem interoperability. SSDTs™ can be used by stakeholders within their existing applications to increase the efficiency of registration and titling for vehicles at the point of purchase or transfer. In Phase 1 of the Pilot, the FSSC WG will demonstrate privacy-preserving multiparty business automation for eTitling across jurisdictional and organizational lines. SSDTs™ will be used for communication interoperability without the need to build new infrastructure. The WG is currently drafting high-level requirements for the pilot. Phase 2 will include real-world implementation.</p>
                    Stakeholders:    Vehicle Manufacturers(OEMs); Financial Institutions (FIs) /Lenders &amp; Servicers; Dealerships; Motor Vehicle Authorities (MVAs) / Third party registration &amp; titling providers (RTPs); State Authorized Inspectors, Department of Justice National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (DoJ NMVTIS); Third Party Data Consolidators; Fleet Operators; and Consumers.                Our Innovative Solution        Self-Sovereign Digital Twins™: trusted decentralized identity for interoperability and business automation   <p>Currently, digital transactions rely on identities issued by centralized platforms to prove their credentials. However, in addition to being vulnerable to fraud, identity theft, and data leaks, centralized approaches to identity management fail to address the trust problems created by the rise of decentralized services, IOT, and Generative AI. As digitization advances, it will become increasingly challenging — and costly — to verify data authenticity, secure digital perimeters, and ensure cross-border regulation compliance. This is critical for state agencies like MVAs and regulated lenders, who are responsible for executing the bulk of the registration/titling process.</p>
<p>Overcoming these challenges calls for a new solution. The White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Federal Zero Trust Strategy</a> (2022) underscores this need by directing federal agencies to adopt a Zero Trust framework by the end of FY 2024. Zero Trust requires every entity to authenticate and validate every other entity for every single digital transaction at all times. Since this is not possible through Web2/centralized means, we must leverage Web3 technologies and principles to unlock privacy-preserving ecosystem interoperability using Citopia <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins™ (SSDTs™)</a>.</p>
           What are SSDTs™?   <p>SSDTs™ are portable digital twins that can automatically authenticate identity and selectively disclose pertinent data for Web3 transactions at the edge. SSDTs™ combine standards from W3C, MOBI, IEEE, ISO, SAE, and others with Zero-Knowledge cryptography to offer the data privacy and autonomy needed to engage in secure, tamper-evident transactions across the connected ecosystem. SSDTs™ enable cross-industry interoperability and business automation through:</p>
        
<p>Enabling seamless verification and validation of identities and transactions</p>
    
<p>Empowering the creation of regulation-compliant data privacy solutions</p>
    
<p>Providing the ability to obtain and monetize data at the moment of transaction without the need to open up databases / store data</p>
    
<p>Serving as platform-agnostic, legacy system compatible “universal translators,” eliminating the need to build new infrastructure / APIs</p>

<p>The biometric industry is asking the privacy commissioner to develop a code of practice that will not impose regulations that stifle innovation.</p>



<p>Industry organisation Digital Identity (DINZ) was concerned regulation would introduce complexities and unintended consequences for the emerging technology.</p>



<p>DINZ executive director Colin Wallis said the industry was advocating for a code that offered strong guidance, while building awareness and education.</p>



<p>“No decision has been made yet, but our point to them was just be careful of the unintended consequences of coming in too quickly, with a lack of forethought about some of the unintended consequences,” he said.</p>



<p>“And our point was, start with beefing up guidance and support and knowledge and awareness, before beginning to try and regulate the space.”</p>



<p>Biometric information included physical and behavioural features such as faces, fingerprints, voices, and walking patterns, which could be used to verify identities online, border control, law enforcement, retail security, access control and attendance monitoring in workplaces and schools.</p>



<p>“Our response focuses on striking a balance between protecting individuals’ privacy and allowing responsible government and business use of biometric data,” Wallis said.</p>



<p>“We emphasise the importance of a thoughtful and well-informed approach to considering the potential for regulation of the use of biometrics, tailored to the unique challenges of this technology.”</p>

<p>Talk with Vladimir Vujovic, Senior Digital Innovation Manager from SICPA about product definition and value proposition of Issuer/Holder/Verifier software of SSI tech providers. Why is it hard to convey the right message to the audience coming from outside of SSI domain. How different SSI tech providers define their offering and the language they use to convey the message. What is really the value proposition of SSI tech providers who are offering their Issuer/Verifier software to the market. How big regulation initiatives like the one in Europe for eIDAS v2 are driving the market and roadmaps for SSI tech providers and how will such initiative will have impact to the rest of the world in terms of regulation, but some of the underlying technical standards. What is the place of SSI platforms in the broader Identity landscape and when are we going to see more maturity from the market. </p>

<p>Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ), an organization making expert contributions to New Zealand’s digital transformation efforts, has underlined the need to prioritize an intense awareness and education program related to the intricacies of biometrics deployment in the country.</p>



<p>This call is contained in a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Response_-Biometrics-discussion-document-2023.pdf">submission</a>&nbsp;by the group and it comes as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/new-zealand-privacy-commissioner-considers-biometric-regulation-code">is considering</a>&nbsp;a code of practice that will regulate the use of the technology that has become a common feature in the daily lives of New Zealanders, according to a DINZ news release.</p>



<p>From online ID verification to border control, to law enforcement, retail security, access control and attendance monitoring in offices and schools, the deployment of biometrics in growing by the day in New Zealand and users are also getting worried about the potential risks of the technology if it is deployed improperly.</p>



<p>“Our response focuses on striking a balance between protecting individuals’ privacy and allowing responsible government and business use of biometric data. We emphasize the importance of a thoughtful and well-informed approach to considering the potential for regulation of the use of biometrics, tailored to the unique challenges of this technology,” says Colin Wallis, DINZ executive director.</p>



<p>He adds that because biometrics are increasingly taking a preponderant place in the lives of citizens, the need for “demonstrable privacy and technical expertise, alongside practical experience combined with good design and implementation, are keys to great outcomes.”</p>



<p>In the submission, DINZ advises the OPC on five key things to consider as it figures out a biometrics code of practice.</p>



<p>On privacy protection, the organization believes that users can have assurance about adequate privacy protection if privacy impact assessment as sated in the Privacy Act 2020 is made mandatory. This, it says, will help “avoid unintended consequences, elevate industry standards and prevent subpar practices.”</p>



<p>Among other things, DINZ calls for clarification on which definition of biometrics should apply to New Zealand before a code of practice is considered, suggests that regulatory changes should primarily safeguard individuals’ privacy in identification and verification processes, advises OPC to exercise caution and avoid rushing into implementing a code of practice which could trigger a change towards “compliance behaviour” that will stifle innovation.</p>



<p>“The proposals for a code could suspend, reduce, or delay use of biometric information, to the detriment of information security and customer service,” DINZ writes in response to the OPC’s question about potential unintended consequences of its regulation. “The proposals could also stunt development and innovation that would in time improve the accuracy and acceptability of less well known/trusted use cases.”</p>



<p>A similar point about the risk of stifling biometrics innovation with overly restrictive regulation has also been made by, biometrics developers like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201910/facefirst-helps-us-lawmakers-draft-facial-recognition-privacy-regulations">FaceFirst</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/eu-preparing-tough-measures-for-ai-while-uk-and-us-take-a-slow-approach">government officials</a>, and even the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/with-long-road-ahead-experts-suggest-eu-ai-act-could-stifle-or-enable-biometrics-adoption">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>.</p>



<p>The group also recommends that OPC collaborate with industry experts to co-create guidance on biometric information’s use in identification and verification.</p>

<p>Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ) has submitted a comprehensive response to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) on its consideration of a code of practice for biometrics.&nbsp;DINZ is Aotearoa’s only community dedicated to digital identity, delivering trustworthy and recognised thought leadership that influences digital identity decision-making for the common good.&nbsp;DINZ’s deep insight into the operating environment for biometrics highlights the complexities and potential unintended consequences of introducing regulation through a code rather than starting with strong guidance, awareness, and education in this field.</p>



<p>Biometric information encompasses physical and behavioural features such as faces, fingerprints, voices, and walking patterns.&nbsp;Some examples of its use include identity verification online, border control, law enforcement, retail security, access control, and attendance monitoring in workplaces and schools.</p>



<p>The increasing role of biometric technologies in the lives of New Zealanders has led to calls for greater regulation of biometrics. Other countries are also considering how best to minimise potential harm to people caused by improper use of these technologies and some have enacted specific regulatory frameworks for biometrics.&nbsp;A code (if taken forward) could change how the privacy principles in the Privacy Act apply when organisations use technology to analyse biometric information.</p>



<p>DINZ Executive Director Colin Wallis says, “Our response focuses on striking a balance between protecting individuals’ privacy and allowing responsible government and business use of biometric data. We emphasise the importance of a thoughtful and well-informed approach to considering the potential for regulation of the use of biometrics, tailored to the unique challenges of this technology.</p>



<p>“Biometrics improves the digital experiences of New Zealanders every day in both the public and private sectors. Demonstrable privacy and technical expertise, alongside practical experience combined with good design and implementation, are keys to great outcomes,” says Colin.</p>



<p>Key Points from DINZ’s Response:</p>



  Privacy Protection: DINZ believes that the Privacy Act 2020 can provide people with adequate privacy protections for biometrics if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/responsibilities/privacy-impact-assessments/">Privacy Impact Assessments&nbsp;</a>become mandatory and high-quality, clear industry co-created guidance is issued under the oversight of OPC. This approach aims to avoid unintended consequences, elevate industry standards and prevent subpar practices.  



  Clarity on Definitions: DINZ emphasises the need for consensus on which of the international definitions of biometrics will apply in New Zealand before considering a code of practice. Clear definitions across the entire domain are essential to prevent confusion and ensure alignment with global standards.  



  Focus on Identification, Verification and Classification: DINZ suggests that regulatory changes should primarily safeguard individuals’ privacy in identification and verification processes, avoiding overlap with other regulatory authorities or areas outside the Privacy Act’s jurisdiction.  



  Measured Approach: DINZ advises OPC to exercise caution and avoid rushing into implementing a code of practice. The roughly equal support for further guidance and a code indicates concerns that a rush to a code will result in a change towards ‘compliance behaviour’ that will stifle innovation, have unintended consequences, and negatively affect the positive outcomes sought by a code’s introduction.  



  Industry Expertise: DINZ recommends that OPC collaborates with industry experts to co-create guidance on biometric information’s use in identification and verification. Such collaboration ensures informed and practical guidance while enhancing OPC’s expertise in this complex field.

      <p>There is one “extra” field that JSON-LD requires/needs which is @context and if you didn’t want to use it and simply wanted to ignore it and just do JSON you could. The VC would be entirely compliant and thus both data expression formats could live in the same specification. JSON-LD credentials that did have an @context that were being read by tooling that just did JSON could still read the credentials – it did nothing to interfere. This seems like a pretty good “let’s figure out how to live with each other” solution.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A JWT-VC has three parts, and the payload contains what I would call envelope information: the data needed to know who the credential is is bound to, who made the credential, when it was made and how it can be identified.  Additionally, there is a JSON object called “vc”. Claims information is embedded inside the vc object.  A JWT-VC uses an external proof, meaning in this case that signature data is not embedded inline with the credential, the signature is detached from the credential.

    <blockquote>
      <p>JWT takes a different approach to determining the meaning of claim terms in credentials. There is an <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml">IANA registry for JWT claims</a> as a first place to look for JWT claim definitions. If the claim name isn’t in the IANA register, then the claim can be given a “give it a public name (i.e., a URI), [or] a local name (i.e., any string)”. The meaning of the terms is decided between the issuers and verifiers.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>JWTs have the benefit of already being widely used in today’s identity technologies, most notably in the framework used by OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Because of this, there are a number of existing software libraries and tools that developers can use immediately to begin building out their implementations. In addition, due to the fact that JWT-based credentials rely on a shared assertion format with existing identity technologies, it may be an easier mental model for newcomers to adopt when starting to experiment with VCs.</p>

 VC-JWT Selective Disclosure

    <blockquote>
      <p>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519] can in principle be used to express Verifiable Credentials in a way that is easy to understand and process as it builds upon established web primitives.</p>

      <p>Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] is a specification that introduces conventions to support selective disclosure for JWTs: For an SD-JWT document, a Holder can decide which claims to release (within bounds defined by the Issuer).</p>

      <p>SD-JWT is a superset of JWT as it can also be used when there are no selectively disclosable claims and also supports JWS JSON serialization, which is useful for long term archiving and multi signatures. However, SD-JWT itself does not define the claims that must be used within the payload or their semantics.</p>

      <p>This specification therefore uses SD-JWT and the well-established JWT content rules and extensibility model as basis for representing Verifiable Credentials with JSON payload. Those Verifiable Credentials are called SD-JWT VCs.</p>

      <p>In recent years, newer solutions have been evolving such as Verifiable Credentials that formalize the entities of Issuer, Holder, and Verifier. A Verifiable Credential lifecycle has three accompanying phases: issuance, storage, and presentation.

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the fourth article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">Photo forensics for AI-generated faces</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Classic computer-generated imagery (CGI) is produced by modeling 3D scene geometry, the surrounding illumination, and a virtual camera. As a result, rendered images accurately capture the geometry and physics of natural scenes. By contrast, AI-generated imagery is produced by learning the statistical distribution of natural scenes. Without an explicit 3D model of the world, we might expect that these images will not always accurately capture the 3D properties of natural scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The lighting of a scene can be complex, because any number of lights can be placed in any number of positions, leading to different lighting environments. Under some fairly modest assumptions, however, it has been shown that a wide range of lighting can be modeled as a weighted sum of nine 3D lighting environments that each capture a variety of lighting patterns from different directions.</p><p>My team and I first wondered if lighting environments on AI-generated faces match those on photographic images. Next, we wondered if the lighting on multiple faces or objects in an image are the same, as would be expected in an authentic photo.</p><p>Analyzing lighting environments first requires fitting and aligning a 3D model to individual objects. Fortunately, for faces, fitting a 3D model to a single image is a problem that has largely been solved. (See article 1 in the Further Reading section.)&nbsp;</p><p>Below you’ll see a 3D model fitted to an AI-generated face. From this aligned 3D model, we can estimate the surrounding lighting environment, which reduces to nine numeric values corresponding to the weight on each of nine 3D lighting environments.</p>

  <p>As you can see in the plot on the left below, there are some significant deviations between the nine lighting values for real faces (horizontal axis) and diffusion-generated faces (vertical axis). Interestingly, as you can see in the plot on the right, the lighting on GAN-generated faces (see previous post) are nearly indistinguishable from the lighting on real faces.</p>

  <p>While a comparison of lighting environments may expose a diffusion-based face (or object), it appears that this approach will not provide much insight for GAN-based faces. This is the reverse of our <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">previously described technique</a>, which was applicable to GAN-based faces but not diffusion-based faces, further highlighting the need for a wide variety of approaches.</p><p>The above analysis can be expanded to compare the lighting between two people or two objects situated side by side in an image where, in a naturally photographed scene, we expect the lighting to be the same. For this analysis, we find that diffusion-based faces and objects exhibit relatively large (but not always perceptually obvious) differences in lighting. (See article 3 in the “Further reading” section below for more details.)</p><p>The strength of this lighting analysis is that we have discovered a fairly fundamental limitation of today's AI-generated content: In the absence of explicit 3D models of the physical world, diffusion-based models struggle to create images that are internally (across multiple people/objects) and externally (as compared to photographic images) consistent. The weakness of this technique is that, unlike other approaches, it does not necessarily lend itself to a fully automatic and high-throughput analysis. The fitting of 3D models can be somewhat time intensive and require manual intervention.</p><p>Another strength of this technique is that even when made aware of the issue of lighting inconsistencies, it is not easy for an adversary to adjust the image. That is because the pattern of illumination is the result of an interaction of the 3D lighting and the 3D scene geometry, whereas most photo editing occurs in 2D. Also, as you will see in the next post, there are additional aspects to lighting that we can exploit to distinguish the real from the fake.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] Y. Feng, H. Feng, M.J.

  <p>ABSTRACT: Self-Sovereign Computing is a transformative paradigm designed to empower individuals to take command of their digital journey and to uphold their dignity, human rights, and resilience online. It encourages proactive collaboration among individuals, collectives, and platforms to enhance digital autonomy and to mitigate vulnerabilities. Building on Christopher’s initial ideas of self-sovereign identity, self-sovereign computing introduces an allegory that revisits some foundational influences and recognizes self-sovereignty not just as a personal choice but as something that’s part of a larger ecosystem._</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2016, Christopher Allen authored <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, where he introduced the concept of “Self-Sovereignty” to the world, with its ten principles. Five years later, he offered an <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/SSI-5-Years-On/">update</a> on its progress. Today, the self-sovereign community continues to evolve, with recent successes including <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/news/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">the ratification of DIDs</a> and the passage of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">laws in Wyoming</a> that recognized self-sovereignty. Given the time that had passed, Christopher also wrote an article talking about <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>

<p>Christopher’s newest look at self-sovereignty is an allegory that again revisits some of its foundational influences, recognizing self-sovereignty not just as a personal choice, but something that’s part of a larger ecosystem.</p>



 Your Digital Journey 

<p>Consider the times when you’ve felt lost in the vast and unpredictable digital sea. You’ve set out in a small ship, but your course is uncertain.</p>

<p>Despite being the rightful owner of that ship, you are a mere passenger. Your ports of call and your choice of companion vessels are not under your command but dictated by corporate behemoths that lurk beneath the waves. These unseen gatekeepers exact a continuous “toll” from you, not always in gold, but often in the currency of your personal data or by compelling you to relinquish your rights. Those behemoths control not just your data, but also your actual digital identity.</p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing is about finding a better way: about giving you control over your digital vessel.</p>

 Claiming Command — From Passenger to Captain 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing empowers you to claim command, to ascend from being a passenger to becoming the captain of your digital ship. This gives you the autonomy to plot your journey, to command your personal data, and to navigate digital exchanges without the burden of incessant tolls.</p>

<p>You become the rightful commander of your digital voyage and online experience.</p>

 Assembling Your Tools — Devices and Services 

<p>Your smartphone, your laptop, your smartwatch, and your digital wallet are the tools that you use to command your vessel, modern-day sextants and compasses. They help you to become a skilled navigator in the often treacherous marketplace of the digital ocean.</p>

<p>They are also powerful tools of communication that allow you to foster cooperation with other digital captains, opening up new possibilities when we self-sovereign sailors come together.</p>

<p>Tools that important must be reliable. Beyond that, they must meet our personal needs. This calls back to a time when ship makers would consult with captains about the individual needs of their vessels (just as we do in the modern day with <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a>). This ensures that we can sail the digital seas safely and have control and trust in our tools.</p>

 Fostering Digital Cooperation — Unity on the High Seas 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing envisions a cooperative digital ecosystem where individuals, as digital captains, can unite. Each ship, regardless of its size, contributes to the strength of our self-sovereign fleet, enhancing autonomy and rights for every individual. They can come together against the considerable adversaries of the digital landscape.</p>

<p>There are also promises of mutual aid: Self-Sovereign Computing seeks to protect the vulnerable. If a ship is in distress, others are obligated to give it support, which might mean helping to route messages to evade censorship or just lending some bandwidth to get around a digital traffic jam.</p>

<p>In essence, Self-Sovereign Computing steers us towards a cooperative digital ecosystem, where every digital captain’s strength is amplified through unity. The result is a digital seascape where collective strength is harnessed and where collective bargaining power is pooled, to negotiate better terms, services, and experiences for all.</p>

 The Inspiration of Self-Sovereign Computing 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing stems from a blend of inspirations, some of which are shared with <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>. Among the influences most important to understanding the idea of Self-Sovereign Computing are: the Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity, Living Systems Theory, Agency Law, and Maritime Law, each of which contributed to its foundational ethos.</p>

<p>The Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity play a crucial role in defining the paradigm of Self-Sovereign Computing. These principles emphasize user control and consent, the freedom of data interoperability, and the decentralization of identity authority, pushing the boundaries of individual digital autonomy.</p>

<p>Living Systems Theory speaks of inviduals having boundaries (“membranes”) that separate them from the rest of the world, but recognizes that communication occurs through that membrane. It was a foundational inspiration for Self-Sovereign Identity and is closely linked to the analogy of ships upon the sea.</p>

<p>Agency Law offers the concept of fiduciary duties that dictate a relationship of trust, responsibility, and user priority. Under this framework, digital tools and platforms are required to grant a duty of loyalty and care to their user: acting in their best interest, respecting privacy, protecting data, and ensuring users maintain control and authority over their digital identities and personal information.</p>

<p>Maritime Law contributes principles of mutual aid, freedom of navigation, and the doctrine of the high seas, reinforcing the importance of collective security, unrestricted access, and autonomy in the digital realm.</p>

<p>This blend of inspirations helps us envision a digital landscape that respects individual autonomy while also acknowledging our shared responsibility within the digital community. Collectively, these principles create the bedrock of Self-Sovereign Computing, guiding us towards a future where technology remembers its ultimate duty — to serve and protect the people.</p>

 The Self-Sovereign Computing Call to Action 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing is more than a concept. It’s a beacon on the digital seas. It’s a movement and a rallying cry for individuals including: professionals in decentralized identity; digital human rights advocates; lawyers; and technologists alike. It’s a call for us to advocate for privacy-preserving tools, to demand transparency from platforms, and to assert control over personal data. It’s about supporting initiatives and platforms that align with the principles of Self-Sovereign Computing, fostering a culture of digital self-sovereignty in our communities.</p>

<p>Working collectively, we can form a fleet, to command respect and instigate change in the digital seas. By engaging in discussions, raising awareness, and actively advocating for change, we can reshape the digital world to prioritize people over corporations.</p>

 The Journey Ahead 

<p>Are you ready to seize control and chart your own course on this digital ocean? The era of Self-Sovereign Computing is upon us. It’s time to take the helm for your digital journey, shaping your route based on your choices and needs, not those of distant corporations.</p>

<p>Together, we can navigate toward a future where technology serves us unconditionally, and our devices, our data, and our digital experiences truly belong to us.</p>

<p>The helm is in your hands. The journey towards self-sovereignty begins now. Will you join us?</p>

 Introduction <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to make the most out of the query filtering and ordering capabilities in ComposeDB. By the end, you will know how to:</p>  Set up type validation directives and create indices for specific fields  Use value and logical conditions for querying  Sort the returned results by specific fields   Prerequisites   Basic understanding of GraphQL  An active ComposeDB environment (make sure to <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network">install the latest versions of Ceramic CLI and ComposeDB CLI</a>)   The Model <p>Before we can start querying, we need to have data models defined in ComposeDB, along with some data to query, filter, and sort.</p><p>You can use a simple social app from the great <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-composedb-on-ceramic-2/">Getting Started With ComposeDB on Ceramic</a> tutorial, create a model from scratch, or work on your existing data.</p><p>For simplicity, I’ll create a new model, adapt it to support filtering, add some data to it, and demonstrate all the filtering and sorting capabilities.</p> Defining a <code>Posts</code> model <p>A simple <code>Posts</code> model from the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-composedb-on-ceramic-2/">“Getting Started” guide</a> looks like this:</p> <code>type Posts @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post") {
  body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
  edited: DateTime
  created: DateTime!
  profileId: StreamID! @documentReference(model:"BasicProfile")
  profile: BasicProfile! @relationDocument(property: "profileId")
}
</code> <p>It’s good enough to capture and store data, but let’s make it more robust, add a few fields and get it ready for filtering and sorting.</p> Create indices and add fields <p>Query filtering in ComposeDB allows you to create queries that return a subset of data that matches specified criteria. This functionality helps you narrow down the search by specifying the search parameter.</p><p>To filter queries, you will need to create an index for the corresponding field. An index is a data structure that allows the database to find documents matching the filter criteria more quickly.</p><p>In our <code>Posts</code> type, for example, we have created indexes for <code>status</code>, <code>tag</code>, <code>created</code>, <code>rating</code>, and <code>edited</code> fields using the <code>@createIndex</code> directive as shown below:</p> <code>@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "status" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "tag" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "rating" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }])
</code> <p>Our model now looks like this:</p> <code>enum PublicationStatus {
    DRAFT
    PUBLISHED
    ARCHIVED
}
type Posts
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "status" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "tag" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "rating" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }]) {
    body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    tag: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    rating: Float @float(min: 0, max: 10)
    status: PublicationStatus!
    edited: DateTime
    created: DateTime!
}
</code> <p>You’ll notice a few additions here:</p>  A new <code>enum</code> type: <code>PublicationStatus</code>. We know that the publication status can have only a few possible options. We’re enumerating them all here and then we’ll use that as a type that we can apply to variables. We’ll use it for the new <code>status</code> value, and we’ll make the <code>status</code> mandatory by adding an exclamation point to the type  New fields: <code>tag</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>edited</code>. A good social app should have more than just short entries. With these fields, we’re adding an option to tag and rate posts, have different publication statuses, and an option to see which entries were edited and when.  <code>@createIndex</code> directive on five fields: <code>status</code>, <code>tag</code>, <code>created</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>edited</code>. These add all the necessary indices. We can now filter and sort on all of these.   Add data <p>We have a model now but we don’t have any data yet. We can’t do much filtering if we don’t have anything to filter. Let’s add some posts.</p> <code>mutation CreatePosts{
  createPosts(input: {
    content: {
      body: "ComposeDB Launch",
      tag: "announcement",
      rating: 9.9,
      status: PUBLISHED,
      created: "2023-02-28T12:00:00Z"
      edited: "2023-03-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }){
    document{
      body
      tag
      rating
      status
      created
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>This mutation adds our first post, a ComposeDB launch post, with an <code>announcement</code> tag, a <code>9.9</code> rating and a non-zero <code>edited</code> field.</p><p>Let’s add 20 more posts so that we have enough to play with. You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/velvet-shark/ff6e840e939ba80dc5a11ad3338db5f9?ref=blog.ceramic.network">copy them from this gist</a> and use GraphiQL to add them to your Ceramic node.</p> Query Filtering <p>Now that we have a way to filter and have the data to filter on, let’s do some filtering.</p><p>You can filter by value or with logical conditions.</p><p>Filtering by value is based on a single field value and we can do a lot with it:</p>  check if it’s null - <code>isNull:</code> Boolean  check if it’s equal or not equal to a value - <code>equalTo:</code> (value), <code>notEqualTo:</code> (value)  check if it is or isn’t in a list of values: <code>in:</code> […values], <code>notIn:</code> […values]  check if it’s greater or smaller than a certain value: <code>lessThan:</code> (value), <code>lessThanOrEqualTo:</code> (value), <code>greaterThan:</code> (value), <code>greaterThanOrEqualTo:</code> (value)  <p>Logical conditions combine multiple conditions using <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, or <code>not</code>.</p> Filtering Examples: Filtering by Value <p>Let’s see all the ways we can filter our posts.</p><p>Filter by publication status</p><p>A query:</p> <code>query FilterByStatus($input: PostsFiltersInput!) {
  postsIndex(filters: $input, first: 50) {
    edges {
      node {
        body
        created
        rating
        tag
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>With the input to show only posts with <code>DRAFT</code> status:</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "status": {
        "equalTo": "DRAFT"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>If you’re <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#graphql-server">using GraphiQL</a> to run your queries, you need to write the query in the query section <code>(1)</code> and the input data in the variables section below <code>(2)</code>.</p><p>You can then run the query with the filter by pressing a play button and you get the results on the right <code>(3)</code>.</p><p>As you can see, only the posts with <code>DRAFT</code> status are showing up. The filter works!</p><p>Let’s do more filtering.</p><p>Filter by rating</p><p>Show poorly-rated posts, with rating less than 7.5</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "rating": {
        "lessThan": 7.5
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by date</p><p>Posts from earlier than Jan 10, 2023.</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "created": {
        "lessThan": "2023-01-10"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by edited status</p><p>Show me the posts that have been edited (their <code>edited</code> field is not null).</p> <code>{
  "input":{
    "where": {
      "edited":{
        "isNull": false
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by tags</p><p>Only the posts tagged with <code>Decentralization</code>, <code>Future</code>, or both.</p> <code>{
  "input":{
    "where": {
      "tag":{
        "in": ["Decentralization", "Future"]
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  Filtering by Logical Conditions <p>Logical conditions combine multiple conditions. These could be either for a single field, or for multiple fields. The syntax is the same.</p><p>Filter by rating range</p><p>This is filtering on the same field but it needs combining two <code>where</code> filters with an <code>and</code> operator, indicating that both conditions must be true. If you know GraphQL, this syntax should be familiar.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "rating":{
                  "greaterThanOrEqualTo":2.2
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "rating":{
                  "lessThan":8.8
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code> <p>Filter by date range</p><p>Show me only the posts from January of 2023 (note the <code>greaterThanOrEqualTo</code> operator).</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"lessThan":"2023-01-31"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code> <p>An alternative way of filtering by range</p><p>The previous two examples of filtering by range used an explicit <code>and</code>: you started with <code>and</code> at the top and supplied two <code>where</code> queries.</p><p>This can also be achieved with an implicit <code>and</code>, where you supply two conditions and the <code>and</code> is implied.</p><p>The two examples above can be rewritten like this:</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "where":{
         "rating":{
            "greaterThanOrEqualTo":2.2,
            "lessThan": 8.8
        }
      }
   }
}</code>  <code>{
   "input":{
      "where":{
         "created":{
            "greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01",
            "lessThan":"2023-12-31"
        }
      }
   }
}</code> <p>In both cases, the results are the same with both an implicit and an explicit <code>and</code>.</p><p>Filter by multiple fields</p><p>I want to clean up some posts. Show me the posts with <code>DRAFT</code> or <code>ARCHIVED</code> status, created before March 1, 2023.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "status":{
                	"in": ["DRAFT", "ARCHIVED"]
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"lessThan":"2022-03-01"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code>  Query Ordering <p>Now that we have focused on the posts we wanted, it would be nice to be able to sort the results, too.</p><p>For that, we need to define an additional variable: <code>$sortinginput</code>, include it in the query, and then add it next to the <code>$input</code> variable.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"lessThan":"2023-12-31"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
  },
  "sortinput":{
      "created":"DESC"
   }
}
</code> <p>Now the posts are filtered, only showing the ones from 2023, and they’re also all sorted by created date, in a descending order, with the newest ones at the top.</p> Putting it all together <p>Here's a sample query that uses multiple filtering options and a sorting option on top, to show you what's possible:</p><p>A lot is going on here:</p>  Implicit <code>and</code> for range filtering  Filtering by options in a provided list  Combining multiple filters  Sorting the output  <p>And that’s it. You’re now filtering and sorting at will! Congratulations 🎉</p> Conclusion <p>ComposeDB's query filtering and ordering features offer powerful ways to manipulate and retrieve your data.</p><p>With the steps in this tutorial, you can now efficiently filter and order your data based on specific criteria, enabling you to build more robust applications.</p><p>Dive deeper into the documentation for more advanced filtering and ordering techniques.</p><p>If you have any questions about filtering and ordering, jump into our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">community forum</a>.

<p>In January 2023, the ToIP Foundation announced the formation of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force</a> (TSPTF) within our <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Stack Working Group</a> (TSWG). <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">See the introductory blog post</a> for an overview of this task force. In short, the goal is to maximize interoperability of decentralized digital trust infrastructure by defining the core protocol at the center of the ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">hourglass model</a>. This protocol needs to meet all the Layer 2 requirements defined in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification</a>.</p>



<p>To do this, the TSPTF spent three months to go through the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">proposal stage</a>, entertaining four overall design proposals from <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/17">Sam Smith</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/19">Daniel Hardman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/25">Wenjing Chu</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/27">Michael Herman</a>. Then the task force entered the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">consolidation stage</a>: the hard work of finding enough common ground among these proposals to reach a rough consensus about the overall framework of the design so it can prepare the first Working Draft of the specification.</p>



<p>The good news is that we believe we have achieved that goal. Through a series of in-depth virtual workshops, additional proposals, and small group <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions">discussions</a>, we have arrived at seven “pillars” of the design. These seven pillars apply not just to the trust spanning protocol, but to a core family of protocols that together form the foundation for all the trust task protocols at Layer 3 of the ToIP technology stack.</p>



<p>In this blog post we will summarize these seven pillars:</p>



 
 <a>Verifiable Identifiers</a> 



 <a>End-to-End Authenticity and Confidentiality</a> 



 <a>Direct Connections (Inner and Outer Channels)</a> 



 <a>Routing Via Intermediaries (Routing Channels)</a> 



 <a>Relationship Context Channels</a> 



 <a>Text and Binary Encoding</a> 



 <a>Trust Task Protocol Framework</a> 
 



<p>This blog post does not attempt to provide the full technical details about each of these topics, rather it will attempt to summarize them using language accessible to anyone interested in decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



 #1: Verifiable Identifiers 



<p>The ToIP Foundation as a whole—and the TSWG in particular—have long compared the ToIP stack to the Internet’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP stack</a> (see <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">our introductory white paper</a> for a full explanation). In particular, we have pointed to how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP) illustrates the critical role of a spanning protocol in a protocol stack (for details, see Principle #3, The Hourglass Model, in <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a>).</p>



<p>The heart of the Internet Protocol defined a new type of address—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a>—that enabled communications between existing networks that otherwise had no automated way to pass data between them. This new addressing layer enabled the Internet Protocol to “span” existing local area networks and create the ubiquitous global Internet we enjoy today.</p>



<p>Since the goal of the ToIP stack is to enable trust to span existing trust domains, the ToIP trust spanning protocol needs the same solution: a new type of address—one designed explicitly to enable cryptographically verifiable communications. In section 6.4 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Technical-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-PR1-2022-11-14.pdf">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification</a> (TAS), we call this new type of address a verifiable identifier (VID). The three essential characteristics of a VID are:</p>



 
 It can be resolved securely to obtain the current public key(s) needed to verify that the VID owner controls the VID. 



 It can be resolved securely to obtain the current network endpoint(s) for establishing a ToIP connection with the entity identified by the VID. 



 It does not need to change when the controller’s key(s) are rotated or network endpoint(s) are updated. 
 



<p>Section 6.4 of the TAS explains that there are multiple types of VIDs, including many different types of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs—standardized by the W3C), and several types of Autonomous Identifiers (AIDs), such as those being standardized in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-did-keri">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> specifications from the ToIP <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">Authentic Chained Data Container</a> (ACDC) Task Force. Since a verifier’s trust in a VID may depend on both the type of VID and the characteristics of its supporting infrastructure (e.g., cryptographic algorithms, storage, key management, resolution, etc.), the trust spanning protocol specification must also include an appraisability framework: a standard way for a ToIP endpoint to describe the type and properties of its particular VID.</p>



<p>In addition, VIDs share the same challenge as any other new type of identifier: how do parties discover and share the VIDs they want to use for each other? How do they bootstrap setting up their first ToIP communications channel? How can they do this safely while avoiding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle</a> (MITM) attacks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>All VID-based protocols, including <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/">DIDComm</a>, <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a>, rely on some form of out–of-band introduction (OOBI), such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR code</a>, to accomplish this critical first step. Regardless of the specific OOBI used, the ultimate result is that all parties now have the VIDs needed to begin using the ToIP trust spanning protocol to connect and interact.</p>



 #2: End-to-End Authenticity &amp; Confidentiality 



<p>Almost all modern security protocols based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public/private key cryptography</a> use some combination of message signing (for authenticity) and message encryption (for confidentiality). A longstanding question has been: precisely what combination of these two properties produces the strongest security?</p>



<p>Our second pillar is a firm answer to that question: the signing and encryption pattern that provides the strongest protection against both key compromise impersonation (KCI) and sender impersonation of the ciphertext is called ESSR (for Encrypt Sender’s key then Sign Receiver’s key). ESSR was first defined <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/079">in a 2001 paper</a> by Jee Hea An and is well explained in these three Neil Madden blog posts about public key authenticated encryption: <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-i/">PKAE1</a>, <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/26/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-ii/">PKAE2</a>, <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/12/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-iii/">PKAE3</a>.</p>



<p>The bottom line: by binding the sender’s public key inside the encrypted ciphertext and binding the receiver’s public key in the enclosing signed plain text, an adversary is prevented from forging messages that compromise either authenticity or confidentiality. So the trust spanning protocol can achieve both strong authenticity and strong confidentiality by applying ESSR to all messages that require both properties.</p>



 #3: Direct Connections (Inner and Outer Channels) 



<p>With VIDs supplying verifiable public key(s) and network endpoint(s), and ESSR supplying the message signing and encryption pattern, all the essential ingredients for two ToIP endpoints are in place to establish a connection in order to communicate securely and confidentially. The only ToIP Layer 2 requirement that we have not addressed is correlation privacy: preventing public observation/correlation of the VIDs that parties are using to communicate.</p>



<p>Although the trust spanning protocol is designed to be transport-independent and could be used with any transport protocol for which a binding is defined (e.g., Bluetooth, AMQP, MQTT), if ToIP endpoints A and B have a direct connection with each other over a public TCP/IP network like the Internet, then full correlation privacy is impossible: anyone who can see the Internet traffic can track the flow of encrypted messages between A’s VID and B’s VID. Thus the only way A and B can achieve full correlation privacy is by employing intermediaries (see Pillar <a>#4</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>However A and B can still achieve partial correlation privacy over a direct connection by tunneling one ESSR protocol inside another. This is shown in Figure 1 below.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Figure 1: A direct connection showing one ToIP channel tunneled inside another for partial correlation privacy.</p>



<p>In Figure 1, the VIDs A0 and B0 are publicly-observable VIDs used to form the outer channel (shown in red). They are outside the two endpoint boxes because they are publicly observable on the Internet. The VIDs A1 and B1 are private interaction VIDs that form the inner channel (shown in orange).&nbsp; They are inside the two endpoint boxes because they are completely private to A and B. Each ToIP message between A1 and B1 is carried in the encrypted payload of ToIP messages between A0 and B0, so A1 and B1 are never exposed publicly on the Internet.</p>



<p>This two-layer, two-channel model enables A and B to communicate privately between A1 and B1 over the inner channel. As explained in Pillar <a>#5</a>, one potential use of this private channel is for A and B to negotiate replacing their current publicly-observable VIDs A0 and B0 with new publicly-observable VIDs An and Bn if/when needed. They can do this while still keeping A1 and B1 hidden. This enables some degree of correlation privacy even without the use of intermediaries.</p>



 #4: Routing Via Intermediaries (Routing Channels) 



<p>To provide stronger correlation privacy—i.e., to prevent public observation that A and B are communicating at all—it is necessary to tunnel one layer deeper using intermediaries. This triple layering is shown in Figure 2.</p>







<p>Figure 2: Adding a routing layer tunneled via intermediaries for stronger correlation privacy</p>



<p>In this configuration, both A and B first establish outer channels over direct connections with their respective intermediaries α and β (shown in red between VIDs A0 and α0 and B0 and β0 respectively). Then A and B tunnel another ESSR protocol (shown in blue) inside the outer channel to send ToIP routing messages. This routing channel gives the intermediaries α and β just enough information to pass the messages to the next hop on the path. The full path is never revealed to any single intermediary; all α and β know is the next destination.</p>



<p>The inner channel (orange) is layered within the routing channel (blue). As with direct connections, this is the fully private interaction channel between A1 and B1. Neither α or β know about A1 and B1 and cannot see any of the communications on this inner channel. To use a physics analogy, this inner channel has two layers of “insulation” that prevent the heat (private information) from leaking out into the environment (third parties observing the outer channel).</p>



<p>This routing architecture is not limited to two intermediaries; it can scale to more as needed. However adding more intermediaries is not required to enable better correlation privacy; it simply increases the number of intermediaries that would need to be compromised to learn the full path.</p>



 #5: Relationship Context Channels 



<p>The double or triple layering of ToIP channels described in Pillars <a>#3</a> and <a>#4</a> satisfies the ToIP architecture requirements for authenticity, confidentiality, and ​​correlation privacy. Whether it operates over a direct connection or via intermediaries, the inner channel instantiates a relationship root context connecting the two endpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, what if two endpoints A and B need to communicate over other inner channels representing different relationship contexts? For example, what if they need to:</p>



 
 Move to a higher level of identity assurance, e.g., for high-value transactions instead of low-value transactions? 



 Step up to perfect forward secrecy or some other cryptographic algorithm? 



 Stream data instead of sending individual messages? 



 Instantiate a multi-party channel incorporating other parties (such as using the IETF <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_Layer_Security">Message Layer Security</a> protocol)? 



 Instantiate new publicly-observable VIDs to increase correlation privacy? 



 Instantiate new private interaction VIDs to prevent privacy leakage over time? 



 Invoke specific higher-level (ToIP Layer 3) trust task protocols (see Pillar <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CULKg76dSLnO5EX3YM5kG6Ya8PWDwmPSZAbGKKqdoTU/edit#heading=h.ekx5229cmb3v">#7</a>)? 
 



<p>In these cases, A and B need to be able to use the default inner channel as a “control channel” to establish other inner channels. Each new inner channel needs: a) a new pair of VIDs to establish a new relationship context, and b) a new set of parameters specific to that relationship context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can be accomplished using a simple control channel protocol that enables A and B to establish and manage as many relationship context channels as they need over the lifetime of their relationship. This is illustrated in Figure 3 (shown over a direct connection for simplicity). The control channel is shown in orange and each new relationship context channel is shown in black.</p>







<p>Figure 3: Using the default inner channel as a control channel to establish new independent relationship context channels between A and B</p>



<p>Note that these new inner channels can emulate the same features as the concept of sessions used in other protocols. However, by using VIDs, they have the following advantages:</p>



 
 They can operate independently from any session management defined by underlying transport protocols. 



 They can persist as long as both parties need them (not just during one communications session). 



 They can establish fully “cryptographic sessions” that include all the security and privacy protections of the ToIP trust spanning layer. 
 



 #6: Text and Binary Encoding 



<p>Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_protocol">wire protocol</a> that moves data from one endpoint to another must define its encoding(s). Encoding choices are even more critical (and often contentious) with security protocols because: a) they are replete with heavyweight cryptographic data structures, and b) they impose very strict rules governing message signing, encryption, decryption, and signature verification.</p>



<p>To avoid as much contention as possible, we propose to use Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) as the encoding format for all ToIP messages. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ssmith-cesr/">CESR specification</a> is one of the deliverables of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ToIP ACDC Task Force</a>. To quote from the introduction:</p>



<p>The Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) is a dual text-binary encoding format that has the unique property of text-binary concatenation composability.&nbsp; This composability property enables the round trip conversion en-masse of concatenated primitives between the text domain and binary domain while maintaining the separability of individual primitives.&nbsp; This enables convenient usability in the text domain and compact transmission in the binary domain.</p>



<p>Other key benefits of CESR include:</p>



 
 Format-agnostic. CESR streams support interleaved JSON, CBOR, and MGPK serializations. 



 Optimized for cryptography. Popular cryptographic material suites have compact encodings for efficiency while less compact encodings provide sufficient extensibility to support all foreseeable types. 



 Self-framing. CESR supports self-framing group codes that enable stream processing and pipelining in both the text and binary domains. 
 



<p>For a complete overview of the benefits of CESR, see the IIW presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12nX_IIPp5xw8qAxhZy-ae2aWYytYQmFBbB9K3PcVhqQ/edit?usp=sharing">CESR for First Year Wizards</a>.</p>



<p>Note: CESR V1.1 will include a few minor pipelining improvements based on production experience with CESR V1.0.</p>



 #7: Trust Task Protocol Framework 



<p>The final pillar is the capability for architects and developers to design, define, and build higher-level ToIP Layer 3 trust task protocols that operate over the Layer 2 relationship context channels described in Pillar <a>#5</a>. This trust task protocol framework should be modeled using the same protocol definition patterns established by other VID-based protocols such as <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/">DIDComm</a>, <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a>. These definitions typically follow a two level model:</p>



 
 Protocol definitions specify the protocol ID (or VID), human-readable name, version, and other identifying metadata for the protocol. They also define its overall relationship context channel parameters and a catalog of its specified packets/messages. 



 Packet/message definitions specify the required and optional contents of each packet or message defined in the protocol. 
 



<p>A complete trust task protocol specification based on this framework will also include roles, states, request/response business logic, co-protocols, error messages, etc.. See <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#protocols">section 9 of the DIDComm V2 specification</a> for a detailed example.</p>



<p>The ToIP trust task protocol framework should also define a small set of standard utility trust tasks such as:</p>



 
 Discovery. Rather than broadly defining how two parties try to discover each other’s VIDs, this trust task will narrowly define how two ToIP endpoints that have established a connection can discover what trust tasks each other is capable of supporting (see examples below). 



 Error handling. The rich extensibility of trust tasks—and the fact they may be combined into complex workflows—make it very useful to have a well-known trust task for handling error messages. 



 Trust ping. This simple, universal trust task for testing a ToIP connection is the ToIP equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)">ping network utility</a> for testing an IP connection. 



 Logging/auditing. This is a standard trust task for logging ToIP interactions for debugging or auditing purposes. 
 



<p>The whole reason for the hourglass design of the ToIP technology stack is for the Layer 2 trust spanning protocol to support any number of trust task protocols at Layer 3. With authenticity, confidentiality, and correlation privacy all handled by the trust spanning layer, it becomes far easier for infrastructure architects and developers to design reusable trust tasks. This is turn makes it much easier for application designers and developers to build trusted applications by calling a series of trust tasks to accomplish their workflows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current market emphasis on digital identity wallets (such as the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU eIDAS 2.0 initiative</a>) can give the impression that the only important trust tasks are the issuance, presentation, and revocation of verifiable digital credentials. These are in fact only a small subset of the universe of trust tasks that can be enabled by the ToIP stack. Some other common examples discussed by the TSPTF include:</p>



 
 Stepping up authentication by using a ToIP connection to request local biometric authentication and/or liveness detection of a user. 



 Signing digital documents with strong, permanently verifiable digital signatures that do not require centralized service providers (a required feature of eIDAS 2.0). 



 Querying a trust registry to determine the authorized participants in a digital trust ecosystem (a trust task protocol under development by the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">ToIP Trust Registry Task Force</a>). 



 Exchanging electronic business cards for peer-to-peer communications and relationship management. 



 Secure messaging using synchronous chat or asynchronous mail. 



 Transmitting digital payments via any mutually-agreed means: credit card, debit card, direct-to-bank, fiat currency, cryptocurrency, loyalty points, etc. 



 Issuing e-receipts for any type of digital payment or value exchange. 



 Buying a digital ticket for an event and presenting it for admission. 



 Bidding in a digital auction, including reconciling and settlement of a winning bid. 



 Issuing a digital purchase order, sending an invoice, and remitting payment. 



 Orchestrating data supply chains using “product passports” that can be the digital twin of physical or digital products. 
 



 Next Steps 



<p>The TSPTF is now moving into the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">Working Drafts stage</a>. After a break during the month of August, we are beginning two weekly meetings again every Wednesday (8AM PT for NA/EU time zones and 6PM PT for APAC time zones) starting on&nbsp;06 September&nbsp;(the full schedule of all ToIP meetings is published on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings">ToIP Calendar</a>).&nbsp;Our goal will be to work through enough open issues to be ready to present a complete “IIW Preview Draft”&nbsp;at the next Internet Identity Workshop, 10-12 October in Mountain View, California.

 OT-RFC-18 — Growing the Trusted Knowledge Foundation: TRAC delegation &amp; OTP incentives <p>“Q. How do you propose to do&nbsp;this?</p><p>A. By saving the knowledge of the race. The sum of human knowing is beyond any one man; any thousand men. With the destruction of our social fabric, science will be broken into a million pieces. Individuals will know much of the exceedingly tiny facets of which there is to know. They will be helpless and useless by themselves. The bits of lore, meaningless, will not be passed on. They will be lost through the generations. But, if we now prepare a giant summary of all knowledge, it will never be lost. Coming generations will build on it, and will not have to rediscover it for themselves. One millennium will do the work of thirty thousand.”</p><p>Hari Seldon</p><p>Foundation series by Isaac Asimov&nbsp;(1951)</p> Introduction <p>OriginTrail ecosystem’s vision is to build a trusted knowledge foundation that greatly improves the way humanity’s knowledge is produced, maintained and shared in a trusted and inclusive manner. The purpose of the OriginTrail Parachain is to provide a tailored blockchain for Trusted Artificial Intelligence that extends the capabilities of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) with growth incentives for <a href="https://origintrail.io">real-world adoption</a>.</p><p>The requirements have already been met for the OriginTrail Parachain utility token (OTP) to be transferable via both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEXs and DEXs) by having the decentralized governance in place. Now this DKG-focused L1 blockchain supporting real-world adoption, is set to drive growth of both valuable Knowledge Asset assemblies and DKG multichain infrastructure — crucial components of the Trusted Knowledge Foundation. It achieves that by incentivizing Knowledge generation and trusted knowledge infrastructure operation with OTP tokens, in unison with the multichain DKG adoption (detailed in OT-RFC-17).</p><p>The OT-RFC-18 proposes the first batch of incentivization features, which also leverage already implemented OriginTrail Parachain community voting.</p> OTP incentives for Trusted Knowledge Foundation Growth <p>Using OTP to create incentives for Trusted Knowledge Foundation Growth is one of its core utilities. The pool of OTP designated for that was 14% (or 70 million OTP) of the Genesis supply and also receives 30% of the annual inflation (you can learn more about the tokenomics and exact numbers&nbsp;<a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/OriginTrail_Ecosystem_White_Paper_2.0.pdf">here</a>).</p><p>When considering the best first activities to be included for the OTP incentives, the key requirements include the relevance of the activity, measurable nature of the activity and inclusiveness for all OriginTrail participants. All OTP incentives should also take full advantage of OriginTrail Parachain Governance — from proposal stage for an activity, to ongoing decisions on the scope of incentivisation support or even proposals to discontinue/substitute the incentives with more appropriate ones.</p><p>The OT-RFC-18 takes the above guidelines in action to propose 2 categories of activities as candidates for incentivization — (1) Incentivizing trusted knowledge creation and (2) Incentivizing trusted infrastructure.</p> Incentivizing trusted knowledge creation <p>Incentivizing the creation of trusted knowledge is central to the growth of the OriginTrail Trusted Knowledge Foundation. By offering OTP incentives for Knowledge Asset creation the “north star” growth activity is supported. The intention of incentives is also to serve as a curation mechanism for guiding publishing of high quality knowledge on the DKG. Curation is to be implemented through community-wide decisions using OriginTrail Parachain Governance. These activities will provide a significant boost towards creating truthful, structured, and AI-ready Knowledge Assets — ultimately leading to the creation of the largest trusted knowledge foundation in the world. The specific incentive mechanisms to achieve this will be continuously improved through OriginTrail Parachain Governance proposals.</p> Incentivizing trusted infrastructure: TRAC delegation &amp; Multichain adoption <p>The OriginTrail trusted infrastructure is a two layer system with two&nbsp;tokens:</p>  the DKG layer hosted on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) fueled by the TRAC utility&nbsp;token,  and multi-chain consensus layer, with respective native blockchain tokens in use (which includes the OriginTrail Parachain and OTP&nbsp;token).  <p>Each of the layers performs a distinct function, yet are necessary building blocks for the implementation of the DKG (more info available in the OriginTrail whitepaper 2.0).</p><p>An increasingly important element of the trusted knowledge infrastructure is the TRAC stake for DKG nodes. The stake presents a collateral TRAC amount that is locked-up as a signal for the security and quality of node operations. The amount of TRAC stake also significantly contributes to the share of the network rewards (paid as network fees by Knowledge Asset publishers) that a DKG node can&nbsp;receive.</p><p>With the OT-RFC-18, the TRAC delegation feature is introduced, and DKG node operators will now be able to open their node stake for other TRAC holders to participate. With a higher amount of TRAC as their stake, nodes are eligible for more network rewards which are then shared with those that delegated their TRAC (implementation details below). This instrument will lead to more TRAC being used for its utility, larger TRAC holder community engagement, more robust and secure trusted knowledge infrastructure and a vibrant “marketplace” of DKG nodes and TRAC delegators.</p><p>To incentivize all of the above-mentioned positive effects of TRAC delegations, the OT-RFC-18 proposes this feature to be eligible for OTP incentives as well. The core premise of the OTP incentives would be to allow any TRAC delegator on blockchains where DKG V6 is implemented to be eligible for OTP rewards according to the size of their delegated stake.</p><p>Moreover, as more blockchain ecosystems <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-17-origintrail-integration-with-evm-compatible-blockchains-e635dc8afb86">express interest</a> to integrate with the DKG (following<a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-17-OriginTrail-integration-with-EVM-compatible-blockchains"> the procedure and criteria detailed in the OT-RFC-17</a>), one time incentives in OTP are proposed, to both reward TRAC token holders who support integrations by contributing to the minimum required threshold. More details on this to be discussed in a separate proposal on incentivising MultiChain DKG adoption before voting on it via OriginTrial Parachain governance mechanism.</p> TRAC delegation mechanics <p>The implementation of the TRAC token delegation mechanism is loosely based on DeFi projects such as Uniswap, with the core component representing Node share tokens, (similar to Uniswap LP tokens). Each node deployed on ODN has a respective, node-specific, mintable and burnable 18 decimal ERC20 token created for it on the desired blockchain during node deployment, with the token symbol and name set by the node operator, as can be seen in the figure&nbsp;below.</p>Figure 1: Node share tokens on OriginTrail Parachain, visible through Subscan block&nbsp;explorer<p>The “share tokens” represent essentially a share of the total amount of TRAC stake that has been deployed on a specific node. The TRAC delegation feature, when fully activated, will enable node operators to “open up” their node to receiving more TRAC stake through delegation by TRAC token holders. The delegation mechanism is explained in the following figures:</p><p>Formula for share tokens&nbsp;minting:</p><p>Where tracAmount is the amount of TRAC delegated to the&nbsp;node.</p><p>Formula for share tokens&nbsp;burning:</p><p>Where tracAmount is the amount of TRAC withdrawn from the node&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Nodes with larger amounts of TRAC staked have effectively stronger economic security signals (see <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/OriginTrail_Ecosystem_White_Paper_2.0.pdf">the whitepaper</a>), and therefore an advantage in receiving Knowledge Asset publishing fees from Knowledge Publishers (also in TRAC). Therefore, node operators have an interest in attracting a large amount of TRAC stake to establish a better position in the DKG service&nbsp;market.</p><p>TRAC token holders’ interest is in putting their TRAC tokens to work, which is achieved by node operators effectively sharing a portion of the TRAC fees received through Knowledge Asset publishing with the delegators.</p><p>Effectively, node runners are delegators to their own nodes at the moment of writing this RFC (currently only node admin keys can delegate, until the fully fledged system is implemented), and get 100% of the TRAC rewards from publishings their nodes&nbsp;receive.</p><p>When the delegation feature goes live, each node operator will be free to set their node settings, which are the following:</p>  operator_fee: percentage of the TRAC fee, which is deducted from each knowledge asset publishing fee, and is directed to the node operator prior to sharing with other delegators. The remaining TRAC fee is then split in proportion to the amount of share tokens among all delegators,  maximum_delegated_trac: the maximum amount of stake a node operator allows to be present on their&nbsp;node.  <p>It is important to note that the system is non-custodial, meaning that all delegated TRAC is locked in DKG core contracts, and can only be “withdrawn” from the system by burning share tokens by the delegators, which can only be performed by the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-evm-module/blob/main/contracts/Staking.sol">DKG Staking contract</a>.</p><p>With such a system in effect, TRAC token holders can safely delegate their tokens to node runners. Having Node Share tokens be ERC20 tokens, they can also be easily transferred between wallets (e.g. a delegator can change wallets for OpSec purposes by transferring share tokens to a different address) and utilized with any ERC20 supporting tool.</p><p>Finally, the proposal indicates delegating TRAC in two&nbsp;ways:</p>  “Delegate” function: by using this function, share tokens are available to the delegator, enabling withdrawing TRAC at all times. This function should not involveOTP incentives,  “Delegate &amp; Lock” function: share tokens are locked in DKG contracts for a period of time, which qualifies the delegator for OTP Incentives, as they promote long-term security in the&nbsp;network.   TRAC Delegation: Implementation action&nbsp;points <p>After the RFC process and open discussion on TRAC delegation feature is completed, the core development team will proceed with detailed specification and updates on the implementation. Community proposals through comments on this RFC are very&nbsp;welcome.</p><p>The relevant updates are expected to include an updated version of smart contracts, with the aim to encapsulate other optimizations to the system (system formulas, neighborhood distance function updates, etc). All information will be available in the relevant Github repositories.</p> Conclusion <p><a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-18-Growing-the-Trusted-Knowledge-Foundation/README.md">This RFC</a> introduces the implementation direction for OTP incentives and initial high-impact activities for the growth of the Trusted Knowledge Foundation.

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the third article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>As I discussed in <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">my previous post</a>, generative adversarial networks (GANs) can produce remarkably realistic images of people that are nearly indistinguishable from images of real people. Here I will describe a technique for detecting GAN-generated faces, such as those typically found in online profiles</p><p>Below you will see the average of 400 StyleGAN2 faces (left) and 400 real profile photos from people with whom I am connected on LinkedIn (right).&nbsp;</p><p>Because the real photos are so varied, the average profile photo is fairly nondescript. By contrast, the average GAN face is highly distinct with almost perfectly focused eyes. This is because the real faces used by the GAN discriminator are all aligned in the same way, resulting in all the AI-generated faces having the same alignment. It seems that this alignment was intentional as a way to improve generation of more consistently realistic faces.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to having the same facial alignment, the StyleGAN faces also appear from the neck up. By contrast, real profile photos tend to show more of the upper body and shoulders. It is these within-class similarities and across-class differences that we seek to exploit in our technique for detecting GAN-generated faces.</p>

  <p>Starting with 10,000 faces generated by each of the three versions of StyleGAN (1, 2, 3), we learn a low-dimensional representation of GAN-generated faces. This learning takes two forms: the classic, linear, principal components analysis (PCA) and a more modern auto-encoder.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of the underlying computational technique, this approach learns a constructive model that captures the particular properties of StyleGAN-generated faces. In the case of PCA, this model is a simple weighted sum of a small number of images learned from the training images.</p><p>Once the model is constructed, we can ask if any image can be accurately reconstructed with this model. The intuition here is that if the model captures properties that are specific to GAN faces, then GAN faces will be accurately reconstructed with the model but real photos (that do not share these properties) will not.</p><p>Below you will see the average reconstruction error for 400 GAN faces (left) and 400 real faces (right). They are displayed on the same intensity scale where, the brighter the pixel value, the larger the reconstruction error. Here you will see that the real faces have significantly higher reconstruction errors throughout, particularly around the eyes.<br></p>

  <p>By simply computing this reconstruction error, we can build a fairly reliable classifier to determine whether a face was likely to have been generated by StyleGAN. We can make this classifier even more reliable by analyzing the eiGAN-face model weights needed for the full reconstruction.&nbsp;</p><p>Using this approach, we can detect more than 99% of GAN-generated faces, while only misclassifying 1% of photographic faces — those that happen to match the position and alignment of GAN faces.</p><p>Any forensic technique is, of course, vulnerable to attack. In this case, an adversary could crop, translate, and/or rotate a GAN-generated face in an attempt to circumvent our detection. We can, however, build this attack into our training by constructing our model not just on GAN faces, but also on GAN faces that have been subjected to random manipulations. (See the article in the Further Reading section below for more details on this attack and defense.)</p><p>No defense will ever be perfect, so the forensic identification cannot rely on just one technique. It must instead rely on a suite of techniques that examine different aspects of an image. Even if an adversary does not find a way to circumvent this particular detection, newer diffusion-based, text-to-image synthesis techniques (e.g., Dall-E, Midjourney, and Adobe Firefly) do not exhibit the same facial alignment as GAN-generated faces. As a result, they will fail to be detected by this specific technique. In my next post, I will describe a complementary forensic analysis that is more effective at detecting faces generated using diffusion-based techniques.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] S.

<p>KaratDAO is a decentralized growth network that connects Web2 to Web3, giving users full control over their personal data. This means that users can choose who they share their data with and how it’s used.</p><p>KaratDAO was founded in early 2022 by high school friends and college roommates who all went on to work in Web3. They identified user data as the most important object in Web2 and sought a way to use on-chain data to make it easier for projects to acquire and leverage this data in a user-centric way in Web3.</p><p>The team says it has a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities of data privacy and ownership in Web3. The first few dApps were built to allow teams to find their audience via community building and a recommendation system to identify holders of similar tokens and look-alike projects.</p><p>290,000 <a href="https://karatdao.com/network/claimer?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Karat network boarding passes</a> have been minted on zkSync by users verifying their Web2 accounts, enabling eligibility for KAT claiming. Recent token listings on <a href="http://gate.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Gate.io</a>, Bitget, BitMart, and MEXC &nbsp;offer access to liquidity KAT and aim to help drive increased utility for the network.</p> How KaratDAO Works <p>KaratDAO is <a href="https://docs.karatdao.com/why-karat-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">built on Ceramic</a>, providing a secure way to store and share data. The team uses Lit for encrypting and accessing data on Ceramic. Karat Smart Contract is a smart contract that manages the ownership and access control of data on Ceramic. This combination of technologies gives users full ownership of their credentials on-chain.</p><p>KaratDAO chose to build on Ceramic after looking at other options because it was the most developer-friendly tech for DIDs, offering the most extensions and toolkits for developers. It also made IPFS usable and had a strong community of other projects in its ecosystem.</p> Why KaratDAO Chose Ceramic   Ceramic is the most friendly platform for DID projects. DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are a new way of identifying people and things on the internet. Ceramic is the most mature platform for storing and managing DIDs.  Ceramic has the most extensions and toolkits for DIDs. Ceramic has a wide range of extensions and toolkits that make it easy to integrate with other projects.  Ceramic makes IPFS more usable. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized file storage system. Ceramic makes it easier to use IPFS by providing a layer of abstraction on top of it.  Ceramic has a strong community of other projects. This means that there is a lot of support and development available for Ceramic.  Ceramic is a long-term project with positive momentum and staying power. Ceramic has been around for several years and has a track record of positive development. This gives the KaratDAO team confidence that Ceramic will be around for the long term.   How KaratDAO Uses Ceramic <p>KaratDAO uses Ceramic to store three types of data:</p>  VCs: VCs are a way of storing verified credentials, such as a person's name, email address, or phone number. KaratDAO uses VCs to store user information in a secure and private way.  Schemas: Schemas define the structure of VCs. KaratDAO uses schemas to ensure that VCs are consistent and easy to use.  Lit protocol conditions: Lit protocol conditions are a way of defining rules for how VCs can be used. KaratDAO uses Lit protocol conditions to ensure that VCs are only used in a way that is consistent with their privacy policy.  <p>Each piece of user data is stored as a separate stream in Ceramic. For example, a user's Twitter handle would be <a href="https://cerscan.com/mainnet/profile/did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1eEad001168B559b7a76875e7D7C2d5EaC6d854a?ref=blog.ceramic.network">stored in a separate stream</a>, and their Discord handle would be stored in a separate stream. This makes it easy to manage and access user data.</p><p>They use the Karat contract to write a <a href="https://www.okx.com/web3/marketplace/nft/collection/zksync-era/karat-vc-registry-a0d713?ref=blog.ceramic.network">pointer to the user data on-chain</a>. This allows KaratDAO to verify the authenticity of the user data and to make it more accessible to other applications.</p><p>In the future, KaratDAO plans to use a smart contract wallet to improve the user experience of storing data on Ceramic. This will allow users to store their data on Ceramic without having to sign a contract.</p><p>KaratDAO offers a number of features and benefits that make it a powerful tool for data privacy and ownership. These features include:</p>  Decentralized control: KaratDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which means that it is owned and controlled by its users.  Rewards for data sharing: KaratDAO rewards users for sharing their data with projects. This helps to incentivize users to share their data responsibly and benefits the projects that can access the consumer data. There are roughly 100 projects using Karat dApps for their own websites, allowing them to host campaigns when users sign up that they can record on their data dashboards for airdrops and other giveaways.  <p>The team is also working on a number of new features and integrations, including:</p>  A marketing platform that will help projects to better understand and engage with their users.  A governance system that will give users control over the future of KaratDAO.  Integrating account abstraction (EIP4337) into Karat Network, enhancing user experience.  The incorporation of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to further protect user’s privacy and bolster data ownership.   The Future of KaratDAO <p>KaratDAO is still under development, but the team plans to continue to grow the KaratDAO user base and become the leading data privacy and ownership platform in Web3. The team also plans to decentralize KaratDAO further, and to give users more control over the platform.</p><p>To learn more please visit the <a href="https://karatdao.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">KaratDAO website</a> or join the KaratDAO community on Discord.</p>

<p>As the world accelerates towards an Electric Vehicle (EV) future, concerns about the sustainability of EV batteries have grown. The EU has responded with a regulation, mandating digital product passports (DPPs) for EV batteries by 2027, and OriginTrail Knowledge Assets emerge as the perfect fit, providing discoverability and verifiability to each DPP. Trace Labs and their partners are leveraging OriginTrail to bring EV battery DPPs to life and build a trusted knowledge foundation for AI in the EV industry. This will provide manufacturers with exciting new ways to manage the sustainability of their supply chains and engage with their customers. And while EV batteries are the current focus, the horizon expands to a myriad of other products, signaling a sustainable future driven by OriginTrail-powered DPPs.</p> The eco-drive: Understanding the need for EV battery passports <p>The world is witnessing a tremendous shift towards EVs, driven not just by technological advancements but also by increasing concerns regarding environmental sustainability. At the heart of this revolution lies the EV battery, an intricate assembly of rare metals and materials. However, the extraction and utilization of these metals have raised significant environmental, ethical, and sustainability concerns, including the use of forced and child labor. Recognizing the gravity of these issues, the EU has introduced a regulation stipulating that by 2027, every EV battery in the market must have a digital product passport, accessible via a QR code. This move underlines the commitment to not only promote green transportation but also ensure its ethical and sustainable production.</p> Setting the benchmark for EV Digital Product Passports with OriginTrail <p>In the evolving digital landscape of global supply chains, ensuring sustainability and ethical practices can be challenging.

With OriginTrail, every piece of data in the EV DPP, as well as its issuer, updates, and other changes can be verified on blockchain. It’s not just about presenting knowledge but ensuring its integrity every step of the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Data privacy. Manufacturers often grapple with the challenge of balancing transparency with business sensitivity. OriginTrail allows them to decide what data is public and what remains restricted or only accessible to certain stakeholders (e.g. regulators), offering an optimal blend of transparency and confidentiality.</p><p>This nuanced approach tailored for the demands of EV DPPs sets OriginTrail apart as the gold standard in the digital landscape.</p>An example of an EV DPP as connected Knowledge Assets on OriginTrail.<p>The example EV DPP shown in the screenshot above can be explored in the <a href="https://dkg-testnet.origintrail.io/explore?ual=did:dkg:otp/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/394620">OriginTrail DKG Explorer</a>.</p> Towards trusted AI: Revolutionizing the EV&nbsp;industry <p>Such an extensive web of interconnected EV DPPs and related Knowledge Assets serves as a trusted knowledge foundation for AI solutions in the EV sector. Leveraging this concept, Trace Labs and their partners have been working on a solution that can unlock countless possibilities for EV manufacturers.</p><p>Simplified, interactive queries. Manufacturers often struggle with vast amounts of data. Combining the web of trusted Knowledge Assets with AI tools, querying complex supply chain data can be done through simple chat-like interfaces. For example, imagine simply asking about the environmental impact of an EV battery batch or the ethical sourcing history and getting a verifiable answer in real-time.</p><p>Proactive insights. Moving from a reactive to a predictive way of operating can be a game-changer. AI coupled with EV battery DPPs and other Knowledge Assets enables manufacturers to foresee issues before they arise. Be it batteries nearing end-of-life or potential supply chain disruptions, trusted AI can offer insights into likely future outcomes.</p><p>Enhanced customer engagement. In an age where customer loyalty is gold, AI-driven insights from EV battery DPPs offer manufacturers a new playbook. For example, by preemptively identifying potential battery issues, manufacturers can proactively reach out to their customers, ensuring safety and building&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Holistic view of the supply chain. OriginTrail trusted knowledge foundation enables AI tools to provide actionable insights that make a difference. Manufacturers can gain a 360-degree view of their battery supply chain, from raw material sourcing to end-of-life recycling, allowing them to identify sustainability (and other) issues and address them effectively.</p><p>By converging OriginTrail-powered EV DPPs and related Knowledge Assets with AI, we’re not just looking at the next step for the EV industry but more of a quantum leap. It’s a future where trusted knowledge drives decisions, ensures sustainability, and shapes an exciting era of innovation and&nbsp;trust.</p>AI-powered chat for EV DPPs based on OriginTrail trusted knowledge foundation. The expanding horizon: Beyond the EV battery passports <p>EV batteries are merely the tip of the iceberg. The EU’s vision for digital product passports extends far beyond, encompassing a range of product categories from textiles to consumer electronics. As these regulations take shape, they signify billions of products that could leverage the benefits of OriginTrail-powered product passports. With this, industries can establish a trusted AI foundation, opening doors to infinite possibilities and ensuring a sustainable and ethical&nbsp;future.</p><p>👇 About Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a> is the core developer of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> — the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

 Join Energy Web in Shaping the Energy Future via Upcoming Polkadot Crowdloan, Launching September 5th <p>Zug, Switzerland, August 24, 2023 — Energy Web, a non-profit organization developing digital solutions to accelerate the energy transition, is pleased to announce the <a href="http://crowdloan.energywebx.com">Energy Web X crowdloan</a>. The objective of the crowdloan initiative is to secure a parachain slot for Energy Web X on the Polkadot Relay Chain, thereby empowering it to leverage the security and scalability inherent in Polkadot’s infrastructure. Contributing to the crowdloan represents a unique opportunity for the Polkadot and Energy Web communities to help expand the Energy Web ecosystem to the Polkadot network and support Energy Web’s mission to accelerate the energy transition.</p> Crowdloan and Polkadot Parachains: Powering Energy Web X with&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Connecting to the Polkadot Relay Chain offers a <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/EWX-Lightpaper.pdf">multitude of scaling and security benefits </a>for the Energy Web ecosystem. Energy Web X aims to harness these advantages through a parachain connection. However, due to the limited availability of parachain slots on Polkadot, a competitive process is in place to allocate&nbsp;them.</p><p>To determine which projects get to connect their parachains to the Polkadot Relay Chain, lease periods (referred to as ‘ ‘time slots’ ‘) are auctioned off. Each lease period lasts for 12 weeks. Projects can bid for up to 8 slots at once in a crowdloan, for a total of 96 weeks of lease time. Winning an auction secures the project a parachain slot, granting it access to the security and resources of the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>The Energy Web and Polkadot communities can support Energy Web X’s bid for a parachain slot through a crowdloan mechanism.</p> How the EWX Crowdloan Works <p>Contributors lend their DOT tokens for the Energy Web X launch via the Polkadot crowdloan mechanism. Similar to the parachain auctions themselves, crowdloans occur directly on the Polkadot Relay Chain. Contributors will use DOT tokens to participate, requiring a Polkadot wallet. Contributed DOT tokens are temporarily locked on behalf of the project. No tokens are spent (except for a small transaction fee). In the event that Energy Web X does not win an auction, contributed DOT tokens are immediately and automatically returned.</p><p>In the event that Energy Web X wins an auction and secures a parachain slot, DOT tokens will be returned to all contributors once the parachain lease ends (96 weeks after it begins). If Energy Web X is awarded a parachain slot in the forthcoming auction, launch will be targeted for October 23, 2023 (coinciding with Polkadot lease period&nbsp;14).</p> Rewards for EWX Crowdloan Contributors <p>To incentivize community participation, a rewards program is in place. For every 1 $DOT contributed to the Energy Web X crowdloan, 1 $EWT (Energy Web Token) on Energy Web X is offered as a reward. The distribution of $EWT rewards is expected to commence in Q1 2024, with the rewards vested and distributed in consistent amounts in regular intervals over the remaining lease time of Energy Web X until Aug 25,&nbsp;2025.</p><p>The EWX parachain address is automatically calculated based on the Polkadot account that was used for the Crowdloan participation. Therefore it’s not possible to receive the crowdloan rewards to another&nbsp;address.</p> Participation Guidelines <p><a href="http://crowdloan.energywebx.com">To participate in the EWX Crowdloan</a>, contributors must send their $DOT tokens directly to the EWX Crowdloan on Polkadot, as described below. Funds raised via the crowdloan will be used in auctions beginning on September 5, 2023 and concluding between September 19 and September 24, 2023. Due to the candle auction mechanism that defines the auction end time at random, contributions made before September 7 have the most impact on EWX’s chances of winning the auction and your chances to win a reward. Please note that Ledger wallets will not initially support EWX. Contributors using Ledger wallets for the EWX Crowdloan may need to follow additional steps to access their $EWT rewards after the public&nbsp;launch.</p><p>About Energy Web <br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the second article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Read part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Before we dive into talking about specific analyses that can help distinguish the real from the fake, it is worthwhile to first ask: Just how photorealistic are AI-generated images? That is, upon only a visual inspection, can the average person tell the difference between a real image and an AI-generated image? Because the human brain is so finely sensitive to images of people and faces, we will focus on the photorealism of faces, arguably the most challenging task for AI-generation.</p><p>Before diffusion-based, text-to-image synthesis techniques like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Adobe Firefly splashed onto the screen, generative adversarial networks (GANs) were the most common computational technique for synthesizing images. These systems are generative, because they are tasked with generating an image; adversarial, because they pit two separate components (the generator and the discriminator) against each other; and networks, because the computational machinery underlying the generator and discriminator are neural networks.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Although there are many complex and intricate details in these systems, StyleGAN (and GANs in general) follow a fairly straightforward structure. When tasked with creating a synthesized face, the generator starts by splatting down a random array of pixels, and then it feeds this first guess to the discriminator. If the discriminator, equipped with a large database of real faces, can distinguish the generated image from the real faces, the discriminator provides this feedback to the generator. The generator then updates its initial guess and feeds this update to the discriminator in a second round. This process continues with the generator and discriminator competing in an adversarial game until an equilibrium is reached when the generator produces an image that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real faces. Above you can see a representative set of eight GAN-generated faces.</p><p>In a series of recent perceptual studies, we examined the ability of trained and untrained observers to distinguish between real and synthesized faces. The synthetic faces were generated using StyleGAN2, ensuring diversity across gender, race, and apparent age. For each synthesized face, a corresponding real face was matched in terms of gender, age, race, and overall appearance.</p><p>In the first study, 315 paid online participants were shown — one at a time — 128 faces, half of which were real. The participants were asked to classify each as either real or synthetic. The average accuracy on this task was 48.2%, close to chance performance of 50%, with participants equally as likely to say that a real face was synthetic as vice versa.</p><p>In a second study, 219 new participants were initially provided with a brief training on examples of specific rendering artifacts that can be used to identify synthetic faces. Throughout the experiment, participants were also provided with trial-by-trial feedback informing them whether their response was correct. This training and feedback led to a slight improvement in average accuracy, from 48.2% to 59.0%.&nbsp;</p><p>While synthesized faces are highly realistic, there are some clues that can help distinguish them from real faces:&nbsp;</p>  <p>StyleGAN-synthesized faces have a common structure consisting of a mostly front-facing person from the neck up and with a mostly uniform or nondescript background.</p>  <p>Facial asymmetries are telltale signs of synthetic faces. They are often seen in mismatched earrings or glasses frames. (See the top-left image in the figure below.)</p>  <p>When viewing a face, we tend to focus most of our attention in a "Y" pattern, shifting our gaze between the eyes and mouth and often missing some glaring artifacts in the background that may contain physically implausible structures. (See the top-right image in the figure below.)</p>  <p>StyleGAN-synthesized faces enforce a facial alignment in the training and synthesis steps that results in the spacing between the eyes being the same and the eyes being horizontally aligned in the image. (See the bottom image in the figure below.)</p>

  <p>Having largely passed through the uncanny valley, GAN-generated faces are nearly indistinguishable from real faces. Although we have not carried out formal studies, my intuition is that the more recent diffusion-based, text-to-image generation yields faces that are slightly less photorealistic. As this technology improves, however, it will surely lead to images that also pass through the uncanny valley.</p><p>Having seen that the visual system may not always be reliable in distinguishing the real from the fake, in my next post I will describe our first technique that exploits the facial alignment of GAN-generated faces to distinguish them from real faces.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] S.J.

Moreover, Gnosis Chain builders exhibited a high level of readiness to support integration and development of AI solutions for prediction markets, using the DKG as a trusted knowledge foundation.</p> Unique character of OriginTrail DKG on Gnosis&nbsp;Chain <p>The rapid expansion of AI capabilities poses a breakthrough opportunity for improving the efficiency of prediction markets as we unlock the strength of Web3 and AI technological overlap. The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph and its Knowledge Assets were identified as the ideal gateway to enable this vision for Gnosis prediction markets&nbsp;by:</p>  creating a trusted knowledge base that serves as input for AI agents to provide more precise bets on prediction markets,  using Knowledge Assets as semantic oracles for fulfillment of prediction markets,  publishing prediction knowledge as Knowledge Assets into the DKG for access with AI tools (Knowledge Graph completion).  <p>The new features of combined Gnosis and OriginTrail technologies are intended to be available to users and builders in both ecosystems, who can also apply for additional support through the <a href="http://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> program run by OriginTrail core developers or by submitting treasury proposals to the <a href="https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=0&amp;month=7&amp;year=2023">Gnosis&nbsp;DAO</a>.</p> Pioneer the OriginTrail V6 on&nbsp;Gnosis! <p>To join pioneers of Gnosis Chain V6 DKG integration, put your TRAC utility token to use by bridging it from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain via the Omnibridge — <a href="https://omnibridge.gnosischain.com/bridge">https://omnibridge.gnosischain.com/bridge</a>.</p><p>Before using the Omni bridge make sure to familiarize yourself with the terms of use and possible associated risks.</p><p>Trace ON!</p><p>👇 About Gnosis — The Community-Run Chain&nbsp;👇</p><p>Gnosis Chain is one of the first Ethereum sidechains and has stayed true to its values. By allowing contributors around the globe to easily run a node, Gnosis Chain is secured by over 140,000 validators.

 Accelerating Innovators through Energy Web Validator Community Fund&nbsp;Grants <p>Zug, 20 July 2023 — Energy Web Chain Validators recently approved a newly designed <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/communitygrantprogram/">Community Fund Grant Program</a>. The program’s objective is to support innovative projects aligned with Energy Web’s mission by awarding them with grants to turn innovative ideas into&nbsp;reality.</p><p>The program will be governed by a comprehensive set of rules approved by the validator community and managed by the Community Fund Committee. The rules and processes were inspired by the experience of several validators, who have participated in several grant programs in other Web 3 communities.</p><p>Although the Community Fund has been used for initiatives such as the Bug Bounty Program or the Validator Accounting Tool, its potential can be maximised by opening it to the wider public and supporting innovative projects that contribute to Energy Web’s mission. And with <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-and-polkadot-link-up-to-build-pioneering-renewable-energy-solutions-aca7e95e61c">Energy Web entering the Polkadot environment </a>and developing its next-generation blockchain <a href="http://www.energyweb.org/EWXLightpaperV1">Energy Web X</a>, the opportunities for innovation are even&nbsp;greater.</p><p>The rules behind the program set a general framework comprised of specific requirements applicants must meet and also specify application processes. It features a tiered grant system intended to support different types of projects, from small-scale ideas such as building simple components to improve Energy Web’s tech stack to larger ones like building entirely new solutions or conducting pilots involving energy&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Impact-driven innovation and open-source technologies are deeply rooted in Energy Web’s mission and values. Applicants will be required to tackle tangible challenges and must be willing to share project results in a transparent way.</p><p>The first iteration of the program is officially accepting grants. Participants will be required to to submit an application via a simple online form made available on this <a href="http://energyweb.org/communitygrantprogram">website</a>. And, though it has only just kicked off, future iterations are being planned by having a GitHub based application process (similar to <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#1-application">W3F’s process</a>) catering to developers and increasing transparency.</p><p>Energy Web Chain Validators look forward to receiving your applications. Stay tuned to upcoming announcements and do not hesitate in reaching out if you have any questions.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.

And to all the friends who helped, including those at <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://pressable.com">Pressable</a>, who made the transition smooth and complete. Links to every post and page we’ve published at blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/ (our old location) now travel down the same directory paths at projectvrm.org/. There will be no 404s. This is a rare thing for any site that moves from one host to another.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is not the one-year project we imagined in the first place. It may not be a one-generation project. But we will get from the state on the left above to the one on the right. And thanks to <a href="https://www.gapingvoid.com/">Gapingvoid</a>‘s Hugh MacLeod for drawing that illustration in the first place, way back in 2005.</p>

 What Happened <p>On Tuesday, August 15, 2023 around 2pm EST, hackers believed to be from the Pink Drainer hacker group breached Ceramic’s Discord server. This resulted in a series of fake airdrop announcements with malicious links that looked like they came from a core team member.</p><p>After the hackers infiltrated the server, they immediately removed all core team members and other prominent community members, which effectively disabled us from taking action to stop the attack. Once the core team realized they lost access to Discord, around 2pm EST, they immediately contacted the support team at Discord and posted on Twitter to warn the community. By 6pm the core team regained control of Discord, banned the hackers, and eliminated the threats including malicious links and posts.</p><p>In total, the hackers siphoned around $1,710 (0.93476 ETH) from community members who clicked the malicious link in the announcement channel. If you were affected by this phishing attempt please email us at <a href="mailto:team@3box.io">team@3box.io</a>.</p><p>Huge thanks to the Metamask, Discord, LearnWeb3, and ENS teams and the multitude of community members who responded so quickly and effectively to help us contain the damage.</p> How it Happened <p>Hackers reached out to a core Ceramic team member on Telegram impersonating a prominent mainstream media journalist and requested an interview for a feature. Prior to speaking, they requested the completion of prerequisite consent forms that required the team member to drag and drop a button into their bookmarks and sign into Discord in order to verify their account identity.</p><p>After dragging the bookmark into <a href="http://discord.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Discord.com</a> through their web browser, the hacker was able to steal the JWT Auth Token of this user’s account from the browser's local storage—bypassing username, password and 2FA. This attack is known as a bookmarklet, you can read more about it <a href="https://breakdev.org/hacked-discord-bookmarklet-attacks/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>. The hackers only gained access to Discord and no other information was lost or compromised.</p><p>This highly-coordinated attack appears to be the work of Pink Drainer, a hacker group that has executed this type of bookmarklet attack on a number of other leading Web3 projects. You can read more about other similar hacks performed by this group <a href="https://drops.scamsniffer.io/post/pink-drainer-steals-3m-from-multiple-hack-events-including-openai-cto-orbiter-finance/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p> Incident &amp; Response Timeline <p>11:20am EST - Consent forms completed, hack begins</p><p>1:50pm EST - Core team members lose access to Ceramic Discord</p><p>1:55pm EST - Hackers impersonate Ceramic’s community manager and post fake Ceramic token airdrop announcements</p><p>2pm to 6pm EST - Core team engages Discord, MetaMask, Seal 911 team, WalletConnect, LearnWeb3, and ENS for support</p><p>6pm EST - Core team regains access to and control of Ceramic Discord</p> Next Steps <p>The Ceramic core team will be doubling-down on security while restoring previous roles and settings in Discord. Please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:team@3box.io">team@3box.io</a> if you’ve been affected by the attack.</p><p>We take our role of protecting the best interests of our community very seriously and this was certainly not our finest afternoon; however, these types of events are an unfortunate reality of operating in Web3. </p><p>We will learn from this misstep, improve, and make sure we continue to serve and protect our community of Web3 builders.

<p>Findynet <a href="https://findy.fi/en/ssi-rfi-2023/">requested information about Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions</a> in the summer. We are very pleased with the quality of the 10 responses and thank all respondents for their participation. We feel that we have a good baseline to start evaluating which solutions would best fit the various ecosystems and use cases Findynet is planning to support.</p>
<p>If you are a potential participant in a Findy pilot or a Finnish SSI ecosystem member looking for an SSI solution, please reach out to <a href="mailto:samuel.rinnetmaki@findy.fi?subject=SSI+RFI+results">Samuel Rinnetmäki</a> so we can share the overview of the RFI results with you.</p>
<p>We have also arranged a series of demonstrations where SSI solution providers showcase their capabilities.&nbsp;In these 1-hour online events, invited SSI solution providers demonstrate their capabilities to support use case examples defined by Findynet.</p>
 Invitation to live demos 
 The demo sessions are open to all Findynet’s members and customers – both current and potential ones.

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>With this year’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata&nbsp;</a>earlier in the month now behind us but still very much in the sector’s mind, it has to be the most appropriate topic to lead this month’s newsletter.</p>



<p>Some of you reading this were there in the room to experience it and as I wrote to you last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/speakers-2023/">s</a><a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/speakers-2023/">peakers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/sponsors/">sponsors</a>&nbsp;and delegates alike all played their part to make this event a great success, ‘the best yet’. Attendee survey results certainly support this assertion.</p>



<p>There were jaw-dropping statistics thanks to the Department of Internal Affairs and&nbsp;<a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/paulwarrentape">Paul Warren-Tape from Diamond Sponsor IDVerse</a>. The cost of identity crime in NZ is +$200M annually, and the cost of identity theft globally in 2021 was $52bn. By comparison, the estimated cost to eradicate world hunger for a year is $45bn. No math needed – the human cost of identity crime is huge and Aotearoa simply has to do better, faster, if we are to get ahead of this.</p>



<p>We enjoyed&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/programme-2023/">presentations, panel and roundtable discussions</a>&nbsp;ruminating on new tech in biometrics, in AI and Cloud, on talent and trust, identity and security. We heard experiences from the banking, health and retail sectors in operationalising digital trust. And we were able to get some useful insights and updates from the Department of Internal Affairs’ Digital Public Service branch and the RealMe team, even though Ministers and senior government officials were unable to attend due to the election being so close. Fortunately for attendees, they can re-run the event on the Backstage app, to keep those poignant moments top of mind. Get a head start on next year’s Summit:&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/subscribe-for-updates/">Subscribe for updates – Digital Trust Summit</a>.</p>



<p>Our decision to bring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victordominello/">Victor Dominello&nbsp;</a>over from New South Wales to deliver the international keynote paid off handsomely – Victor also giving up his time so generously to meet with the Minister, the opposition, the Digital Executive Board comprising senior public service officials, the Te Whatu Ora and&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity NZ’s</a>&nbsp;own&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it was in my car on the Sunday night two days before the Hui Taumata, touring Victor around the Wellington CBD showing the locations for his upcoming meetings when he asked, “What happened? In my early days in the New South Wales Government as Minister for Digital we envied just how far ahead New Zealand was in terms of digital compared to us. And now you have me over here to share our story. What happened?”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a fair point. There were several policy changes around seven or eight years ago which impacted New Zealand’s leadership position. But on the other hand, that’s when discussions about regulating the New Zealand digital identity market first surfaced (with the passing of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">DISTF regulation</a>&nbsp;we are up towards the front again in that aspect) and with the establishment and success of New Zealand digital identity companies coming a little later, some of which have gone global (MATTR recently winning a contract from the NSW Government no less) it’s clear that we’ve moved forward. If you’re interested,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final-1.pdf">pages 14 -15 and 32-34 of our Report on Digital Identity in Aotearoa</a>&nbsp;help with further context around the market dynamics. Nonetheless, it’s sobering to be reminded how offshore perceives us – how our comprehensive leadership in this space less than 10 years ago has narrowed and in some cases been overtaken. Just like the All Blacks or the Silver Ferns (if we thought of Aotearoa’s digital identity ecosystem as a national team) there should be no complacency regarding our relative position in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So it was great to feel the ‘buzz’ of a sense of urgency in conversations at the Hui Taumata this year. And it has motivated<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">&nbsp;Digital Identity NZ</a>&nbsp;to think strategically on how to deliver its value proposition and increase its relevance more directly into the NZ digital identity ecosystem while supporting its members. In the coming months expect to see some timely and strategic changes to our positioning, posture, website and events content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>My opening and closing remarks encouraged attendees to actively participate and help frame the underpinning ecology and ecosystem that’s needed to support our shared goal. That could be through advocacy, research and development or education and awareness raising throughout your organisation, whānau, iwi and hapu of the critical and foundational role digital identity plays in achieving safe, secure and privacy-centric digital transactions.</p>



<p>To that end&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity NZ</a>&nbsp;has some great resources to draw on for help, including&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">articles, research, reports and our submissions</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/webinars/">webinars</a>&nbsp;and similar postings from its&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/knowledge-hub/">Knowledge Hub</a>.&nbsp;They are there for you – private, public and&nbsp;non profit sectors – the mahi sponsored by socially responsible organisations working alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-members/">members</a>&nbsp;volunteering their time.&nbsp;The time for action is now.</p>

 Introduction — bringing any message across blockchains <p>The OriginTrail technical architecture consists of 3 layers — the consensus layer, the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) layer and the application layer. Since the OriginTrail ecosystem inception and the first whitepaper, the consensus layer was intended to include multiple blockchains in order to ensure neutrality, robustness and inclusiveness.</p><p>We have seen the first implementation of the multi-chain approach in the V5 of the DKG which ended up being integrated with Ethereum, Gnosis and Polygon. The currently newest V6, initially deployed on the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, has yet to become a multichain network and drive trusted knowledge infrastructure across blockchains. This document serves as an outline of the path towards reaching&nbsp;that.</p><p>Web3 is currently lacking an interoperable layer for maintaining a trusted knowledge base across a growing number of blockchain ecosystems which is limiting the possibility to create cross-blockchain applications or expand user experience and user base across multiple blockchain ecosystems.</p><p>In addition to limiting the value that can be created for Web3 users, it also significantly discourages Web2 users from onboarding to Web3. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/10/majority-of-americans-arent-confident-in-the-safety-and-reliability-of-cryptocurrency/">According to research, </a>75% of Americans who have heard of cryptocurrencies are not confident in their safety and reliability. While reasons for this are multifaceted, it is clear, the growth of this sector is impeded by misinformation, poorly structured and siloed&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Web3 requires a semantic layer to bring any message across blockchains in a verifiable manner. Having discussed integrations with several leading EVM compatible blockchain ecosystem champions, the right time to enable such integrations is&nbsp;now.</p> OriginTrail integration with EVM — compatible blockchains <p>The ambition of the multichain OriginTrail project is to drive trusted knowledge exchange across Web3 communities by equipping builders from various ecosystems with tools and guidance to integrate DKG with their EVM-compatible chain.</p><p>The impact of OriginTrail integration with a blockchain ecosystem:</p>  Bringing Decentralized Knowledge Graph technology to any blockchain ecosystem enabling trusted AI applications, such as AI-powered trusted semantic search (<a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> initiative)  Enabling enterprise solutions leveraging DKG and AI technology on your chain (enterprises using OriginTrail <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/overview">here</a>)  Cross-chain knowledge portability (e.g. bridging knowledge for multichain Dapps)  Semantic data oracle functionality for smart contracts on your blockchain (e.g. RWA applications)  Integrations with applications and protocols within your blockchain ecosystem, leveraging the interoperable design of Knowledge Assets (e.g. NFT marketplaces for trading Knowledge assets)  Shared user experience between metaverses leveraging trusted Knowledge Assets across blockchains (e.g. <a href="https://www.tracverse.com/">Tracverse</a>)  <p>Enablement of EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystems drives further exposure and awareness about OriginTrail DKG, resulting in synergies between crypto communities and ultimately the establishment of the Multichain Trusted Knowledge Foundation.</p> EVM blockchains DKG integration steps <p>The process kick-starting the integration of Decentralized Knowledge Graph on an EVM compatible blockchains is straightforward. The first step is to create a pull request in the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/">OT-RFC-repository</a> using the template pull request with the following name: RFC-17-CHAIN_NAME_integration. In the PR you should create a JSON file with key details about the blockchain network (name, network ID, block explorer, website) and addresses of the smart contracts for TRAC bridge (both on Ethereum and destination chain). An example of the file is available <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-17-OriginTrail-integration-with-EVM-compatible-blockchains/chains/integration-requests/example.json">here</a>.</p><p>Once the pull request is submitted, the core development team will validate the submission to ensure that no inputs are missing and that all requirements are fully met (see below). Depending on the findings, the integration might be approved for the next stage or a request for more information will be&nbsp;given.</p><p>Once approved, a dedicated channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/cCRPzzmnNT">OriginTrail Discord</a> will be created for the blockchain network and integration will be scheduled for implementation (the exact date will be communicated in Discord).</p> EVM blockchain requirements for DKG integration <p>There are a few key criteria that need to be met in order for integration to&nbsp;proceed:</p>  The blockchain network needs to be EVM-compatible.  The blockchain network needs a functioning, preferably decentralized, bridge for the TRAC&nbsp;token.  Engagement within the OriginTrail community — there should be a positive presence of the particular blockchain community present in the OriginTrail community and/or vice-versa. The signaling of desired DKG utility on a particular blockchain ensures that the deployed network will see reasonable activity.  5MM+ TRAC bridged to the blockchain network showing support to initiate network infrastructure and initial DKG network activity.   Conclusion <p>This RFC has presented the approach to integrating OriginTrail DKG with EVM-compatible blockchains, the value propositions and indicated requirements for such integrations. We invite the wider Web3 community to participate in the RFC process, provide their feedback and initiate integrations.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-17-origintrail-integration-with-evm-compatible-blockchains-e635dc8afb86">OT-RFC-17 OriginTrail integration with EVM-compatible blockchains</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.</p><p>This is the first article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">Photo forensics for AI-generated faces</a></p><p>Part 4: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-from-lighting-environments">Photo forensics from lighting environments</a></p><p>Part 5: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-from-lighting-shadows-and-reflections">Photo forensics from lighting shadows and reflections</a></p><p>Part 6: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/passive-versus-active-photo-forensics-in-the-age-of-ai">Passive versus active photo forensics in the age of AI and social media</a></p>

  <p>In the past, altering the historical record required cumbersome and time-consuming darkroom techniques. Starting in the early 2000s, powerful and low-cost digital technology began to make it easier to record and alter digital images. And today, sophisticated generative-AI software has fully democratized the ability to create compelling digital fakes.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, I was waiting in line at the library when I noticed an enormous book in the return cart called The Federal Rules of Evidence. I thumbed through the book and came across Rule 1001 of Article X, which outlined the rules under which photographic evidence can be introduced in a court of law. The rules seemed straightforward until I read the definition of original:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>An “original” of a writing or recording means the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by the person who executed or issued it. For electronically stored information, “original” means any printout — or other output readable by sight — if it accurately reflects the information.</p></blockquote><p>I was struck that the definition of original included this vague statement: “... or other output readable by sight.”&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, digital cameras and digital editing software were still primitive by today’s standards, and generative AI was unimaginable. The trajectory of technology, however, was fairly clear, and it seemed to me that advances in the power and ubiquity of digital technology would eventually lead to complex issues around how we can trust digital media. As we enter the new age of generative AI, these issues have only become more salient.</p><p>Although it varies in form and creation, generative AI content (a.k.a. deepfakes) refers to images, audio, or video that has been automatically synthesized by an AI-based system. Deepfakes are the latest in a long line of techniques used to manipulate reality — from Stalin's darkroom to Photoshop to classic computer-generated renderings. However, their introduction poses new opportunities and risks now that everyone has access to what was historically the purview of a small number of sophisticated organizations.</p><p>Even in these early days of the AI revolution, we are seeing stunning advances in generative AI. The technology can create a realistic photo from a simple text prompt, clone a person's voice from a few minutes of an audio recording, and insert a person into a video to make them appear to be doing whatever the creator desires. We are also seeing real harms from this content in the form of non-consensual sexual imagery, small- to large-scale fraud, and disinformation campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Building on our earlier research in digital media forensics techniques, over the past few years my research group and I have turned our attention to this new breed of digital fakery. All our authentication techniques work in the absence of digital watermarks or signatures. Instead, they model the path of light through the entire image-creation process and quantify physical, geometric, and statistical regularities in images that are disrupted by the creation of a fake.</p><p>In this series of posts, I will describe a collection of different techniques that we use to determine whether an image is real or fake. I will explain the underlying analyses — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, specular reflections in the eye, and AI-generated faces — and the conditions under which the analyses are suitable.</p><p>While these and related techniques can be powerful, I need to emphasize their limitations.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it is important to understand that while the presence of evidence of manipulation can tell us something, the absence of traces of manipulation do not prove that an image is real. We cannot differentiate between a flawless fake and the real thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, nearly all forensic techniques have a limited shelf life because techniques to manipulate content are continually improving. So while these techniques are applicable today, we have to continually be aware of how generative AI is evolving.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, these forensic techniques are only one part of a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record. This includes efforts like the Content Authenticity Initiative (to which I contribute), some regulatory pressures, education, and the responsible deployment of AI technologies.</p><p>Further reading:<br>[1] H.

      <p>beyond credentialing and the formal/informal divide<br>
Badges as credentials includes approaches that are well understood and largely replace or augment existing certification practices. Badges for recognition, however, include approaches that remain somewhat confusing to many people.</p>

      <p>This information means that this particular badge, which is manually issued, can be given out in fair and equitable ways. It also means that someone else who engaged with the Open Badges community before 2017 could lay claim to it.</p>

      <p>Stealth badges at scale require an automated system that issues badges depending on particular criteria. This is why they are very common in games-based environments. For example, I unlock some most weeks playing new and existing games on my PlayStation and Google Stadia.</p>

      <p>Last week, we ran the first Keep Badges Weird community call, and it was even more energising than we expected it to be. We were so pleased to see so many people interested in the current and future status of badges and open recognition. We were elated to begin to have a deep conversation about counteracting the top-down focus of institutions and large organisations using badges for corporate stuff. There’s an outstanding question, for us, around how this community explores and thinks about the theoretical underpinnings of a Community of Practice (CoP), but one thing is for sure, Keep Badges Weird is a CoP.</p>

      <p>The complexity surrounding any global audience can’t be understated, really. I mean, we’re talking about millions of people.
