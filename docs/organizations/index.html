 CharacterGPT is a revolutionary artificial intelligence system that allows users to quickly generate interactive characters with distinct appearances, voices, intelligence, personalities, and identities simply by providing a natural language description. 
 After a character is tokenized, its owner can customize its personality, train its intelligence, trade its generative outputs, and use it across the other dApps on the AI Protocol. 
<p>In the same way that the internet revolutionized content distribution, AI is revolutionizing content creation. Large Language Models such as GPT-3, ChatGPT, Text-to-Image Models like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 2, MidJourney, and now Alethea AI’s Text-to-Character AI System, CharacterGPT, mark the beginning of a new age in content creation.</p>

 La Suisse en route vers une nouvelle identité électronique — Lancement d’une sandbox publique pour tester l’écosystème des preuves numériques <p>Cet article donne un aperçu sur les développements de l’E-ID en Suisse et renseigne sur l’environnement Sandbox récemment lancé. (<a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/die-schweiz-auf-dem-weg-zur-neuen-elektronischen-identit%C3%A4t-public-sandbox-gestartet-99723a2e31bf">Artikel auch auch Deutsch verfügbar</a>.)</p> Contexte de l’E-ID suisse&nbsp;: ce qui s’est passé jusqu’à&nbsp;présent <p>Alors que le commerce électronique dans l’Union européenne est largement régi par le règlement eIDAS, il existe en Suisse différentes lois qui régissent des aspects comparables du commerce électronique. Actuellement, il n’existe toutefois pas de base juridique au niveau fédéral en Suisse pour une identité électronique émise par&nbsp;l’État.</p><p>Une première loi fédérale sur l’E-ID a déjà été adoptée en Suisse par le Parlement en septembre 2019, celle ci reposait sur des fournisseurs d’identité centraux et privés, mais elle a été abrogé lors d’une <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/fr/home/themes/abstimmungen/bgeid.html">votation populaire le 7 mars&nbsp;2021</a>.</p>Source de l’image: <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/fr/home/themes/abstimmungen/bgeid.html">https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/fr/home/themes/abstimmungen/bgeid.html</a><p>En mai 2021, le Conseil fédéral a chargé le Département fédéral de justice et police, le Département fédéral des finances et la Chancellerie fédérale d’élaborer, avec la participation des milieux scientifiques et des cantons, un concept sommaire pour un nouvel&nbsp;E-ID.</p><p>Une audition et une consultation publiques ont ensuite permis de discuter des trois solutions possibles suivantes pour un E-ID suisse&nbsp;:</p>  Self-Sovereign Identity  Infrastructure à clé&nbsp;publique  Fournisseur d’identité central de&nbsp;l’État  <p>En décembre 2021, <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-86465.html">le Conseil fédéral a annoncé une décision</a> orientée en faveur de la solution Self-Sovereign Identity pour l’E-ID&nbsp;suisse.</p><p>L’E-ID devra être émis par l’Office fédéral de la police (fedpol), qui est subordonné au Département fédéral de justice et police&nbsp;(DFJP).</p><p>L’infrastructure de confiance doit être développée et exploitée par la Confédération et permettre l’établissement de données et de justificatifs d’identité publics et&nbsp;privés.</p><p>Après la <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-89515.html">consultation sur la nouvelle loi E-ID</a>, qui a duré jusqu’en octobre 2022, le Département fédéral de justice et police devrait présenter la nouvelle loi E-ID d’ici l’été 2023. Parallèlement, l’expérimentation de la technologie dans une sandbox se poursuit.</p> Lancement d’un environnement d’essai public “Sandbox”. Source de l’image&nbsp;: Github repository “e-id-admin”.<p>La Suisse est en train de développer une nouvelle solution E-ID. La nouvelle solution E-ID poursuit l’objectif de stocker de manière décentralisée les données d’identité numériques et les justificatifs des citoyens. L’État conserve le contrôle de l’infrastructure de confiance nécessaire. Pour la mise en œuvre de l’écosystème E-ID, on mise, comme à l’avenir dans l’Union européenne, sur le concept des Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI).</p><p>Cette semaine, l’Office fédéral de l’informatique et de la télécommunication (OFIT) et l’Office fédéral de la justice (OFJ) ont mis en place une Public Sandbox afin de recueillir les premières expériences pratiques avec des ID-Wallets et des preuves vérifiables. L’objectif de la Sandbox est de travailler avec environ 40 partenaires participants&nbsp;:</p>  Permettre des applications pilotes SSI en Suisse De générer des expériences pratiques préliminaires pour l’ensemble de l’écosystème et de ses&nbsp;acteurs.  D’acquérir une expérience technique et organisationnelle par l’expérimentation  De faire progresser la construction d’une culture de collaboration au sein de l’écosystème.  Source de l’image&nbsp;: Github repository “e-id-admin”.<p>L’équipe E-ID de la Confédération organise chaque mois une réunion publique de participation E-ID en ligne. Davantage d’informations sont disponibles via la newsletter. (<a href="https://www.eid.admin.ch/eid/fr/home/e-id-gesetz/partizipation.html">Inscription via la newsletter</a>).

Dans le cadre de cette réunion, Adrian Doerk de notre équipe a présenté <a href="https://github.com/e-id-admin/general/blob/main/meetings/20230302_E-ID-Participation-Meeting_March_Lissi_fr.pdf">les développements au niveau européen</a>.</p><p>Lissi est actuellement en discussion avec l’OFIT et l’OFJ en vue d’une participation à la Sandbox. Les entreprises et organisations intéressées ayant leur siège en Suisse pourront utiliser Lissi-Agent pour établir, gérer et vérifier les données d’identité numériques et les justificatifs dans la Public Sandbox suisse. Il est en outre prévu que Lissi-Wallet puisse être utilisé dans le cadre de la Public Sandbox Trust Infrastructure.</p>Séquence du point de vue d’un&nbsp;citoyen<p>Les personnes physiques reçoivent avec le Lissi Wallet un ID-Wallet très intuitif à utiliser dans différents cas d’application au sein de la Public&nbsp;Sandbox.</p>La plateforme Lissi Agent permet différents cas d’application dans l’E-ID Sandbox&nbsp;suisse.<p>Si vous représentez une organisation suisse et que vous souhaitez participer à la Sandbox avec un cas d’application, n’hésitez pas à remplir notre <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/ArRDi3I7">formulaire de contact</a>. Nous vous assisterons volontiers dans la mise en&nbsp;œuvre.</p> À propos de&nbsp;Lissi <p>Lissi propose des applications simples pour les organisations afin d’établir, de gérer et de stocker des preuves numériques.

 Die Schweiz auf dem Weg zur neuen elektronischen Identität — Öffentliche Sandbox gestartet <p>Dieser Artikel gibt einen Überblick über die E-ID Entwicklungen in der Schweiz und informiert über die kürzlich gestartete Sandbox Umgebung. (<a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/la-suisse-en-route-vers-une-nouvelle-identit%C3%A9-%C3%A9lectronique-lancement-dune-sandbox-publique-pour-306c77e38b6a">article également disponible en allemand</a>).</p> Hintergrund zur Schweizer E-ID: Was bisher&nbsp;geschah <p>Während der elektronische Geschäftsverkehr in der Europäischen Union weitgehend in der eIDAS-Verordnung geregelt wird, gibt es in der Schweiz unterschiedliche Gesetze, die vergleichbare Aspekte zum elektronischen Geschäftsverkehr regeln. Derzeit besteht auf Bundesebene in der Schweiz allerdings keine Rechtsgrundlage für eine vom Staat herausgegebene elektronische Identität.</p><p>Ein erstes Bundesgesetz zur E-ID in der Schweiz, welches auf zentralen, privaten Identitätsanbietern beruhte, wurde zwar bereits im September 2019 vom Parlament verabschiedet, jedoch in einer <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/bgeid">Volksabstimmung am 7. März 2021&nbsp;</a>gekippt.</p>Bildquelle: <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/bgeid">https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/bgeid</a><p>Bereits im Mai 2021 beauftragte der Bundesrat das Eidgenössische Justiz- und Polizeidepartement, das Eidgenössische Finanzdepartement und die Bundeskanzlei unter Beteiligung der Wissenschaft und Kantone ein Grobkonzept für eine neue E-ID zu erarbeiten.</p><p>In einer anschließenden öffentlichen Anhörung und Konsultation wurden die drei folgenden mögliche Lösungen für eine Schweizer E-ID diskutiert:</p>  Self-Sovereign Identity  Public Key Infrastruktur  Zentraler staatlicher Identitätsprovider  <p>Im Dezember 2021 gab der <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-86465.html">Bundesrat einen Richtungsentscheid zugunsten der Self-Sovereign Identity Lösung für die Schweizer E-ID&nbsp;bekannt</a>.</p><p>Die E-ID selbst soll vom Bundesamt für Polizei (fedpol), welches dem Eidgenössischen Justiz- und Polizeidepartement (EJPD) unterstellt ist, herausgegeben werden.</p><p>Die Vertrauensinfrastruktur soll durch den Bund entwickelt und betrieben werden und sowohl die Ausstellung öffentlicher, wie privater Identitätsdaten und Nachweise ermöglichen.</p><p>Nach der <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-89515.html">Vernehmlassung zum neuen E-ID Gesetz</a>, welche bis Oktober 2022 andauerte, wird mit einer Vorlage des neuen E-ID Gesetzes durch das Eidgenössische Justiz- und Polizeidepartement bis Sommer 2023 gerechnet. Parallel wird die Erprobung der Technologie in einer Sandbox vorangetrieben.</p> Start einer öffentlichen Versuchsumgebung “Sandbox” Bildquelle: <a href="https://github.com/e-id-admin/general/blob/main/meetings/20230302_E-ID_Participation-Meeting_March_Update_Public_Sandbox_Trust_Infrastructure_en.pdf">Github repository “e-id-admin”</a><p>Die Schweiz ist auf dem Weg eine neue E-ID Lösung zu entwickeln. Die neue E-ID Lösung verfolgt das Ziel, die digitalen Identitätsdaten und Nachweise der Bürgerinnen und Bürger dezentral zu speichern. Die Kontrolle über die erforderliche Vertrauensinfrastruktur verbleibt beim Staat. Für die Umsetzung des E-ID-Ökosystems wird, wie auch zukünftig in der Europäischen Union, auf das Konzept der Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI)&nbsp;gesetzt.</p><p>Diese Woche haben das Bundesamt für Informatik und Telekommunikation BIT und das Bundesamt für Justiz BJ eine Public Sandbox eingerichtet, um erste praktische Erfahrungen mit ID-Wallets und verifizierbaren Nachweisen zu sammeln. Ziel der Sandbox ist es mit ca. 40 teilnehmenden Partnern:</p>  SSI-Pilot Anwendungen in der Schweiz zu ermöglichen  Frühzeitige praktische Erfahrungen für das gesamte Ökosystem und seine Akteure zu generieren  Durch das Experimentieren technische und organisatorische Erfahrungen zu&nbsp;sammeln  Den Aufbau einer Kultur der Zusammenarbeit im Ökosystem voranzutreiben  Bildquelle: <a href="https://github.com/e-id-admin/general/blob/main/meetings/20230302_E-ID_Participation-Meeting_March_Update_Public_Sandbox_Trust_Infrastructure_en.pdf">Github repository “e-id-admin”</a><p>Das E-ID-Team des Bundes veranstaltet jeden Monat ein öffentliches E-ID Partizipationsmeeting online. Mehr Info gibt es per Newsletter. (<a href="https://www.eid.admin.ch/eid/de/home/e-id-gesetz/partizipation.html">Anmeldung via Newsletter</a>). Am 2.

Interessierte Unternehmen und Organisationen mit Sitz in der Schweiz können den Lissi Agent nutzen, um digitale Identitätsdaten und Nachweise in der Schweizer Public Sandbox auszustellen, zu verwalten und zu verifizieren. Weiter ist es vorgesehen, dass die Lissi-Wallet im Rahmen der Public Sandbox Trust Infrastructure eingesetzt werden&nbsp;kann.</p>Abfolge aus Sicht eines&nbsp;Bürgers<p>Natürliche Personen erhalten mit dem Lissi Wallet eine sehr intuitive ID-Wallet zur Nutzung für unterschiedliche Anwendungsfälle innerhalb der Public&nbsp;Sandbox.</p>Die Lissi Agent Plattform ermöglicht verschiedene Anwendungsfälle in der Schweizer E-ID&nbsp;Sandbox.<p>Falls Sie ein Schweizer Organisation vertreten und sich mit einem Anwendungsfall an der Sandbox beteiligen möchten, können Sie gern <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/p7VCW5Jt">unser Kontaktformular</a> ausfüllen.

Konfir was established to revolutionize the employment verification process by securely removing companies’ administrative burdens when requesting or completing employment and gaps in employment verifications. We achieve this by leveraging our certification under the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) and streamlining the process in a GDPR-compliant way. We aim to accelerate all corners of the modern UK economy, from those switching jobs to those renting a property or obtaining any type of credit.</p>



              



<p>Our unique focus is on protecting and enabling consumers by ensuring transparent and secure access to their own income and employment records. We’re dedicated to helping UK-based workers get approvals faster while controlling their data flow and helping relying parties verify employment faster. By offering instant results, improved candidate experience, and faster turnaround times, we make it a no-brainer for employment screening teams to choose Konfir.</p>



<p>What makes Konfir unique?<br>Konfir stands out from other providers in the employment and income verification space for several reasons. The antiquated and insecure solution of contacting previous employers takes days or weeks to process and only verifies what a candidate has said, not necessarily the reality. In contrast, Konfir provides instant employment data from authoritative sources using payroll integrations and open banking. This allows us to offer comprehensive results in a flash, which is especially helpful for employment verification and gap in employment validation checks that can often be time-consuming and cumbersome.</p>



<p>We also focus on improving the candidate experience, evidenced by our conversion rate of over 80%. Candidates appreciate the convenience, speed, and security of our service, which helps them complete what is sometimes a stressful and time-consuming experience so they can get to work quicker. As the only method of employment verification underpinned by certification, we’re continuously innovating to make the employment verification process even smoother and more efficient.</p>



Team Konfir



<p>What was the key driver for choosing certification under the UK DIATF?<br>The primary driver for choosing certification under the UK DIATF was to foster trust by providing evidence that Konfir operates to the highest security standards. The certification serves as a springboard to open conversations about employment verification with public bodies and the market given it is already understood by many following the Digital ID rollout. By establishing digital trust in the employment screening process, we can ensure that personal data is used responsibly and that individuals have control over how their data is used. This certification helps set the standard for employment and income verification in the UK; placing Konfir as a pioneer in the industry.<br><br>What made you choose Kantara Initiative (KI) as your certification body?<br>We selected Kantara Initiative as our chosen certification body due to their responsiveness, support from start to end, and their experience in this space in the UK and abroad. Furthermore, Kantara’s in-depth approach to ASP certification has complemented our ISO 27001 journey, ensuring a robust and comprehensive certification process that demonstrates our commitment to security and data protection.</p>



<p>What did you learn about your business as you went through the certification process?<br>Going through the certification process, one of the first major external full-company audit processes we’ve experienced, validated that we’re doing many things right. We also identified a few areas for improvement and learned a lot about how to standardise our rating of the identity and employment attributes we make available to our clients. The process emphasised the importance of digital trust and our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals in the employment screening process.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to other start-up organisations considering certification?<br>Our advice to other start-ups considering certification is to start early and engage with organizations that have already gone through the process. Understand the requirements and benefits of certification, and ensure your business is well-prepared. Certification not only helps establish trust with your clients and partners but also strengthens your company’s internal processes and security standards.</p>



<p>How have you used certification to support your business development strategies?<br>Certification has been instrumental in enhancing our business development strategies. It has opened doors to partnership opportunities with key players in the trust framework, such as OSPs and IDSPs, as well as relying parties. As Konfir employs novel technologies like open banking and payroll integrations to complete verifications, the certification instills trust in the secure and responsible use of these technologies.</p>



<p>This certification not only establishes Konfir as a credible and viable business partner but also fosters trust in our processes among candidates. By operating in a secure, auditable, and compliant manner, candidates are more inclined to engage with our processes over non-certified competitors. Furthermore, our pioneering position in the industry, amplified by certification, boosts our visibility among employment screening companies and other stakeholders, contributing to the success of our business development efforts.<br><br>What feedback can you provide for the Kantara team?                                                                             The auditors were highly skilled individuals possessing a wealth of knowledge. Their structured and approachable demeanor made the entire experience both smooth and enjoyable. Throughout each step, they clearly communicated the requirements, rationale, and methods, ensuring a seamless process. We truly appreciate the Kantara team’s dedication and support.<br><br></p>

             <p>During the 37th GS1 Healthcare Conference in Paris (2022), Cliona Kiersey, Chief Pharmacist, HSE National Immunisation Office presented on stage the key successes for COVID-19 vaccine traceability in Ireland, including the early detection of quality issues and medication safety through reporting discard codes for vaccine usage. The implementation of TrackVax increased the certainty of valid doses, and collaboration and co-design with multiple stakeholders allowed system users to take ownership and continuously propose improvements. The system also provided full accountability in an environment of limited supply and public demand, and enabled real-time and accurate national reports with a rich dataset. Additionally, the system offered end-of-day reconciliation compared to paper-based reporting and provided timely, accurate, informative (usage trends) standardized reports, thereby increasing visibility.</p>

             <p>A successful pilot with Covid-19 vaccines has helped lay the ground for pharmaceutical traceability for all drugs by 2024. The arrival of vaccinations against Covid-19 represented a big step forward in managing the pandemic. Countries around the world have been seeking ways to easily and constantly monitor the amount of vaccine available to citizens, to ensure efficient and fair distribution of these medicines. As a relatively new treatment – with side effects and efficacy still being closely tracked – it is also important to know which batches of which medicines are where, not least in case of recall.</p>

<p></p>     <p>Members of the Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contracts Working Group co-developed Citopia vinTRAK Zero-Knowledge proof of location verification for Dealer Floorplan Audit automation. </p>
          <p>Los Angeles — 30 March 2023: MOBI and its members have successfully demonstrated the first-ever Web3 digital infrastructure for privacy-preserving verification of vehicle track-and-trace, enabling lenders and auditors to automate Dealer Floorplan Audits (DFA). Currently, DFA is done manually, a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. The technologies piloted, MOBI Trusted Trip (decentralized identity linked with location into a verifiable trip) and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof of location, are foundational for many more applications, such as tolling, road usage charging, CO2 emissions tracking/reporting, and usage-based insurance.</p>
<p>Modern IT systems allow for the track and trace of connected devices with a big catch — the location of device users (Personal Identifiable Information, or PII) is exposed! Vehicles on dealer lots are filled with sensors that can provide accurate data about the vehicle’s condition, location, and other important information. While it is theoretically possible to use existing vehicle telematics to check location and automate the audit process, doing so can potentially reveal customer PII, for example, if the vehicle is sold or loaned to a customer. In addition, each dealer lot may contain vehicles from multiple manufacturers (OEMs) that do not share data with each other during the audit. As a result, lenders have continued with manual auditing.</p>
<p>MOBI’s DFA pilot uses Citopia vinTRAK ZK proof of location verification capabilities to safeguard vehicle location and other PII. The only public information required to verify the ZK proof and verification is the geofenced location of the dealership. During the audit process, the vehicle is asked “Are you in this geofenced location?” and the vehicle responds with the proof “Yes/No.” The proof does not contain any clear text information about a vehicle’s location or identity (e.g. VIN number).</p>
<p>An additional layer of privacy for the technology being demoed is the use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> standards to create <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Citopia Self-Sovereign Digital Twins (SSDT)</a>. An SSDT is a Digital Twin (DT) where only the owner/controller has access to the data stored inside the DT and can participate in autonomous transactions. In this pilot:</p>
<p>Vehicle geolocation resides in the vehicle SSDT and only the vehicle data owner/controller has access to this data. Lenders receive the ZK proof and MOBI and Lenders do not have access to vehicle C-SSDT.</p>
<p>ZK verification of vehicle location (does not contain a specific location or the VIN) resides in both the vehicle and the lender SSDTs (MOBI does not have access to this data).</p>
<p>The technologies used in this pilot enable the automation of Dealer Floorplan Audit for lenders and auditors without the complications and legal risks of handling PII associated with vehicles. This pilot is foundational for many track-and-trace applications powered by MOBI Trusted Trip and ZK cryptography. Building on this innovative groundwork, OEMs can monetize connected vehicle data in future applications such as vehicle maintenance traceability, battery cross-border compliance, and usage-based services.</p>
<p>The DFA Pilot using Citopia vinTRAK ZK proof of location verification is spearheaded by MOBI’s Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contracts (FSSC) <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Working Group</a>.

<p>Canada’s trusted digital ID leader, the DIACC, welcomes Budget 2023; applauds the government for investments in digital transformation and Canada’s shift to a digital economy</p>



<p>RONTO, MARCH 29, 2023 — Joni Brennan, President of the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) released a statement following the tabling of the federal budget yesterday:</p>



<p>The DIACC welcomes the federal government’s investments for digital transformation and Canadian innovation to enable a thriving digital economy announced in yesterday’s budget.</p>



<p>Canada has an opportunity to be a global leader in digital ID, and unlock opportunities for Canadians, decrease costs for governments, consumers, and business, improve service delivery, and drive GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A digital identity is a highly personal yet critical component to both serve and protect Canadians. From increasing data protection and privacy in the public sector to strengthening national security, public safety and child protection through effective authentication and authorization, digital ID is an important part of our transition to a digital world and a digital economy. Further, we know that an effective, safe and secure digital ID ecosystem will save manual operation costs and reduce fraud, saving an estimated $482 million for provincial and federal governments, and $4.5 billion for private sector organizations.</p>



<p>This budget announcement reinforces the government’s commitment to Canada’s digital transformation as it looks for ways to be a full participant in the global digital economy and shift to a digital-first mindset. The government has made some encouraging progress in adopting digital technology solutions to better deliver programs and services, and Canadians are benefiting from that progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were pleased to see the following commitments included in the budget:</p>



 
 A commitment to introduce legislative amendments to the Criminal Code and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) to strengthen the investigative, enforcement, and information sharing tools of Canada’s AML/ATF Regime. 



 A commitment to improving Airport Operations and Passenger Screening, including $1.8 billion over five years to the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) to maintain and increase its level of service, improve screening wait times, and strengthen security measures at airports. 



 Commitments to improve service delivery for Canadians including $156.7 million over five years to reduce backlogs in Veterans Affairs Canada; $123.9 million over seven years for Old Age Security IT modernization; and a commitment to amend the Citizenship Act to enable the electronic administration of the citizenship program, automated and machine-assisted processing, and the collection and use of biometric information. 
 



<p>The budget provides an opportunity to further advance digital ID in Canada, and the DIACC remains committed to partnering with both government and industry to continue building a trusted digital ID ecosystem and educating Canadians to combat dis and misinformation regarding digital ID.</p>



<p>About Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) is a non-profit coalition of public and private sector organizations committed to developing research and tools to enable secure, robust, and scalable Canadian digital ID solutions and services. With privacy, security, and choice at the forefront of all DIACC initiatives, we aim to enable all Canadians to participate safely and confidently in the global digital economy.</p>

<p>We have long said there will not be one blockchain to rule them all. It will take a mix of blockchains and blockchain technologies to maximize the value of distributed ledgers, smart contracts, digital assets and self-sovereign identity between businesses, across industries and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hybrid networks, which combine the capabilities of private and public blockchains, can deliver a number of advantages, including high levels of scalability and performance, and provide the right balance of security, privacy and transparency. The private blockchain offers secure, permissioned data storage—an essential feature that’s particularly crucial for highly regulated industries. Meanwhile, the public blockchain brings scale and immutability, enabling a more open and transparent ledger.</p>



<p>As part of our spotlight on #HyperledgerHybrid, we’ve compiled a sampling of production deployments and solutions leveraging Hyperledger technologies to deliver value across a mix of permissioned and public chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain for Energy</p>



<p>Energy industry consortium, <a href="https://www.blockchainforenergy.net/">Blockchain for Energy</a> has launched a new decentralized and interoperable platform powered by <a href="https://www.kaleido.io/">Kaleido</a> and leveraging <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/firefly">Hyperledger FireFly</a>. The B4E Network &amp; Platform allows energy companies to access proven solutions and build applications that leverage Web3 constructs including smart contracts, digital assets, NFTs, and tokenization across both public and private chains. The first production-grade solution released on the new platform is from the B4E Commodity Transport Program, a collaborative effort led by Pioneer Natural Resources, that utilizes IIOT and blockchain technology to track chemical deliveries.</p>



<p>IPwe Digital Assets</p>



<p>In September 2022, <a href="https://www.casperlabs.io/">Casper Labs</a> and <a href="https://ipwe.com/">IPwe</a> developed and launched a dynamic NFT blockchain solution, IPwe Digital Assets. The solution uses the permissioned distributed ledger technologies of open source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> and the public Casper Blockchain to securely store verified public and private information about each patent. The integration capitalizes on the data security and trust inherent on a Hyperledger Fabric network and enables Casper to securely bring assets locked on the private ledger to the public chain.</p>



<p>IPwe is now <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/02/02/ipwe-launches-revolutionary-platform-and-deployment-of-25-million-patent-nfts-on-hybrid-casper-blockchain-and-hyperledger-fabric-network">deploying 25 million patent NFTs</a> leveraging the hybrid Casper Blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric network. On top of that, IPwe’s solution includes <a href="https://ipwe.com/smart-intangible-asset-management/">Smart Intangible Asset Management</a> (SIAM), a comprehensive SaaS tool for IP valuation and management that allows enterprises to fully utilize these patent NFTs to transact, manage, and value their IP. This revolutionary implementation of blockchain technology will enable IPwe to bring liquidity to the IP space, where currently approximately 95% of IP assets are not transacted or commercialized</p>



<p>Palm Network</p>



<p>The <a href="https://palmfdn.org/#/network#network">Palm network</a> is an Ethereum sidechain dedicated to selling, purchasing, and trading NFTs that are associated with real-world and digital assets. It is built with <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu">Hyperledger Besu</a> and uses IBFT 2.0 proof of authority (PoA) consensus, with network validators being run by key stakeholders. IBFT 2.0 offers fast transaction speed and free minting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An automated bridge relay service connects payment tokens, like DAI, and NFTs on Ethereum and the Palm network, with bridging contracts deployed on both networks to manage the connection. Fees collected from this bridge are partially used to purchase carbon offsets.</p>



<p>Starling Lab&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/">Starling Lab</a> is a joint effort developed by the USC Shoah Foundation and Stanford University’s Department of Electrical Engineering. The initiative’s goal is to develop a set of tools and principles to be used across non-profit organizations, news outlets, and industry experts to solve challenges when it comes to the uncertainty of the media we see today and our enduring effort to preserve the truth. </p>



<p>Starling provides an open-source, end-to-end framework for the media generation and verification process. The framework consists of three modules: capturing the image, storing the information, and verifying its authenticity. It leverages multiple blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. Each metadata record, such as the caption or photographer byline added by an editor to a photo’s record, is relayed to a Hyperledger Fabric peer for notarization on a private permissioned ledger. Each transaction posted to Hyperledger is recorded on <a href="https://hedera.com/consensus-service">Hedera Consensus Service (HCS</a>) using a hashgraph that rapidly orders and stamps each entry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Global law firm DLA Piper developed its <a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en/about-us/law-and/toko">TOKO</a> tokenization platform to issue non-fungible tokens across asset classes including real estate, fine art, debt and even intellectual property. Toko is a digital asset creation engine to solve inefficiencies in today’s capital markets by using DLTs to distribute, trade and settle transactions rapidly, bypassing the need for trusted third party intermediaries that are both expensive and slow. It is built using the combination of a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric network and the Hedera Consensus Service.</p>

<p>Notice of Intent: DIACC is collaborating to develop and publish the Trust Registries component of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) to set a baseline of public and private sector interoperability of identity services and solutions. During this public review period, DIACC is looking for community feedback to ensure that the conformance criteria is clear and auditable.</p>



<p>To learn more about the Pan-Canadian vision and benefits-for-all value proposition please review the<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf"> Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Overview</a>.</p>



<p>Document Status: These review documents have been developed by members of the DIACC’s<a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/"> Trust Framework Expert Committee</a> (TFEC) who operate under the DIACC controlling policies and consist of representatives from both the private and public sectors. These documents have been approved by the TFEC as Draft Recommendations V1.0.</p>



<p>Summary:</p>



<p>A Trust Registry is a key component of the new and emerging decentralized digital identity architecture. In this decentralized (or Self Sovereign) architecture a Digital Wallet receives Verifiable Credentials from Issuers and then subsequently provides presentations of these Credentials to Verifiers. In this architecture a Trust Registry provides Issuers, Verifiers, Digital Wallets (and their human Holders), and other Trust Registries the information necessary to verify the identity and status of the other parties as well as the authenticity and status of Credentials and Presentations that a Digital Wallet receives and presents.</p>



<p>Invitation:</p>



 
 All interested parties are invited to comment. 
 



<p>Period:</p>



 
 Opens: March 27, 2023 at 23:59 PT | Closes: April 27, 2023 at 23:59 PT 
 



<p>When reviewing the components Conformance Criteria, please consider the following and note that responses to this question are non-binding and serve to improve the PCTF.</p>



 
 Would you consider the Conformance Criteria as auditable or not? That is, could you objectively evaluate if an organization was compliant with that criteria and what evidence would be used to justify that?

<p>Value to Canadians:</p>



<p>The PCTF Trust Registries component will provide value to all Canadians, businesses, and governments by setting a baseline of business, legal, and technical interoperability. The DIACC’s mandate is to collaboratively develop and deliver resources to help Canadian’s to digitally transact with security, privacy, and convenience. The PCTF is one such resource and guides digital identity ecosystem interoperability by putting policy, standards, and technology into practice aligning with defined levels of assurance. The DIACC is a not-for-profit coalition of members from the public and private sector who are making a significant and sustained investment in accelerating<a href="https://diacc.ca/2019/02/26/canadas-digital-identity-ecosystem/"> Canada’s Identity Ecosystem</a>.</p>



<p>Context:</p>



<p>The purpose of this review is to ensure transparency in the development and diversity of a truly Pan-Canadian, and international, input. In alignment with our<a href="https://diacc.ca/principles/"> Principles for an Identity Ecosystem</a>, processes to respect and enhance privacy are being prioritized through every step of the PCTF development process.</p>



<p>DIACC expects to modify and improve these Draft Recommendations based upon public comments. Comments made during the review will be considered for incorporation into the next iteration and DIACC will prepare a Disposition of Comments to provide transparency with regard to how each comment was handled.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/l/cp/0BXjjcnX">Privacy-Enhancing Mobile Credentials Working Group</a> within <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> is working to develop the necessary privacy-related guidance for those organizations issuing, verifying, and developing the technologies to hold digital credentials such as mobile drivers’ licenses (mDL) when in person. This work has been underway since November 2021, and the lessons learned in that time have resulted in the revision of the PEMC WG charter.</p>



<p><a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEMCP/pages/2097569/WG+Charter">Revised Charter</a></p>



<p>The revised charter provides a new Background section to help people new to the space understand the impetus behind the work and a clear description of the target audience for the specifications that this group will produce. The goal of all Kantara Initiative working groups is to be open and accessible to all, and providing a clearer background for the work will enable those new to the space to be more confident when engaging with the group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Purpose and Scope have also been clarified, moving the timeline to its own section with revised dates and offering a bit more detail on both what is in scope and out of scope for our work.</p>



 
 In Scope: Credentials issued by both public sector and private sector issuers are in scope of this document. 



 Out of Scope: Collection, use, and maintenance of identifying attributes by the Issuer are out of scope of this document. Decisions made by an Issuer could be set by policy or regulation regarding what information they collect for the credential itself. 
 



 PEMC Implementors Report 



<p>The next official output of the PEMC WG is the Early Implementors Draft Report. The Implementors Report offers the necessary framing, guidance, and description of appropriate evidence that will allow the PEMC WG to develop the requirements and profiles needed for implementing the best practices described by the PEMC WG. It will also provide much-needed initial guidance for Holders (the people and/or organizations that provide technology to store mobile credentials and support the necessary consent models for its use), Issuers (the people and/or organizations issuing the credentials), Verifiers (those entities that must verify the credential as valid or legitimate).</p>



<p>The goal is to have this report published by the close of Q2 2023.</p>

 About Kantara Initiative and the OpenID Foundation 



<p>Support for the volunteer-led PEMC WG is offered by Kantara Initiative and the OpenID Foundation.</p>



<p>About Kantara Initiative</p>



<p>Kantara Initiative is a global community focused on improving the trustworthy use of identity and personal data. It has multiple working groups that explore innovation, and standardization and develop good practices around the collection, storage, and use of personal identity information. Kantara nurtures thought leadership, and ground-breaking R&amp;D and develops specifications that will create and maintain a trustworthy identity ecosystem. Our working groups concentrate on informing policy and standards on topics as wide-ranging as User Managed Access and Consent Receipts; Privacy-Enhancing Mobile Credentials, and Digital Healthcare Services.</p>



<p>Kantara also runs the world’s leading Identity Assurance programs. These assessment programs uniquely audit companies and their products for conformance against a number of Trust Frameworks, including the National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) 800-63 standards for privacy and security around Identity and the UK government’s Digital Identity &amp; Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF).</p>



<p>Different classes of Identity Assurance Trust Marks are awarded to organizations that meet specific criteria around technical and business expertise. The most complete Trust Mark is awarded for full compliance with technology, business processes, maintenance, and governance for full credential service providers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;More than 50% of Kantara members reside outside the US.&nbsp; Our leadership is committed to low – or no – barriers to participation, and we encourage membership from organizations across all public, private, and non-profit sectors and across all geographies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See<a href="http://www.kantarainitiative.org/"> www.kantarainitiative.org</a> for full details of our work.&nbsp;</p>

   Practical steps for better business decisions using decentralized identity SSI infrastructure

<p>This new ToIP white paper sets out practical steps for better business decisions using decentralized identity SSI infrastructure.</p>



<p>Although this new ToIP white paper, publishing jointly by the ToIP Ecosystem Foundry, Governance Stack, and Concepts and Terminology Working Groups, is entitled <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Decentralized-SSI-Governance-V2.0-2022-01-06.pdf">Decentralized SSI Governance</a>, the focus of the paper is actually on how governance can be used to specify business logic and workflow and hence the contextual validity of what qualified data:</p>



<p>Qualified data: data that comes with assurances, e.g. regarding its provenance and integrity (immutability), such that it qualifies as ‘valid to be used for specific purposes of individual parties’.</p>



<p>In the world of TCP/IP it is argued, any data can be transmitted, whereas SSI is specifically exchanging qualified data that is contextually relevant for decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper first distinguishes between verification and validation — a critical distinction which interestingly challenges traditional identity and verification models. In traditional ID&amp;V workflow, validation comes before verification. For example, at an airport when a traveler presents at passport control, the passport is first scanned to check that it is a valid document, then the border officer will use human and/or machine tools to verify that the traveler presenting the document is also the passport holder.</p>



<p>With SSI, this workflow is reversed. At the time of presenting their credential, the traveler is already verified as being the document holder (for example, using biometric verification and/or zero knowledge proof cryptography). Then the document’s data contents need to be validated as relevant for the purposes of that particular context— in this case, passing over an international border.</p>



<p>The paper lays out the business drivers and business process challenges of changing this logical flow. It shows how the benefits of SSI can be realized by following a clear roadmap at three levels:</p>



 
 Participatory governance for all three roles in credential exchange (holder, issuer and verifier) to set policy for their respective contexts. 



 Automating decision-making based on arguments (business logic). 



 SSI assurance communities that are built on the existing accreditation, certification and audit regimes. 
 



<p>While it is billed as a white paper about governance, it is really a pragmatic guide for business people can make the most of SSI infrastructure, streamline their business processes, and implement new workflows for qualified data. The result is a clear path for transitioning from validation first to verification first, based not on future technological capabilities (although the roadmap proposes tools such as cryptographically enforceable policies for the future), but on existing business and assurance processes.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Decentralized-SSI-Governance-V2.0-2022-01-06.pdf">paper (PDF)</a> is available to read.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>SK Telecom, a leading mobile phone service provider in Korea, is taking a big step forward in terms of user authentication by adopting passkeys for their online users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys are a replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices.&nbsp;Unlike passwords, passkeys are always strong and phishing resistant.&nbsp;They eliminate the need for users to remember complex passwords and the authentication process is much faster.&nbsp;Passkeys are based on FIDO authentication, which is proven to be resistant to threats of phishing, credential stuffing and other remote attacks.&nbsp;</p>



 







 



<p>SK Telecom has introduced passkeys as a means of user authentication to PASS, their identity verification services with over 18 million users.&nbsp;Customers using iOS16 or higher devices can use the passkeys for PASS login, identity verification through PASS, and electronic signature.&nbsp;Depending on the device, user authentication is performed using Face ID and Touch ID.&nbsp;Android users can now use FIDO2 based authentication methods and perform authentication by utilizing screen locks (biometrics, PINs, patterns, etc.) provided by their devices.&nbsp;In the future, SK Telecom plans to make sign-ins with passkeys available to Android users as well.&nbsp;SK Telecom will introduce new user scenarios in a variety of ways to better protect customers’ assets and identity through the introduction of the passkeys.</p>



 


 
 


 



<p>[Passkey Registration Process on SK Telecom PASS]</p>



<p>SK Telecom Developed support for passkeys through cooperation with platform operators, and the FIDO authentication server for processing sign-ins with passkeys was developed by SK Telecom’s own technology.&nbsp;By actively introducing not only PASS but also various services provided by SK Telecom, they hope that many customers who use SK Telecom services will be able to use the service more conveniently and without worrying about security.</p>



<p>This deployment represents a new milestone in SK Telecom’s journey with FIDO. In 2019, during the FIDO Alliance Public Seminar in Korea, SK Telecom reported zero credential stuffing once the company adopted FIDO Authentication for internal usage.&nbsp;They also claimed that their FIDO-based biometric authentication reduced the average authentication time to less than 5 seconds, which previously took more than 30 seconds on average, when the internal users tried logging in with ID and passwords. It is great to see that they continue to innovate and now provide the benefits of FIDO Authentication to the general public.</p>



<p>Through this milestone, many users in Korea will be safe from various threats stemming from passwords, and SK Telecom’s movement as an innovator will have a positive impact on spreading password-less authentication not only in Korea but also globally.</p>



<p>To learn more about SK Telecom, please visit their <a href="http://www.sktelecom.com/en/brochure">corporate website</a>. You can also download the PASS apps by visiting the App <a href="https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/pass-by-skt/id1141258007">Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sktelecom.tauth&amp;hl=ko&amp;gl=kr">Google Play</a>.</p>

<p>Now in a key 18-month window, 1Password plans to ramp up its shift to passkeys in 2023.</p>



<p>Big Tech companies have recently made headlines by pledging to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2022/05/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard/">move away</a>&nbsp;from traditional passwords in favour of a more modern solution: passkeys. But for Anna Pobletts, the advent of passkeys is nothing new.</p>



<p>Two years ago, Pobletts co-founded and was CTO of Austin, Texas-based startup Passage, which focused on making the predecessor to passkeys, an API called WebAuthn, accessible to developers and businesses that were looking to implement passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>In only the second year of its existence, Passage caught the eye of another major player in the authentication space: 1Password, the password manager used by millions and one of Canada’s&nbsp;<a href="https://betakit.com/1password-claims-2-5-billion-cad-valuation-in-new-round-as-investors-rave-about-generational-security-software-business-opportunity/">most valuable</a>&nbsp;tech companies.</p>

<p>Passwordless authentication has the potential to continue to grow in 2023. In any case, the tech giants, Microsoft, Google and Apple in the lead, within the FIDO Alliance, are doing everything to ensure that the adoption happens as soon as possible. To quickly summarize what we had already explained previously, authentication without passwords, or passwordless , has, as its name suggests, the purpose of allowing you to connect to sites and services without passwords.</p>

<p>Until recently, replacing passwords has ranked somewhere between tricky and impossible. Passkeys completely eliminate passwords, and while they won’t end cyberattacks, they represent a far more convenient and secure framework to navigate the digital world. “Legacy frameworks, including some forms of two-factor authentication, depend on a human-readable and shared secret. This makes them highly susceptible to attack and relatively easy to bypass,” explains Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance.</p>

As Shikiar sees it, Twitter could have told users that they’re removing OTP but educating users on passkeys, which are safer and built into Android and iOS devices.</p>

<p>GitHub will begin its official rollout of two-factor authentication for developers who contribute code on the platform, starting March 13. GitHub added that it will support SMS text messages as a second factor, while testing FIDO Alliance passkeys internally to improve the security posture. “It is true that SMS 2FA can be easily phished by hackers as it relies on knowledge-based credentials. But GitHub recognizes these risks and strongly recommends using security keys and TOTPS wherever possible for greater security – [and] will continue to offer SMS for 2FA – which is better than removing the option entirely,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance.</p>

 Nurturing a healthy online community takes personality, purpose, and persistence. <p>In the world of Open Source, it’s well known that products and projects with a healthy, vibrant community withstand the test of time. For some reason, though, in the ever-expanding digital landscape, “community” is a hard concept to understand.</p>cc-by-nd Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO<p>There is an obvious, visible difference between a community and a group of consumers. Talking to users is not the same as collaborating in a community. A community is a group of people with a shared purpose, and cultivating a healthy one demands patience as you help people find their shared purpose, culture, and connection.</p><p>With this post, we aim to demystify the special sauce that makes truly collaborative communities different.</p> Anti-transactional relationship building <p>There are certain behaviours that should be left at the door when doing community work. One is a transactional mindset, where “you scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours”. While this can work, it’s usually in the short-term. While communities are made up of individuals with varying motivations, goals, and personalities, for organisations looking to build community, it’s important to understand the difference between transactional marketing relationships and community driven collaboration.</p><p>Trust and solidarity develop not through transaction, but through collaboration&nbsp;. So, be transparent about your intentions and values, and stay true to your community’s purpose. Authenticity fosters trust, and authentic relationships are not always transactional.</p><p>Staff members who interact with community members on a regular basis need to hone the connection between their own authentic voice and the brand or organisation they’re representing. Their ability to embody the organisational mission and empower other people are key components to a thriving community.</p><p>Example: A community manager might be a little quirky and really into 80s pop music. How do these personality traits show up in relation to their organisation’s mission?</p> Show solidarity <p>Engaging a community involves both honing a voice and helping bridge the gap between organisational intentions and community initiatives. It’s also about ensuring that the culture of the community is inclusive and representative of the people inside&nbsp;it.</p><p>As community members follow the activities of the organisation, so too should the organisation follow the activities of highly engaged community members. Encouraging people in endeavours that take place outside the community’s immediate landscape is a way to find points of overlap. By spotlighting things community members are doing in other contexts, you create both content and engagement for the community more&nbsp;broadly.</p><p>Example: A community manager notices that one of their community members is doing a charity run. How can the community manager call attention to the relationship between what the community member is doing and the community’s mission?</p> Advocacy in Leadership <p>Building a healthy online community is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires dedication and consistent effort to maintain and grow your community. You need people in leadership who are committed to the community and prepared for occasional setbacks or slow periods. This persistence will pay off in the long run as the organisation witnesses the community flourish.</p><p>As with any living organism, online communities grow and change over time. Organisations need to be receptive to feedback and willing to adapt to the evolving needs of community members. This means that detailed roadmaps are difficult to create that cover more than the next few months. However, you can plan in broad brushstrokes some of the ‘tentpole’ initiatives you want to run. Taking a different approach runs the risk of not knowing what the community wants and needs! Instead, find processes to regularly evaluate your strategies and make necessary adjustments.</p><p>Advocates in leadership teams are essential for community work. Community engagement is all about impact and real impact is tricky to measure. It is sometimes impossible to see. What looks like a failed community initiative might actually be the point where everything changed for the&nbsp;better.</p><p>Example: The community team organises a community call, which runs out of steam after a few sessions. The team does a post-mortem, decides to change the focus, agenda and timing. What else could the team try to iterate&nbsp;on?</p> Start Small, Think Long-term <p>To build a successful online community, you need a strong foundation. Begin by assembling a small group of dedicated members who believe in your mission and are willing to invest time and energy into fostering connections. Focus on incremental growth to create a sustainable, lasting community.</p>cc-by-nd Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO<p>Engagement is the lifeblood of any online community. Encourage members to participate by asking questions, sharing stories, and sparking discussions. Be present in these conversations and listen actively to understand the needs and desires of your community members. By making yourself accessible and responsive, you create an environment where members feel seen, heard, and&nbsp;valued.</p><p>Empower your community members to contribute their knowledge, skills, and experiences. User-generated content (UGC) not only enriches the community but also fosters a sense of ownership and belonging among members. Collaborative projects and initiatives can help community members bond and feel invested in the community’s success.</p><p>Example: Your community team runs a 24 hour documentation edit-a-thon. During the event, a translator mentions that she wishes the documentation was in French. How can your community team empower this translator?</p> Conclusion <p>Cultivating a thriving online community requires a delicate balance of personality, persistence, and planning. Remember, the most successful communities are built on strong relationships, which can only be nurtured through time and intention. So, take a deep breath, roll up your sleeves, and get ready to embark on this rewarding journey.</p><p>Co-written with <a href="https://dajbelshaw.medium.com/">Doug&nbsp;Belshaw</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-art-of-community-cultivating-online-connections-738cc90b0a39">The Art of Community: Cultivating Online Connections</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Open AI; Why is Self-Sovereign ID superior to Digital Identity? 



<p>Self-sovereign identity (<a href="https://lionsgate.io/main/">SSI</a>) is a decentralized approach to digital identity management that emphasizes individual control and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investoffshore.com/contact/">ownership</a>&nbsp;over personal data. In contrast, digital identity (DI) typically involves the use of centralized systems, such as those employed by social media platforms, governments, and financial institutions, to manage and authenticate identity.</p>



<p>There are several reasons why SSI is often considered superior to digital identity:</p>



 
 Control: With SSI, individuals have full control over their personal data, including what data is shared, who it is shared with, and for how long. This gives individuals greater privacy and security than with centralized systems where data may be shared or accessed without their consent. 



 Portability: SSI enables individuals to carry their identity with them wherever they go, regardless of the platform or service being used. This allows for greater flexibility and convenience, as well as reducing the need for individuals to create and manage multiple identities across different systems. 



 Interoperability: SSI is designed to be interoperable across different systems and platforms, making it easier to use and integrate with other technologies. This can facilitate the development of new applications and services that rely on identity verification. 



 Trust: SSI is built on trust networks, where identities are verified by trusted parties rather than centralized authorities. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud and identity theft, as well as promoting greater transparency and accountability in identity management. 
 



<p>Overall, SSI offers a more secure, flexible, and user-centric approach to identity management than traditional digital identity systems.</p>







 Open AI; When will W3C make SSI mandatory in browsers? 



<p>As an AI language model, I cannot predict when the W3C will make SSI mandatory in browsers, as this decision is ultimately up to the W3C and its members. However, it is worth noting that the W3C has been actively involved in developing standards for SSI, such as the Verifiable Credentials Data Model, and has created a Working Group dedicated to developing SSI standards. Additionally, several browser vendors, including Microsoft, have already implemented support for SSI in their browsers.</p>



<p>That being said, making SSI mandatory in browsers would require significant buy-in from both browser vendors and the wider web development community, as well as careful consideration of the potential impact on user privacy and security. It is possible that we may see more widespread adoption of SSI in the coming years as the technology matures and its benefits become more widely recognized, but it is difficult to predict exactly when or if it will become mandatory in browsers.</p>







 Open AI; When will SSI reach adoption? 



<p>The adoption of SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) is a complex process that depends on several factors, including technological development, regulatory frameworks, industry standards, and user acceptance. While SSI is still in its early stages, there are several promising developments that suggest it may see increasing adoption in the coming years.</p>



<p>First, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of digital identity and the need for more user-centric approaches to identity management. SSI is seen as a solution to many of the issues associated with traditional identity management systems, including privacy concerns and data breaches.</p>



<p>Second, there has been significant progress in the development of SSI technologies, including the emergence of decentralized identity networks, such as Sovrin and DID (Decentralized Identifier) systems, which are based on open standards and provide a framework for interoperability between different SSI systems.</p>



<p>Third, several major players in the technology industry, including Microsoft and IBM, have already begun developing and implementing SSI solutions, which suggests that the technology is gaining traction in the enterprise space.</p>



<p>Finally, there has been increasing interest from regulators and policymakers in exploring the potential of SSI to improve identity verification processes and protect user privacy.</p>



<p>While it is difficult to predict exactly when SSI will reach widespread adoption, there are clear signs that the technology is gaining momentum and is likely to play an increasingly important role in the future of digital identity management.</p>







 Open AI; Is SSI good for KYC? 



<p>Yes, SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) can be an effective solution for KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements in industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.</p>



<p>Traditionally, KYC has been a time-consuming and costly process for businesses, requiring the collection of extensive personal information from customers and often involving manual verification procedures. SSI can streamline this process by enabling individuals to share only the information necessary for KYC purposes, while still maintaining control over their personal data.</p>



<p>By using verifiable credentials, which are based on cryptography and distributed ledger technology, SSI systems can provide a secure and tamper-evident record of identity information, which can be easily verified by businesses and other third parties. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud and identity theft, while also improving the efficiency of KYC processes and reducing costs for businesses.</p>



<p>In addition, SSI can also provide benefits for individuals, such as greater privacy and control over personal data, as well as the ability to carry their identity with them across different services and platforms.</p>



<p>Overall, SSI can be a valuable tool for businesses looking to comply with KYC requirements, while also improving the customer experience and enhancing data privacy and security.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce the availability of certification tests for both <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-security-profile.html">FAPI 2.0 Security Profile Implementers Draft 2</a> and the upcoming first <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-message-signing.html">Implementer’s Draft of FAPI 2.0 Message Signing</a>.</p>
<p>The FAPI Working Group has taken many of the learnings from FAPI 1.0 and also formulated an attacker model, producing a second iteration of FAPI that is simpler and easier to use but still meets the security goals. You can learn more about the <a href="https://openid.net/2021/12/14/what-are-the-differences-between-fapi-1-0-and-fapi-2-0-and-what-do-they-mean-to-you/">differences between FAPI 1.0 and FAPI 2.0 on our blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The release of these FAPI 2 certification tests is an important next step on the journey to these standards becoming final specifications. The release of the FAPI 2 certification tests follow the <a href="https://openid.net/2022/12/19/fapi-2-0-announcement/">comprehensive security analysis performed and published in Summer 2022</a>. The researchers at the University of Stuttgart, Institute of Information Security led by Prof. Ralf Küsters, Pedram Hosseyni, and Tim Würtele were able to prove the security properties of the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile (formerly known as FAPI 2.0 Baseline). This is a great result and should give implementers of FAPI 2.0 further confidence in the security benefits of implementing the specifications.</p>
<p>Two ecosystem profiles are currently supported for certification – the “plain” FAPI 2.0 specification and a profile of FAPI 2.0 Message Signing for the <a href="https://connectid.com.au/">Australian ConnectID ecosystem</a> (the latter requiring support of the OpenID Connect ‘claims’ parameter).</p>
<p>A significant change in the new FAPI 2.0 tests is that support of OpenID Connect (in particular, the openid scope value and the return of an id_token) is now optional.</p>
<p>Certifications that include DPoP will launch later in the year (beta versions of the DPoP tests are available but are not yet complete and do not yet support some features like DPoP nonces).</p>
<p>Please note a few features of the FAPI 2 specification currently not supported:</p>
 
 RAR 
 HTTP Message Signatures 
 Servers must reject unregistered redirect URLs 
 
<p>These features will be tackled in due course. If you have any current use-cases that rely on these features and are particularly interested in any, please inform the certification team at <a href="mailto:certification@oidf.org">certification@oidf.org</a>. Additionally, the certification team kindly welcomes feedback from all testers on the performance of the tests.</p>
<p>The Foundation also kindly thanks ConnectID for their directed funding contributions to support the development of these FAPI 2.0 conformance tests. This directed funding accelerated the development of these tests for the global community to start using with Implementer’s Drafts, and the importance of these tests to help the FAPI 2.0 family of specifications move towards Final in due course.</p>

<p>The OASIS Board of Directors comprises industry leaders who are integral to the organization’s success. In our Board Member Spotlight Q&amp;A, gain a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.&nbsp;</p> 


<p></p>



      



<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan-sparrell-cissp-csslp-ccsk-038137/">Duncan Sparrell</a>, a seasoned network security evangelist with more than 40 years of expertise in conceiving, developing, and delivering state-of-the art software platforms. A strong advocate for the cybersecurity industry, Duncan was named an OASIS Distinguished Contributor in 2021 for his significant impact advancing open standards and open source projects.</p>



<p>Can you tell us about your current role at sFractal Consulting?<br>I jokingly refer to myself as “Chief Cyber-Curmudgeon,” which is an evasive way of saying that I have retired from a long career as Chief Security Architect at AT&amp;T and am currently channeling my experience into a broad passion for boutique consulting at the intersection of cybersecurity, standards, and software.&nbsp;<br><br>When did you join the OASIS Board, and what inspired you to join?<br>My tenure on the board began in July of 2022. Besides serving on the Executive Committee, I also serve as corporate secretary and chair of the Governance Committee. Since my retirement, I have steadily ratcheted up my involvement in the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2">Open Command and Control (OpenC2)</a> Technical Committee (TC), and I’ve pursued global initiatives like the <a href="https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/">Open Cybersecurity Alliance</a> (OCA) and its <a href="https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE">Posture Attribute Collection and Evaluation</a> (PACE) sub-project, software bill of materials (SBOM), and the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=csaf">Common Security Advisory Framework</a> (CSAF) TC. I’m very honored to have been tapped to serve on the OASIS Board of Directors where I can further this work and broaden my efforts to support developments across the broader standards ecosystem.</p>



<p>What types of skills/expertise do you bring to the board?<br>Claiming to be strong on technical skills is a hard sell at an organization like OASIS, where so many individuals excel in the technical, but my head’s big enough that I’ll still claim a certain expertise. My background is steeped in the development of open source projects built around collaborative software development and securing the cyber infrastructure. I also bring the business perspective to the table. There is often a communications gap between the technical, policy, and business communities; I feel comfortable in all three spaces and can translate across them. Being retired, I am not beholden to any corporate interests, so I feel I can represent what is really best for everyone.</p>



<p>How do you hope to make an impact as a board member during your term?<br>OASIS is member-driven and has well-developed processes for creating standards through consensus. My experience serving on OASIS TCs has imbued my thinking with a notion that innovative work and revolutionary discourse will naturally bubble up from those well-supported communities.&nbsp;It’s my role as a board member to provide stability, sustenance, and encouragement for the spaces within our organization where those processes thrive, and to push the staff and members to think strategically about what will be the OASIS mission in the future. I’m very familiar with the organization, its standards, the challenges it faces, and the energies it channels. I hope to bring this tribal knowledge as a reinforcing influence on a board chock full of talented, visionary, and capable directors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did you first get involved with OASIS?<br>I first got involved through STIX and TAXII while I was still at AT&amp;T and while STIX/TAXII were still U.S. government projects. In the telecommunications world, we’re very interested in both cybersecurity and international standards, and I’ve been involved with that co-evolution since 1980. You can imagine my delight to discover OASIS when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security suggested it as a more open forum for developing STIX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are your thoughts about the OASIS community? What are some of the key aspects of OASIS that sets it apart from other organizations?<br>The OASIS community is extremely functional, but also collaborative and congenial. The OASIS staff and processes facilitate this in ways that other SDOs I’m involved in struggle with. One of the key aspects that both sets OASIS apart and is key to the facilitation I mentioned, is that OASIS is the most transparent.</p>



<p>What excites you about OASIS and why are you passionate about its mission?<br>My worldview has been deeply informed by the work I’ve done in cybersecurity dating back to the first Gulf War. That perspective makes it very difficult not to acknowledge the challenges that loom on our collective cyber horizon. I’m particularly excited about the new avenues of development that OASIS is working on, such as ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), which is a hot topic in corporate boardrooms today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are some reasons why companies, organizations, and individuals should bring their projects to OASIS?<br>OASIS is a fulcrum organization. We are purpose-built to help both enterprise and research initiatives shape their visions into something tangible and robust. People value OASIS because of our framework, which facilitates this development in a way that is extremely functional, but also collaborative and congenial.</p>



<p>Where do you see OASIS going in the future?<br>OASIS already covers a very broad waterfront, and I see it broadening even further. One thing about standards is their impact is largely invisible and occurs long after the development of the standard. OASIS standards like SAML, XACML, and MQTT are the underpinnings of the internet that most people don’t even realize they are using hundreds of times per day. I feel recent standards like STIX and CSAF will have a similar impact over the next decade and will drastically improve the cybersecurity landscape along with the many other cybersecurity standards OASIS is currently developing. I see ESG as the next horizon where OASIS will have a tremendous impact.</p>



<p>What professional accomplishments are you most proud of?<br>If pressed for Cliff’s Notes on my working life, my one highlight per decade would be:</p>



 
 Writing software (back when we literally wrote 1s and 0s in pencil on graph paper) that handled over 1 trillion phone calls. 



 Getting agreement on one worldwide voice coding and packetization standards when I believed I was the only person on the planet that thought we wouldn’t inevitably have separate standards for the U.S. and Europe. 



 Being awarded the U.S. Intelligence Community Seal Medallion for counter-intelligence/counter-narcotics/counter-terrorist efforts that truly made the world a safer place. 



 Being awarded the AT&amp;T Science and Technology award for my early cybersecurity work creating the first Security Operations Center (SOC), a term I coined. 



 Being an early advocate of software transparency and concepts like software bill of materials (SBOM). 



 Being awarded the 2021 <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/members/distinguished-contributors/">OASIS Distinguished Contributor Award</a> for my work in open standards. 
 



<p>What’s a fun fact about you?<br>There’s something in the water, apparently, in my hometown of Scituate, Massachusetts, that provokes its native sons to pursue the time-honored tradition of genealogy. I, too, caught the bug and have now spent an inordinate amount of time charting out the lines that connect my daughters to their Yankee and Scottish ancestors.<br>&nbsp;<br>I enjoy the stories, not just the ‘who begat whom’. Upon meeting at my parents wedding, my one grandmother remarked “My ancestors came over on the Mayflower,” to which my other grandmother replied, “I came over on the New Caledonia.”</p>

<p></p>      Introduction           <p>Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) is a global nonprofit smart mobility consortium. MOBI and our members are creating blockchain-based standards to identify vehicles, people, businesses, and <a href="https://dlt.mobi/trusted-trip/">MOBI Trusted Trips</a> (decentralized identity linked with location into a verifiable trip). We are building a <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">Web3 digital infrastructure</a> (Citopia vinTRAK) for connected ecosystems and IoT commerce. Our goal is to make transportation more efficient, equitable, decentralized, and sustainable, all while preserving the data privacy of users and providers alike.</p>
<p>The Dealer Floorplan Audit (DFA) Pilot using Citopia vinTRAK <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c">zero knowledge</a> proof of location verification is spearheaded by MOBI’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Finance, Securitization, and Smart Contract (FSSC) Working Group (WG)</a> with contributions from Accenture, Altaventure, Amazon Web Services, BMW Bank, CEVT, Connections Insights, CO-OP Financial Services, ConsenSys, D.E. Consulting, DENSO, DMI, Ford Credit, Global Debt Registry, GM Financial, Honda, IOTA, Itochu, National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), Nissan Motor Acceptance Company, On the Road Lending, Orrick, Quant Network, Quantstamp, Reply, RouteOne, Southeast Toyota Finance, Spring Free EV, Stellantis Financial Services, Tezos Foundation, Toyota Industries Corporation, Trade Log, and USAA.</p>
                       Overview of the Pilot and the Problem it Solves           <p>When dealers buy vehicles from manufacturers (OEMs), they finance the purchase with the vehicle as collateral for the loan. To ensure that the collateral is safe, lenders perform audits to verify that the vehicles expected to be at the dealership are actually physically there — hence the name, dealer floorplan audit. If a vehicle is sold, the loan must be repaid under the lender’s terms. This is similar to the housing market where you must immediately pay your mortgage lender if you sell your house. In the housing market, mortgages are repaid out of escrow as part of the sales process. Dealer floorplan loans have no similar escrow process, so lenders currently employ human auditors (usually third party service providers) who provide a trust service to guarantee that their unsold vehicles are on the lot and that the sold vehicles are being paid according to the lender’s terms.</p>
<p>Floorplan auditing requires an extensive amount of manual work as auditors must physically go to dealer lots to count and verify that the vehicles are on the lot or otherwise accounted for. Furthermore, these audits are not done frequently enough to catch all potential errors. Therefore, lenders hold reserves to compensate for the risk, thus increasing the cost of the loans for dealerships.</p>
<p>To this end, MOBI and our members are building a digital infrastructure called Citopia vinTRAK. Auditors can incorporate the technology provided by vinTRAK to significantly improve their auditing process/application by reducing resources while being able to perform secure and privacy-preserving audits at any time and any frequency (with frequencies corresponding to different levels of risk at different dealers). This will eliminate substantial expenses for the lenders — fewer auditing resources, cheaper capital — and therefore lower the costs of loans for dealerships; a win-win.</p>
                     Our Innovative Solution           <p>Modern IT systems allow for the track and trace of connected devices with a big catch — the location of device users (Personal Identifiable Information, or PII) is exposed! Vehicles on dealer lots are filled with sensors that can provide accurate data about the vehicle’s condition, location, and other important information. While it is theoretically possible to use existing vehicle telematics to check location and automate the audit process, doing so potentially reveals customer PII, for example, if the vehicle is sold or loaned to a customer. In addition, each dealer lot may contain vehicles from multiple OEMs that do not share data with each other during the audit. As a result, lenders have continued with manual auditing.</p>
<p>MOBI’s DFA pilot uses Citopia vinTRAK zero knowledge proof of location verification capabilities to confirm the loan collateral without revealing vehicle location or any other data. Vehicle location within or outside a dealer lot at any moment in time can be proven and verified using Zero Knowledge (ZK) cryptography without revealing any clear text information about a vehicle’s location or identity (e.g. VIN number). The only public information required to verify the ZK proof and verification is the geofenced location of the dealership. During the audit process, the vehicle is asked “Are you in this geofenced location?” and the vehicle responds with the proof “Yes/No.” Lenders can vary how frequently the vehicles should generate such proofs in response to the varying levels of risk between different dealers. See Appendix A for ZK proof input/output and generation/verification.</p>
<p>An additional layer of privacy for the technology being demoed is the use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> standards to create <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Citopia Self-Sovereign Digital Twins (C-SSDT)</a>. **A C-SSDT is a Digital Twin (DT) where only the owner/controller has access to the data stored inside the DT and can participate in autonomous transactions.</p>
 
 Vehicle geolocation resides ONLY in the vehicle C-SSDT (MOBI and Lenders do not have access to this data) 
 ZK verification of vehicle location (does not contain specific location or the VIN) resides in both the vehicle and the lender C-SSDTs (MOBI does not have access to this data)** 
 
<p>Together, these technologies enable the automation of DFA without the messy complications of handling PII associated with vehicles. This DFA pilot is foundational for many track-and-trace applications powered by ZK cryptography. Building on this innovative groundwork, OEMs can monetize connected vehicle data in future applications such as vehicle maintenance traceability, battery cross-border compliance, and usage-based services.</p>
          <p>PILOT STAKEHOLDERS — See (**) above regarding C-SSDT. For this pilot, C-SSDTs are implemented on Citopia cloud.</p>
<p>OEMs: </p>
 
 Create a secure account and self-onboard by creating C-SSDT 
 Onboard vehicles by creating vehicle C-SSDTs (VIN, make &amp; model) and generating secure API endpoints 
 Connect vehicle C-SSDT to vehicle telematics via secure API connection (specifically only near real-time geocoordinate is needed. This data resides in the vehicle C-SSDT and is not shared with MOBI or Lenders) 
 Allow communication between vehicle and Lender C-SSDTs via secure API connection &gt;&gt; Lender C-SSDT asks vehicle C-SSDT “Are you in this geofenced location?” the vehicle responds with the proof “Yes/No” 
 
<p>Lenders:</p>
 
 Create a secure account and self-onboard by creating C-SSDT 
 Provide periodic updated list of dealers and each dealer’s geofenced location(s) via secure API connection 
 Provide periodic updated list of vehicles (VIN numbers) for each dealer via secure API connection 
 Set vehicles’ ZK proof of location requirements for each dealer (e.g. ping vehicles 1-24 times a day) 
 Set vehicles’ ZK proof of location report for each dealer (e.g. once every 1-3 days) 
 
           Pilot FAQ           <p>Our focus for phase 2 of the DFA pilot is to use in-vehicle telematics (specifically only near real-time geocoordinate is needed). As stated above, this data remains in the vehicle C-SSDT and is not shared with MOBI or Lenders. If you have questions, please contact <a>griffin@dlt.mobi</a>.</p>
<p>1. Why is near real-time geocoordinate data needed for this DFA pilot?<br>
To generate ZK proof of location verification with PII and data privacy. The proof does not contain clear text information about vehicle location or VIN, therefore vehicle location is not shared with MOBI or Lenders.</p>
<p>2. What are the required in-vehicle telematics attributes?</p>
 
 VIN 
 Latitude and longitude within at least 5 decimal (approx 1.11m) degrees accuracy 
 Timestamp in UTC (date and time) 
 
<p>3. What frequency of vehicle geolocation data is needed?<br>
Maximum once/hour. Vehicle exact geolocation remains in the vehicle C-SSDT. Lenders receive the ZK proof and MOBI and Lenders do not have access to vehicle C-SSDT.</p>
<p>4. How is vehicle geolocation data shared?<br>
A secured API connection directly to the vehicle C-SSDT. MOBI and Lenders do not have access to or see data.</p>
 
 When an OEM creates a secure account and self-onboard, the OEM C-SSDT is automatically generated in the system 
 OEM onboard vehicles by creating vehicle C-SSDTs 
 Vehicle C-SSDTs generate API endpoints for C-SSDT to C-SSDT communication (e.g. Lender C-SSDT asks vehicle C-SSDT “Are you in this geofenced location?” and the vehicle responds with the proof “Yes/No”) Note: See Appendix A for ZK proof input/output and generation/verification 
 Future phases of the pilot may include Dealer and Lender C-SSDTs asking the vehicle C-SSDT for additional telematics and/or sensor data for use in other applications 
 
<p>5. How long is the pilot duration?<br>
Six months.</p>
<p>6. How often does the system need the updated list of vehicles (VIN list)?<br>
Minimum once per day through a secured API connection directly to the Lender C-SSDT.</p>
<p>7. How often does the system need the updated list of dealers and their geofenced location(s)?<br>
Minimum once per month through a secured API connection directly to the Lender C-SSDT.</p>
<p>8. How many vehicles are needed for the pilot?<br>
There is no limit and the more the better. Minimum ten vehicles per dealer.</p>
<p>9. Which ZK proof system was used for this pilot and why?<br>
For this pilot, Lenders are repeatedly pinging Vehicles at regularly defined intervals to request Proof of Location (PoL). As the number of requests for PoLs increases, the number of proofs increases quickly. Moreover, those proofs must be stored, as Lenders must be able to reference them in the future. And they should be fast to verify without heavy compute requirements. Therefore, proofs should be efficient (fast to generate without requiring a lot of storage and compute during proof generation) and succinct (small in size, and, therefore, fast to verify on regular computers/devices).</p>
<p>In light of these requirements, Citopia utilizes ZK-SNARKs (Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) as the ZKP method of choice for vinTRAK ZK Proof of Location. SNARKs are a powerful cryptographic tool that have several advantages over other types of ZKPs for this use case due to the following key factors:</p>
 
 SNARKs are private and trustless. SNARKs enable the verification of computations without trusting any third-party or revealing any information about the private inputs used in the computation. This makes them useful in situations where the privacy of the inputs is important, such as in financial transactions or in sensitive data processing (such as geolocation). 
 SNARKs are scalable. SNARKs enable the verification of large computations with very low computational overhead. This is because the proof generated by a SNARK is very small (on the order of a few hundred bytes) and can be verified very quickly (on the order of milliseconds). This makes SNARKs suitable for verifying computations on large-scale systems, such as blockchain networks, where scalability is a critical concern. 
 SNARKs are efficient. SNARKs are computationally efficient, meaning that they can be generated and verified using relatively low computational resources. More specifically, SNARKs have an O(N*logN) proving time and O(1) verification time. This makes them useful in situations where computational resources are limited, such as in low-power devices or in resource-constrained environments. 
 
<p>Overall, SNARKs offer computational efficiency, strong security, and privacy, making the approach a valuable tool for those handling sensitive or valuable data like geolocation or other PII.</p>

There wasn’t a week going by without news of AI-enabled tools that create sophisticated content from basic human prompts, major advances in biometrics, robotics or extended reality tech, and other viral stories from the sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as the tech industry’s impact has become more significant, it has become consequently difficult to tell which of these innovations are truly groundbreaking and which will be passé soon, which are the harmless and the more worrisome advancements within the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at The Engine Room are no stranger to this complexity: we have been helping activists navigate the nuances of digital systems for over a decade now. One key area that tends to almost always come up in our analysis revolves around the “sustainability costs” of these emerging systems. How much will digital tech cost us in the long run, both in a financial and philosophical sense? What are the unintended environmental, social and political consequences of such systems going mainstream? What kind of labour relationships fuel innovation? Who really maintains the success of the industry? And how is this division entrenching historical inequalities?&nbsp;</p>



 The sustainability costs of innovation 



<p>When we look at the evidence, it is increasingly clear that emerging tech systems and internet technologies are very resource intensive. Our own <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TER-Final-Report-07-07-22.pdf" title="">research</a> at The Engine Room has shown that corporate data centres have high energy needs, algorithmic models are data hungry and often built on exploitative labour relations, while the production of smart devices requires excess mineral extraction. To illustrate, the emissions generated by large-scale language models are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243" title="">reportedly the same</a> as the emissions of five cars, <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SustAIn_Magazine_2022_EN.pdf" title="">underscoring</a> how heavily AI systems rely on the exploitation of our natural and social resources.</p>



<p>And yet, the popular attitude in the tech industry (and adjacent sectors) is to continue prioritising high energy interventions –regardless of whether more efficient options are available or not. Facebook and Google famously tried to <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html" title="">use drones and high-altitude balloons to connect remote regions to the internet</a>, even though the <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/the-life-and-death-of-snet-havanas-alternative-internet/" title="">shadow internet in Cuba</a> and the <a href="https://firn.genderit.org/research/cultivating-feminist-community-network-reflections-practices-quilombo-ribeirao-grandeterra" title="">community networks in Brazil</a> have proven that low-tech alternatives are often more sustainable, affordable, efficient and resistant to disruptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what are some of the ways to push back on the notion that innovation should be prioritised by all means? How can we continue experimenting with technology’s liberatory potential, without sacrificing too much?&nbsp;</p>



 Low-tech solutions to high tech problems 



<p>Recognising the importance of a sustainable digital future, <a href="https://aisustainability.cargo.site/" title="">more and more activists are calling</a> for a low-tech/degrowth mindset that prioritises simplicity and durability over scale and fanciness. The degrowth movement is not a product of the digital era: the 1970s already saw growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful" title="">critique</a> of modern technology’s depletion of resources like fossil fuels, with many advocating for locally affordable, efficient technologies. Since then, the term ‘low-tech’ has become mainstream across different sectors, as a way to describe sustainable, accessible, responsible and ethical approaches to innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how do these principles translate into every-day decisions for the makers and users of digital solutions?</p>



<p>There are a number of inspiring approaches and conceptual frameworks in emerging tech that prioritise degrowth. Some of the more promising examples include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.pikselkraft.com/en" title="">Low-energy approaches to web design</a> that are fully adapted to users’ needs without any technological or functional surpluses 



 <a href="https://www.ursi.org/files/RSBissues/RSB_339_2011_12.pdf" title="">Long-range wifi networks</a> that increase access and narrow the digital divide without the burden of costing too much 



 <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/01/how-sustainable-is-a-solar-powered-website.html" title="">Solar powered web hosting and data centres</a> that experiment with renewable energy sources in order to create resource-efficient content 



 <a href="https://library.theengineroom.org/01-tool-reuse-open-contracting/" title="">Reusable, open source and easy-to-maintain code</a> that can alleviate the costs of technological development 



 <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SustAIn_Magazine_2022_EN.pdf" title="">Sustainable AI practices</a>, and more 
 



<p>For those who want to learn more about environmentally conscious web development, I highly recommend a deep dive into the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BhGaPrfJ4l0m6NM0C0l6xXCRD5vo3l4GMMCYp0Vc2Vw/edit?pli=1#" title="">Web Environmental Sustainability Guidelines</a>, a collaboratively written document that provides helpful prompts and resources. To illustrate, here are some of the questions that one can ponder before developing or deploying a particular technology:</p>



 
 What is the overall carbon footprint of this tech solution? Is it possible to decarbonize by detecting carbon leaks.? (<a href="https://www.greenframe.io/#features" title="">GreenFrame</a> and others offer open-source solutions that can help with that.) 



 How long is this application trying to “retain’ users and keep their attention, thus increasing their energy consumption, and causing <a href="https://ledger.humanetech.com/" title="">other significant harms to their mental </a>health? Are we making it easy for people to find the information they need, or are we trying to keep them hooked on our tech? 



 How much data does this tech collect? Only what is needed to improve the experience of the people using it? Or are we collecting excess information that will require energy-intensive data centres, while <a href="https://responsibledata.io/" title="">raising other concerns as well</a>?&nbsp; 



 Are we using large visual files and complicated design features? Or are we prioritising simplicity, access and sustainability in our visual approach?&nbsp; 
 



 Get in touch!&nbsp; 



<p>These are just some of the many questions we can ask ourselves when thinking about the longer term sustainability of digital innovation.</p>

<p>An interview with Jessica Fjeld, Lecturer on Law &amp; Assistant Director of the Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;&nbsp;Society</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Christina @ wocintechchat.com</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>.<p>OpenAI, creator of text generator ChatGPT, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-openai-cost-regulations/672539/">started out as a nonprofit</a> in 2015 but became a “capped profit” entity a short three years later. This week, the release of their GPT4 product has swept the news cycle with debate of its ability to analyze and describe visual&nbsp;content.</p><p>But the companies responsible for generative AI are just that: companies. Companies must turn a profit eventually, which makes the outcome of concurrent intellectual property disputes around generative AI incredibly important. This is why I wanted to interview Jessica Fjeld, whose legal practice is focused on supporting the work of creatives, archivists, and advocates, especially as it intersects with emerging technology and debates around topics like intellectual property but also equity and inclusion. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/12/when-ai-can-make-art-what-does-it-mean-for-creativity-dall-e-midjourney">Across the world</a>, people who study the ownership, governance, and power of emerging technology companies are concerned about the power of generative AI to displace artists and creative workers. Now is the time to discuss the potential devaluing of creative work and the unique skills and vision of artists in the labor market through machine learning appropriation and reproduction.</p><p>Fjeld is a Lecturer on Law and the Assistant Director of the Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University. She is an accomplished poet whose legal practice focuses on supporting creatives as their work intersects with emerging technology. We sat down to discuss intellectual property in the context of the rise of generative AI.</p><p>Krista Cezair: Generative AI, like ChatGPT, has been predicted to displace poets, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04397-7">writers</a>, and artists. One novelist asks, “Can ChatGPT <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/can-chatgpt-write-a-better-novel-than-i-can/2023/02/11/e7f3d0c4-aa0e-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html">write a better novel</a> than I can?” Are these fears&nbsp;valid?</p><p>Fjeld: I’m not worried about generative AI replacing artists and writers. I think we’ll find ways to manage&nbsp;it.</p><p>Using photography as an example, my artist friend explained that when the camera was invented, most art schools devoted a lot of time to teaching people to paint in photorealistic styles. With the advent of the camera, there were worries about whether this meant the end of painting. But when art schools stopped teaching with the emphasis on photorealistic painting, it gave us abstract painting, a meaningful cultural advance. But for the upheaval of the camera, we wouldn’t have&nbsp;it.</p><p>Similarly, the skill of initially drafting will become less important, and the skills of editing and topic selection will become more important. Fundamentally, these algorithms are recombinatory. They’re not novel. They’re not innovating. They’re just producing raw material.</p><blockquote>They’re not novel. They’re not innovating. They’re just producing raw material.</blockquote><p>Cezair: If your poems were used as training or seed data, and then something was produced in the style of your work, would you expect attribution?</p><p>Fjeld: Yes, I think so, and that aligns with contemporary practice. When people are integrating elements of other works or inspired by a particular poem, you see captions at the top of poems that say “after so-and-so” or acknowledgment sections in the backs of books that cite other&nbsp;texts.</p><p>I fundamentally trust people and think that they’ll do the right thing if they’re given appropriate guidance. Ethically, that is the practice in most domains, and to the extent that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a> has a future in legislation or otherwise becomes enforceable through law, we’ll see it even as a kind of social best practice. It’s reasonable to&nbsp;expect.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@bamagal?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">"My Life Through A Lens"</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>.<p>Cezair: That makes sense, especially with your theory about how fears would be overblown right now as we start to use this technology. Would it be fair to say that you think that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-ai-regulation">regulation of generative AI</a> should be at a more local level, like within a contract, rather than at the more systemic state or federal&nbsp;level?</p><p>Fjeld: I think it’s very tempting, especially when we have revolutionary technologies — “disruptive technologies” to use the Silicon Valley term — to start to think about regulating them technology by technology because we’re worried about the change brought up by that technology. But in general, I think the most impactful regulation has to do with a harms-based approach.</p><p>In the copyright infringement context, we already have the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/getty-images-lawsuit-says-stability-ai-misused-photos-train-ai-2023-02-06/">Getty and Stable Diffusion lawsuit</a> brought by three artists. So, I think we’ll see that existing framework begin to deal with these new technologies. Copyright also had a hard time with the camera. Photographs came to be recognized as copyrightable after the courts realized they required originality and creativity to produce. The challenge here isn’t exactly parallel, but it will be similar to see courts grapple with how these technologies implicate copyright.</p><p>Cezair: Again, it shows that you have faith in humans and our already-built structures to be able to manage these very human-made creations. My final question is about this copyright idea and if it’s found that working artists don’t own the intellectual property of the product of what was trained on their work. Do you think that this ownership scheme reifies current power structures that devalue the labor of working artists who are <a href="https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/Artists_and_Other_Cultural_Workers.pdf">disproportionately of a lower socioeconomic status</a> than other professional workers in favor of corporations and capitalist hegemony?</p><p>Fjeld: Yeah, it’s a great question, and it’s worth recognizing the work of scholars like <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/caelj36&amp;div=29&amp;id=&amp;page=">Anjali Vats</a> and others who have routinely and persuasively pointed out that even the existing copyright laws themselves have often been used in ways to reify existing racialized and economic power structures. You see the use of copyright law in music to devalue the work of Black musicians and to allow sampling of their works by white musicians.</p><p>Something that’s kind of interesting that I haven’t seen people thinking about yet is the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/robin-thicke-pharrell-williams-blurred-lines-copyright-suit-final-5-million-dollar-judgment-768508/">Blurred Lines case</a> in music copyright. In that case, Marvin Gaye’s estate won a judgment against Robin Thicke for a song that copied the feel or groove of Marvin Gaye’s original. If an algorithm is prompted by typing in, “I want something in the style of Krista’s work,” there could be an expansion of that type of case law to say there’s liability for this as a derivative work because it captures the overall feel of her&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>It’s also important to remember that the creativity that goes into making these types of software programs is valuable and that those people should have rights,&nbsp;too.</blockquote><p>It’s also important to remember that the creativity that goes into making these types of software programs is valuable and that those people should have rights, too. And so, we want to reward the artists who are contributing to social progress through all of the important work they’re doing, and we also want to reward the technologists.</p><p>There are good guys on the tech side,&nbsp;too.</p><p>Cezair: Thank you. That’s a fantastic note to end&nbsp;on.</p><p>So, Fjeld fundamentally trusts us. She trusts us to apply existing structures and frameworks to new problems that arise from disruptive technologies. She trusts us to be honest about our use of generative AI. And she trusts us to protect those of us who would otherwise be exploited by this technology. But I wonder how much that optimism should be tempered with caution. Technological advances that implicate the skills of laborers have not been kind to people who are already subordinated in the American workplace, like people of color, women, and people with disabilities.</p><p>Recalling the Anjali Vats example, we see that the work of these kinds of marginalized groups is often already diminished even without the convenience of disruptive technologies to use to perpetuate that discrimination. As Fjeld’s discussion makes clear, technology outpaces law. I argue that particular regulatory attention must proactively be paid to artists and creative workers, themselves an underpaid class, and especially to those who exist at the intersection of other subordinated classes to guard against their further subjugation in response to the proliferation of generative AI.</p><p>Krista L.

Chan School of Public&nbsp;Health.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/devalue-or-defend-generative-ai-artists-and-the-law-7b5f514ff822">Devalue or Defend: Generative AI, Artists, and the Law</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/accelerators/cyber-cloud/"></a>The <a href="https://digitalscot.net/accelerators/cyber-cloud/">Cloud Accelerator</a> will help connect Scottish startups to global partners and new markets, and build an IP base that helps cultivate and fast-track new ventures. 
 The sector opportunity is simply massive. The global cloud computing market size is forecast to grow to $1,240.9 billion by 2027. 
<p>Scotland is well positioned to carve out a significant niche within this vast market. A number of Scottish companies have developed world-class intellectual property and innovative solutions that have global scale revenues potential.</p>
 Cloud Cover IT 
<p>Cloud Cover IT, an Microsoft solutions partner based in Glasgow, offers an exemplar blueprint for how Scottish tech businesses can develop global scale products.</p>
<p>Their core business is consulting and services work, and they have leveraged those capabilities to also build SaaS (Software as a Service) products, notably ‘<a href="https://www.checkitteams.com/">Check IT</a>‘ and ‘<a href="https://www.gaugeitteams.com/">Gauge IT</a>‘.</p>
<p>SaaS businesses are massively more scalable than services-based models, easily saleable online to customers worldwide versus labour-intensive client facing work, and that are extremely profitable and cash flow generating. But they can prove very expensive and time-consuming to build and launch, and so conceiving them as a consequence of your regular services capability is a super smart boot-strapping strategy.</p>
<p>Built as a Microsoft Teams app, Check.it works seamlessly on desktop and mobile, allowing users to keep up to date with tasks and update team members on their progress from any location. Similarly Gauge.it is a Teams-based app which makes it easy to track employee morale, allowing leaders to identify and address potential issues.</p>
 CirrusHQ 
<p>Similarly CirrusHQ, based in Livingstone, specializes in AWS and provides consulting services, and has also repeated this approach to also launch their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cirrushq.com/solutions/cirrushq-acuity/">Acuity Platform</a>.</p>
<p>Aggregating data across AWS accounts, the Acuity platform streamlines and democratises access to the AWS platform and provides a customised graphical dashboard enabling customers to simply manage their AWS accounts and workloads from one single place.</p>
<p>With cost optimisation being a key advantage of the cloud’s capabilities, Acuity provides CirrusHQ customers with oversight of their entire AWS estate, highlighting insights which might otherwise be missed, such as illustrating savings which can be made by moving workloads or reducing bills by eliminating unused or idle resources.</p>
 Cloudsoft 
<p>Edinburgh-based <a href="https://cloudsoft.io/">Cloudsoft</a>&nbsp;is an Advanced AWS Consulting partner, delivering <a href="https://cloudsoft.io/services/aws-services-in-scotland">AWS services to customers across Scotland</a>&nbsp;and beyond.</p>
<p>Recent innovations includes&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudsoft.io/blog/aws-launch-partner-for-service-management-connectors-for-servicenow">their news</a> they were named as an AWS Launch Partner for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/aws-service-connector-servicenow-aws-catalog-appregistry/">AWS’s Service Management Connector for ServiceNow&nbsp;</a>, which enables ServiceNow end users to provision, manage, and operate AWS resources natively from ServiceNow.</p>
<p>AWS Service Management Connector benefits from high adoption levels, supporting millions of resources per year for global telecoms, aviation, and oil and gas organisations.</p>
 Ionburst 
<p>Other notable startups include <a href="https://ionburst.io/">Ionburst</a>, an Edinburgh-based software solution that provides data defence-in-depth for any digital assets anywhere.</p>
<p>Customers of all sizes and industries can use Ionburst Cloud to securely store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as cloud and secrets storage, web and mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, and enterprise applications.</p>
<p>Ionburst also specializes in AWS Cloud services, recently participating in the <a href="https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2022/june/17/220617-royal-navy-stormcloud">StormCloud Community</a>, supporting the Royal Navy and British Defence to bring cutting-edge, cloud based technology to the frontline.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>In the USA equivalent companies enjoy $ hundreds of millions in funding and grow to $ billions in revenues.</p>
<p>While Scotland may not have that scale of venture capital we match the same level of engineering expertise and resulting product innovation, and thus have the foundations to build upon to reach for the same levels of success.</p>

<p>by Scott S. Perry, CPA, CISA<br>Principal, Crypto and Digital Trust Services<br>Schellman</p>







<p>Back in 2021, members of the Trust Over IP Foundation took on a monumental task.&nbsp; An august set of passionate cyber technologists (including me, who plays at it) set out to create design principles for its innovative Internet architectural model where trust and digital identity can be layered onto online transactions for greater transactional confidence and authenticity.</p>



<p>Within this effort, the group plummeted into a deep dive focusing on what are the key principals driving human trust and the factors in enacting decisions based on trust.&nbsp; I believe this effort was groundbreaking, and I fear this portion of a technical white paper will get lost without the effort to raise the topic to more prominence.&nbsp; In this paper, I hope to summarize and elevate the topic of human trust principles and the factors we humans employ in making decisions based on trust.</p>



<p>From the Oxford dictionary, trust is defined as the “firm belief in the reliability, trust, ability or strength of someone or something”.&nbsp; All of these are human constructs to measure and apply.&nbsp; This makes the concept of trust, with so many variables in play, more of an art rather than science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-01-17.pdf">Design Principles</a> identified the following human trust principles as headings in this essay.&nbsp; The principles create the fabric in which we make decisions to trust something or someone.&nbsp; I’ll explore each one.</p>



 Trust is Human 



<p>Trust can be achieved with only a few data points or volumes of input.&nbsp; While we can artificially program computers to “trust” using rule sets and decision trees, the full embodiment of trust has too many variables to be programmed holistically.&nbsp; Humans use data, but they also use instincts and emotion to drive their trust decisions, characteristics which are difficult to program.&nbsp; The ingredients of trust are human concepts: belief, experiences, propensity, tolerance, and fear.&nbsp; It is said that human life is a compilation of decisions.&nbsp; Many of these decisions involve trust.</p>



 Trust is Relational 



<p>In the Oxford definition, trust is the state of reliability, truth, etc. about someone or something.&nbsp; That requires a relationship between the trustor and the object of trust.&nbsp; Those objects are in two broad categories: parties(people) and things.&nbsp; Trust is based on an unlimited number of conditions and experiences, some of which we cannot define verbally or objectively (or sometimes even consciously). Human trust can be vague and subjective, yet it is adaptable enough to consider conditions that are not yet known. It can also change over time—trust in people and things can be built up over multiple interactions and then eroded or destroyed by a single action.&nbsp; But it is all within the trustor over their relationship with the trusted person or object.</p>



 Trust is Directional 



<p>In the unaccounted number of trust decisions taking place in the world as you read this, each single trust action takes place in one direction.&nbsp; While the earlier principle identified there is a relationship between the trustor and the object of trust.&nbsp; That relationship is always one way, a human trustor applies trust to a party or thing.&nbsp; Trust can be bidirectional, but each trust action is one way and separate and nondependent on each other.&nbsp; Now that we have the two atomic principles for trust, we can build upon these elements using the next principles.</p>



 Trust is Contextual 



<p>In the world of digital trust, context is king.&nbsp; But what is context?&nbsp; Our friends at Oxford define context as “the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement or idea and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed”.&nbsp; Think of context as its own mini metaverse, with a singular focus on all the factors that contribute to a specific trust decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to direction, context may need to be broken down to a point where it cannot be parsed any further.&nbsp; For example, a parent might not trust a teenager to help with all tasks in a household but may trust her to babysit his four year-old.&nbsp; That trust is predicated on the teenager passing an American Red Cross babysitting course and the parent supervising the babysitting for two two-hours sessions without incident.&nbsp; If we change the context to assistance in fixing the family minivan, alternative evidence is needed to trigger the parent to trust the teenager for that context such as experience and a high-school car maintenance class.&nbsp; Therefore, trust is not triggered for all decisions, each context is taken individually.</p>



 Trust Has Limits 



<p>As we have seen that context may need to be segmented in order to be properly applied, the degree of trust is neither infinite nor needs to be for a trust decision to be enacted.&nbsp; The question is what are the factors required for a person to make a trust decision within a given context?&nbsp; The secret is within traditional risk analysis using the concepts of risk tolerance, confidence intervals and assessed risk determined from factors of likelihood of occurrence and severity of outcomes.</p>



<p>Risk tolerance is defined as the standard level of risk and uncertainty innate to the risk taker based on experience and biological factors.&nbsp; How much of a “risk taker” are you? How did you establish that stance?&nbsp; Was it through previous risky decisions that went right or wrong?&nbsp; Have you always been willing to take risks that others will not?&nbsp; How attuned are you to learn from others’ risky decisions to make your own?&nbsp; All these factors set a personal risk tolerance level that is imprinted within trust decisions we make in our daily lives.&nbsp; That is why, given the same information and experience, two people could make different trust decisions within a given context.&nbsp; The following diagram illustrates this point.</p>







<p>The trust trigger area is a continuum when a given set of experiences, transactions, and other human perceptions combined with a person’s risk tolerance will cause an individual to take a trust action.&nbsp; The amount of information needed is not infinite.&nbsp; As the amount reaches B, we start experiencing “analysis paralysis” where the need to gather more information outweighs the utility of making a trust decision.&nbsp; At the limit, we don’t act.&nbsp; Where do you place yourself in the trust trigger continuum for trust decisions you’ve made?</p>



<p>Confidence level is the surety of making an appropriate trust decision at the time of its trigger. This level considers the likelihood of it being the wrong decision and the totality of that wrong decision’s effect on the context.&nbsp; Typically, higher consequence trust decisions take more confidence and information to trigger a decision.&nbsp; For example, typically we require deep analysis of budget, locations and features to trigger a home purchase; it takes nanoseconds to trigger an action to cross the street.</p>



<p>As we have seen that there are limits to the amount of information we need to trigger a trust decision, there is a limit to the amount of confidence we have in that decision when we make them.&nbsp; No trust decision delivers absolute assurance so what confidence do we need to trigger trust decisions?</p>



<p>In the audit profession, attestation reports cite that reasonable assurance is applied to auditor opinion letters.&nbsp; That level equates to a 95% confidence level for illustrative purposes.&nbsp; The amount of effort in reviewing and analyzing evidence to assert more confidence is not cost-effective. Relying parties have accepted the 5% risk understanding the costs.&nbsp; This applies to individuals making trust decisions.&nbsp; The confidence level in triggering a trust decision considers, risk likelihood/severity, time, availability of evidence and the person’s risk tolerance.&nbsp; This equates to a reasonable level of assurance perceived by the trustor at the time of making that trust decision.</p>



<p>The final attribute of the limits of trust is the time horizon.&nbsp; Each trust decision typically takes place within a planned time horizon and has a (usually unstated) time window when that trust applies.&nbsp; I may be willing to trust my friend John with my car within the next month; that trust would not extend a lifetime.</p>



 Trust Can Be Transitive 



<p>In our collective society, trust decisions are not solely based on personal experiences.&nbsp; We typically consider the positions of others in which we have developed a trust relationship.&nbsp; Who are these trusted third parties?&nbsp; There are many but in the revolution of social media applied to the global landscape, the term “influencer” has been coined with both positive and negative connotations.&nbsp; Who influences your trust decisions? We may be more inclined to trust the purchase of a skin product because our favorite celebrity endorses it or accept a SOC 2 auditor’s report because Schellman’s name is on the letterhead.&nbsp; We follow clergy’s opinions on a range of faith topics and take our parent’s advice on a place to eat.&nbsp; In these cases, as in mathematics, we are applying our trust decision using the perception of trust we have about a third party’s trust input.</p>



<p>The factors that cause us to rely on third parties are the same principles discussed in this paper. We create our own trust triggers for third parties based on the same concepts of risk likelihood/severity, time, availability of evidence and the person’s risk tolerance.&nbsp; Using transitive trust is likely to be more efficient and can be more effective than without it depending on the reliability of the trust source on the context we are seeking trust.&nbsp; As in all human experiences, some sources are more trustworthy than others.</p>



 Tying the Human Trust Principles Together 



<p>Next time you need to make a decision that has notable downstream consequences, think of the following:</p>



 
 What is the context of the trust decision? 



 What could go wrong if the wrong decision is made? How likely is that to happen? 



 How much information do I need to make the decision? Where can I find that information? 



 What timeframe do I need to make that decision? 



 How long do I need to trust? 



 Are there third parties I can consult to assist in the decision? How can I trust their input? 



 How confident do I need to be when I make that trust decision? 



 What prior experience can I draw from to assist in that decision? 
 



<p>Humans process trust transactions like a bank account.&nbsp; When we make commitments, then execute them to another’s satisfaction, we are building trust.&nbsp; We do this unsuccessfully, we erode trust.&nbsp; Therefore, to become more trustworthy, we need to be transparent and confident when we make commitments and work diligently to achieve them. The more collective trust there is in society, the more transitive trust is available to consider.</p>



<p>As we propagate trust decisions to our digital life, human trust principles will apply.&nbsp; It is our collective responsibility to understand these principles and build trustworthy applications considering that humans will remain on the forefront of their own decision-making process.</p>

<p>Let me start with the difference between the Internet and the&nbsp;web.</p><p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers or devices. The World Wide Web is a collection of information (data) on this network (see&nbsp;<a href="https://sciencerack.com/difference-between-world-wide-web-and-internet/">link</a>)</p><p>That means the web sits on the Internet.</p><p>Typically, web pages are owned and processed by centralised servers so to decentralise data, you might use a blockchain or some equivalent technology to tokenise and track the data between these centralised systems.</p><p>But what if, instead of decentralising data from the central data processing system we decentralise the data processing system&nbsp;itself?</p><p>That’s what a decentralized data server (DDS) is. (It’s also called the <a href="https://hubofallthings.com">HAT</a>). It is a virtual “device” in the cloud ownable by any legal entity – individuals, businesses and governments. The R&amp;D work by Dataswift and 8 U.K. universities brought the price of each of this data server down to less than $3 per&nbsp;year.</p><p>What this means is that data can be stored and processed at any entity’s data server, not just at centralised servers. The data in these server databases are called Self-Sovereign Data (SSData), a special legal and economic class of data that is much safer to use and&nbsp;share.</p><p>Over the years, Dataswift has built “pipes” and “valves” that move SSData between servers based on contracts agreed between parties and recognising where it was originally generated, where it was used and shared without knowing its contents. The Internet now has a new “lane” on its superhighway for SSData. SSData can be produced by one entity, processed by another, shared with another, all moving on this lane safely, securely and speedily. This legal class of data (SSData) can now create&nbsp;markets.</p><p>On top of that Internet layer, you can still have the normal web1, 2 or 3 technologies. The web pages or applications above it can read from multiple data servers, with the right permissions and contracts. And you can still tokenize and chain the SSData if you wish. In fact, decentralized data servers can enable crypto and NFTs to grow and thrive with the creation of data wallets and ecosystem-enabled applications.</p><p>To read more about decentralised data processing, go to this&nbsp;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3570895">link</a>.</p><p>To read more about the market for self-sovereign data go to this&nbsp;<a href="http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/160054/">link</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/how-is-self-sovereign-data-different-from-blockchain-technologies-f915daaa0787">How is Self-Sovereign Data different from Blockchain technologies?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things">Hub of All Things</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
 The Skills Development Scotland ‘<a href="https://digitalscot.net/digital-skills-action-plan/">DESAP</a>‘ report describes the need for Cloud and Cybersecurity skills for Scottish businesses. 
 In particular they highlight: 
 
 Only 3 in 10 businesses are fully equipped with cyber security skills. 
 Only 1 in 3 businesses engage in ecommerce. 
 Only 1 in 5 businesses feel fully equipped with digital technology skills. 
 
<p>In short Scotland is punching well below it’s weight when it comes to our businesses participating in the modern digital economy, and therefore efforts to boost adoption are critical.</p>
<p>Cloud computing, applications and cybersecurity are the building blocks required for this participation, and so developing those skills is the core objective for our digital skills strategy, achieved through delivering the required educational support.&nbsp;Key providers in Scotland include:</p>
 
 The <a href="https://www.abertay.ac.uk/business/cyberquarter/">Abertay Cyberquarter</a>, a new £18m cybersecurity research and development centre housed within Abertay University. 
 Glasgow Clyde College offers an <a href="https://www.glasgowclyde.ac.uk/courses/403498-hnd-cyber-security/2323">HND in Cybersecurity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Robert Gordon a <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/study/courses/430-bsc-hons-cyber-security">Cyber Security BSc</a>. 
 <a href="https://codeclan.com/courses/amazon-aws/">CodeClan</a> delivers bespoke Amazon AWS training and The Skills Academy <a href="https://digitalacademy.gov.scot/courses/microsoft-cloud-training-and-certification/">Microsoft Azure courses</a>. 
 
 AWS re/Start 
<p>An especially important factor is making these courses accessible to key social groups, via fast-tracking route to work pathways. For example:</p>

		 
			 
				<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/">AWS re/Start</a> is a cohort-based workforce development training program that prepares individuals for careers in the cloud and connects them to potential employers. A technology background is not required to apply. The program is free to the learner and focused on helping unemployed or underemployed individuals launching a new career.
			 
		 
	
<p>re/Start is implemented by local partners. In Scotland the first provider is Dundee and Angus College, where <a href="https://dundeeandangus.ac.uk/subject-areas/computing-creative-media/aws-restart/">their course</a> is provided via 12 weeks, online and face-to-face delivery.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Excellent to see our <a href="https://twitter.com/AWS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AWS</a> re/Start programme featured on <a href="https://twitter.com/STVDundee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@STVDundee</a>. Given challenges in the labour market right now &amp; the skills gaps in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/digital?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#digital</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Tech</a>, it's vital that a joined up approach is taken to provide opportunities to upskill/reskill in a focused, responsive way.  <a href="https://t.co/JshIeqq940">pic.twitter.com/JshIeqq940</a></p>

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO, FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahoo! JAPAN is an industry pioneer known for being an early adopter of new technologies to improve the security and usability of its services for its customers. Today, the company is continuing that tradition with its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">adoption of passkeys</a> across Apple’s iOS, iPad OS, MacOS, and Google’s Android operating systems.</p>



<p>“Yahoo! JAPAN is one of the first companies to support passkeys from Apple and Google,” said Yuya Ito, ID Division, Yahoo! JAPAN. “Passkeys solve the usability issues that FIDO authentication has traditionally faced and dramatically improve users’ difficulties in using FIDO authentication. Through these initiatives, Yahoo! JAPAN and the FIDO Alliance will promote the shift away from passwords and the spread of passkeys and contribute to providing more secure and simple authentication on the Web.”</p>



<p>Based on FIDO standards, passkeys are a replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. Unlike passwords, passkeys are always strong and phishing-resistant.​ Passkeys simplify account registration for apps and websites, are easy to use, work across most of a user’s devices, and even work on other devices within physical proximity.​</p>



<p>Passkeys stand to fundamentally shift the way that consumers sign into apps and services across the web and across world, moving away from the burden and vulnerabilities of passwords and OTPs to a fundamentally stronger and simpler approach that allows users to sign in by taking the same action they use to unlock their device dozens of times each day – typically a biometric or local PIN code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Yahoo! JAPAN, more than 70% of its active users use either SMS or <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/yahoo-japans-password-free-authentication-reduced-inquiries-by-25-sped-up-sign-in-time-by-2-6x/">FIDO-based biometric passwordless authentication</a>. With passkeys, Yahoo! JAPAN’s customers can access their FIDO sign-in credentials on many of their devices, even new ones, without having to re-enroll every device on every account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By enabling its users to sign in with passkeys, Yahoo! Japan continues to serve as a leading innovator in Japan and in the FIDO Alliance, where it has played a vital role on the Alliance’s Board of Directors, the FIDO Japan Working Group and other FIDO Alliance bodies.</p>

 Shouldn’t that be… every&nbsp;day? Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>At <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> we often notice how much some of our clients enjoy having meetings with us. Which is weird, right? Who enjoys meetings?</p><p>Meetings can be useful though, depending on a) how the meeting is run and b) why it’s being held in the first place. Many organisations run status update meetings. These can be, sadly, quite boring and disempowering for many in the room. That’s partly because these kinds of meetings adhere ‘status’ to people too. That’s part of what makes them soul-sucking.</p><p>WAO meetings feel qualitatively different. No matter what meeting we’re in, we bring our full selves to work and try to encourage others to let the masks slip away. After all, when we feel comfortable being ourselves, we’re more likely to contribute ideas and collaborate with others. This leads to a more productive and innovative work environment.</p><p>So how do you do&nbsp;this?</p>  Start with a check-in — how’s everyone doing today? Schedule time to allow people to settle in and let everyone else know what’s going on for them. Yes, this might feel awkward at first, but it’s an important norm to get into our working&nbsp;lives.  Use rounds —the norm in meetings seems to be a kind of free-for-all where anyone can speak next. This allows the loudest voices to speak the most, and some people never get to say a word. Instead, try an approach where at some points of the meeting, and particularly at important decision points, everyone gets a chance to speak or&nbsp;react.  Make things visual — holding everything that people have said during the meeting is conceptually difficult. Showing collaborative notes being taken on a screen makes this task easier. It’s even more generative (and fun!) to do it in a visual way using real or virtual sticky&nbsp;notes.  <p>If you’re not in the position where you’re running or organising meetings, then there are still things you can&nbsp;do:</p>  Be honest and transparent — share your thoughts and feelings honestly, even if they don’t align with the expectations or norms of the workplace. Authenticity builds trust and can lead to more productive relationships with your coworkers.  Embrace your unique perspective — everyone has a unique perspective and set of experiences that they bring to the table. Recognise and contribute your unique ideas and insights.  Practise active listening — it’s difficult, but really listening to others and acknowledging their perspectives is key to allowing everyone to be their authentic selves. You can do this by asking questions, demonstrating empathy, and reflecting back what you’ve heard people&nbsp;say.  Set boundaries — while empathy is important, there’s such a thing as being too empathetic. Set boundaries to maintain a work-life balance by prioritising your own needs and communicate them clearly to your coworkers.  Seek out opportunities for growth — “get busy livin’ or get busy dyin’” goes the famous line from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a>. Being your full self also means being open to growth and learning, so seek out opportunities for professional development and take on new challenges that align with your values and passions.  <p>We spend a good chunk of our lives at work, so we might as well spend that time authentically. So, the next time you’re in a meeting or interacting with coworkers, consider ‘taking off the mask’ and showing up as your true self. You may be surprised at the positive impact it can have on your work and your overall well-being!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/bring-your-full-self-to-work-day-7efbaea914f1">‘Bring Your Full Self to Work’ day</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Trust over IP Foundation is forming a new Interaction Patterns Task Force under its Human Experience Working Group. The mission of this task force is to enable consistent, accessible and trustworthy data exchange experiences for all. The task force will accomplish this through the documentation of best practices in design decisions for specific user-focused interactions and enabling both designers and developers to implement such decisions.</p>



 Why 



<p>The experience and security of any system operated by people depends on the information conveyed through user interfaces, the response of the users, and the interpretation of their actions. In the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">Trust Over IP Stack</a> the critical interface for end users is at layer 2, where they interact with ‘wallets’. Existing ‘wallet’ interfaces commonly let technology dictate interaction sequences, default to culturally narrow mental models, and inconsistently represent key objects and functions.</p>



<p>Trustworthy data exchange is a foundational building block in the infrastructure of modern society—for it to function as a public good, it must be available and accessible to all. As such, the digital objects involved should be easy to identify, clearly communicate their boundaries and functions, and demonstrate consistent behaviour within interactions. Interfaces should make it easier for users to understand data exchange interactions and accomplish tasks whilst reflecting unique contexts.</p>



<p>Design principles and best practices, which the Interaction Patterns Task Force will deliver, will provide the guard rails to deliver humane, transparent and consistent software behaviours while allowing for a culturally diverse ecosystem to flourish.</p>



 How 



<p>The intended deliverable is a living repository of resources for the community that articulates clear principles on the social mechanics of trustworthy interactions, highlights existing standards and interaction examples, recommends research-backed best practices and identifies new patterns to unlock novel user experiences.</p>



<p>We intend to work in phases, initially focussing on identifying archetypal user journeys and the interaction patterns associated with the most common use cases. We will then begin to identify patterns transversal across different ceremonies and rituals, cultures, domains and contexts, adapting to differences in user behaviour and interactions across form factors and devices.</p>



<p>In our initial calls, we will be starting with show &amp; tell sessions where group members are invited to walk through product user journeys, beginning to map which flows and actions are most relevant for us to consider. We anticipate repeating this activity periodically, providing an opportunity for a diverse range of voices to share their experience and highlight challenges or positive outcomes in trust infrastructure interaction and user experience design.</p>



 Get involved 



<p>We welcome all experts in the Human Experience Working Group (that’s you), ethical design, consent agreements, social sciences, human-computer-interaction and interaction design.</p>



<p>More details are available at the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Interaction+Patterns+Task+Force">Interaction Patterns Task Force Wiki</a>, where we also store meeting notes and recordings. We meet on the 2nd and 3rd Thursday of each month at 17.00UTC. We report back to the Human Experience Working Group on the first Thursday of every month at 17.00UTC. Meeting details can be found at the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings">Calendar of ToIP Meetings</a>.</p>



<p>We look forward to you joining us!</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/guides/metaverse-future/"></a>When Neal Stephenson coined “the Metaverse”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openculture.com/2021/10/how-neal-stephensons-sci-fi-novel-snow-crash-invented-the-metaverse.html">three decades ago</a>, his book Snow Crash was found on the shelves of science fiction. 
 Fast forward to today and that vision is quickly becoming a modern reality. 
<p>Numerous companies are now building toward their version of the metaverse, including Neal himself, and through early pioneers like Second Life, Roblox, Epic Games and Facebook, and many more.</p>
<p>There are many different ideas for how the Metaverse will come about, featuring technologies ranging from Virtual and Augmented Reality through the Blockchain and AI, and many compelling visions for where it may lead over the coming decades.</p>
<p>Our guide compiles and showcases this wide spectrum of ideas, technologies and ventures, to provide a comprehensive vision of a Metaverse Future, showcasing Scottish innovators pioneering the trend, important use cases for it’s adoption and massive opportunities for new startup ventures.</p>
 Museums in the Metaverse 
<p>One example of this type of trailblazing project is the University of Glasgow’s Museums in the Metaverse project.</p>
<p>As Neil McDonnell tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/nltmcd/status/1636798208213909524">here</a>, the MiM project will create a ground-breaking 2-sided Extended Reality (XR) Culture and Heritage platform, empowering online visitors to explore vast cultural assets in engaging new ways.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/guides/digital-skills/"></a>A key foundation for Scotland’s future digital economy and education policies and infrastructure are Digital Badge ‘Micro-credentials’. 
<p>As <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/higher-education-certifying-your-future/0/steps/213776">FutureLearn describes</a> a Micro-credential is a “Certification of learning that can accumulate into a larger credential or degree, be part of a portfolio that demonstrates individuals’ proof of learning, or have a value in itself.”</p>
<p>They are offered by Education providers like the <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/microcredentials">Open University</a> and <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/study/microcredentials/">Glasgow University</a> among many others.</p>

		 
			 
				
<p>The <a href="https://digitalscot.net/digital-skills-action-plan/">Digital Economy Skills Action Plan</a> from Skills Development Scotland defines a strategy for their implementation:</p>
 
 
 
 “Identify key digital economy skills competencies and aligning and developing micro-credentialed/short courses to address skills needs of employers. 
 Implement&nbsp;micro-credentials based on the Digital Economy Skills Framework which allows individuals to demonstrate their competency.” 
 
 
 

			 
		 
	
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/skillsdevscot/status/1237702387839762432">This tweet</a>&nbsp;from Skills Development Scotland highlights digital badges offer an ideal starting point for modernizing education in such a way it supports the further modernization and growth of skills and employment.</p>
 Route to Work Pathways 
<p>They are especially potent due to their modular nature making them ideal for utilizing them to define a series of steps that constitute and lead to specific job roles. A great example of this is the <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/micro-credentials">PMI offering micro-credentials</a>.</p>
<p>The QAA offers this <a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/quality-code/characteristics-statements/micro-credentials">detailed definition</a>, highlighting:</p>
<p>“Micro-credentials have a key role to play in upskilling and re-skilling the workforce as short, credit-bearing courses that support a learner-led engagement in higher education which could be spread over many years. </p>
<p>Micro-credentials would not normally constitute an award in their own right, but they have standalone value and could also contribute to a recognised qualification. They also widen access to learners who might not have considered a more traditional approach to achieving a qualification, as well as potentially assisting with meeting skills needs for employers and learners.”</p>
<p>Critically:</p>
<p>“While higher education providers have a long history of running short courses, micro-credentials are closely aligned with employability and also offer more structured opportunities for progression which brings new challenges.”</p>
<p>The BCS describes this as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/digital-badging-the-future-of-professional-development/">future of professional development</a>, with many organizations like&nbsp;<a href="https://new.siemens.com/uk/en/company/education/teachers/siemens-digital-badges.html">Siemens</a>&nbsp;using them this way. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.badges.sssc.uk.com/getting-started/what-you-need-to-know-about-open-badges/">Scottish Social Services Council using them</a>&nbsp;to underpin workforce learning.</p>
<p>Writing for the RSA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thersa.org/cities-of-learning/articles-blogs-and-reports/badges-for-jobseekers">Jillian Linton provides</a>&nbsp;a great overview of how badges can help jobseekers stand out from the crowd. This&nbsp;<a href="https://lincs.ed.gov/professional-development/resource-collections/profile-716">Lincs report</a>&nbsp;examines how they are ideal for supporting adult learners, with both combined highlighting how they offer great potential for helping those experiencing difficulty with getting back into the workforce.</p>
 Digital Badges 
<p>Highlighting the enabling role of technology micro-credentials can be implemented and represented through ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_badge">Digital Badges</a>‘.&nbsp;These can enable gamified learning models through to providing a complete framework for a common, industry-wide credential recognition system.</p>
<p>As the&nbsp;<a href="https://raccoongang.com/blog/digital-badges-education-what-are-they/">Racoon Gang describe</a>&nbsp;they provide a modular approach for rewarding achievements and encouraging motivation.</p>
<p>“With digital badges you don’t have to depend solely on exams and other conventional assessment methods. The badges can be associated with everything, including class participation, information retention, attentiveness, positive behavior, etc.”</p>
<p>In his article the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/the-power-of-digital-badges">Power of Digital Badges</a>&nbsp;David Niguidula explains how they can be utilized to define learning pathways, steps of progress required to achieve the badge.</p>
<p>These journeys are often described as “quests”, highlighting the sense of adventurous fun and reward they offer students.</p>
 Vendor Solutions 
<p>A number of vendor options are available for implementing such a system:</p>
 Digitary 
<p>A leader in this space is Digitary. As they write here <a href="https://www.digitary.net/the-value-of-digital-badges-in-the-education-sector/">Digital Badges in Education</a> offer the ability for learners to establish portfolios and express knowledge.&nbsp;Critically they demonstrate how they can be applied across the entire educational ecosystem.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://e54b1a5c-a1c1-4de5-92be-372a9479ac65.filesusr.com/ugd/5bcc07_25aca1d75ef040708d1e87318cef59d9.pdf">this news</a>&nbsp;highlights one of the first customers to harness this capability is the Association of the Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC), choosing&nbsp;Digitary&nbsp;as the solution provider for the Made for Canada National Network.</p>
<p>This has been followed by launching ‘<a href="https://e54b1a5c-a1c1-4de5-92be-372a9479ac65.filesusr.com/ugd/5bcc07_b96a19aa6e6c46dd9d1d697089a306e1.pdf">MyCreds</a>‘, a national, bilingual credential wallet supported by a comprehensive website for Canada’s post-secondary community and learners.</p>
<p>This initiative means the Canadian higher education community is creating the very first online platform and national credential wallet for post-secondary learners. Once fully operational, the Network will enable 3 million learners across the country to access and share their official digitized post-secondary transcripts and credentials online – anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Also as they describe in <a href="https://www.digitary.net/digital-badges-available-to-irish-higher-education-sector/">this news</a>&nbsp;the Irish education sector is adopting this approach too:</p>
<p>“EduCampus and Digitary are excited to announce an additional feature under the collaborative framework agreement, enabling all EduCampus clients from Irish higher education institutions to be able to adopt Digital Badges. Sitting alongside the existing Digitary CORE solution for the issuance of academic credentials, such as degree certificates, academic transcripts, European Diploma Supplements (EDS) and other official academic documents; Digital Badges enables institutions to recognise all kinds of learners skills, competencies and learning experiences.”</p>
  
 Credly 
<p>Another major player is <a href="https://credly.com/">Credly</a>, who&nbsp;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/24/credly-raises-11-1-million-to-issue-and-manage-digital-badges/">raised $11m in 2019</a> and were recently&nbsp;<a href="https://plc.pearson.com/en-GB/news/pearson-acquires-digital-credentialing-leader-credly">acquired by Pearson</a>. Their CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbarthur/2021/07/19/an-innovators-views-on-digital-credentials---from-credlys-jonathan-finkelstein/">describes</a> how they help foster a more diverse and inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>Users include&nbsp;<a href="https://frederick.edu/degrees-certificates/credly.aspx">Frederick College</a>, where they highlight the value of digital badges:</p>
 
 Provide a more complete picture of your interests and experience 
 Show potential employers evidence of your up-to-date proficiency, relevant skill sets, and achievements 
 Help assist employers in matching you to their specific positions 
 Reflect your efforts to engage in more flexible ways of learning and scope of knowledge

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/accelerators/gaming/"></a>The goal of this article is to define the role of Esports within an overall <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/accelerators/gaming/">industry action plan</a> for Scotland’s gaming sector, and to begin brainstorming its’ goals and actions. 
 We welcome any and all levels of participation, from one-off ideas to full-time project membership. 
<p>The foundations and momentum for the sector are well underway.&nbsp;As <a href="https://digitalscot.net/esports-in-scotland/">we wrote</a> back in 2021 Scottish Esports has grown from a grassroots effort to a budding ecosystem, and further initiatives are evolving its’ capacity, such as Dundee and Angus College <a href="https://digitalscot.net/dundee-angus-esports-course/">launched the first Esports course</a>.</p>
 An Esports Club in Every School 
<p>A headline goal is start the ball rolling is the objective of having every school in Scotland having their own Esports club, because what’s especially exciting and important about the trend is the dual outcomes it offers.</p>
<p>There is the industry sector opportunity, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/esports/worldwide">global eSports market</a> is projected to reach $2,235m by 2027, and there is also the key role it can play in addressing <a href="https://digitalscot.net/digital-skills-action-plan/">Scotland’s digital skills challenge</a>, where Skills Development Scotland defines this headline goal for their DESAP initiative:</p>
<p>“Extend the reach of digital technology experiences for young people who may otherwise not participate in technology subjects at school.”</p>
 Alva Alliance: Exemplar Blueprint 
<p>Local expert Mark McCready explains the role of <a href="https://digitalscot.net/esports-in-education/">Esports in Education</a>, and an exemplar case study of how to achieve this and the benefits it brings is Alva Academy’s esports team, the <a href="https://digitalscot.net/alva-alliance/">Alva Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>Their case study tells the inspiring story of how the students took on the task themselves to develop the club, from building the equipment to connecting with other teams and competitions worldwide.</p>
<p>Quite simply it demonstrates the seeds of a new approach that could entirely transform Education wholesale, including but not limited to improving the uptake of computing.</p>
<p>It offers the potential to modernize our approach to schooling and curriculum, with immediate impact in critical areas like Computer Science uptake and a ripple effect spreading across Education as a whole.&nbsp;As such it should be replicated across every school in Scotland as a matter of priority.</p>
 Issues and Action Plan 
<p>In terms of the roadblocks standing in the way of achieving this goal this Twitter exchange goes straight to the heart of the practical challenge that needs addressed:</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>1. Computers that can run the software <br>2. Connections to the internet </p>
<p>We can’t connect non council managed devices to the internet and can’t run games on our current PCs so cannot have an e-sports team.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/guides/digital-skills/"></a>Digital Skills are of course central to the ambitions of a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/">Digital Nation</a>. 
 From the essential skills required for the modern workplace through the knowledge to start and grow a new digital business, all the desired outcomes are dependent on the latest technology skills. 
<p>Our Digital Skills Strategy draws together the key policies, industry leader insights and worldwide best practices to shape an action plan that can underpin a world leading 21st Century Scottish Digital Nation.</p>
 Digital Economy Skills Action Plan 
<p>As they announce <a href="https://www.skillsdevelopmentscotland.co.uk/news-events/2023/march/digital-skills-vital-for-scotland-s-economic-growth/">here</a> Skills Development Scotland recently published their <a href="https://www.skillsdevelopmentscotland.co.uk/media/50035/digital-economy-skills-action-plan.pdf">Digital Economy Skills Action Plan</a> (DESAP).</p>
<p>The report highlights the key skills challenges Scotland faces in realizing it’s ambition to become a world leading digital nation:</p>
 
 Only 3 in 10 businesses are fully equipped with cyber security skills. 
 Only 1 in 3 businesses engage in ecommerce. 
 Only 1 in 5 businesses feel fully equipped with digital technology skills. 
 
<p>An ambition of <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/a-changing-nation-how-scotland-will-thrive-in-a-digital-world/">Digital Scotland: A Changing Nation</a> is that every business and every individual in Scotland can embrace the economic opportunities presented by the digital economy. Achieving this target requires an inclusive skills and education system which is responsive to the ever-changing needs of the digital economy.</p>
<p>Since 2014 the maturity of Scotland’s digital economy has been measured against a baseline, and progress was subsequently tracked in 2017 and 2021.</p>
<p>This research shows that despite the pandemic being an accelerator of digitalisation, Scottish businesses predominantly are in the lower half of digital economy maturity and a lack of skills is a contributor.</p>
<p>Businesses across the maturity spectrum reported digital skills issues, which included a quarter of businesses identifying their workforce lacked the basic digital skills to use email, internet, and office packages effectively. Only around a third of business reported being fully equipped with cyber security skills which is a serious risk as businesses faced an average of 24 cyber security incidents last year.</p>
 Action Plan 
<p>The report defines a series of actions and objectives to address these challenges:</p>

		 
			 
				
 
 Extend the reach of digital technology experiences for young people who may otherwise not participate in technology subjects at school. 
 Inspire young people about careers in the Scottish digital economy by engaging employers in every primary and secondary school in Scotland. 
 Strengthen and communicate the evidence base on the current and future demand for digital economy skills and jobs. 
 Identify key digital economy skills competencies and aligning and developing micro-credentialed/short courses to address skills needs of employers. 
 Maximise the uptake of work-based learning pathways to support the demand for professional digital skills. 
 Support small businesses to identify and address the digital economy skills gaps in their workforce. 
 Increase the number of small businesses who can harness the benefits of digital transition.

     <p>Mobility is one of the core foundations of human civilization — expanding the range of opportunities to vast swathes of our society.&nbsp; Auto insurance protects the rights of individuals to access these opportunities while minimizing the downside in the event of an accident or natural disaster. Considering the importance of this function, this industry is highly regulated and places costly overhead looking for a path to transformation. The best way we can leverage technology is to address problems today and evolve them into a solution for the future. In this community lecture, we will look at the structure of the auto industry and how we can chart a path to transformation.</p>

<p>In just two weeks, the ban on SMS two-factor authentication for non-subscribers on Twitter will go into effect, a move blasted by the majority of the security community.</p>



<p>While Twitter CEO Elon Musk has defended the move as a way to protect user security, most leaders aren’t buying it.</p>



<p>“Just from a purely pragmatic standpoint, this is basically stripping away the lowest threshold of 2FA out there without any sort of viable or easy replacement,” Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, told SC Media.</p>

<p>GitHub reaffirmed this week that it is testing passkeys from the FIDO Alliance industry association, which is developing “open standards that are more secure than passwords and SMS OTPs, simpler for consumers to use, and easier for service providers to deploy and manage.” Passkeys use public key cryptography standards to authenticate client devices that are protected using biometrics, such as smartphones, eliminating password-based authentication altogether.</p>

<p>Due to rapid developments in both safe and harmful technology, cybersecurity is among the most volatile industries. However, we can still identify certain trends affecting the industry. From passwordless solutions broadly available to consumers, to the first real-life cases of automotive hacking, all of these are likely to shape the cybersecurity landscape in 2023. 2022 marks the year when the passwordless future idea experienced its first big wins, and 2023 is expected to be even more fruitful. Many progressive companies are likely to adopt the new passkeys technology, supported by the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google have already announced their commitment to delivering passwordless logins and even introduced their first efforts to consumers.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/accelerators/gaming/"></a><a href="https://www.speech-graphics.com/">Speech Graphics</a> are a keynote example of a world-class venture leading Scotland’s Gaming Ecosystem. 
 They <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/speech-graphics-raises-7m-for-audio-driven-facial-animation/">raised £7m in funding</a> in early 2022, with <a href="http://www.sandscapital.com/">Sands Capital</a> leading the round, which will be used to hire additional employees, build partnerships, and expand available products and services. 
<p>Speech Graphics raised its first round of funding in 2018 with a $3 million raise, and are based in Edinburgh.</p>
 Audio-driven Facial Animation 
<p>Speech Graphics addresses a very specific use case: Their technology automatically generates facial speech animation graphics from audio and even text. It enables animated characters in games and other applications to move their mouths properly in real time when uttering spoken words, utilizing their ‘<a href="https://www.speech-graphics.com/muscle-dynamics/">Muscle Dynamics</a>‘ innovation.</p>
<p>For sectors like game development speaking characters is a core building block of the experience but it can require an extremely labor intensive process to code manually. By interpreting the emotional nuances in voice performances to drive a detailed model of the muscle systems involved in speech, Speech Graphics technologies allow producers of video games to save significant time, money, and effort while achieving superior outcomes.</p>
<p>For example Speech Graphics <a href="https://mayflower-puma-nl6b.squarespace.com/client-projects/facial-animation-for-fortnite">collaborated with Epic Games</a> to integrate SG Com, the leading real-time audio powered facial animation synthesizer, into the Fortnite game lobby where players socialize with their friends and fellow players.</p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/guides/metaverse-future/"></a>Rapport Cloud 
<p>Speech Graphics has also extended their IP into a new venture and market, via <a href="https://www.rapport.cloud/">Rapport Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>This leverages the core technology for a more generalized set of applications, positioned for the massive growth of the ‘Metaverse’, offering capabilities to animate characters in this new digital universe for use cases from gaming through virtual e-commerce.</p>
<p>Rapport has developed a platform enabling customers to create highly personal interactions with digital avatars anywhere — in the web, in game engines, or in apps.</p>
<p>The platform provides access to Speech Graphics’ real-time avatar technology, along with low-latency streaming, real-time animation in the browser with no plugin required, and emotional AI that interprets the user’s voice and responds accordingly — all of this integrated with a highly scalable backend plugin infrastructure that readily connects a growing range of third-party technologies, including conversational AI, speech recognition, and speech synthesis.</p>
<p>Nicolas Diacono <a href="https://twitter.com/nincoroby/status/1587784703121170434">shares on Twitter</a> how it can enable a virtual influencer to act as a sales advisor or shopping assistant &amp; talk to customers on your website.</p>
 Grow Global 
<p>With such a world-class technology capability and importantly, ambition for addressing the largest of global markets, as well as their active international sales efforts, Speech Graphics is an exemplar of a gaming sector venture that can act as a flagship ambassador for the whole industry.</p>

<p>The Speech Graphics team had a fantastic time showcasing our demos at Tokyo Game Show last week! </p>

It is also <a href="https://oeweek.oeglobal.org/">Open Education Week</a> currently which means it is the perfect timing to talk some more about Open Recognition in education.</p><p>As an example we are talking about my five months of studying abroad at the University of Lapland in Finland. For me it was one of my biggest live experiences and I learned so much about myself, professionally and culturally. But in my CV or my LinkedIn profile it is just a sidenote without any&nbsp;proof.</p><p>The <a href="https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/">Eramus+ Program</a> has started to experiment with Open Badges for <a href="https://openbadgefactory.com/fi/webinar/case-erasmus-virtual-exchange/">their virtual exchanges</a>. But also the people who are going abroad can benefit from earning badges for their experiences. They are very individual and badges can help to tell a story in different ways. For an employer you might prefer showing the badges for knowledge and personal development but if you want to apply for another exchange you might prioritise showing the cultural awarness badges and personal development ones.</p>Example: my imaginary badge backpack for&nbsp;Finland<p>This excercise of remembering what I did in Finland and think of badges I would’ve earned was great. It is fun to go back to all these memories and I might design some of these badges further and issue them myself. Because this is the great thing with Open Badges, I can do this, I don’t need the offical program to do it for me. And over time I will meet people who can endorse these badges because they might see some of the skills and understandings that I gathered.</p><p>Interested in helping foster an ecosystem of Open Recognition?

 Stretching an analogy?&nbsp;Maybe. <p>Metaphors are powerful things. They can help people understand new concepts, and they can also help stretch our thinking about the art of the possible.</p><p>In this post, I want to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000">Sim City 2000</a>, one of my favourite childhood video games, as a metaphor for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>. For those who may be unfamiliar, Sim City 2000 was a popular city-building simulation game released in 1994. In the game, players act as mayors of their own virtual cities, managing everything from zoning laws to infrastructure development.</p><p>You may be wondering how Open Recognition (and <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a>) is like building your own city? Here are some&nbsp;reasons.</p> Infrastructure <p>Cities need a strong infrastructure to be able to function properly. So do recognition ecosystems. Open Recognition is all about creating a system that allows individuals to earn and display recognition for their skills, knowledge, and achievements. Fortunately, we have the ever-evolving Open Badges specification which supports the creation, sharing, and validation of recognition in a way that is open and interoperable.</p><p>You can imagine Open Badges as the roads, bridges, and buildings that make up the infrastructure of a city. They provide a way for individuals to earn recognition and for this recognition to be displayed and shared across different platforms and contexts.</p><p>Sadly, real-life cities have often been designed by a certain subset of the general population and, as books such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Women:_Exposing_Data_Bias_in_a_World_Designed_for_Men">Invisible Women</a> point out, this can be hugely problematic. So too with recognition — how can we recognise people in all of our diversity?</p> Resources <p>When playing Sim City 2000, it’s important to balance the needs of citizens with the resources you have available. Too many people, not enough power stations? Uh-oh. (Weirdly, I was always obsessed about getting enough water to everyone, but that’s a story for another&nbsp;post!)</p><p>When building Open Recognition ecosystems, we need to balance the needs of individuals, organisations, and the Community of Practice in which they interact. We need to ensure that recognition is meaningful and valuable to individuals, that it meets the needs of organisations, and that it aligns with the broader goals of the community.</p> Zoning <p>In Sim City 2000 players must define different areas as ‘zones’ — for example, residential, commercial and industrial zones. This helps to create a balanced and sustainable city. Too much of one thing can spell disaster!</p><p>Similarly, with Open Recognition, we need to create different zones or categories of recognition. This can include recognition for formal learning, informal learning, and experiential learning. Instead of people’s LinkedIn profiles being just a list of formal qualifications and where they’ve worked, we can recognise people in all of their wonderful complexity.</p> Evolution <p>Players in Sim City 2000 must constantly adapt and evolve their cities to meet changing needs and challenges. One of my favourite things to do was to initiate a ‘disaster’ to see if my city could handle a UFO attack, nuclear meltdown, or a rampaging Godzilla.</p><p>It is a rare individual, organisation, or community that doesn’t at some point face some kind of crisis. Keeping up-to-date with a world beyond microcredentials is important as new technologies, standards, and practices emerge. This helps with adaptability and resilience, allowing us to find new ways to recognise learners.</p><p>There are so many other ways to take this metaphor. But there are also points of deviation. For example, a key part of Sim City 2000 is that you play in ‘god mode’ where you can do whatever you want and hang the consequences. In real life, we have ‘town hall’ meetings where, to get back to the metaphor, recognition can be co-designed with the people we want to recognise.</p><p>Just like in Sim City 2000, it takes careful planning, thoughtful design, and ongoing adaptation to create a thriving ecosystem of recognition. So let’s roll up our sleeves and get building!</p><p>Interested in helping foster an ecosystem of Open Recognition?

 New toolkit enables enterprises to launch a variety of applications for multilateral business processes, from 24/7 renewable energy matching to integrating distributed energy resources <p>Zug, Switzerland, 7 March 2023 — Energy Web, an independent non-profit accelerating the global energy transition with open source software, today released the <a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/worker-contract">Energy Web Worker Node toolkit,</a> a new technology that enables enterprises to construct distributed computing networks that securely execute sensitive business operations impacting multiple companies.</p><p>Worker Nodes were originally developed to solve a paradox that hinders advanced renewable energy tracking solutions like 24x7 matching and green electric vehicle charging: credibility relies on accurate, publicly verifiable results (e.g., proof that digital representations of renewables are not double-counted). But inputs from separate organizations, such as granular renewable energy production and electricity demand data, are commercially sensitive and need to remain private. Complex commercial, legal, and technical requirements often make it challenging for a single actor to unilaterally access and process all requisite data. The ability to establish a shared source of truth from segregated, individual information sources has been an ongoing challenge in multilateral settings; the challenge is even greater for energy market participants seeking to exchange and process granular data in order to procure services from distributed energy resources.</p><p>The Energy Web Worker Node toolkit solves these challenges by enabling enterprises to configure, launch, and maintain distributed computing networks that ingest data from external sources, execute custom workflows based on business logic, and vote on results in order to establish consensus without revealing or modifying the underlying data. Worker Nodes apply concepts and components from blockchain technology in a novel, enterprise-friendly architecture to provide all stakeholders with cryptographic proof that mutually-agreed rules and and processes are followed correctly, ensure computational outputs from business processes are correct, and preserve the privacy and integrity of underlying data for auditing purposes.</p><p>Worker Nodes are currently in production supporting several solutions in the Energy Web ecosystem, including:</p>  Conducting 24/7 renewable energy accounting by <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-study-24-7-track-and-match/">ingesting and matching granular electricity load and generation data</a>, ensuring that matching rules and preferences are enforced correctly, and that there’s no double-counting of renewable generation;  Coordinating dispatch of distributed energy resources by <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-study-project-edge/">enabling distribution utilities, market operators, transmission actors, and distributed energy resources </a>to exchange critical operational data that enhances each organisation’s ability to perform its function without revealing sensitive commercial information  <blockquote>“Worker Nodes are the single most powerful Web 3 technology for enterprise that I have encountered to date,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “For a low carbon energy system to run, companies need to be able to exchange and perform computations on data from millions and eventually billions of people, businesses, and clean energy assets. Using a decentralized network of nodes to do useful work produces better outcomes than giving all that data and responsibility to a single&nbsp;entity.”</blockquote><p>Currently Worker Node networks comprise independent worker nodes, which can be implemented in multiple languages and hosting environments, and a governing smart contract, which collates voting results and publishes consensus results. <a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/worker-contract">The Worker Node repository is now available to the public on Github</a> containing both a smart contract and basic Worker Node template based on a 24/7 renewable energy matching application. This initial release includes business logic for 24/7 matching, enables users to authorize issuance of certificates, and allows users to set permissions for data input. An easy to use “as-a-service” version of the toolkit is currently under development as is Energy Web X, a new public blockchain for governing and securing Worker Node networks; both are expected to be made available to the public later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>The Green Proofs smart contract, part of the Worker Node Toolkit, was recently <a href="https://hacken.io/audits/#energy-web">audited by blockchain security auditor&nbsp;Hacken</a></p><p>and given a 10/10 rating, indicating the highest standard for blockchain security.</p><p>Interested parties can contact info@energyweb.org to learn&nbsp;more.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>First public review for Version 2.4 ends April 5th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Universal Business Language TC are pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.4 is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for Universal Business Language Version 2.4.</p>



<p>About the specification draft:</p>



<p>UBL is the leading interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:<br>– A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.<br>– A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.<br>– A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.</p>



<p>UBL v2.4 is a minor revision to v2.3 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 93. As with previous UBL releases, the UBL 2.4 library is designed to support the construction of a wide variety of document types beyond those provided in the 2.4 package.</p>

<p>A year ago today, I started full-time working on Verite, coordinating research on my fronts and moving from prototype and "cookbook for an ecosystem" to production trials, compliance research, and use-case exploration. It's been a great year and we have a lot to be proud of-- but also a backlog of updates to the documentation, as the exploration has yielded iteration and variation, new frontiers and new constellations of design. This post will serve as a milestone report overviewing those discoveries, new research directions, and ongoing conversations.</p> Compliant Membership<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>For all of this year, we remained laser-focused on one use-case: "membership proofs" that attest to a specific blockchain address being a member of a coarsely-defined "compliant pool" that has been checked to a minimal level, which reveal minimal identifiable data on-chain or on the open web. Delivering this value is what Verite was created to do, and all other use-cases we have been working on follow from it and build on it -- or, to put it another way, are unlikely to go to production until our primary use-case has users and traction, as "follow-on" products and "knock-on" network effects.</p><p>Our research uncovered much complexity and diversity among the on-chain consumers of these membership proofs, which leads us to support different variations and form-factors for this use case and the supporting technical work needed to go beyond mere membership. We found:</p>  Some smart-contract-based consumers only wanted to consume membership proofs on-chain, making a strict "nothing on-chain" approach across all Verite architectures unworkable  Other smart-contract-based consumers want to outsource the enforcement of a compliance policy (usually roughly defined, and expected to be refined over time) to a single service, with an expectations of real-time monitoring and complete separation of concerns.  These services will need to retool as regulatory requirements and reliance frameworks evolve over time.  Everyone (even the services!) worries about centralization and silos forming -- the services want to be able to work with one another's end-users, and thus provide a larger (and more decentralized!) customer-base to their on-chain customers.  <p>Our earlier research assumed on-chain activity could be gated by Verifiable Credential (or "off-chain soulbound tokens" as they are sometimes called in web3), but the further we delved into the "customer requirements" of on-chain platforms, the more it became apparent that it did not fit in their technical or business model to accept and validate verifiable credentials, with or without input towards the schematization of those policies into composable bits. They wanted a distinct service provider (#2) to handle that, and off-chain tokens would allow these service providers to federate their customer bases and interoperate (#4), as well as to evolve over time (#3). Their secret sauce and competition was best left to their relationships with on-chain customers, as well as their specific tooling and integration patterns (#1).</p> Governance and Compliance<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Another aspect that shifted substantially over the last year was the role of governance in the system. When the work began, without splitting on-chain relying parties from verification services, it was easier to imagine a simple feedback loop between relying parties and the schema design for the contents of the Verite credentials which would be issued and/or validated by verification services. But if verification services would be independent actors rather than implemented by and owned by the relying parties, the complexity of governance needed for this network was growing.</p><p>In particular, we worried that on-chain communication would be the hardest to align on given the business model pressures of this 4-actor model. While "schema design", as we had been calling it, sounded like a relatively simple technical question of data modeling, it turned out to be a far more complex beast across different chains of reliance and slight architectural variants.</p><p>For this reason, less schema design happened in Centre-hosted working groups than we had expected. As end-to-end products continue to evolve, this kind of alignment could perhaps be premature, and many Verite partners have opted to defer this kind of harmonization until after there is signification adoption and traction. The schemas published so far are adequate to geographically-limited launches of the initial use-case, and as the sphere of supported geographies and use-cases expands, or as more players enter the space and demand grows for federation and interoperability, we look forward to truly viable self-governance. In the meantime, we will continue technical research and design work.</p><p>Specifically, that falls in four categories:</p>  On-chain Design  Architectural Design &amp; Adoption  Technical Standardization  Additional Use-Cases   Ongoing On-Chain Research<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>One of the most active groups Verite hosted over the last year was the On-Chain Best Practices group, which zoomed in on the "last mile" between the on-chain consumers relying on Verite to deliver it safe addresses, and the off-chain verifiers handling all the messy details and off-chain data with privacy and nuance. This group focused on the subtle difference (lost on many readers of the Verite documentation!) between Verification Results (verbose, identifying, necessarily off-chain and archival for reporting and legal reasons) and Verification Records (concise, anonymous, essentially just a log entry or a pointer to archival results documentation). Only the latter can go on-chain, and thus the latter needs to be enough for on-chain relying parties to act; the former, however, enables all the flexibility and nuance needed for a policy engine, a data translation layer, and a federation of competitors.</p><p>Surveying the landscape, a Verite research team and a few academic interlocutors cooperated on a synthetic comparison of architectures we saw for addressing the on-chain compliance problem space. The result was a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/onchain_identity_verification_flows.md">thorough lightpaper</a> laying out where Verite fit in the broader landscape of on-chain identity with and without verifiable credentials. Zooming in even more on the relationship between on-chain consumers and identity-enabled on-chain tokens, Keith Kowal from the Hedera-focused research team at Swirld Labs wrote up another <a href="https://hedera.com/blog/the-rise-of-the-identity-token">useful primer</a>. It focuses in on where on-chain tokens do and don't fit the "soul-bound" model for a "decentralized society," as well as how on-chain artefacts can and cannot meet the requirements of compliance in today's jurisdiction-based and centralized society of laws.</p><p>As products launch and evolve in the marketplace, this group remains confident that alignment on incrementally more technologically prescriptive guidance will be valuable, leading to shared interfaces and shared security models as federations form. For this reason, Verite's most active working group plans to keep meeting and keep designing on-chain registries and smart contracts across multiple languages and blockchain environments. Look forward to additions to Verite's documentation along these lines in Q2 and Q3 of this year.</p> Ongoing Architectural Design<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The RWoT lightpaper linked above implicitly compared <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/onchain_identity_verification_flows.md#architecture-c-blinded-off-chain-proof-verified-on-chain">the Verite architecture</a> to simpler end-to-end products already active in the DeFi space today, but this comparison only works at a certain level of abstraction. Zooming in a bit, Verite has actually forked into two separate-but-equal architectures over the last year, and works hard to keep feature parity and use-case parity between the two.</p><p>The original Verite design assumed an end-user either using TWO wallets (an identity wallet and a crypto wallet), or a "fat wallet" controlling both a private and portable DID and one or more blockchain private keys). This defined our initial schemas, and the original Verite implementation guide imagines <a href="https://verite.id/verite/developers/wallet-guide">multi-chain Crypto wallets adding support for a DID</a> in much the same way they handle adding support for a new blockchain or private-key type to be able to handle private, DID-based offchain VCs. This dual-wallet, both "SSI" (self-sovereign identity) and "Crypto", is a cornerstone of <a href="https://areweweb5yet.com/">the "Web5" approach</a>, allowing SSI for next-gen (and post-cookie!) Web2 use-cases, strong privacy and pseudonymity for web3 use-cases, and even a few carefully guard-railed bridges between the two. While we fully endorse this approach, we are waiting for more implementation interest and DeFi demand to further prototype technical artefacts for this architecture.</p><p>In the meantime, a simpler architectural pattern (outlined in detail in a <a href="https://verite.id/blog/verification-patterns-1">prior blog post</a>) emerged in prototyping work with Circle Engineering: an <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/issuance-flow#address-bound-credential-issuance">address-based credential</a>, issued not a DID controlled by a specific wallet client, but to an address (which might even be controlled from multiple wallet clients). This enables a different path to wallet support, piggybacking on the <a href="https://medium.com/walletconnect/walletconnect-v2-0-protocol-whats-new-3243fa80d312">WalletConnect version 2</a> upgrade cycle to get wallets implementing lightweight, "minimum-viable" support for verifiable credentials without the need to handle DID keys or complex VC-specific protocols.</p><p>In the coming months, expect to see the <a href="https://verite.id/verite/developers/supporting-wallet-connect">Wallet Connect</a> instructions on the Verite documentation expanded and entries added to other pages as more wallets roll out support for Verite credentials via Wallet Connect rails. This is a major ongoing research topic with Circle and WalletConnect, testing the hypothesis that thin wallets want to stay thin just as much as dapps wants to stay ignorant of the identities of their users (even in compliant products).</p> Ongoing Technical Standards Contribution<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>It bears repeating often that Verite is not a product or a solution, but rather a protype and a "cookbook" for overlapping DeFi ecosystems. While Centre strives to be a neutral convener of co-development between startups and major players, Centre is not a "standards organization" but encourages use-case alignment with subsequent development in appropriate standards organizations. Rather than design or specify them, Centre strives to integrate and socialize technologies. As such, a key design goal for Verite from the beginning was to invent as little new technology as possible and use standards-track building blocks wherever possible to maximize interoperability between competitors and sustainability of technical decisions, two crucial ingredients in any sustainable ecosystem.</p><p>For this reason, while Verite is not a product or a solution, it could be called a "protocol," aiming at adoption by wallets and dapps. Or to be more precise, Verite could be seen as a "profile" and sample implementation of the more general-purpose <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> protocol for Verifiable Credentials. For this reason, Centre is committed to maintaining and iterating the Presentation Exchange specification at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.</p><p>Of course, Verite relies on many other standards and open-source initiatives, to which it is also committed.

<p>If you use a dedicated password manager, such as Dashlane, you’ll probably expect it to manage your passkeys for you, just as it does with your passwords. Unlike passwords, the mechanism passkeys use is more sophisticated under the hood, though this isn’t apparent in the user experience; passkeys are actually much simpler than passwords to create and use.&nbsp; Dashlane has been at the forefront of passkey support since passkeys were announced last year. In August, Dashlane introduced integrated passkey support in our security-first password manager and unveiled the first in-browser passkey solution.</p>

<p></p>



<p>THE CHALLENGE:<br>Improving Employee Access with Zero Trust</p>



<p>When Cloudflare started the company provided its employees with access to internal applications via a virtual private network (VPN). Access to some, but not all applications behind the VPN required two factor authentication, typically done with One Time Passcodes (OTP) generated by applications like Authy or Google Authenticator.</p>



<p>Cloudflare realized that it needed a more secure and scalable approach than VPN and started a process of moving toward a Zero Trust architecture utilizing Cloudflare Access.</p>







<p>From OTP to unphishable FIDO authentication</p>



<p>As part of its migration to a zero trust architecture, starting in 2018 Cloudflare began its usage of FIDO based security keys.</p>



<p>The goal behind using FIDO2 was to provide strong authentication that would enable Cloudflare’s zero trust model.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wanted something that was unphishable,” said Derek Pitts, director of enterprise security at Cloudflare. “If we were going to go through all the trouble of redoing a lot of our identity and access management infrastructure, I wanted it to be future proof and resilient.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>



<p>Overcoming barriers to adoption with selective enforcement</p>



<p>Cloudflare’s path to adoption of FIDO security keys was not an entirely straight path. Initially there were concerns around account recovery and replacement of lost physical security keys.</p>



<p>Another challenge was the fact that Cloudflare’s users were used to using OTP technology with Google Authenticator, or Authy. Managing user change aversion and education were key components in the switch from OTP to FIDO security keys. This led Cloudflare to a selective enforcement approach, so as not to force change on users that could potentially lock them out.</p>



<p>What Cloudflare did was to integrate FIDO into its access identity aware proxy that internal users used to access internal sites. Instead of immediately requiring FIDO for all internal sites, Cloudflare initially only required the use of security keys on three of its sites. Selective enforcement for FIDO security keys were activated on July 20, 2020, which is the day Twitter fell victim to a social engineering attack.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“That day was mayhem and we wanted to ensure<br>that didn’t happen to us,” Pitts said.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>



<p>Pitts said that by requiring the use of FIDO2/WebAuthn for its three more most sensitive internal apps, adoption grew as it gave employees a training ground to get familiar with the technology. In 2021, Cloudflare made the switch to requiring FIDO security keys across its network.</p>
 



 
 
  
 


 



 
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
		
<p><br>
Founded in 2010, Cloudflare
is one of the world’s leading
internet content delivery and
security platforms.</p>
		
<p>Overview<br>
Cloudflare is one of the world’s
most deployed security and
content delivery platforms.
Cloudflare’s products include
a range of services including
web performance, application
network, zero trust and
developer services.<br><br>
Cloudflare’s network handles
over 36 million HTTP requests
per second and blocks over 124
billion cyber attacks a day. The
Cloudflare network has over
200 points of presence around
the globe.</p> 



 
“Selective enforcement ended up being a huge deal for us,” Pitts said. “That was one of the biggest forcing functions and things that made this project successful.”<p></p>
		
Read Cloudflare’s blog,  <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust/">“How Cloudflare implemented hardware keys with FIDO2 and
Zero Trust to prevent phishing,” to learn more about their FIDO Authentication implementation.</a><p></p> 



 
 
 



<p></p>



 



<p>LESSONS LEARNED:<br>Take the small wins where you can</p>



<p>From the outset, the movement toward strong authentication had top down support from Cloudflare’s CEO, CIO and CSO. Pitts said that having the executive buy in was important as it helped his team to push through when it ran into issues.</p>



<p>Cloudflare has a large and complex network architecture and it didn’t move to WebAuth/FIDO2 overnight. Pitts said that it was a multi-year effort that was successful on the foundation of a series of incremental small wins that helped to prove that the technology can work to improve security.</p>



<p>The small wins approach incorporated Cloudflare’s selective enforcement approach. Pitts said that it’s important to have a training ground that will allow users to try out security keys and get familiar with the approach.</p>

Lynzie Adams, US Assurance Program Manager



<p>Kantara Initiative has been running identity assurance programs since 2011.</p>



<p>As the global leader in this area, we asked our current US Assurance Program Manager, Lynzie Adams, to give us her top tips for organizations wishing to apply for a Kantara Grant of Approval – particularly against the NIST 800-63 standards. Having worked with a Kantara Accredited Assessor, you will be ready to submit your application for final consideration by our Assurance Review Board (ARB) who review many different applications every month. We want to make sure that by the time you get to this stage, you have the best possible chance of Approval.</p>



<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the standards in detail as you may not be quite ready to submit an application.&nbsp; [link to See the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST guidelines directly </a>or <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download-category/service-assessment-criteria-sets/">request the Service Assessment Criteria</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; Be self-critical: does your product or service truly align to the criteria?&nbsp; You may be able to refine your processes slightly to help move things along more quickly.</p>



<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mailto:secretariat@kantarainitiative.org">Talk to us</a> before you consider investing! Our team can help you understand the full requirements, which templates to use (and when) and whether you may be able to refine some of your processes to improve your chances of success.</p>



<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus on your Service Description (S3A) as this is often the first thing our Assurance Review Board will read. &nbsp;The ARB requires a detailed overview of the service you offer. They don’t see all the materials you have shared with your assessor so they can only judge by what the S3A tells them. Be honest about what you DO (and DON’T) offer in the realm of identity assurance.</p>



<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your solution overview needs to clearly point to the relevant sections on the corresponding Service Assessment Criteria (SAC) spreadsheet. Make sure everything cross-references correctly. The ARB needs the Service Description (S3A)&nbsp; document to be clear and detailed for them to understand fully what your service does. Clear reference to the Service Assessment Criteria sheet will help enormously.</p>



<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide as much evidence as you can in the S3A to support your application. Can you add visuals such as diagrams or graphics as these often help the Assurance Review Board to understand your application better?&nbsp;Be detailed and don’t be afraid to share supportive graphics that might help support SAC conformity. The S3A is a confidential document that will only be reviewed by the ARB.</p>



<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not involve your wider colleagues – including your Communications team who will be well practised at writing materials for diverse audiences?&nbsp; They will offer a more “independent” view on how easy your application is for a reader who doesn’t know your solution. And, significantly, they will help pick up any areas of conflicting information so you can remedy these before submission.</p>

 Advanced Notice &amp; Consent Receipt WG 



<p>February 28 2023   Chair: Salvatore d’Agostino</p>







<p>On 20th February, our Advanced Notice and Consent Receipts Work Group (ANCR WG) celebrated the 5th anniversary of the publication of the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/7902/">Consent Receipt Specification v1.1</a></p>



<p>This is now an integral part of multiple ISO standards and has been adopted by developers and service providers around the world. We are currently extending this work to meet the challenges of an evolving, decentralized identity market.&nbsp; Our current efforts focus on providing an ‘Open Source Notice Controller’ credential which will include Transparency Performance Indicators (TPIs) to measure the transparency, privacy and security of individual data controllers.</p>



<p>This credential and its performance indicators are widely applicable across sectors but are particularly relevant to regulated activities such as banking, healthcare, and – importantly, in the case of automated decision making – to the use of AI in the delivery of identity and access services.</p>



<p>The work of the ANCR WG is relevant to several national and global initiatives including the CoE 108+ protocols for the protection of individuals with regards to the processing of their personal data, adopted by 47 countries including 28 EU members. The WG submitted comment to rulemaking at the US Federal Trade Commission and is preparing a response to the current Request for Comment by NIST on SP 800-63-4 Digital Identity Guidelines &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Open Notice Controller Credential and TPIs address key areas of interest to NIST including advancing equity. &nbsp;This includes expanding the risk management framework to measure the impact of digital identity adoption on individuals. It considers any equity implications in terms of individual control or increased risk exposure. The approach also provides optionality and choice with notice and consent receipts that can be used independently of service providers. Our work also helps to deter fraud and advanced threats through actionable co-governance that allows people to be involved personally in managing their data security.</p>



<p>Join us as we engage with innovators and standards setters in identity assurance for people. &nbsp;We welcome new contributors and participation in the Work Groups, it does not require membership in the Kantara Initiative. Visit <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WA/overview">ANCR WG</a> or <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GI/overview">Kantara Wiki</a> for more information.</p>



 Identity Assurance Work Group 



<p>March 1 2023    Chair:  Andrew Hughes</p>







<p>IAWG continues to bring together contributors to Kantara’s assurance framework which underpins the Kantara Trust Framework program. ID proofing&nbsp;and authentication&nbsp;providers,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;assessors convene to discuss, clarify and&nbsp;improve the framework documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At present, IAWG is focused on analysing, and providing feedback on, NIST SP 800-63 v4 draft.&nbsp;The four volumes of 800-63 are being updated, with potential impact to Kantara’s approved CSP vendors. We will assemble a comments package to submit to NIST for consideration, by the deadline of March 24th, 2023.</p>



<p>Later in 2023, IAWG will work on updates to our Service Assessment Criteria to match the updated 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines&nbsp;as well as initiatives related to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in relation to the Identity space.</p>



<p>If you work with ID proofing/verification providers or authentication/authorization&nbsp;providers and wish to gain insight into how those services fulfill requirements, please join our weekly calls. Just complete the&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/gpa-signup/?selectedGroup=12">Group Participation Agreement</a>&nbsp;to get set up.&nbsp;</p>

  🚀 Foundation News  
<p>Are you up to date on recent accomplishments of the DIF Working Groups? This newsletter covers the latest updates from Claims and Credentials, ID and Discovery, Secure Data Storage, Applied Cryptography, Sidetree, Wallet Security,DIDComm and all of DIF’s open groups.</p>
<p>We want to give a warm welcome to DIF's new Executive Director, Clare Nelson. Clare brings a wealth of experience to DIF and is looking to move DIF’s mission forward to “advance the interests of the decentralized identity community, including performing research and development to advance pre-competitive technical foundations towards established interoperable, global open standards.” If you are interested in participating in any of the Working Groups described below, please click <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>We also want to give a big thank you to our outgoing Executive Director Rouven Heck. Rouven has served as ED of DIF since 2019 and has done tremendous work in leading its foundation and growth.  Make sure to read Rouven’s latest <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/rouven-heck-welcomes-clare-nelson-as-new-executive-director-of-dif/">post</a> to review all the great progress DIF has made as a community.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are thrilled about an upcoming event. On Thursday March 2nd, DIF will be hosting a one-hour Ask me Anything (AMA) with Daniel Buchner on Decentralized Web Nodes or DWNs at 11am PT/2pm ET/ 8pm CET. There are still tickets available. Register <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ask-me-anything-on-dwns-with-daniel-buchner-tickets-543200957687?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a> while you still have a chance!</p>
  🛠️ Working Group Updates  
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">🛡️ Claims &amp; Credentials</a> 
<p>Presentation Exchange and Credential Manifest<br>
The Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group at DIF is excited to announce the release of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Presentation Exchange (PE) v2 specification.</a> Presentation Exchange enables a verifier to express to a credential holder (via their software agent, such as a wallet) their requirements for claims and proofs. This updated and ratified version of the spec includes a restructured set of core requirements, as well as an extensibility mechanism through the use of optional “features.” You can read the full press release <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/presentation-exchange-v2/">here.</a> Ongoing work on implementation guidance and test suites begins in March, and new contributors are warmly welcome.</p>
<p>The “sibling specification” defining <a href="https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/v1.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Credential Manifest</a> (a requirement for open-world and widely interoperable Presentation Exchange) has also just been finalized as a WG-approved v1, so implementer feedback is warmly welcome (and required by the DIF Steering Committee for ratification!). Part of finalizing CM v1 was breaking out the ongoing design work on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/wallet-rendering?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Wallet Rendering</a> extension as an optional extension; this latter specification is seeking active contribution to join the v1 club.</p>
<p>Presentation Exchange, Credential Manifest and Friends meets weekly at 10am PT/1pm ET/ 7pm CET Thursdays</p>
<p>Data Agreement</p>
<p>The task force is developing consent receipts for Presentation [Exchange] proofs (which log signature of “data agreements”) conformant to <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/80392.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">ISO 27560 standards.</a> These provide a legally-grounded, verifiable, and immutable record of intended usage of data received, including data received in the form of Verifiable Credentials. Work is ongoing to create alignment of data agreement fields across vendors using ISO 27560 as a reference. They are also exploring potential interoperability events and test vectors for signing of data agreements.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the Data Agreement Specification <a href="https://hackmd.io/mX-SvRovRr6aeuMONApt3Q?view=&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>Data Agreement meets bi-weekly at 7amPT/ 10amET/ 4pmCET Thursdays</p>
<p>Trust Establishment</p>
<p>The Trust Establishment work item is looking to output specifications, interoperability profiles, and reference implementations that help organizations assemble and maintain an ecosystem of trusted relationships and data.</p>
<p>The v0.0.1 draft sets out the core data structures that can be referenced in credentials. There's also been discussion with the Trust over IP (ToIP) Governance Architecture Task Force to make sure both groups stay aligned on the mechanics of how open-world or permissionless Trust Establishment mechanisms can consume trust documents from permissioned  governance structures, such as documents from <a href="https://indicio.tech/trust-registry-or-machine-readable-governance/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">machine-readable trust frameworks.</a></p>
<p>Trust Establishment meets bi-weekly at 10am PT/ 1pm ET/ 7pm CET Mondays</p>
<p>Schema Directory</p>
<p>Claims and Credentials has a work item for a schema directory and right now they have a survey out to understand what schemas DIF members are using with a goal of greater alignment and convergence. They are looking for more participation in the survey at this time which can be found <a href="https://forms.gle/Yzj9bYLXFLVdtDk96?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>Schema directory meets bi-weekly on 9am PT/12pm ET/ 6pm CET Thursdays</p>
<p>VC-JWT bi-weekly</p>
<p>The VC-JWT biweekly has been an occasional meeting place for DIF members to catch up on and discuss the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-jwt/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">JWT work</a> taking place in the Verifiable Credential work group at the W3C.  This work on a formal standards-track document was discussed at a recent special W3C meeting in Miami. As an update, for the first time, there is now a native and more tightly-specified JSON Web Token (JWT) representation for Verifiable Credentials. This representation uses IANA-registered JWT claims whenever applicable, and requires no understanding of or reference to JSON-LD. Long-time DIF contributor Mike Jones offered <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2316&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">this summary</a> of the evolution of the specification.</p>
<p>The DIF VC-JWT discussions happen sporadically at the bi-weekly “reserved time” of Thursdays at 11am PT/ 2pm ET/ 8am CET; DIF members can inquire about vc-jwt issues and check for meetings in the #vc-jwt channel on DIF Slack.</p>
 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/crypto-wg/blob/main/agenda.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">🔐 Applied Crypto WG</a> 
<p>BBS+Signatures</p>
<p>Members of our Applied Cryptography work group have been doing a fabulous job preparing the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-01.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IETF draft for BBS+</a>signatures which iterates the early DIF draft in preparation for the next IETF meeting in March. There is one new JavaScript implementation of the draft and the group is close to having a complete set of test vectors that will be cross-validated by multiple implementations (and hopefully be part of the new version that will be pushed to the CFRG working group at IETF before the next annual meeting).The draft is close to becoming quite stable. DIF Member Greg Bernstein has made a fantastic online application for people to test BBS+ which can be found <a href="https://www.grotto-networking.com/BBSDemo/https://www.grotto-networking.com/BBSDemo/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>More attendance, reviews and implementations are always welcome.</p>
<p>The DIF Crypto - BBS+ work item meets weekly  at 11am PT/2pm ET /8pm CET Mondays</p>
<p>Crypto Revocation Work Item bi-weekly</p>
<p>The group is looking for more participation at this time, particularly from potential implementers of low-level libraries for the novel revocation schemes the group has been researching and documenting. If you’re interested in contributing and helping to drive work on this, please reach out to limari@identity.foundation.</p>
<p>The DIF Crypto Revocation work item meets bi-weekly at 11am PT/2pm ET/8pm CET Thursdays</p>
 📡 DIDComm User Group: (Open Group) 
<p>For those who have been away from DIF for a while, the DIDComm “Unsyc” has now been reformed into the DIDComm User Group, which meets Mondays at 12 pm PT. The group is open and non-IPR protected. The group is currently discussing creating a DIDComm user guide in addition to a DIDComm testing tool, a training course, and a browser-based DIDComm-focused playground with the intention of helping the community understand and extend DIDComm v2. Feel free to join the group meeting or contribute to the discussion on <a href="https://discord.gg/8FB8c4FG?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Discord.</a></p>
<p>The DIDComm user group meets weekly at 12pm PT/3pm ET/ 9pm CET Mondays</p>
 🌳 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Sidetree Weekly Work Group</a> 
<p>DIF is restarting the Sidetree weekly meeting and the group is getting to work on bug fixes and specification clarifications/errata for a v1.1. Some features they’re looking to add to v2 are more human-friendly named aliases and more flexible cryptography support. Be on the lookout for a survey on what people would like to see for v2 in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Sidetree Weekly Work Group meets at 10am PT/ 1pm ET/ 7pm CET Tuesdays</p>
 💡 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Identifiers and Discovery Work Group</a> 
<p>In the Identifiers and Discovery work group there was recently a presentation by Christoph Fabianek about a DID validator called <a href="https://didlint.ownyourdata.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Lint</a>  and <a href="https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/soya/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">SOyA</a>, or Semantic Overlay Architecture. SOyA is a data model authoring and publishing platform and also provides functionalities for validation and transformation.</p>
<p>There has also been ongoing discussion about the finer points of rotating and revoking keys in DID documents, and how that relates to VC issuance and verification and the VC extension pattern formerly and elsewhere known as “holder binding”. The working group keeps detailed meeting minutes which can be found <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here.</a></p>
<p>Here are the updates on the Universal Resolver drivers since December:</p>
<p>Updated support for did:ebsi<br>
Added support for did:algo<br>
Removed support for did:work (deprecated)<br>
Added support for did:3</p>

 📦 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Secure Data Storage</a> 
<p>DWN Task Force (Decentralized Web Nodes)</p>
<p>We want to give a big welcome to our new co-chair to the DIF Secure Data Storage Group, Andor Kesselman. Andor is the CTO and co-founder of [Benri,]<br>
(<a href="http://benri.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">http://benri.io/</a>) a company that specializes in providing tools and infrastructure for developer onboarding into DWNs. Prior to entering the SSI industry, Andor was a founding engineer at pathr.ai and co-authored <a href="https://github.com/andorsk/rk_toolkit?ref=blog.identity.foundation">RK-Diagrams.</a> Along with his involvement with DIF, Andor serves as co-chair of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Trust Registry Task Force</a> and as an editor of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Trust Registry Architecture</a> at Trust Over IP. He is dedicated to making DWNs more accessible to a wider audience and welcomes any questions you may have on the topic. Don't hesitate to reach out to him!</p>
<p>The DWN work group has been delighted by the enthusiastic participation of the community and their ongoing interest in expanding the specifications. Recently, there have been some exciting developments to the Protocols interface, allowing for the description of arbitrary protocols to interface with DWNs. Additionally, the Collections interface has been updated, and we are thrilled to see real-world applications being built and demonstrated during the work group meetings. To further encourage the adoption of DWNs and lower barriers to implementation, the co-chair has initiated the <a href="https://hackmd.io/S7RczUDxQgyHxWKBmBVW_A?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DWN companion guide.</a> They warmly invite all DIF members to join us every Wednesday bi-weekly at 9AM PST to listen in on the working group's progress. TBD, a division of Block, has also been working to open-source <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/incubating-web5-labs?ref=blog.identity.foundation">tooling and onboarding</a> to DWNs, in addition to the core sample implementation.</p>
<p>DIF/CCG Secure Data Storage WG  - DWN Task Force meets bi-weely at 9am PT/12pm ET/6pm CET Wednesdays</p>
 👝<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Wallet Security Work Group</a> 
<p>A new work item is about to kick off called Universal Wallet Backup Containers. This work item was spun up following activity at the last IIW relating to a standard interface for storage to backup/restore wallet information to and from. This group is also looking to engage wallet vendors to discuss common problems relating to wallet backup and recovery to avoid pitfalls and focus on universal benefits that can be quick wins. They are looking for members to help participate in the new work item and vendors interested in participating in a forum discussion on wallet backup and recovery. DIF Wallet Security is also looking forward to working with Open Wallet Foundation, which just held their opening session last month.</p>
<p>They are on the lookout for a new co-chair. Please reach to limari@identity.foundation if you’re interested in volunteering.</p>

<p>The Edelman Trust Barometer is a comprehensive study conducted every year since 2000 by Edelman, a global communications firm, to measure the current level of trust around the world in institutions such as Governments, Businesses, NGOs, and the Media. It usually generates significant attention and debate about Edelman and clients potentially deriving business value from exploiting the notion of Trust in managing reputation.</p>
<p>This article focuses solely on the results of the 23rd survey which was released around the World Economic Forum last month and the interesting insights it reveals, which seem to encourage business leaders to be the actors of change for trusted practices and technologies in a world where governments and their representatives have lost voters’ trust.</p>
<p>This year’s survey is based on interviews with 32’000 respondents in 28 countries. This time again, it shows how Trust is a complex and multifaceted concept, as opinions and perceptions vary among individuals, communities and countries. Trust can also be influenced by a range of factors such as personal experiences, media coverage or cultural and social contexts.</p>
<p>The backdrop for the report is 2022, the post pandemic year, the year of a return to normal life and economic rebound. To the contrary, we faced a Russian invasion of Ukraine, an Afghan crisis and an Iranian freedom movement. But not only. We also saw an increase in people struggling to feed themselves compared with before the pandemic, a worldwide inflation crisis as well as persistent droughts.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, a recent announcement by the CFF to increase the level of camera surveillance in train stations throughout the country, has triggered concerns and actions from politicians and citizens alike, fearing and distrusting a systematic spying in the public space whether for commercial or security reasons.</p>
 The collapse of trust in current economical contexts but businesses seen as most competent 
<p>What are the consequences of all that on the world level of trust? Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>First, according to the 2023 Barometer, economic optimism is collapsing around the world: in 24 out of 28 countries, the number of people who think their family will be better off in five years has never been lower.</p>
<p>Second, on a more individual aspect, personal anxieties and existential societal fears have become impressively high. Out of all the people interviewed, 89% fear to lose their job, 76% are scared of climate change and 74% fear inflation and its negative impact on their purchasing power. Sadly, fears of a potential nuclear war, of food or energy shortage, are not much lower.</p>
<p>The Barometer also reveals an evaporation of trust across most institutions. People persistently do not trust the media or social media which create even more entranched divisions. Trust in media declines in 16 of 27 countries. Trust in Governments and institutions declines in 14 of 27 countries.</p>
<p>The level of trust in the United Nations (UN) has also decreased in 21 of 27 countries and the current level is 59%, a 2% decrease compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The survey reveals that trust in the UN varies widely depending on the region. The UN suffers from the lowest level on trust in the U.S. and Europe. But it reaches its worst level in Japan with 35 %! However, China, Indonesia, Thailand and India win the award of the countries trusting the most the institution (with a level between 78% and 80% ).</p>
<p>On the other hand, despite the criticisms it faced because of its initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN agency responsible for international public health, the World Health Organisation (WHO), becomes the most trusted global organisation in the world (67%). Its level of trust varies according to regions, its handling of specific health crises, political controversies, and media coverage, but it stays surprisingly high.<br>
Taking a closer look to the results, Businesses seem to be the only institution seen as competent and ethical (with the greatest trust increase in the U.S.) and Family-Owned Businesses are the most trusted of all. Trust in industry sectors such as Technology, Education, Food &amp; Beverage as well as Healthcare remains the highest.</p>
<p>NGOs and Businesses are seen as the most reliable source of trustworthy information, unlike Governments and the Media.</p>
<p>The report shows that in the globalised economy, trust is still very much local. We tend to trust people in our neighborhood, our local community, and our coworkers more than Government leaders, journalists or CEOs.</p>
<p>In summary, the Edelman’s 2023 trust barometer paints a complex and multifaceted picture of the current state of trust around the globe.</p>
<p>The continued erosion of trust in traditional institutions represents a significant challenge for leaders, policymakers and business owners. To rebuild trust and to rebalance a polarized world, it is obvious that actions, not words, and measurable results bringing a positive difference to the close nexus of human and animal populations as well as the environment, are now more than ever needed.</p>

With today’s release of ComposeDB Beta (v0.4), developers can easily build fully-composable Web3 applications on Ceramic Mainnet.</p><p>Combining Ceramic, GraphQL, and reusable data models, ComposeDB is a graph database that unlocks an interoperable data ecosystem for all applications built on it. It lets Web3 applications support data-intensive use cases like rich social features, identity and reputation, shared knowledge graphs, and dynamic collaboration.</p><p>Jump into the brand new ComposeDB <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">website</a> and <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">docs</a> to learn more and get started.</p> What is ComposeDB?   📀 Powerful, decentralized graph database <p>ComposeDB is a decentralized property graph database designed for building data-intensive, highly-relational Web3 application use cases. ComposeDB’s graph database relies on popular GraphQL for powerfully expressive schemas, queries, and mutations.</p> 🪐 Composable data models and data ecosystem <p>ComposeDB’s ever-growing, interoperable data ecosystem makes it easier to build apps and grow them faster than ever before. Developers can reuse existing plug-and-play models from the ComposeDB catalog to bootstrap their app with all data that exists on the network. Every additional ComposeDB integration adds to the overall data available for you to use when building your app.</p> 🔌 Loads of Web3 integrations <p>ComposeDB is designed to play nicely with the rest of your Web3 stack. You can use ComposeDB with all popular Web3 wallets such as MetaMask and Phantom, along with other popular Web3 data protocols such as Sign in With Ethereum for authentication or Lit for encryption.</p> 🔥 Powered by Ceramic, now faster than ever <p>ComposeDB is built on Ceramic’s Web3 event streaming network, so you can trust that it is decentralized, secure, verifiable, and fast. ComposeDB indexes Ceramic data, improving query performance.</p> What’s included in ComposeDB Beta?  <p>The Beta release of ComposeDB includes all the core features needed for developers to build fully-composable Web3 graph data applications to Ceramic Mainnet. ComposeDB Beta (v0.4) introduces the following improvements over previous versions.</p>  ⏳ History Sync: History Sync brings full composability to ComposeDB, letting developers instantly sync the full history of all data associated with any model they add to their application  🔍 Query Performance: Server-side GraphQL query execution brings faster query speeds, more responsive applications, and better user experiences. It also makes ComposeDB more optimized to support popular GraphQL clients like Apollo and Relay  ✅ GraphQL Types: We’re continually adding support for more GraphQL data types. Now you can use <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-modeling/schemas?ref=blog.ceramic.network#enums">Enums</a> and new <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/api/sdl/scalars?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Scalars</a> in your ComposeDB schemas, letting you write more strict or expressive models  🔢 Future-Proof Models: Model versioning ensures data models created today are future-proofed against changes and upgrades to the data models protocol in the future  📖 Updated Docs &amp; Guides: New <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB docs</a> make it easier to get started developing with better information, more examples, and detailed <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides?ref=blog.ceramic.network">guides</a> on data modeling, performing queries, and mutations  <p>During Beta, Mainnet applications will be rate-limited by default to ensure the network remains performant under load. Apps that have previously deployed to Ceramic Mainnet are not impacted by this. </p>  📧  If you need &gt;200 requests/second, email us at <a href="mailto:partners@3box.io?ref=blog.ceramic.network">partners@3box.io</a>.   Ceramic Upgrades  <p>The Ceramic protocol and network infrastructure have been meaningfully improved to support ComposeDB’s Mainnet debut. </p>  🔑 Self-Serve Mainnet: Developers can now onboard their node to Ceramic Mainnet in under 5 minutes without needing to contact any community members  ⚓️ Improved Anchoring: The Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is responsible for finalizing Ceramic transactions by time-stamping them into the Ethereum Mainnet blockchain. This service has improved performance, providing more scalability and stability to the network  📌 Secure Pinning: A security hole has been closed, ensuring only node admins are able to pin and unpin streams on your Ceramic node  🛠 Improved Pubsub: Ceramic now works with a new version of IPFS Kubo, formerly named go-ipfs, to mitigate a pubsub flood issue with more proactive limiting. Thank you to Protocol Labs for helping us expedite this important fix 🙏. We strongly recommend this upgrade to improve stability, <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/please-upgrade-ipfs-to-kubo-v0-18-1/932?ref=blog.ceramic.network">see this post</a> for details on how to upgrade Kubo.  🚩 ComposeDB by Default: ComposeDB now runs by default on your Ceramic node. Previously, ComposeDB was only enabled through experimental ENV variables or CLI flags   Future Improvements  <p>Ceramic core devs are already working on supporting the most requested features and improvements. If something you want isn’t on this list, drop a post in the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/c/graph/9?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>.</p>  Performance and Stability: Continual optimization across all parts of the Ceramic and ComposeDB stack. Particular focus on the speed of queries and history syncs as well as more robust network monitoring  Complex Queries: Support queries that span multiple graph relationships. This will enable developers, for example, to get all posts by anyone a user follows in a single query, to get all data for an account, or to query specific fields within a model  More GraphQL Types: The goal is to support as many native GraphQL data types and schema rules as possible, such as regex. The next data types to be added will likely be date and time scalars  Evolvable Schemas: Support the evolution of schemas over time to better fit the development flow of most applications that launch with something simple at first and then add or change features. Today, models are immutable and once they are created they cannot be changed  Model Catalog UI: A simple UI that makes it easier to find and use relevant and popular models, improving on today’s DX of using the ComposeDB CLI to discover models in the catalog  Deployment Scalability: Enable larger-scale deployments of Ceramic and ComposeDB to support applications that require much greater scale, reliability, and uptime than can be provided by a single node. This may include clustering to unlock stability, high availability, and horizontal scale   Getting Started With ComposeDB  <p>There are lots of resources to make it as easy as possible to get started developing with ComposeDB:</p>  Jump into the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Docs</a>  Try the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/getting-started?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Quickstart</a>  Read the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Guides</a>    💡  If you've already been working with ComposeDB, see this <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/please-upgrade-ipfs-to-kubo-v0-18-1/932?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum post</a> on upgrading to the newest Ceramic version.

<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) has joined the Linux Foundation’s OpenWallet Foundation (OWF). The OIDF is among the first of Non Profit, Standards Development Organizations to be approved as an Associate Member. Others include ID2020, MIT, Open Identity Exchange, and the Secure Identity Alliance.</p>
<p>Throughout the OWF’s formation, OIDF members have contributed to OWF’s organization design and technical development agenda.</p>
<p>OpenID Foundation Chair, Nat Sakimura said, “The experience and expertise of global technical Standards Development Organization (SDOs) like the OpenID Foundation and others can help guide the OpenWallet Foundation and increase opportunities for industry and governments.&nbsp; Collaboration among SDO’s can facilitate and accelerate technical development for all stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Associate Members are expected to have an “ambassador-like” function, a two-way role Associate Members can uniquely provide. One is external: tell the OpenWallet Foundation story to a diverse group of international stakeholders including OIDF members. The second: bring the OIDF’s &nbsp;learnings and recommendations to the OpenWallet Foundation Board, members and stakeholders.</p>
 
 
 
<p>In the next few months, the OpenID Foundation will co-publish a series of whitepapers on key changes in the Identity landscape. Through the wide lens of these papers, the Foundation will speak to the OWF’s Open Source Project and its potential role and alignment with other global interoperability initiatives like the GAIN Global Assured Identity Network. Efforts like these are an important part of how the OIDF delivers on its vision to help people assert their identity wherever they choose and its mission to lead the global community in creating identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving.</p>

<p>Overview</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation board of directors established the <a href="https://openid.net/2022/04/08/announcing-the-2022-openid-foundation-kim-cameron-scholarship/">OpenID Foundation Kim Cameron Award Program in May 2022</a>. Our goal is to encourage representation from young people who have an interest in subjects consistent with the OpenID Foundation Mission, in creating identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation Kim Cameron Award is a recognition of the importance of mentoring a new generation of technical domain experts and thought leaders in user centric identity. The Award go to those who’ve demonstrated academic and practical interests in subjects consistent with OpenID Foundation’s Mission. The Foundation is collaborating with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity Conference</a>&nbsp;(EIC), Authenticate and&nbsp;<a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a>&nbsp;Conference organizers to maximize the value of the awards for recipients and the community at large. The OpenID Foundation Kim Cameron Award Program complements similar efforts in partner organizations to ensure diversity, international access and opportunities.</p>
<p>Award recipients will be studying, researching, interning, or working in a field relevant to&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/">OpenID Foundation working groups</a>&nbsp;and consistent with Foundation’s Mission. The recipients will be invited to participate in Foundation breakout meetings at the conferences to provide exposure to both the Foundation’s leadership and leading industry technologists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Award Request Process</p>
<p>The 2023 Kim Cameron Award includes complimentary admission to designated conferences and a $2500 per diem for travel, lodging and meals. Award recipients will be required to submit a blog detailing their experience at the conference to be published on the Foundation’s website and promoted via social channels.</p>
<p>Those interested are to send a request for award (and questions) to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a> with “2023 Kim Cameron Award Request” in the subject line. The request is to include:</p>
 
 300 words or less essay describing why the individual requesting the award is deserving, how it aligns with their current studies/work and how it will help them advance their career in digital identity 
 The conference of interest and indicate if the submitter has an accepted presentation at this conference of choice 
 A brief professional bio and headshot to be used if selected for an award to announce award recipients on the Foundation’s website and social channels 
 
<p>Please have approval to travel to the conference of choice should you be selected as an award recipient before applying for the award.</p>
<p>Award milestones:</p>
 
 Friday, March 24, 2023 – deadline to submit award requests for both EIC and Identiverse 
 Friday, March 31, 2023 – award recipients announced 
 Monday, April 3, 2023 – per diems to be processed week of March 27th so that awardees can plan travel 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Assist in Building the Award Program for the Future</p>
<p>The Foundation welcomes members becoming more involved in the award program and they may consider contributing human and/or financial capital via directed funding. For 2023, we anticipate more applicants and have more industry conference partners than we can accommodate.</p>
<p>We are collaborating with members, IDPro, Women in Identity and other partners to best serve applicants and grantees. The Foundation welcomes their continued participation.</p>
<p>Finally, these awards would not be possible without the support of the organizers of Authenticate, EIC and Identiverse so a big “thank you” to them for their continued support and encouragement of the award program in 2023.</p>

<p>First public review for Version 2.0 - ends March 29th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security TC are pleased to announce that CACAO Security Playbooks v2.0 is now available for public review and comment. This 30-day review is the first public review for Version 2.0 of this specification.</p>



<p>About the specification draft:</p>



<p>To defend against threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures, organizations need to identify, create, document, and test detection, investigation, prevention, mitigation, and remediation steps. These steps, when grouped together, form a cyber security playbook that can be used to protect organizational systems, networks, data, and users.</p>



<p>This specification defines the schema and taxonomy for cybersecurity playbooks and how cybersecurity playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions.</p>

 Energy Web is accelerating the European electricity market to enhance grid transparency and interoperability of clean&nbsp;energy <p>Energy Web recently participated in the European Commission’s consultation on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13668-Electricity-market-reform-of-the-EUs-electricity-market-design/public-consultation_en">Electricity Market Design</a>. Some of Energy Web’s key messages in this consultation focused on what we do&nbsp;best:</p>  To enhance grid transparency and interoperability of clean energy assets, data and workflows should be harmonized across the transmission and distribution interface  End users should have the ability to independently verify where their energy comes from at a granular&nbsp;levels  <p>Our comments included the following:</p><p>Increased granularity for EU’s guarantee of origin system: <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-green-proofs/">Granular Guarantees of Origin (GO) could increase legal certainty for investors and reduce greenwashing</a>. Increased granularity can improve Europe’sGO System as there is often no temporal and geographical correlation between generation and consumption events. It can also support an extended range of power purchase agreement offerings that could lead to further renewable expansion.</p><p>Flexibility Resource Registry: This concept is emerging as a critical infrastructure requirement for network operators to manage distributed energy resources (DERs) and unlock demand flexibility. Flexibility Resource Registries, developed either at the European level or national level, based on a set of harmonized rules and <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-data-exchange/">decentralized, interoperable open-source architecture</a>, can provide transmission system operators and distribution system operators with access to a shared registry,enabling them to have greater visibility and access to services from customer-owned resources connected with their networks.</p><p>Distributed Energy Resources and Energy Communities: Harnessing demand-side flexibility from DERs and energy communities give grid operators new tools to balance an increasingly decarbonized grid.. Energy communities should not be limited solely to community trading, nor should DERs be limited to self-consumption; they should be allowed to actively participate in flexibility markets and engage in trading within and across energy communities.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.

 Newly registered domain names enable small business owners to easily accept payments from customers 



<p>TEMPE, Ariz.,&nbsp;Feb. 23, 2023&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — GoDaddy Inc. (NYSE:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/godaddy-launches-payable-domains-reimagining-the-domains-role-in-business-301754432.html#financial-modal">GDDY</a>), the company that empowers entrepreneurs around the world, today announced the launch of Payable Domains, which allow entrepreneurs to register a new domain and easily start accepting payments from customers. GoDaddy is the first company to seamlessly bundle payment technology with the brand power of a professional domain – at no additional cost – to help small business owners start growing from day one.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than 30 years, domain names have been essential to the digital identities of entrepreneurs and companies worldwide. Yet during this time relatively little innovation has occurred–– until now. Powered by&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3790836-1&amp;h=973874803&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Faboutus.godaddy.net%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2Fpress-release-details%2F2021%2FIntroducing-GoDaddy-Payments-Fast-and-Secure-Payments-for-Small-Businesses%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;a=GoDaddy+Payments">GoDaddy Payments</a>, Payable Domains are branded pay links that create a secure checkout page, shareable via a link, that enable U.S.-based domain name customers to begin accepting payments shortly after they purchase a newly registered domain, even if they do not yet have a website or online store. Any domain purchased after, or for any existing domain owners, the respective Payable Domain can be&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3790836-1&amp;h=630591174&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Fhelp%2Fconnect-a-domain-to-online-pay-links-41120&amp;a=accessed">accessed</a>&nbsp;through their GoDaddy back-end dashboard.<br><br>Combining the ability to accept payments with the credibility of a domain name enables small businesses to get up and running instantly. Small business owners can easily share their Payable Domain with customers through text, social media, QR code and more—and with GoDaddy Payments’ industry-low transaction fees of 2.3% +&nbsp;$0.30&nbsp;per online transaction, they will keep more of what they make.</p>

<p>“While there’s been innovation around add-on products for domain names, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3790836-1&amp;h=2892273127&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Fdomains%2Ffull-domain-privacy-and-protection&amp;a=Domain+Privacy+and+Ownership+Protection">Domain Privacy and Ownership Protection</a>&nbsp;services, not much has been done to enhance the capability of domain names themselves,” said GoDaddy President of Domains&nbsp;Paul Nicks. “Domains have largely been used as a digital identity for businesses, but with this new commerce capability we view the domain name taking on a far more versatile role for up-and-coming small businesses. The Payable Domain ultimately serves as an innovative and cost-effective tool for entrepreneurs to accept online payments before even setting up a website.”</p>



<p>Now when a&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3790836-1&amp;h=661576838&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Fdomains&amp;a=domain+name">domain name</a>&nbsp;is registered, its usefulness is no longer contingent on its owner creating a website and publishing content. Instead, domain owners can quickly start taking payments via their enabled Payable Domain. For example, if a person registers the domain of their name or business, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.roohshad.co/">www.roohshad.co</a>, they will then receive the corresponding Payable Domain, pay.roohshad.co, to accept payments. Once that first payment is received, domain owners can then link a bank account to their GoDaddy Payments account, complete the verification process, and receive payouts for transactions just as they would with any other payments service. Payments are processed securely and efficiently, with funds deposited into users’ bank accounts as early as the next business day.</p>



<p>In addition, small business owners can customize their Payable Domain with their company logo, product images, cost of their products or services, or other branded content to create a seamless checkout experience and maintain a personal and professional look.</p>



<p>“We’re intensely focused on building connected commerce solutions that make growing a business easier, whether you’ve just named your business or are in the process of expanding its sales across the country,” said GoDaddy President of Commerce&nbsp;Osama Bedier. “With Payable Domains, it’s never been easier to start selling online.”</p>



<p>Payable Domains is just one part of GoDaddy’s expansive push to provide businesses with payment solutions out of the box. GoDaddy Payments is integrated and easily enabled in a host of GoDaddy commerce products, including GoDaddy’s Website Builder, Managed WordPress and Managed WooCommerce Store plans, GoDaddy Point of Sale and more. This latest innovation strengthens GoDaddy’s suite of connected commerce tools that empower entrepreneurs with everything they need to start, grow, and scale their business.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, March 1, 2023  –Based upon the diverse connectivity and technical capabilities of the Edge network, EdgeNet, University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey has recently selected Edge as their internet services provider. As the principal teaching hospital of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences and a Level 1 Trauma Center and resource for critical care, University Hospital required a secure connection to geographically diverse Points of Presence on the network.</p>
<p>Edge has partnered with University Hospital since its inception as the University of Medicine &amp; Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ). In 2013, this state-run health sciences institution was restructured, with most of the schools being transitioned into Rutgers University. At that time, legislation also made University Hospital an academic medical center with its own board of directors. “Until very recently, University Hospital relied upon Rutgers for networking services,” explains Bruce Tyrrell, Associate Vice President Programs &amp; Services, Edge. “Over the last couple of years, we have been working with the hospital and Rutgers to provide migration services that help separate their networks and deploy the infrastructure necessary to connect University Hospital to a colocation facility. We are excited to have been recently selected by the hospital as their internet services provider to help manage redundant connectivity and deliver a highly survivable, highly available networking experience to connected members.”</p>
<p>Edge provides internet services from multiple Points of Presence on the EdgeNet network, where volumetric Distributed Denial Of Service mitigation is included at no additional cost and without added technical complexity. EdgeNet supports 100% of member demand, ensuring that an organization’s traffic is never impacted by the network activity of another member. Designed with redundant nodes and Internet transit providers distributed throughout the state, EdgeNet offers superior network connectivity and advanced features that meet the evolving needs of high-speed research and collaboration and help members to take advantage of the latest developments in networking technology.</p>

<p><a href="http://index.as/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index.as</a> is a Web3 native, no-code, organizational and content curation tool taking aim at the content discovery space. It offers creators, curators, and topical experts the ability to create their own search ecosystems and independently control the value of their curation. The Index team chose to build on Ceramic's new decentralized graph database, <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a>, because of its ability to facilitate decentralization and support interoperable ownership and discovery.</p><p>Index.as is building tools to enable context-based discovery to become as powerful as social discovery. Platform-controlled content distribution purposefully inhibits cross-platform discovery and seeks to capture and hold hostage user attention. This limits users’ ability to discover engaging, interesting information outside of these silos, trapping them with the same or irrelevant content instead of revealing corners of the internet that pique curiosity and delight. Additionally, these businesses wrest value away from creators, concentrating power at the distribution layer. To solve these problems, Index.as set out to build a tool that helps builders, creators, and communities connect atomized information without creating another walled garden—opening vast opportunities for authentic content playgrounds.</p> How it Works <p>Data ownership, signing and authorization via DIDs and interoperability with shared schemas offered Index.as a reliable framework to build on top of. Indexes are schemas that represent context and become curated maps based on users’ tastes and motivations. They act as niche, topic-based search engines that are both searchable and filterable. For example, product curations are automatically sortable by price, brand, or event, and can be filtered by date, location, and other relevant criteria.</p><p>Additionally, it allows the product to index data from specified models such as profiles, indexes, and links and makes it easy to define one-to-many relations between documents. Every new element in an index (e.g., a product, video, or article) can be related to the Index document, creating a complete and interoperable graph.<br><br>You can learn more about how Ceramic powers applications <a href="https://ceramic.network/how-it-works?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p> Composability in Action <p>Index.as’s partners are collaborating on developing and reusing data models on <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> (Ceramic's composable graph database) for a variety of use cases. Veeo is focused on an interoperable web annotation model to support knowledge mapping. <a href="https://www.csensemakers.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Csensemakers.com</a> is leveraging the aforementioned index schema to enable decentralized curation of scientific research.</p><p>Developers can access a wealth of data simply by reusing established models, all while keeping ownership, access and authorization in the hands of users. Veeo and Csensemakers are bypassing the time and resources required to build and maintain siloed data structures by collaborating across models built in ComposeDB on Ceramic, and are speed-running the process of building network effects by automatically populating their dApps with network data.</p><p>Index.as is excited to continue development, first with multi-user curation and role-based access control via NFTs enabled by Lit Actions and subsequently with private indexes, incentivizing creators and curators to invest in developing experiences meeting the unique interests, tastes, and needs of their communities.<br><br>If you're interested in building your application on Ceramic you can learn more <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a> or ask questions on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a>. </p>

<p>It is hard to imagine a world without passwords. They remain the most-used authentication method for consumers according to the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance’s annual Online Authentication Barometer, despite the fact that passwords almost universally fail at keeping accounts secure and preserving a smooth user experience. The death of the password will be a huge relief for users, removing the need to remember or type passwords and enabling better user experiences. For organisations, the upsides are just as powerful, with a passwordless future offering better improved security, reduced risk of data breaches and lower support costs. As we enter the new year, 2023 seems set to be the year when passwords finally become an endangered species.</p>

In any case, the tech giants, Microsoft, Google and Apple in the lead, within the FIDO Alliance, are doing everything to ensure that the adoption happens as soon as possible. To quickly summarize what we had already explained previously, authentication without passwords, or passwordless , has, as its name suggests, the purpose of allowing you to connect to sites and services without passwords.</p>

<p>ISO Publishes Registry and Repository Standard from OASIS to Securely Manage and Disseminate Information&nbsp;</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, 23 February 2023 — OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced that the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/regrep/regrep-core/v4.0/os/">OASIS Electronic Business eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) Registry and Repository (RegRep) v4.0</a> has been published as a global standard by the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO) as <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/83479.html">ISO 15000-3</a>, Electronic business eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) – Part 3: Registry and repository. ISO 15000-3 is one of many data and documents standards approved by <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/53186.html">ISO Technical Committee (TC) 154</a>.</p>



<p>Originally produced by the OASIS ebXML Registry Technical Committee (TC), ebXML RegRep v4.0 is a standard that defines the service interfaces, protocols, and information model for an integrated registry and repository. The repository stores digital content while the registry stores metadata that describes the content in the repository. The ebXML registry standard has been deployed in diverse applications by organizations worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ebXML RegRep standard allows for greater interoperability and cooperation between public and private authorities. Versions of ebXML RegRep are used in domains such as healthcare and geospatial information. The current version of the standard is adopted by one of the European Commission’s initiatives, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/OOTS/OOTSHUB+Home">Once-Only Technical System</a> (OOTS) for exchange of official documents and data for EU citizens and businesses. It is also used in OpenPeppol in pre-award electronic tendering specifications: “<a href="https://docs.peppol.eu/pracc/profiles/p006/index.html">Search Notices</a>” and “<a href="https://docs.peppol.eu/pracc/profiles/p008/index.html">Publish Notice</a>”.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ebcore/">OASIS ebXML Core (ebCore) TC</a> provides continued maintenance and related work on ebXML RegRep and other OASIS ebXML specifications. Its newest specification added an <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/ebcore/ebrr-ebms/v1.0/cs01/">ebXML Messaging binding for RegRep</a>.</p>



<p>“It is great to see ISO and OASIS working together in order to advance the ratification of ebXML specifications, in this case ebXML RegRep,” said Nikola Stojanovic, an author of the ebXML RegRep standard. “Congratulations to the EU teams on implementing such major initiatives while leveraging the ebXML RegRep standard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Single Market is one of the EU’s greatest achievements. Online procedures mean that ever more citizens and businesses can make use of their rights and live, work, and do business in different EU countries. Through the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, the Commission and the EU Member States are implementing a large-scale distributed system called the Once-Only Technical System supporting the exchange of evidence in administrative procedures,” said Joao Rodrigues Frade, Head of Sector at the Directorate-General for Informatics of the European Commission. “The Once-Only Technical System will use OASIS RegRep version 4.0 as a key specification for the common services and secure exchange of evidence i.e. official documents exchanged by public administrations on the explicit request of the citizen. In this context, we welcome the adoption of this specification as use of open standards is a core principle of the Once-Only Technical System architecture.”</p>



<p>“OASIS ebXML RegRep is a robust specification for the definition of queries and realization of data requests to public registries,” said Andriana Prentza, Professor at University of Piraeus. “It has been proven very valuable in the realization of the once-only principle and implementation of data services that enable the service discovery and exchange of information between data consumers and data providers.”</p>

 We need everyone around the table to move AI principles into practice. <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/maroussia-levesque">Maroussia Lévesque</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tom-zick">Tom Zick</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/dredeker">Dennis Redeker</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/you-jeen-ha">You Jeen Ha</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/florian-martin-bariteau">Florian Martin-Bariteau</a>, and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/mkortz">Mason Kortz</a> — inspired by discussions within the Rebooting AI Working Group at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;&nbsp;Society</p><p>The White House recently released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>. It consists of five high level principles and supplementary information detailing its relevance, expectations, and examples of good practices.</p><blockquote>We propose to build on the Blueprint, opening up the conversation between and across people working on AI governance from various&nbsp;fields.</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/about-this-document/">legal disclaimer</a> is careful to say that this is ultimately a non-binding white paper, so any expectation of binding legislation is off the table for now. The Blueprint aligns with a history of aspirational, yet mostly non-binding documents that articulate people’s rights and technology governance principles in the digital age. Such <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2687120#">Internet bills of rights</a> have been proposed by various actors including tech firms, civil society, and states. Even more closely related, documents outlining <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42160420/HLS%20White%20Paper%20Final_v3.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">AI principles have proliferated around the world</a>, mostly non-binding and mostly as high-level principles.</p><p>Yet the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights stands out from other such documents in several respects. First, the document was drafted in a relatively inclusive one-year process, which has been <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/listening-to-the-american-people/">well documented</a>. Second, it adopts a civil rights framing. Civil rights come with a body of clarifying case law, enforcing institutions and mechanisms, and a shared vocabulary to articulate, contest, and redress harm. Third, concrete <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/10/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-key-actions-to-advance-tech-accountability-and-protect-the-rights-of-the-american-public/">executive/administrative actions</a> accompany the Blueprint. This signals a comprehensive governmental approach to AI policy that is often missing and may allow the Blueprint to percolate across the various nooks and crannies of government. Fourth, the Blueprint attempts to complement high-level guidance with cues for implementation. In our opinion, this crucial piece is often missing to bridge ambitious policy ideas to the nitty-gritty task of implementation.</p><p>In this post, we explore how to further specify the Blueprint’s principles into workable guidance for engineers and others on the ground. We propose to build on the Blueprint, opening up the conversation between and across people working on AI governance from various&nbsp;fields.</p> Now what? <p>The Blueprint provides an opportunity to further translate general guidance into technical specifications for industry adoption. While “plug and play” recipes are challenging in light of the contextual variability across deployments, academic and civil society organizations can play a key role in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533091">mediating between theory and practice</a>. The Blueprint’s breath is vast, but two areas conducive to such specification are discrimination and explanation. In what follows, we propose concrete ways for multi-disciplinary groups to narrow the gap between high-level statements and implementation.</p><p>Discrimination</p><p>The technical companion to the Blueprint purports to provide concrete steps to move the principles into practice. Its section on disparity assessment suggests three types of metrics: demographic performance measures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, as well as calibration. While this is a step in the direction of more explicit guidance, it still leaves important questions unanswered for the technical community at the frontline of implementing protections against discrimination. To name but one obstacle, some fairness metrics are mutually exclusive, in the sense that satisfying them simultaneously is impossible when demographic subgroups fare differently. As the <a href="https://perma.cc/2WAM-7QPM">controversy</a> about risk assessment tools in the criminal justice system illustrates, equalizing error rates entails a loss of accuracy when the base rate differs between demographic groups. The devil is, so to speak, in the&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer as to what fairness metrics should prevail. But developing a common language to bridge high-level equality principles with the actual task of measuring a model’s performance is a good starting point. A shared vocabulary will foster transdisciplinary debates and avoid the proverbial two ships passing in the night. This is a two-way street: those with legal and policy training should strive to get a more granular understanding of the statistical theory undergirding fairness metrics, while technical experts should grasp the contours of legal and ethical implications. As examples of this sociotechnical approach, questions for further research&nbsp;include:</p>  What is missing from the proposed metrics in the Blueprint?  Which fairness metric is most compatible with legal obligations in a given&nbsp;context?  Who should make judgment calls about which fairness metric to constrain a model&nbsp;with?  Are the existing siloed institutions (e.g. developers conceiving models ex-ante; courts reviewing harm post-facto) capable of making such&nbsp;calls?  How should we (re)think the pipeline between the technical front-line implementors and external oversight?  <p>Explanation</p><p>Much like discrimination, the notion of explanation in a colloquial and legal sense differs from the technical conception. Moreover, explainability is subject to technical limitations that inhibit its efficacy in a multitude of ways. The implementation guidelines for the Blueprint bundle the notion of ex-ante and ex-post explanations.</p><p>On the ex-ante side, the guidelines prescribe documentation reporting “how the system works and how any automated component is used to determine an action or decision,” as well as stakeholder notification when the system has changed. Ex-post explanations are more like justifications. The guidelines state this “need not be a plain-language statement about causality but could consist of any mechanism that allows the recipient to build the necessary understanding and intuitions to achieve the stated purpose.” The guidelines emphasize the need for such explanations to be tailored to their use and validated by user experience research. That’s great. But how that plays out in real world systems can get complicated.</p><p>The guidelines correctly point out that explainability is an active area of AI research. This means that ‘explanations’ from AI can take a variety of forms, some of which may not comport with intuitive definitions of explainability. Some explanations can draw on the data used by an AI to reach a decision. Others are completely ex-post, meaning that explanations can be provided by an entirely separate AI system that has been trained to output explanations for the original system’s recommendations. In other words, one AI system produces recommendations, another explains them. Some initial questions that come to mind&nbsp;are:</p>  What level of sophistication do AI explanations need to reach before they can fill the role the Blueprint envisions? Which types of explanatory AI have cleared this bar (if&nbsp;any)?  What should be contemplated in ex-ante documentation given the type of AI&nbsp;system?  How much of the system should be described ex-ante versus how much can ex-post rationales be relied&nbsp;on?  What does it mean for models to be fully transparent?  How should techniques for ex-post explainability vary with risk&nbsp;levels?   Next steps for building on the Blueprint <p>Neither policy, law, or technical approaches alone can build on the Blueprint. Just like carpenters, plumbers, and electricians contribute to building a house, we need different expertise to come together. In terms of AI governance, this requires technical systems to surface facts for human oversight, rather than baking in opaque editorial choices that resist external review. Thankfully, we have references in adjacent areas on how to improve the interoperability between technical implementation and external oversight. For instance, <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">data nutrition labels</a> provide qualitative assessments to inform external evaluations of data provenance, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf):">model cards</a> foster transdisciplinary discourse on fairness by detailing salient model parameters, and <a href="https://cltc.berkeley.edu/reward-reports/">reward reports</a> do the same for continually learning AI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The Blueprint provides a foundation for aligning AI systems with democratic values and civil rights and liberties, but it is ultimately up to all of us to build on that foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/building-on-the-blueprint-9471276f2cce">Building on the Blueprint</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, February 23, 2023  – Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge, will join co-presenter Melissa Handa, IEEE Program Director Technical Activities, at the NorthEast Regional Computing Program (NERCOMP) Annual Conference for an exciting discussion of Research Data Management for Open Science. NERCOMP partners with EDUCAUSE to bring together leaders in the higher education IT community from across the region at the NERCOMP Annual Conference.</p>
<p>Held March 27–29, 2023 in Providence, Rhode Island, the NERCOMP Annual Conference brings together IT and library professionals, faculty, researchers, and higher education leaders from across the Northeast to connect and share their experience and expertise on the latest issues in the field. With a goal of promoting collective learning, attendees are able to discuss their successes and challenges in advancing innovation, including data-driven decision-making, supporting audiovisual and IT services, and innovating student success.</p>
<p>The Research Data Management for Open Science session will explore the fundamental aspects, benefits, and challenges of data management and the requirements for a unified data and collaboration platform. Features of the IEEE DataportTM platform which support Data Management by researchers will be explored and demonstrated. “Open access is critical for advancing science, scholarship, and society,” says Dr. Ghahramani. “The challenge of ensuring the long-term preservation and access to the outputs of scientific research, especially data sets produced by publicly funded research projects, has become a prominent topic in this country. Data management and sharing policies are also increasingly becoming a requirement to qualify for research funding. For research data management to become a higher priority for researchers, they must see a clear benefit from devoting time, attention, and funds to these purposes.”</p>
<p>“In 2023, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will implement an updated data management and sharing policy,” explains Dr. Ghahramani. “Like similar policies implemented by other research funding organizations, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), researchers will be required to submit a data management plan as part of any grant proposal. There has been extensive research into why researchers do and do not share their data openly, and the major themes that arise are lack of time and skills necessary to organize the data into a form suitable for sharing.”</p>
<p>Attendees of this session will explore trends and patterns in data management, the barriers that currently exist, and the specific skills and training that are currently in demand for data management professionals. “Developing a skilled workforce with diverse ideas, styles, and identities will require attracting more individuals to the data management profession, specifically from under-represented groups in the community,” says Dr. Ghahramani. “We must strive to enable equal access to resources and opportunities and believe in the individual ability of all to learn and grow. Melissa and I look forward to connecting with conference attendees and discussing how we can work together to accelerate institutional research efforts throughout the region.”</p>

 What is the OpenWallet Foundation? 



<p>The <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallet Foundation</a> (OWF), which <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-an-intent-to-form-the-openwallet-foundation">announced its intent to form</a> last September, formally launched today, February 23rd (press release: <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">English</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/fr/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">French</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/de/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">German</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/it/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">Italian</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/de/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">Spanish</a>). As an open source project of the Linux Foundation, the mission of the OWF is to develop a digital wallet “engine” that anyone can use to build secure, privacy-respecting, interoperable multi-purpose wallets. The OWF compares this wallet engine to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines">the open source browser engines</a> that currently power all major Internet browsers.&nbsp;</p>



 Why is this important to the ToIP Foundation? 



<p>The mission of the OWF is highly relevant to the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) since our mission (described in our <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">Introduction to ToIP white paper</a>) is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layers with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers.</p>



<p>In this architecture, referred to as the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">ToIP stack</a>, digital wallets play a prominent role at the very heart. They are the tool that individuals and organizations—even connected things—will use to generate and store cryptographic keys, obtain and present digital credentials, make payments, exchange cryptocurrency and NFTs, unlock cars and hotel rooms, sign digital documents, and perform countless other digital trust tasks.</p>



 What does the ToIP Foundation expect to contribute? 



<p>Since the missions of ToIP and OWF are so complementary, the ToIP Foundation is joining the OWF as an Associate Member. We will support the development of OWF code projects by providing requirements, specifications, governance tools, and best practices as to how OWF code modules can accomplish interoperability using the ToIP stack. For example, ToIP deliverables immediately relevant to OWF include:</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a> 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Architecture V1.0</a> 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification V1.0&nbsp;</a> 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0</a> 
 



<p>ToIP also has two task forces currently working on protocols that can be incorporated directly into OWF code modules:</p>



 
 <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">The Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force</a> is developing <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">the ToIP Layer 2 protocol</a> that will enable authentic connections between any digital wallets and agents. 



 <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">The Trust Registry Task Force</a> is developing the protocol that any digital wallet can use to query a compliant trust registry for governance information—for example to verify if an issuer is authorized under a governance framework to issue a certain type of digital credential, or if a verifier is authorized to request presentation of a certain type of credential. 
 



<p>ToIP anticipates a rich ongoing dialogue with OWF as its coding projects implement ToIP specifications and OWF feedback improves ToIP specifications, tools, and guides.</p>



 Why another Linux Project? 



<p>The OWF represents the largest global collaboration on open source digital wallets since the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">decentralized digital identity</a>. It represents an expansion of — and ideally a collaboration with — the Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries digital wallet project</a> that began in 2019 and currently powers a first generation of open source digital wallets, such as the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-wallet">BC Wallet</a> from <a href="https://bcdigitaltrust.info/">BC Digital Trust</a>. The OWF will also build on years of work on decentralized identity standards and open source code at another Linux Foundation sister project: the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF). OWF is a wonderful complement to ToIP, Hyperledger, and DIF as the LF projects working to directly enable a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust.&nbsp;</p>

 State-of-the-art approaches to cybersecurity awareness training are challenging the old employee education models 







<p>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, February 22, 2023 /<a href="http://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — CybeReady, provider of the world’s fastest security awareness solution, today announced the availability of a new&nbsp;<a href="https://cybeready.com/live-talk-with-the-ciso-for-the-city-county-of-san-francisco">on-demand webinar</a>&nbsp;featuring Michael Makstman, CISO for the City &amp; County of San Francisco and Michal Gil, Head of Product Development for CybeReady. In this webinar, Michael Makstman shares his experience of using positive training techniques, combined with advanced automation to motivate more than 30,000 employees to take an active role in mitigating cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Known for its progressive approach to deploying innovative technologies, The Golden City decided to shift from a legacy security training model to engage in a more effective employee-centric cybersecurity culture. During the webinar, he shares how a positive and more modern training approach, combined with advanced automation, now motivates over 30,000 employees to take a more active role in mitigating cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Michael Makstman mentions the primary challenges faced by CISOs today:<br>1. Understaffed and overburdened security teams with endless tasks, which are time-sensitive and essential for keeping the organization safe.<br>2. The focus of employees on their own professional development and KPIs who view cybersecurity training as a waste of time.<br>3. Workforce dynamics such as a high number of remote employees with high turnover rates which is now resulting in additional risk and uncertainty from new, untrained employees.</p>



<p>According to Makstman, “The role of a CISO is no longer limited to the technology aspects of an IT environment. Being part of a larger ecosystem, CISOs must be part of the business and understand employees and customers in order to make better informed decisions. It includes looking at business aspects, understanding employees, and understanding the potential ramifications throughout the decision-making process.”</p>



<p>When it comes to security awareness training, the CISO’s challenge is amplified. Cybercrime is escalating and so are the attacks employees are facing. Organizations must embrace change to address these evolving challenges, and create a new culture-based training.</p>



<p>To start building a cybersecurity culture, Makstman suggests the following:</p>



<p>1. Define your KPIs – Set measurable goals you can work toward and choose a solution that allows you to track progress over time.<br>2. Set employees up for success – Deploy a positive training approach with immediate feedback for maximum success. Training sessions should be short and embedded in employees’ work day to generate quick, rewarding engagements.<br>3. Communicate continuously – Conduct the training in ongoing cycles to create multiple opportunities for engagements and at the same time, yield multiple data points for adapting the training to each employees’ performance.</p>



<p>“CISOs today have a lot on their plate. Training employees can be a tedious task if the wrong path is taken, which often results in training taking a backseat to other activities,” said CybeReady’s Head of Product, Michal Gil. “Having a highly automated security awareness platform that communicates continuously and ensures progress is the preferred direction for CISOs today.”</p>



<p>Following the webinar, the following resources were shared to help cybersecurity leaders build an effective cybersecurity awareness program:</p>

 Learn how Blockchain Laboratories is using web3 to bring more trust and better ROI to ESG markets, and how you can too. 







<p>SHERIDAN, WYOMING, UNITED STATES, February 22, 2023 /<a href="http://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — In recent years, digital assets have emerged as a revolutionary new technology that is beginning to change the way businesses operate. Digital assets are a form of cryptographic token that can be used to store and transfer data in a secure, immutable, and reliable manner. The potential applications of digital assets are seemingly endless, and businesses around the world are beginning to adopt this technology in order to take advantage of its potential benefits.</p>



<p>An advantage of ESG digital assets is the efficiency they provide. By using digital assets, brands can quickly transfer assets and track ESG related data knowing that it is publicly auditable. This can help to reduce overhead costs associated with data management and transfer fees. Also allowing businesses to quickly and easily access and track their ESG data.</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/lionsgate.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/esg-tokenization-forecast.jpeg?ssl=1"></a>



<p>Finally, digital assets can also help to reduce the risk of fraud. By using digital assets, businesses can securely store and transfer data in a way that is nearly impossible to forge.</p>



<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and its Potential to Conserve &amp; Increase Biodiversity</p>



<p>Also in the last few years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has come on the scene and is beginning to change the way financial markets operate. DeFi is a form of blockchain-based finance that allows anyone to access financial services without the need for a trusted third party. This new technology has the potential to revolutionize the way industries operate, and one of the areas in which it could have the most impact is ecological conservation and regenerative finance.</p>



<p>One of the potential benefits of DeFi for conservation and regenerative finance is increased transparency in carbon markets. By using DeFi for carbon credits, businesses can ensure that their financial transactions are transparent and secure. This increased transparency can help to validate ESG claims, and provide supporting data for ESG reporting.</p>



<p>Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and its Potential to Protect Biodiversity</p>



<p>And in more recent years, regenerative finance (ReFi) has become a trending topic to fund ecological projects, protect biodiversity, and to support regenerative practices on many types of landscapes. ReFi allows individuals and businesses to access ESG markets and services in a publicly auditable way. This new Green Finance model has the potential to have a major impact on biodiversity conservation and regeneration.</p>



<p>One of the potential benefits of ReFi for biodiversity protection and preservation is increased transparency through using digital assets and distributed ledger technology to track the whole lifecycle of eco projects. Another potential benefit of ReFi for biodiversity protection is increased funding going to the eco projects. By using ReFi, eco projects can quickly and easily transfer funds with minimal overhead costs and without any delays. This can help to reduce overhead costs associated with financial transactions, and create more funding for the work on the ground by making easier for eco projects to fundraise.</p>



<p>Innovators at the crossroads of ESG digital assets and ReFi PaaS</p>



<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carbonlanddao-trust-esg-nfts-protect-133000486.html">Blockchain Laboratories has been at the forefront of ESG digital assets</a>&nbsp;and the ReFi movement. Since April 2021 Blockchain Laboratories has been working on building Carbonland Trust’s carbon credit registry on the XRP Ledger. And although there have been setbacks to overcome that caused the development timeline to be extended, lots of progress has been made, and the carbon credit tokenization platform is scheduled to go live in April 2023.</p>



<p>And in more recent times, Blockchain Laboratories started&nbsp;<a href="https://blockchainlaboratories.com/blockchain-laboratories-announces-partnership-with-intrinsic-methods-to-build-carbon-credit-registry-on-xrpl/">building a XRPL carbon credit tokenization platform for Intrinsic Methods</a>. Intrinsic Methods Registry will use XRP Ledger to issue Future Mitigated Units(carbon credits) from reforestation projects globally.</p>



<p>In the near future, Blockchain Laboratories will be on scene at some industry events to network and share about the web3 platforms that were launching in the 2nd quarter of 2023. In March the events on our schedule are the Climate Summit in Denver on March 1st, the World Sustainability Summit(we are presenting here) in Dubai on March 16th-17th, and the World Blockchain Summit in Dubai on March 20th-21st.</p>



<p>Our goal in attending these summits is to share about what we have learned from two years of intense R&amp;D. And to showcase and bring attention to the ReFi Platform as a Service(PaaS) that we have developed over the last two years. We know digital assets and DLT have the potential to bring radical transparency to the ESG and carbon markets, and strive to be thought leaders in the industry.</p>

<p>This will be the last release before ComposeDB Beta goes live on Mainnet early next week. The <code>Model Versioning</code> feature provides backwards compatibility, even as future updates are made to the models protocol. The rollout involves a wipe of all models and ComposeDB data currently on Clay testnet, with breaking changes to model indexing and configuration table structure.</p><p>This release will allow devs to experiment with the HistorySync feature.</p> Model Versioning &amp; Table Config <p>The new table config structure includes a <code>version</code> field. Follow these steps below to update:</p>  Stop the node &amp; update packages  If using <code>SQLite</code> delete the existing database found at:   <code>~/.ceramic/indexing.sqlite
</code> <p>3. &nbsp; If using <code>Postgres</code> connect to the DB and drop the following tables: <code>ceramic_models</code>, <code>ceramic_config</code>, and any tables starting with <code>kjz</code>(the index table).</p><p>Example Postgres Structure:</p> <code> Schema |                              Name               |   Type   |  Owner
--------+-------------------------------------------------+----------+---------
 public | ceramic_config                                  | table    | ceramic
 public | ceramic_models                                  | table    | ceramic
 public | kjzl6hvfrbw6c8c48hg1u62lhnc95g4ntsl...vsbjtw374 | table    | ceramic
</code> <p>4. &nbsp;Start up the node: you'll see <code>ceramic_models</code> and <code>ceramic_config</code> tables be created as part of the startup message.</p><p>5. &nbsp; Recreate your models using the latest <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-modeling/introduction-to-modeling?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB tooling</a></p> History Sync <p>History Sync enables developers to index models and sync all history for the model, enabling full backwards and forwards composability. History Sync will be run by default after the Beta release next week, but if you want a sneak preview, you can try out History Sync by adding <code>CERAMIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_SYNC='true’</code> when <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network#run-a-ceramic-node">starting your daemon.</a></p>  ComposeDB Beta on Mainnet <p>Thank you for your incredible patience and excitement leading up to our Mainnet launch of ComposeDB Beta on February 28th. We are less than a week away! Stay tuned for more details.</p>

<p>DIACC is hosting a series of spotlights showcasing our amazing female DIACC members in the digital identity space, noting the importance of diversity. These spotlights will be regularly socialized through DIACC’s LinkedIn and Twitter channels as well as our monthly member newsletters.</p>



<p>If you’re a DIACC member and would like us to feature your spotlight,&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/contact-us/">contact</a>&nbsp;us today to learn more!<br></p>


 
 


<p>What has your career journey looked like?<br>I started my career in media as a customer success manager, then got into media sales which lead to working in technology sales in business intelligence. From there I did some consulting and wound up in cybersecurity where I found my sweet spot: product marketing. From there I have focused on scaling and growing innovative technologies; AI and now digital identity. It’s a very exciting time to be contributing the to DI ecosystem globally.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?<br>I wanted to be the CEO of a international marketing agency and a part-time travel photographer for National Geographic.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>The barriers I’ve encountered&nbsp;are reflected across&nbsp;women in the tech industry:&nbsp;<br>1. Lack of mentors<br>2. Lack of female role models in the field<br>3. Gender bias in the workplace<br>4. Unequal growth opportunities compared to men<br>5. Unequal pay for the same skills&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Working for companies with cultures that match my value work/life balance, turning off slack, and prioritizing my personal and family life after 5 pm (easier said than done).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>❝Creating an environment that encourages girls from an early age to pursue technology fields is essential in advancing their participation in the workforce.❞</p>
Alana Bennett</blockquote>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Creating an environment that encourages girls from an early age to pursue technology fields is essential in advancing their participation in the workforce. Whether it’s donating to organizations, promoting young women in STEM, volunteering to mentor, or developing company policies that push for more diversity and inclusivity, there’s plenty to do to shape the future for many girls and women globally.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?<br>Representation is a key step in creating an inclusive and equitable environment where all employees can do the best work of their lives. Today’s companies are well aware that women in positions of power can lead to more innovation and better outcomes. Organizations can develop meaningful programs to develop technical talent, which not only supports women but helps diversify‌ representation and ideas, which often leads to even more innovation. Internships or job shadowing programs provide a chance for women to gain tangible technology skills. Mentorship programs that help employees learn, develop, grow and thrive in today’s ever-changing environment.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?<br>Income inequality compared to male colleagues, workplace gender bias and a shortage of female role models are among the main barriers faced by women working in the tech industry. Women are often underrepresented in leadership positions in tech companies. This can make it difficult for women to advance their careers and achieve their goals.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?<br>Advocate for yourself, and know that reaching outside of your comfort zone with the support of strong mentors and a company that shares your values can take you far.<br><br>Alana Bennet is the Product Marketing Director at <a href="https://atbventures.com/">ATB Ventures</a></p>

     <p>This lecture took place on 15 March 2023. </p>
<p>While many countries are trying to meet their climate goals, and companies are embracing ESG by moving away from ICE vehicles, higher utilization of EVs has boosted the demand for charging stations. EV charging infrastructure development is making headway, CPOs, corporates and fleet operators are adding more charging ports every day, and the charger hardware itself is becoming more user-friendly and interoperable, but there are other issues that must be addressed. Among them, how to avoid stressing the power grid and reduce charger downtime are top priorities.</p>
<p>ASJade Technology’s smart EV charging solution tackles these problems with advanced hardware and management software, allowing EV owners to keep their vehicles charged while maintaining a stable grid, providing utilities greater flexibility during times of increased need. It can be particularly useful for companies that operate many EVs or communities that have many private EVs that need to be charged but not necessarily all at once. Future work includes vehicle-to-grid or vehicle-to-home technology that can allow certain EVs to transmit electricity back to the grid during peak hours, or to power a home during an outage. When combined with decentralized renewables-generating platforms such as roof-top solar power along with battery energy storage systems, this can make EV charging even more flexible.</p>
<p>Besides, as more public charge points and networks are available, the EV-drivers are left with choice paralysis when planning a long-distance trip such as driving from Nuremberg to Porto. EV drivers will need to investigate and install several parking &amp; charging network apps that could use different payment methods. The lack of interoperability and trust among eMobility service providers and charge point operators led to fragmented charging network. One of the potential solutions to overcome this challenge is to incorporate decentralized identifier and verifiable credential service that enabled by consortia or Federated networks such as <a href="https://itn.global">ITN (Integrated Trust Network)</a>.</p>

 Multichain Decentralized Knowledge Graph: AI-grade Knowledge Assets Hub on the OriginTrail Parachain <p>This blogpost outlines the next development milestones within the scope of the multichain strategy pursued by the OriginTrail ecosystem and amends relevant sections of <a href="https://origintrail.io/roadmap#turing">the roadmap pertaining to the OriginTrail Parachain development and its overarching role in devising a future blueprint for </a>allowing more blockchain networks to integrate the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;(DKG).</p><p>The OriginTrail technology presents a unique two-layer decentralized system, designed for sharing trusted data as AI-grade knowledge assets made discoverable across the Internet. The core component, OriginTrail Decentralized Network hosts the multichain Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), integrated with multiple blockchains. With each blockchain connected to the DKG, the DKG semantic features of Knowledge Assets are enabled on that particular chain.</p> AI-grade Knowledge Assets are a new, dynamic resource for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The next generation DKG V6 is following the expected growth trajectory, with OriginTrail Parachain underpinning its cutting-edge features. The key innovation V6 brings are dynamic AI-grade Knowledge Assets, with prescribed ownership, designed to drive unprecedented potential network effects as they gain existence on the new DKG V6. The AI-grade knowledge asset represents a leapfrog innovation as a new, dynamic resource on the Internet with the following main features:</p>  Ownership through the non-fungible token (NFT): Each Knowledge Asset is created with an NFT token (inaugurally on the OriginTrail Parachain), enabling trusted ownership of the underlying structured knowledge;  Verifiability: Each Knowledge Asset state can be verified using a cryptographic proof on the blockchain;  Discoverability: Each Knowledge Asset has its own Unique Asset Locator (UAL), similar to how websites have&nbsp;URLs;  Asset knowledge graph: Knowledge Assets have AI-grade data structure and their growing knowledge graph can be private and public (e.g. metadata/indexing data is always public, the rest of the knowledge can be kept privately), thus capable of powering AI and ML algorithms in a fully decentralized manner;  Composability: Due to their underlying vehicle — the DKG, each Knowledge Asset can be connected to others to form a connected knowledge about anything (scientific research, supply chains, value transactions, IoT data…) and establish an unprecedented potential for the value generation based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metcalfe’s law on network&nbsp;effects</a>.  The anatomy of a DKG Knowledge Asset<p>You may learn about the growing number of solutions and industries that are being positively impacted by the knowledge assets&nbsp;<a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions">here</a>.</p> Multichain approach <p>The multichain approach, envisioned in the initial 2017 whitepaper, embodies the 3 key principles of the ecosystem — neutrality, inclusiveness and usability — driving the DKG expansion to blockchain ecosystems that benefit from the unique capabilities of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph.</p><p>With the recent launch of DKG V6 on the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, the DKG receives an additional, tailored blockchain environment to both further innovation on the DKG, as well as to devise new means and approaches to expand the infrastructure and creation of Knowledge Assets on other blockchains (Polkadot Parachains and EVM compatible networks alike). The potential value of knowledge assets interconnected across blockchain networks integrated in the DKG, will grow according to Metcalfe’s law of network&nbsp;effects.</p><p>After DKG V6 inaugural launch on ecosystem’s own L1 — the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, an important milestone was achieved, as this DKG-specific blockchain became both an AI-grade Knowledge Assets Hub for innovations in the semantic web space as well as an acceleration environment for developing new approaches for expanding the DKG to other EVM-capable blockchains (multichain strategy, starting with Polkadot Parachains). Each expansion will be decided within the OriginTrail community through an auction-like selection process (the blueprint to be rolled out in the<a href="https://origintrail.io/roadmap#metcalfe"> Metcalfe phase of OriginTrail’s roadmap</a>).</p><p>With <a href="https://teleport.origintrail.io/">nearly 85 million TRAC utility tokens teleported</a> to the OriginTrail Parachain (23% of circulating supply) to provide utility needed on the DKG V6, we now aim to address the following topics under the scope of the multi chain strategy within the Turing phase <a href="https://origintrail.io/roadmap#turing">of the&nbsp;roadmap</a>:</p>  Strengthening decentralization for the OriginTrail Parachain,  OriginTrail Parachain Token (OTP) availability,  OriginTrail multichain growth.   Strengthening decentralization for the OriginTrail Parachain <p>In the Turing phase of the roadmap, we will see the OriginTrail Parachain reach its maturity as a decentralized blockchain. This will be achieved by initiating the OriginTrail Parachain collators system, OriginTrail Parachain’s governance system and performing the sudo removal&nbsp;process.</p><p>Both collators and governance systems will be introduced through an RFC document open for inputs from stakeholders before their deployment on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet and mainnet. Both will also follow the good practices that we’ve already seen established in the Polkadot community and leverage some of the battle-tested components.</p><p>Successful integration of both components will be followed by the sudo key removal process, which will be detailed in the Governance RFC document.</p><p>RFCs pertaining to strengthening decentralization topics are planned to be released in&nbsp;March.</p> OriginTrail Parachain Token (OTP) Availability <p>As described in the OriginTrail whitepaper, OTP’s basic utility is to facilitate the transactions in the OriginTrail consensus layer (similar to ETH used on Ethereum). With the inaugural deployment of the OriginTrail DKG V6 on the OriginTrail Parachain, there has also been a growing need to access OTP to use the DKG v6 functionalities. Partially, this has already been addressed through the OTP bounty distributed during the TRAC Teleport process. Additionally, there are 4 other important developments coming in the Turing phase — the OTP sponsorship pallet, XCM enablement, OTP availability on Statemint (<a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/t/statemint-update-roadmap/1200">in line with their roadmap</a>), and Ledger hardware wallet support for&nbsp;OTP.</p><p>The OTP sponsorship pallet’s aim is to support the knowledge asset users by “sponsoring” the costs of gas fees for Knowledge Asset interactions (create, update, transfer) on the OriginTrail Parachain. By doing so, the core functionalities of the DKG v6 will be accessible to anyone even before additional options to obtain OTP tokens are available. The sponsorship pallet will substitute the need for a converter on the OriginTrail Parachain and will, before deployment, be also introduced in an RFC document detailing its implementation.</p><p>Another important milestone for OTP availability which will take place in the Turing phase is integration with Statemint via XCM. The exact timeline is largely dependent on the<a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/t/statemint-update-roadmap/1200"> Statemint roadmap</a> but is expected to happen in the coming months. This will allow anyone to obtain OTP on the decentralized exchange and transfer it to the OriginTrail Parachain using XCM to be used for DKG and OriginTrail Parachain functionalities.</p><p>Final availability milestone in the Turing phase is a dedicated OTP app on Ledger devices. We can confirm that through our collaboration <a href="https://twitter.com/_zondax_/status/1592173152364384256">with Zondax</a>, we have submitted the final version of the OTP app for review with the Ledger team. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/origin_trail">our Twitter </a>for any updates on the review process timeline.</p> OriginTrail Multichain Growth <p>The fact that the OriginTrail DKG is a network integrating with multiple chains has already proven valuable for efficiency and resiliency of the OriginTrail ecosystem. With the launch of the new OriginTrail V6 in December, we are also turning a new page in the OriginTrail Multichain approach, ensuring that the Knowledge Assets and its functionalities can be accessed across more blockchain ecosystems.</p><p>Opening access to blockchains other than the OriginTrail Parachain will start within the Polkadot ecosystem (leveraging the core Polkadot capabilities), followed by possibilities of other EVM-compatible blockchains to integrate with DKG as well. In the Turing phase, we are expecting 3 important developments in this process — the conclusion of the TRAC teleport process, integration with the Polkadot Snowbridge system and detailing the DKG integration capabilities and requirements for Polkadot Parachains.</p><p>The Teleport process for TRAC tokens started last August and has so far seen over 84 million TRAC get transferred from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain (23% of circulating supply). The teleported TRAC tokens are used to fuel the DKG functionality on the OriginTrail Parachain and have been implemented as a native token on Polkadot, allowing it to leverage all other Polkadot capabilities (including XCM transfers between Polkadot parachains). Teleport will conclude on 22nd of March 2023 with a total of up to 100 million TRAC having the possibility to be teleported from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>Following the teleport process, there are no planned movements of TRAC between Polkadot and Ethereum until the Polkadot-supported <a href="https://docs.snowbridge.network/">Snowbridge infrastructure</a> is in place. Their treasury proposal suggests a Polkadot deployment of the infrastructure in July 2023, which would be the requirement for further integration with TRAC to take place with an RFC detailing the process available before that, in the Turing phase of the OriginTrail roadmap.</p><p>Finally, the Turing phase will also see more details on how the OriginTrail DKG can get integrated on other parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing the first wave of multi-chain network effects. While all the details on the approach will be available at a later stage, it is expected that the approach will leverage core Polkadot capabilities like&nbsp;XCM.</p> Towards a human-centric knowledge economy <p>With the advent of AI-grade Knowledge Assets as the new resource on the Internet made possible with the DKG V6, the potential to spawn a human-centric knowledge economy has become a possibility. Each Knowledge Asset gaining existence on the DKG is discoverable and verifiable across the universe of otherwise disconnected systems, which constantly expands the value potential based on the Metcalfe’s law of network effects and then materializes in connections generated to form connected knowledge about anything.</p><p>The AI-grade Knowledge Assets hub on the OriginTrail Parachain is now envisaged to spawn new methods to bring the powers of the DKG to other parachains on Polkadot as well as any EVM-compatible blockchain, furthering network effects across a multiverse of communities. Upon validation of each reusable component within the OriginTrail-specific blockchain environment, more Web3 teams will gain a chance to leapfrog their value proposition with these strong semantic web fundamentals.</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Join our mission</a> in making the global economy work, by organizing the AI-grade Knowledge Assets!</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing trusted AI — grade knowledge assets. It leverages the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph that connects the physical world (art, healthcare, fashion, education, supply chains,&nbsp;…) and the digital world (blockchain, smart contracts, Metaverse &amp; NFTs,&nbsp;…) in a single connected reality driving transparency and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Advanced knowledge graph technology currently powers trillion-dollar companies like Google and Facebook.

<p>The death of the internet password has been proclaimed many times, but this time, it may actually be coming sooner than you think. Its replacement? The passkey.</p>



<p>Passkeys are the way of the future in basic internet security as they’re intrinsically more secure and phishing resistant, according to Kathleen Moriarty, the chief technology officer at the Center for Internet Security. As major companies including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL">Apple</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL">Google</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;work with the standards developed by the FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium — two organizations that create password authentication standards — to provide support for passkeys on their platforms, the list of organizations offering passkeys as an alternative to passwords is continuing to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Passkeys are an example of what security should be: seamless and invisible to the end user,” said Moriarty.</p>

<p>After the whole&nbsp;<a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2022/12/lastpass-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-recent-data-breach.html">LastPass</a>&nbsp;fiasco, many users are wary of entrusting their sensitive information to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/best-password-managers">online password managers</a>. But the era of password-protected vaults may soon be a thing of the past, as leading tech companies, including 1Password, are pushing for a new form of authentication technology that is more secure than passwords called passkeys. The company recently&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.1password.com/unlock-1password-with-passkeys/">announced</a>&nbsp;plans to support passkeys in the summer of 2023, allowing users to log in to accounts without using a master password.</p>



<p>This move follows the acquisition of ID authentication start-up Passage and the company’s announcement last year that users would soon be able to log in to apps and websites through its platform using passkeys. While 1Password already supports biometric authentication, CPO Steve Won believes that “For passkeys to be the way forward, it’s not enough for them to replace some of your passwords. They have to be able to replace all passwords – including the one you use to unlock 1Password.”</p>

<p>After hearing that&nbsp;<a href="https://niemopen.org/">NIEMOpen</a>&nbsp;was awarded the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2023/01/26/niemopen-initiative-for-information-exchange-and-csaf-cybersecurity-standard-win-oasis-open-cup-awards/">2023 OASIS Open Cup</a>, you may be interested in learning more about the new OASIS Open Project. With the assistance of&nbsp;<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a>, the current technology darling of the moment, here is a quick summary of what you need to know about NIEM.</p>



 What is NIEM? 



<p>NIEM, formerly known as the “National Information Exchange Model,” is a framework for exchanging information between public and private sector organizations. The framework includes a for using and extending the data model in information exchanges.</p>



<p>NIEM promotes scalability and reusability of messages between information systems which allows organizations to share data and information more efficiently. It was launched in 2005 in response to the U.S. Homeland Security Presidential Directives to improve information sharing between agencies following 9/11. Since then, NIEM has been updated and maintained in a collaboration between the U.S. federal government, state and local government agencies, private sector, and non-profit and international organizations with new versions released roughly annually.&nbsp;<a href="http://niem.github.io/niem-releases/5.2">NIEM 5.2</a>, the latest version released in December 2022, defines a set of common objects, “NIEM Core,” and 17 sets of objects that are specific to certain government or industry verticals, “NIEM Domains.”</p>

<p>We have increasingly been using applications on our mobile devices for everyday payments. In recent years, Apple and Google revolutionised the way we were using our phones for making secure digital payments, but without being aware, people had been using digital wallets long before then.</p>
<p>The beginnings of digital wallets were modest, initially storing different access passes, membership cards, coupons, or airplane boarding passes that still had to be visually checked by a human or provided a simple code for a machine scan. Nowadays, digital wallets are mostly associated with card payments and in some cases for managing crypto assets.</p>
<p>Use cases are however not limited to financial transactions. Developments of decentralised identity (DID) technology have expanded the use of digital wallets. In fact, digital ID is the foundation of all other possible digital services.</p>
 Digital ID is the foundation of all our future digital services 
<p>The web as we know it now is dominated by large platform-centric services (Amazon, Google) provided in exchange of personal data (Web 2.0). As the industry moves away from usernames and passwords as the defacto standard for authentication on websites and in digital transactions, wallets provide a user-centric approach for storing and managing private keys used for identification and authentication.</p>
<p>With the advent of verifiable credentials (VCs) as the most important artefact of decentralised identity, digital wallets can now be used to store and manage non-financial information, such as educational qualifications, professional certifications, and even government-issued identification. Verifiable credentials allow for the exchange of information in a trusted framework, between public administrations, citizens, and businesses. A recent study from Gartner indicates that over 30 per cent of national governments will provide digital wallets for identity for mobile phones by 2024. <a>[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials prove that “I am me” or “You are you” as the Holder. They are a digital version of a person’s identity card or qualification certificates, with all the entitlements that they may bring. VCs are digitally signed by the organisation or institution as the Issuer. Verifiable credentials are also instantaneously verified by third parties, be they governments or any other public or private organisation. Verifiable credentials represent every aspect of “My life”, — My Education, My Work, My Health – and can include my driver’s license, my diplomas, or my employment certificates. By storing these credentials in a digital wallet, individuals have greater control over their personal information and can easily share with a Verifier only what is necessary in terms of data.</p>
 Verifiable credentials reduce fraud and increase trust in digital interactions 
<p>One of the major advantages of verifiable credentials is the ability to reduce fraud and increase trust in digital interactions. Traditional paper documents are not only easy to fake, but indeed difficult to verify in online transactions, not to mention the very poor user experience with media discontinuity. With verifiable credentials, the authenticity and integrity can be easily verified through a digital signature or other cryptographic techniques.</p>
<p>Another advantage of this technology is streamlining processes like customer onboarding for online services. It follows the KYC principle, to automate and optimise otherwise inefficient and manual business processes. For example, in the onboarding process, instead of providing multiple forms of identification, an individual can simply share all required data attributes from various digital credentials in “one tap” which can be verified by the receiving organisation in real-time. This not only saves time but also reduces the potential for errors and increases security.</p>
<p>However, as with any other innovative technology, digital wallets also raise concerns about data privacy and security. Digital wallet providers must ensure that personal information stored in the wallet is protected against unauthorised access and breaches. Holders or individuals should be aware of the risks and take steps to protect their digital wallets and the information stored within, just like they protect their physical wallets or mobile devices.</p>
<p>The use of digital wallets for payments and identification is on the rise. We are witnessing how European Union is redefining its eIDAS framework with the introduction of European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) which is intended to be used by all Europeans across the EU member states in both public and private sector as early as 2024/2025 <a>[2</a><a>]</a>. As technology continues to advance and is adopted by society, it is likely that digital wallets will become a trusted starting point for every digital interaction in our digital lives.</p>

<p><br><br>Dear DIF community,</p><p>After my 3.5 years as the voluntary Executive Director of DIF, I am excited to announce my successor Clare Nelson who has joined as full time ED as of Feb 1st, 2023.</p><p>In reflecting on our progress and development over the last few years, I am incredibly proud of the evolution &amp; growth we’ve achieved.</p><p>DIF working groups have delivered various well received specifications like <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1">SideTree</a>, <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2">DIDComm</a> v2 and <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Presentation Exchange</a>. &nbsp;We’ve incubated <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDAuth</a> which grew to become a joint effort at the OpenID foundation. Many of the other working groups are making great progress around core elements in the technology stack like decentralized storage &amp; wallet security.</p><p>Membership has grown from around 80 members to over 350 companies and more than 100 individual contributors. DIF has established itself as one of the leading organizations in the broader (decentralized) identity ecosystem and established strong connections with partner organizations like ToIP, W3C, OpenID Foundation, Hyperledger, etc. - and in various cases, established cross-ecosystem collaborations like the DIF facilitated cross-community Interoperability Group.</p><p>Motivated by DIF’s goal to increase global access, education &amp; collaboration, we established virtual events, regional working groups, and special interest groups. In doing so, we educated hundreds of new people about what’s going on in our industry, established a more permanent exchange amongst organizations in the APAC region including a <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-Japan?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Japanese-speaking chapter</a>, and created industry-specific working groups around verticals like <a href="https://www.notion.so/Banking-and-Finance-SIG-b2d528af578d44699aeb742ed47b81d2?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Banking &amp; Finance</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-IoT?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IoT</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-Hospitality-and-Tourism?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Hospitality &amp; Travel</a>.</p><p>DIF as an organization has also evolved significantly. Working groups are largely empowered to operate independently. A technical steering committee (TSC) has been introduced to ensure strong communication &amp; collaboration across these working groups. The overall strategic direction &amp; leadership is provided by the Steering Committee, whose seats are now filled by members based on a yearly election process voted by all membership organizations, rather than based on financial contributions to DIF. &nbsp;DIF has introduced a free membership tier to increase inclusivity for members around the world, and has grown the supporting team from none to three members, whilst becoming a financially stable &amp; sustainable organization.</p><p>As DIF continues to grow and the ecosystem matures, the need for a dedicated Executive Director to bring the organization to the next level has become clear. Over the last months of interviews, we found an excellent candidate for the role. Clare brings a lot of experience in leading organizations, a strong technical background as well as industry experience. I am excited to work with Clare as I continue in my role as a DIF steering committee member. Stay tuned for a welcome message from Clare in her own words.</p><p>To sum up: It has been an honor to serve as the ED of DIF. I am inspired by all we have achieved together, and the positive impact our community can have in the world. I look forward to working with Clare, and all of you, in realizing the very best of these possibilities.<br></p><p>Rouven Heck</p><p>Executive Director at DIF 2019-2023</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Ceramic nodes operating on Ceramic mainnet must upgrade to at least version <code>2.20.1</code> of the <code>@ceramicnetwork/cli</code> package or the docker image before February 21st.</p><p>The Ceramic core team implemented the network's first hard-fork on February 15th. The team discovered a bug during post hard-fork validation related to an incorrect smart contract address. An immediate hot-fix was deployed to address the issue and will prepare Ceramic nodes to use the proper smart contract address.</p><p>As a result of the hot-fix, Ceramic nodes operating on the Ceramic mainnet must upgrade to running at least version <code>2.20.1</code> of the <code>@ceramicnetwork/cli</code> package or the docker image before February 21st. </p><p>We will continue to share status updates as we work on this via the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>. </p><p>Update Feb 22: You might see the AWS error below while updating, please disregard:</p><p>"NOTE: The AWS SDK for JavaScript (v2) will be put into maintenance mode in 2023. Please migrate your code to use AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3). For more information, check the migration guide at <a href="https://a.co/7PzMCcy?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://a.co/7PzMCcy</a>(Use <code>node --trace-warnings ...</code> to show where the warning was created)"</p> <p>Protocol Changes to Anchoring, Detailed<br><br>The upcoming ComposeDB Beta launch at ETHDenver includes HistorySync, the ability to sync historical data related to your models. Enabling HistorySync requires breaking changes to the Ceramic anchoring system.<br><br>There are two main changes we are making to the way anchoring (timestamping) works:</p>  Transactions to put anchor tree merkle roots onto Ethereum will no longer be simple regular transactions. &nbsp;Instead there will be an anchor smart contract and we will call an “anchor” function that causes the smart contract to emit an “anchor event” that ethereum RPC clients can subscribe to. &nbsp;This will make it easier for Ceramic nodes to discover when anchors happen and to sync the history of anchor events.  The second change is designed to make the system more resilient to block reorgs on Ethereum. Ceramic anchor commits will no longer include the specific blockNumber and blockTimestamp that the anchor event was included in, as it’s possible the transaction could later be reorged into a new block. Instead, Ceramic will only use the transaction hash and will look up which blockNumber the transaction was included in from Ethereum directly.  <p>Both of these changes require changes to the js-ceramic node implementation so that the node can still know how to verify and apply anchor commits with the new behavior. Nodes that haven’t upgraded will have failures when applying anchor commits.</p><p>Data update commits that fail to be anchored within the CACAO timeout period will then start failing to apply as the node will not be able to verify that the update was created during the time when the CACAO (the capability that gave the app permission to write into the stream on behalf of the user) was valid. This can wind up corrupting the state of streams and invalidating writes that seemed to be applied successfully at first, but then are later invalidated when their CACAO times out.</p>

<p>Cisco, Comcast, Dropbox, Indeed, Tencent America, TrustArc, Uber, U.S. NIST, and Other Leading Organizations Represent U.S. Technical Advisory Group Under ANSI and OASIS to ISO/PC 317</p> 


<p>New York, NY, and Boston, MA – 16 February 2023 — The U.S. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for Consumer Privacy by Design successfully concluded its mission with the publication of a new global standard approved by the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO). Administered by the <a href="https://www.ansi.org/">American National Standards Institute</a> (ANSI), in partnership with OASIS, the U.S. TAG was a major contributor to the new international privacy standard, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/84977.html">ISO 31700</a>, Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services. This standard represents the first set of preventative international guidelines for assuring that consumer privacy is embedded into the design of a product or service, offering protection throughout the whole life cycle.</p>



<p>Members of the U.S. TAG included leading U.S. companies and government agencies committed to privacy rights for consumers. The U.S. TAG carried U.S. positions forward to ISO Project Committee (PC) 317, the international committee that developed <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/iso/iso317002023">ISO 31700-1</a> and a related technical report, <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/iso/isotr317002023">ISO 31700-2</a>, with the input of 17 participating member countries. The U.S. TAG provided extensive input into both documents, promoting and representing U.S. interests at each stage of the process.</p>



<p>“ISO 31700 is a significant development. Both those with experience — and those new to the domain of privacy by design — will find this standard an essential tool to guide them in creating goods and services with privacy by design,” said Jonathan Fox of Cisco and chair of the U.S. TAG to ISO/PC 317. “The U.S. TAG is pleased to have played a part in bringing ISO 31700 to the global community as an international standard.”<br><br>“Data protection is the work of many. Regulators, organizations, and human interest organizations all have a role to play to ensure that data is processed with respect for human rights. The new standard helps provide tools for organizations looking to implement statutory protections and good privacy policy for the data they manage. It focuses on the empowerment of the individual, transparency into data processing, and accountability and responsibility by those who process the data,” said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive officer of the Future of Privacy Forum. “Privacy by design and default is an essential part of the process, ensuring that data is protected from collection to deletion when it is no longer needed. We congratulate the companies and government agencies involved in this work and ANSI and OASIS for their support.”</p>



<p>The standard will impact online service providers, mobile application developers, providers of digitally connected consumer technologies, and more.</p>



<p>ISO 31700-1 and ISO 31700-2 will continue to be guided by the OASIS Privacy Management Reference Model (PMRM) and the 27561 Privacy Operational Model and Methodology for Engineering (POMME) in development now (based on the PMRM).</p>



<p>ISO hosted a webinar on February 8, 2023, to introduce ISO 31700. <a href="https://share.ansi.org/Shared%20Documents/News%20and%20Publications/Links%20Within%20Stories/Webinar%2031700.pdf">Access the slide deck</a> from the event for more information.</p>



<p>Support from U.S. TAG Members<br>“Cisco is honored to have helped lead the U.S. Technical Advisory Group and contribute to the development of ISO 31700 – Consumer Protection, with Jonathan Fox serving as chair. This new standard will serve as an indispensable, tactical guide to privacy by design for companies of all sizes.” <br>– Harvey Jang, vice president, deputy general counsel and chief privacy officer, Cisco</p>



<p>“Tencent America is proud to have played a role in shaping international privacy standards as a member of the ANSI. Tencent is committed to connecting people, services, and devices, as well as businesses and future technologies, to create mutually beneficial ecosystems for all. With this in mind, we will continue to align with the globally recognized consumer privacy standard set forth in ISO 317.”<br>– Tencent spokesperson</p>



<p>“TrustArc was involved in the development of ISO 31700 from the outset and we believe that the publication of ISO 31700 highlights the importance for companies to build a culture of privacy and trust with consumers. Incorporating privacy by design principles throughout the life of a product is essential to helping companies meet their compliance goals.”<br>– Chris Babel, CEO, TrustArc</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>With a great sense of accomplishment, it’s exciting to share the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final.pdf">Digital Identity in Aotearoa: Identity and Trust in an Increasingly Digital New Zealand</a>&nbsp;report published earlier this month.</p>



<p>The report combines DINZ’s latest results from its survey of people and businesses carried out last year, with perspectives on the state of the growing digital identity ecosystem comprising local and international providers, government and business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ensuring people are delivered secure and privacy-aware identification, authentication and authorisation services, to support a trusted fraud-free digital economy in Aotearoa is the shared goal – and a complex one requiring a range of approaches as the reports’ recommendations make clear.</p>



<p>It also recognises that people have the right to choose a non-digital channel over the convenience of a digital one. Regardless, their personal information must be processed respectfully with the attendant care for security and privacy that it deserves. The concept of digital identity is quite new, with emerging tech continually fueling conversations to challenge yesterday’s status quo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation at the AWS sponsored Wellington event last week was terrific and I expect similar at the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-in-aotearoa-report-and-research-results-virtual/">online event on 9 March</a>. Such a pity that the cyclone forced the cancellation of the Air New Zealand sponsored Auckland event but I hope that all registered for that can make the online event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No doubt not everyone will agree with everything in this report. But that’s why this space continues to attract endless, if sometimes circular conversation that remains the essence of its attraction – it will never simply be ‘done’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please take time to read the report, form your view and share it with colleagues, iwi, hapū &nbsp;and whānau, to form their view as well as DINZ.</p>



<p>The conversation in Aotearoa will be all the richer for it.</p>



<p>Colin Wallis<br>DINZ Executive Director</p>

<p>The ToIP Foundation is pleased to announce the appointment of Judith Fleenor as full-time Executive Director. Judith is taking over the role that John Jordan, Executive Director of Digital Trust Services for the Province of British Columbia, has served in a part-time volunteer capacity since the Foundation’s inception in May 2020. John has been elected to serve as Chair of the Steering Committee.</p>



<p>Judith first joined the ToIP Foundation as Director of Strategic Engagements in May of 2021, a role in which she helped grow the organization to over 400 organizational and 100 individual members and coordinate the Foundation’s engagement at events including the Internet Identity Workshop, the European Identity Conference, Identiverse, and the ToIP 2022 Summit.</p>



<p>Judith recently sat down with John to have a conversation about her new position.</p>



<p>Congratulations, Judith. What was your reaction when the Steering Committee invited you to become Executive Director?</p>



<p>Frankly, I was surprised and honored when the Executive Committee came to me with the proposal. Titles have never been that important to me. I’ve always been about how I can use the skills I have and what I enjoy doing to help move an effort forward. One of my favorite sayings comes from Lao Tzu:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Go to the people.<br>Live with them. Learn from them. Love them.<br>Start with what they know.<br>Build with what they have.</p>



<p>But with the best leaders,<br>when the work is done,<br>the task accomplished,<br>the people will say<br>‘We have done this ourselves.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was an honor to be asked with a group of wonderful individuals who are all volunteering their time and talents to make a real difference in the future of the Internet. What could be more fulfilling than that?</p>



<p>What motivated you to initially join ToIP as Director of Strategic Engagements?</p>



<p>I have always had an interest in Identity and Access Management (IAM), dating back to my time as Director of Training Delivery Worldwide at Netscape. We were promoting the use of LDAP, and the courses we were giving on IAM made me quickly realize that digital identity goes way beyond the need for authentication and access. It is a very complex topic with multiple interweaving issues.</p>



<p>The reality is that the way we have been designing digital identity systems has not matched the way identity works in the real world, where we naturally share different identity attributes in different contexts. For example, in some contexts a person needs the freedom to be anonymous or pseudonymous, while in other contexts the need for individual and community security requires a greater ability to correlate.</p>



<p>As a result, the field of digital identity and trust is always interesting and challenging—even more so when you want solutions to be decentralized and vendor-neutral. It requires deep thinkers who look at problems from multiple perspectives. The ToIP Foundation is a place where these thinkers can collaborate to take on these tough challenges. As the song from the musical Hamilton put it, “I want to be in the room where it happens.”</p>



<p>What resonates with you about the mission of the Foundation?</p>



<p>The mission of the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) is to simplify and standardize how trust is established over digital networks and using digital tools. Our goal is to achieve this by bringing together (and developing when necessary) robust, common standards into a complete architecture for internet-scale digital trust.</p>



<p>While it is easy to state that mission, it is anything but easy to execute on it. It takes a high-functioning collaborative community to get it right. Very few of the protocols within the ToIP stack will be developed within the ToIP Foundation. Some are being developed at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), some at W3C, some at other standards development organizations. Some will be nurtured by multinational organizations, others by open source projects, others by entrepreneurs as yet unknown.</p>



<p>I think the part of the ToIP stack that most resonates with me is the central piece, the concept of a <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">trust spanning protocol</a> that can be used by other higher-level protocols for many different trust tasks, yet works across ecosystems built for different purposes. This is just like how the Internet Protocol works everywhere, yet supports many other higher-level protocols built for many different purposes.</p>



<p>This means we need the equivalent of an IP address, but for digital trust relationships—which is what the trust spanning protocol will provide. Note that I use the term “digital trust”, not “digital identity”, because when we say “digital identity” we most often think of humans, whereas the ToIP stack needs to work not only for people and organizations—in all their complexity—but for objects and data as well.</p>



<p>What are your top three priorities for 2023 in your new role?</p>



<p>Collaboration, Collaboration, Collaboration!</p>



<p>Seriously—the challenges we are trying to solve at the ToIP Foundation all require collaboration at three levels:</p>



 
 Collaboration between different working groups and task forces within ToIP itself. I want to work with our members and Linux Foundation experts to create better processes to facilitate that collaboration. 



 Collaboration across the various communities and foundations in the digital identity, credentialing, and business transactions space. I’d like to help reduce marketplace confusion about who is working on what, iron out differences, and focus on crossover work efforts. 



 Collaboration with government(s) to help educate and influence the adoption of decentralized digital trust infrastructure. For example, when governments begin issuing verifiable digital credentials that citizens can use to prove their identity – as digital versions of the same documents every government does for its citizens today in physical form, it has the potential to streamline and strengthen processes, while providing cost saving and added security. It’s no coincidence, John, that you are leading just such an <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023CITZ0003-000076">effort in British Columbia right now</a>. John, you are forging a path for your Canadian citizens that has the citizens’ best interest in mind. I want ToIP to be a resource for governments everywhere to understand that not all verifiable credentials methodologies are the same and that the choice they are making now, have long range implications. As governments roll out their solutions, it will be a massive boost to adoption. We need to help governments understand the implication of the decisions they are making to allow them to make the best decisions now.

<p>Because India is home to the <a href="https://becknprotocol.io/">Beckn protocol:</a> one that enables peer-to-peer e-commerce at scale without the big platforms taking a large cut of the pie just for matchmaking. The possibilities are endless and extreme—especially for customers and small businesses.</p>
<p>Beckn is open source (<a href="https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications">here on Github</a>),&nbsp;&nbsp;moving into deployment, and expected to grow toward ubiquity on the same slope as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar">Aadhaar</a>, the government ID now held by 1.35 billion people.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective,&nbsp;India has more people than all of Europe (even when you throw in Russia and Turkey), and more than twice the population of North America. Only China has more people, but India is ready to overtake it in <a href="https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/indias-population-will-overtake-china-by-2027-world-population-prospects-2019-1560850930-1">just four years</a>.</p>
<p>We will discuss all this and more&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://fide.org/founders/sujith-nair/">Sujith Nair</a>&nbsp;this coming Monday, 20 February, from 2-3:30 PM Eastern Time.&nbsp; He is the CEO &amp; Co-founder of <a href="https://FIDE.org">FIDE.org</a>, the nonprofit behind the Beckn protocol, and may have the clearest vision in the world toward an e-commerce future that isn’t contained inside big tech’s walled gardens: ones in which every business and every customer can operate with both independence and minimized friction.</p>
<p>This will kick off the Workshop’s next&nbsp;<a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/news-events/events/salon/index.html">Beyond the Web salon series</a>&nbsp;.

<p>Are you a civil society organisation or collective working within or with the health sector? Are you thinking about ways to collect, manage and store data more efficiently and securely? Are you looking to strengthen your organisation’s capacity around responsible data practices? Please read on, our Light Touch Support programme might be a great fit for you!</p>



<p></p>



 How we can support you 



<p>One of our goals for the year is to increase our offer of support to organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support</a> (LiTS) programme, we offer lightweight, pro bono support to organisations and individuals with questions about using data or technology in their social justice work. We work with a wide array of individuals and organisations, usually from within Latin America and Africa, most of whom work on some aspect of social justice. Our partners’ technical backgrounds are as varied as the work they do – some are looking for specific, technical advice on their projects, while others want to get more familiar with broader conversations around using data or technology in their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the beginning of a LiTS partnership, we connect with our partners to learn more about their work and understand the challenges they are facing. We then devise a support plan – the exact shape can vary and depends on the identified needs and context, but it often includes a mix of knowledge sharing, provision of technical feedback, drawing specific recommendations, facilitating connections to other organisations or experts, and sharing useful research, tools or resources.</p>



 Supporting organisations working on health and social justice&nbsp; 



<p>Organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice collect, manage and store a lot of data through community health projects, research programs and advocacy campaigns, and a significant portion of that data is often sensitive data that needs to be protected. Many organisations that reach out to us are interested in expanding&nbsp; capacity and expertise to securely and responsibly collect, manage and store data, particularly sensitive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data collected from civil society has the potential to complement and enhance official state data collected by National Statistical Offices (NSOs) on various pandemics and epidemics such as HIV, TB and COVID-19 and their impact on marginalised groups. The repercussions of those pandemics have contributed to broader conversations around data and public health, such as:</p>



 
 Advocating for health data that is inclusive: Who is not being counted and who is left behind as a result? 



 Investigating how data is being used and managed: Who has control over our data and what is it being used for? 



 Learning about the risks associated with data: Can health data be used to abuse marginalised and vulnerable populations? 
 



<p>For many organisations, these conversations have sparked reflections at the organisational level and, through our work, we see that many groups working at the intersection of health and social justice are grappling with questions such as:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Are the ways we collect, share and store data and information that are more secure and more responsible? 



 How can we decide on what data to keep, and which one to delete? 



 How can I explore if there’s a risk for our data to be accessed by unauthorised external parties?&nbsp; 



 How are the ways we use data impacting our work? 



 Are the digital platforms we use safe and effective for our context?&nbsp; 
 



<p>We support our partners by providing space to reflect on these questions, and offer tailored resources to strengthen organisations’ data practices and processes. </p>


 
<a href="https://calendly.com/the-engine-room"></a> 


<p>What do we mean by organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice?<br>By organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice, we are referring to civil society organisations working in the health sector in various ways, such as: advocating for access to care, addressing health inequities, influencing public health policy, providing support and care to beneficiaries, etc. This broad category can also include:<br><br>– Organisations focusing on specific health issues (such as HIV, TB, Malaria, or COVID-19),&nbsp; at a policy and/or advocacy level.<br>– Organisations promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and/or reproductive justice.<br>– Organisations working on human rights issues that involve a health component, such as LGBTQ+ organisations addressing mental health issues, trans organisations advocating for access to gender affirming therapy, youth organisations promoting access to sexual and reproductive health services for young people, and more.<br>– Organisations directly providing specific health services to communities.</p>



 Going beyond Light-Touch Support 



<p>Once your organisation has <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">engag</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">e</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">d with our Light Touch Support</a> multiple times, and it seems like you and your work might be a good potential fit for more intensive support, we may propose an exploratory call to discuss <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Matchbox-partnership</a> possibilities.</p>



<p>Through our Matchbox Programme, we support selected organisations, over a period of 6 – 8 months, to think through the design, development and implementation of their data and tech project or general strategy – customising the support to the specific needs and contexts of our partners. Matchbox support can include targeted research, matchmaking with other organisations, and tailored recommendations.</p>

 “INEEXS” project leverages digital technology to create new business models for utilities and energy service companies <p>ZUG, Switzerland, 14 February 2023 — Energy Web has joined a new, EU-funded initiative to enhance the value of energy efficiency solutions across Europe. The initiative, “Innovative Energy Efficiency Service Models for Sector Integration via Blockchain’’ or INEEXS, is primarily focused on improving the business case for energy efficiency with the help of open source digital technologies. To do so, INEEXS will enable market participants to exchange granular building, asset, and organizational data in a secure, privacy-preserving way. Solutions under the initiative will be deployed in Germany, Spain, Greece and one additional EU member country to be selected during the deployment process.</p><p>Energy efficiency and demand flexibility solutions continue to follow a positive growth trajectory across Europe. However, a series of technical barriers and regulatory challenges prevent these solutions from being adopted at the scale needed to facilitate the European Union’s transition towards a clean energy economy. INEEXS is primarily focused on overcoming technical barriers to progress by enabling energy service companies, retailers, distribution system operators, financial institutions, and distributed energy resource aggregators to exchange trusted data from organizations and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Over the next three years, the initiative will launch new technology and associated business models in support of this objective. As a first step, INEEXS will analyze five primary energy efficiency business cases, their legal requirements, cost structures, revenue streams, and benefits beyond cost savings in order to prioritize technology development activities under the initiative.</p><blockquote>“We couldn’t be more excited to bring our open source technology stack to this initiative” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “Energy Web solutions are designed to support this exact use case — enabling multiple market participants, each with their own information technology systems to exchange and trust granular data — in this case data powering energy efficiency solutions across&nbsp;Europe.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Elaborating innovative and fitting business models by active market participants is pivotal if we are to address the existential challenge of transforming the energy system”. Explains Filippos Anagnostopoulos, Senior Associate at IEECP and Project Coordinator. “The INEEXS project offers a unique opportunity to energy retailers, energy communities, technology developers, energy agencies and real estate companies to validate, replicate, adopt and roll concrete technical solutions with potentially transformative impact.”</blockquote><p>By adopting new digital technologies, methods, and tools to enable automated, accurate, fast and secure data exchange, INEEXS meets the key principles of the European Green Deal; More information can be found on the project webpage: <a href="https://ieecp.org/projects/ineexs/">https://ieecp.org/projects/ineexs/</a></p><p>Partners: IEECP — Institute For European Energy And Climate Policy (the Netherlands), HERON — Iron Thermoilektriki Anonymi Etaireia (Greece), NTUA — National Technical University of Athens (Greece), ESCAN (Spain), ENERCOOP- Cooperativa Electrica Benefica San Francisco De Asis Sociedad Cooperativa Valenciana (Spain), DOMX (Greece), VL — Verdia Legal (Spain), BEA — Berliner Energieagentur (Germany), OFFIS (Germany), Inlecom Group (Belgium), HIVEN (Finland), Energy Web Foundation (Switzerland).</p><p>Co-funded by the European Union under project ID101077033.

 The release of Energy Web’s Decentralized Data Hub on Microsoft’s Azure Marketplace significantly improves user experience for enterprise <p>ZUG, Switzerland — 13 February 2023 — <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-2022-lookback-navigating-the-storm-before-the-calm-9b056e02d8dc">2022 was a major turning point</a> for Energy Web. Whereas in the past much of our effort was devoted to innovation and experimentation, last year our focus shifted entirely to execution–specifically, delivering new features and functionalities across three core solutions.</p><p>We, and our community of enterprise members, are now crystal clear about what <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/what-we-do-the-grid/">problems we solve</a> and how our open-source software solutions create tangible business value. The question is no longer what we’re going to build, but how to streamline implementation.</p><p>As demonstrated by many other software categories with huge addressable markets, the best way to scale adoption and impact is to make our solutions available on-demand, with the click of a button. Or in other words, make EW-DOS look and feel like conventional enterprise Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).</p><p>In December we took the first step in this direction with the release of <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-now-available-on-amazon-9bb6c65375ca">RPC on AWS Marketplace</a>. Today we’re pleased to announce another step forward with the r<a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/energywebdevhubgmbh1670375546257.ewf-data-exchange-client-gateway?tab=Overview">elease of Data Exchange client gateway on the Azure Marketplace</a>. This is an important milestone, as it represents our first core enterprise solution component to be made available with a seamless user experience, and without the need for specialized technical resources.</p> What is the Data Exchange Client Gateway, and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>The Data Exchange Client Gateway is a key component of <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-data-exchange/">Energy Web’s Data Exchange solution</a>: it’s the application that provides the UI and APIs for interacting with shared messaging infrastructure to send, receive, and authenticate messages. One of the main value propositions of the client gateway is providing a single, standardized integration method for many independent organizations to exchange information across various messaging channels.</p><p>The client gateway was developed in support of the Data Exchange solutions deployed in <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-study-project-edge/">Project EDGE</a> and <a href="https://www.westernpower.com.au/community/news-opinion/project-symphony-premieres">Project Symphony</a> in Australia. These projects are demonstrating how a shared industry data hub can <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/canary-in-the-sunshine-australia-is-showing-the-rest-of-the-world-what-a-modern-grid-looks-like-ce95832cc017">enable better utilization of customer-owned, distributed energy resources</a> (“DER”, such as rooftop solar and battery storage systems) by improving coordination between AEMO (the national grid and wholesale market operator), distribution network utilities, and aggregators. Compared to the status quo approach to data sharing, which relies on a multitude of point-to-point integrations between individual companies, a shared data hub will help enhance DER visibility and ensure consistency across market participants, while maintaining standard cybersecurity and reducing costs to industry.</p><p>There are several dozen other markets around the world that need similar solutions for sharing and validating DER data among multiple entities, especially in the US (where r<a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">egulations like FERC 222</a> are removing barriers to DER market participation) and Europe (where <a href="https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/Publications/Position%20papers%20and%20reports/TSO-DSO_ASM_2019_190416.pdf">coordination between transmission and distribution grid operators</a> is <a href="https://www.ceer.eu/documents/104400/3731907/C16-DS-26-04_DSO-TSO-relationship_PP_21-Sep-2016.pdf">a regulatory priority</a>). As Energy Web we see a major opportunity for our Data Exchange solution to unlock the full potential of DER all over the world, and so making the Client Gateway as user-friendly as possible as at the heart of our technology roadmap.</p> DDHub on Azure: How it Works and Why it&nbsp;Matters <p>The EDGE and Symphony trials have been ongoing since 2022 and while overall results have validated the value of a shared data hub, a <a href="https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2022/project-edge-lessons-learnt-2--final.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=0A6D7D1A47CE168E130983F082EA9CDE">key lesson learned is that integration needs to be&nbsp;simpler</a>.</p><p>The Client Gateway is an independent application that each market participant runs within an environment of their choice. Up until now, the process of deploying and maintaining Client Gateways across multiple companies was complex, manual, and required specialized technical knowledge of advanced topics like containers and orchestration.</p><p>The reality is that not all electricity market participants have the internal capabilities to manage this manual deployment model and even those that do don’t always have spare capacity. Further complicating matters, because this approach requires each company to independently download, install, and configure the Client Gateway application, coordinating both initial installations and ongoing maintenance and update releases was challenging and time-consuming.</p><p>Making the Client Gateway available on Azure obviates the need for any specialized IT resources and reduces the time to install the application by 90%. Additionally, participants are able to natively integrate the Client Gateway application with other Azure services (for example, Azure Key Vault) that they already use and need to integrate with the shared data hub. Taken together, this means the Energy Web Data Exchange solution is not only better positioned to support existing projects, but production-grade solutions in any other&nbsp;market.</p> Conclusion <p>2023 is going to be a pivotal year for Energy Web, as the global energy transition is hitting an inflection point right as we’re evolving from delivering individual projects to delivering software solutions that are repeatable and scalable. Our whole focus is simplifying the user experience for enterprises to adopt these solutions not just in the innovation sandbox, but the core operational business.</p><p>Making the Data Exchange Client Gateway available as an Azure marketplace offering is an important step in realizing our vision of a complete EW-DOS-aaS. Going forward, in the near term we will continue to expand marketplace offerings. Later in Q1 we will share additional updates on our plans to make all of our solutions available “as-a-Service” via managed service, third-party resellers, and fully self-hosted options.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>This post was originally published at <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/news/solidarity-not-solutionism-wayfinding-just-paths-digital-infrastructure-serves-planet" title="APC.org">APC.org</a>.  </p>



<p>On 25 January, the European Digital Rights initiative (EDRi) hosted <a href="https://privacycamp.eu/" title="">Privacy Camp 2023</a>, which brought together digital rights advocates and technologists with a call to explore the critical infrastructure of digital technologies, and how they feed into and foster the multiple crises we inhabit.</p>



<p>We (Becky Kazansky, senior research consultant with The Engine Room, and shawna finnegan, Technology and Environmental Justice Initiative coordinator with the Association for Progressive Communications, APC) welcomed this opportunity to deepen and expand the conversation around digital rights, climate and environmental justice, and brought together a hybrid panel with Lili Fuhr, Paz Peña, Plamen Peev and Narmine Abou-Bakari, titled “<a href="https://privacycamp.eu/panel-solidarity-not-solutionism-digital-infrastructure-for-the-planet/" title="">Solidarity not solutionism: digital infrastructure for the planet</a>“.</p>



<p>The panel discussion provided space to reflect on some of the false climate solutions that digital rights advocates should be aware of amid efforts to act in solidarity with environmental defenders and climate justice movements. We invited participants in the session to reflect on shared demands for accountability across our struggles for digital rights, environmental protection and climate justice, and consider opportunities and mechanisms for collaboration.</p>







 Calling out false climate solutions and tech complicity 



<p>Our panel followed on research conducted last year by The Engine Room and APC, and a number of other collaborators, within a <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/learning-reflections/intersections-of-digital-rights-and-environmental-and-climate-justice/" title="">research consortium</a> exploring the intersection of digital rights, climate and environmental justice.</p>



<p>The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/7356/ter-final-report-07-07-22.pdf" title="">research</a> highlighted the lack of transparency around the climate and environmental impacts of the tech sector, where bold pledges have been made in recent years with very little detail of actual progress made available to the public. Despite the opacity of the tech sector, it’s clear that tech companies often rely on dubious tools to claim they’re minimising harms and working towards “carbon neutrality”.[1] One example the research touched on is carbon offsetting, an increasingly common practice long decried as a “false solution” to climate change by the global climate justice movement. Recent evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe" title="">more than 90% of carbon offset schemes have none of the positive impacts they claim</a>, while also increasingly <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2022/12/12/total-congo-offsetting-land-dispossessed/" title="">infringing on the rights of peoples and their territories</a>.</p>



<p>Alongside The Engine Room’s research, APC published a set of <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/interstice-digital-rights-and-environmental-justice-four-issue-briefs-inform-funding" title="">issue briefs</a> based on over a decade of experience working alongside partners around the world on climate and environmental issues. One of the issue briefs developed by APC member and Bulgaria-based foundation BlueLink and APC looked at where environmental governance frameworks can be used as levers for accountability at the intersection of digital rights and climate concerns. For example, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polluter_pays_principle" title="">polluter pays principle</a>” has contributed to the development of policies and standards for <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/extended-producer-responsibility.htm" title="">Extended Producer Responsibility</a>.</p>



<p>What this research underlined for us is how important it is for communities already working towards more just approaches to technology to challenge “false tech solutions” for climate – and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayfinding" title="">wayfind pathways to sustainability</a> that honour the rights and sovereignty of Indigenous people and traditional communities. These two priorities informed the focus of our discussion at Privacy Camp.</p>



 Naming false solutions 



<p>In December 2022, more than 80 civil society organisations sent an <a href="https://etcgroup.org/content/no-climate-geoengineering-open-call-cbd-parties-and-cbd-secretariat" title="">open letter</a> to the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), calling on all parties to the CBD to “prevent geoengineering from harming biodiversity, the environment, the climate, the rights of Indigenous Peoples and the human rights of local communities,” echoing recent calls for a “<a href="https://www.solargeoeng.org/" title="">Solar Geoengineering Non-Use Agreement</a>“. At Privacy Camp 2023, our panellists explained how false climate solutions like geo-engineering are narrowing paths for action, and reflected on calls to action for digital rights communities.</p>



Image: Participants who connected online included APC’s shawna finnegan and panellists Lili Fuhr, Paz Peña and Plamen Peev.



<p>Lili Fuhr, who works with the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL) to monitor emerging “climate technologies” (e.g. geo-engineering, carbon capture) provided historical context on climate-tech debates, raising a sense of urgency around the need for digital rights advocates to engage in how these technologies are governed and invested into, especially as “Big Tech” companies invest heavily into them. Looking back at the past 30 years of climate governance, Lili reflected on the many narrowed pathways that have led up to the present day of climate crisis, and challenges around defining problems and solutions. “False solutions and risky technologies that have potential to destroy entire ecosystems,” Lili stated, explaining how techno-solutionist mindsets often accompany neoliberal capitalist beliefs in endless economic growth within a finite Earth system. The metrics that we use to measure the problems and so-called solutions keep changing and narrowing paths for action.</p>



<p>Paz Peña, a researcher, activist and co-creator of gato.earth who is working with the Latin American Institute of Terraforming, reflected on her experiences at the intersections of technology and environmental crises. In outlining the pitfalls of techno-capitalism, Paz unpacked the false narratives of a “Twin Transition” that promotes the use of technology and data to improve efficiency and productivity as a panacea to climate and environmental crises. “Big Tech portrays itself as friend to the environment, and it gets good press,” Paz explained, emphasising the need for digital rights communities to act in response to techno-capitalist ideologies of unlimited growth and explore the potential of techno-diversities, a concept that Paz will be exploring more this year.</p>



<p>During the discussion, Paz called for European-focused discussions of sustainability to consider the impacts of extractivism of so-called “green technologies” for the Majority World. Paz highlighted the <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/impact/fair-materials/" title="">Fairphone</a> project, which, despite experimenting with more circular approaches to technological production, raises concerns around lithium mining and brings up questions around whether “ethical” mining and resource extraction is ultimately possible.</p>



 Wayfinding just paths for digital infrastructure to serve the planet 



<p>Identifying and calling out tech complicity in false climate solutions is an essential component of digital rights advocacy that supports <a href="https://climatefalsesolutions.org/real-solutions-for-climate-justice/" title="">real solutions for climate justice</a>. In the technology sector, digital rights advocates can learn from and support alternative models for just technology, and use existing and emerging policy mechanisms as levers for change.</p>



Image: On-site participants included Becky Kazansky (The Engine Room) along with panellist Narmine Abou Bakari.<br>



<p>Narmine Abou Bakari, a campaigner who works for the Greens/EFA of the European Parliament, shared a story of her journey from working on data protection to a focus on the right to repair and circular economy policies. Narmine explained the stakes of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/initiative_on_green_claims.htm" title="">new European Union (EU) regulation</a> to hold companies accountable for making false green claims, introspecting on how to make policies focus on <a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu/opinions/digital-technologies-in-europe/" title="">structural accountability</a> alongside consumer-level change. “Companies are using a marketing strategy to make claims about environmental footprint regardless of accuracy,” she shared, noting that this method of greenwashing generates a lack of trust among consumers. When a member of the audience asked Narmine about challenges for enforcement, Narmine reflected on the need for investment by national authorities and involvement of consumer rights organisations.</p>



<p>Plamen Peev, a policy expert and environmental lawyer who works with BlueLink Bulgaria, discussed the journey towards holistically accounting for the intersections of environmental and digital rights, sharing <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/interstice-digital-rights-and-environmental-justice-four-issue-briefs-inform-funding" title="">recent work with APC</a> to explore how existing environmental policies and mechanisms can be used to push for greater transparency and access to justice. Plamen highlighted how the <a href="https://unece.org/environment-policy/public-participation/aarhus-convention/text" title="">Aarhus Convention</a> has been used to push for the right to information, describing it as “a strong safeguard for nature and a benchmark for environmental democracy that links environmental and human rights, and the obligations of technologists.” He explained that the Aarhus Convention created pathways for local communities and environmental defenders to monitor and resist exploitation of natural resources.</p>



 In solidarity for the planet 



<p>As the discussion wrapped up, the panellists reflected on how digital rights advocates can contribute to international climate policy. Paz reminded us that actions taken in Europe will impact the rest of the world, and identified the EU as having an important role to play in addressing global techno-capitalism.</p>



<p>Lili emphasised that phasing out fossil fuels is an urgent priority that is being undermined by false solutionism. Lili also highlighted concerns for surveillance of activists and shrinking space for civil society, particularly in light of the UAE hosting the next UN climate conference (COP 28) in Dubai in November 2023.</p>



<p>Our discussion at Privacy Camp concluded with an invitation to participants to join a growing community working to address crucial issues at the intersections of digital rights, climate and environmental justice. We invite participants and readers to reach out and contact <a href="mailto:beckyk@riseup.net" title="">Becky</a> and <a href="mailto:shawna@apc.org" title="">shawna</a>, and consider joining us in future discussions and related sessions at the <a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/" title="">MozFest</a> Tech &amp; Biodiversity track, 20-24 March 2023.</p>

<p></p>     <p>This lecture took place on 1 March 2023. </p>
<p>Zero trust and its architectures are incomplete in a digital world where the benefits of exponential innovation are starting to be outweighed by its risks. To exponentiate trust in the digital world, zero trust must be expanded to zero trust under zero knowledge — because in a world of generative AI, none can be trusted, nothing should be shared, and if something is shared it must be verifiable to be true by anyone without revealing any sensitive data.</p>
                           <p>Q: If how <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> work is inherently Zero-Knowledge (ZK), then what does the ZK layer in <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia</a> do?<br>
A: VCs are not inherently ZK. Typically they will contain clear text data making claims about a subject that might be pseudonymous when using DIDs and attested to by a VC issuer that might also be using a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a>. But that is not ZK. ZK in a VC is, for example, attesting to a ZK proof that the subject is over 21 years of age without revealing the birthday at the time the VC was issued.</p>
<p>Q: Is it more of a verification that ZK is actually being preserved?<br>
A: It is a verification that a ZK proof was created at a specific point in time, more than anything else. But that is a very powerful statement by itself since otherwise, you cannot prove when a ZK proof was created.</p>
<p>Q: Interaction between digital twins is zero trust (ZT) in a network, but if a digital twin is accessed by an API, is it still a ZT network?<br>
A: Yes, it is as long as the requester of the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twin (SSDT)</a> API is required to prove its identity using public key cryptography every time the requester accesses the API of the SSDT.</p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between the Citopia nodes being connected using Citopia API vs the Citopia nodes being connected via ITN?<br>
A: Citopia Nodes connected to one another are network nodes in one network connected to one another, as network nodes are in IPFS or Bitcoin or Ethereum. Citopia Nodes connected to the ITN are one network talking to another network – cross-network node communications.</p>
<p>Q: When do the Citopia nodes communicate with one another?<br>
A: Only when one node wants to discover or access services and applications in another node or when Citopia membership credentials are replicated between nodes.</p>
<p>Q: Is it strictly for peer-to-peer communications, such as proof presentations?<br>
A: Basically, yes.</p>
<p>Q: I think peer-to-peer communication including write transactions is slow, what is the tech in order to speed up the communication?<br>
A: Requests between Nodes can be processed in parallel. Therefore, more powerful compute and network infrastructure improves throughput.</p>
<p>Q: Is it correct to understand that interaction between Citopia API nodes is ZT and interaction between Citopia applications is ZT but interaction between Citopia API node and Citopia application node is NOT ZT because that API interaction is not by ZT (DID to DID)?<br>
A: Communication within a Citopia node is within a trust boundary. Therefore, although all traffic is encrypted, not all applications must authenticate each other. However, all external requests made to a Citopia node must be authenticated and authorized by the Citopia node and by the targeted Citopia Application – double verification.</p>
<p>Q: Which ensures ZKPs? SSDTs by themselves or SSDTs with Citopia services or SSDTs and Citopia services interacting with core services?<br>
A: ZKPs are generated and verified by Citopia Services or — a bit later on the roadmap due to required optimizations — directly within a Citopia SSDT as part of an SSDT’s capabilities. </p>

<p>By <a href="https://medium.com/@kimdhamilton?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a>, on behalf of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group</a></p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">The Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group at DIF</a> is excited to announce the release of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Presentation Exchange (PE) v2 specification</a>. This updated and ratified version of the spec includes a restructured set of core requirements, as well as an extensibility mechanism through the use of “features.”</p><p>But first, let’s take a step back: <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">The DIF Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group</a> is responsible for developing interoperable formats and supporting tools for broad adoption around issuing, requesting, exchanging and verifying credentials in a vendor-agnostic manner. Current work items include Schema Registries, Trust Establishment, Data Agreement, JWT-VC Interop Profiles, and of course, Presentation Echange. All of this open-source work is licensable under Apache 2.0, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 or W3C Patent licensing, as outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_CC_WG_charter_v1.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">WG Charter here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_CC_WG_Operating_Addendum_V1.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">WG Operating Addendum here</a>.</p><p>So, what is Presentation Exchange all about? In short, it enables a verifier to express to a credential holder (via their software agent, such as a wallet) their requirements for claims and proofs. For example, a financial institution can use PE to express to a potential customer (via the customer’s credential wallet) that they require a driver’s license from a certain set of state DMVs, as well as proof of address. The customer’s wallet can then use this information to pre-select the necessary credentials and, upon receiving the customer’s consent, generate a cryptographic signature, and package it all up to send to the financial institution. Importantly, different kinds of wallets using different cryptography and credentials formats can be added and subtracted over time, abstracting out many of the divergences in today’s verifiable credential systems.</p><p>With the release of PE v2, we have restructured the spec to define a reduced set of core requirements for implementers. This was based on input from implementers across different identity standards communities, who were all converging around a core set of baseline requirements on their respective roads to production. The spec separates this core set from additional functionalities, known as “<a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#features">features</a>” which enable additional features only activated when both wallet and server signal support for them. This design allows verifiers and relying parties to layer additional functionality on top of the PE spec, while still providing a streamlined, implementable baseline for all implementers and a graceful upgrade path for wallets and implementations alike.</p><p><br>Additionally, we have restructured some of the PEv1 data model, moving previously mandatory properties and objects into optional features, which enables a more concise and consumer-friendly language. A variety of other minor improvements were also made based on implementer feedback. You can find more details on these updates in a new section of the spec, available <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#what-is-new">here</a>.</p><p>The net result of these various updates is a broader range of support for the PE spec. A number of companies and organizations have already implemented the spec, including <a href="https://block.xyz/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Block</a>, <a href="http://bloom.co/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Bloom</a>, <a href="http://centre.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Centre</a>, <a href="http://circle.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Circle</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">OIDF</a>, <a href="https://sphereon.com/solution/dif-presentation-exchange-with-siop-v2/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Sphereon</a>, <a href="http://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Spruce</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/workday-engineering/lets-actually-share-our-verifiable-credentials-7ab1b4c73079?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Workday</a>, <a href="http://benri.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Benri</a>, and <a href="http://gendigital.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Gen Digital</a> just to name a few.</p><blockquote>Presentation Exchange: in short, it enables a verifier to express to a credential holder (via their software agent, such as a wallet) their requirements for claims and proofs.</blockquote><p>Presentation Exchange V2 joins the list of delivered work items from DIF WGs, including <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1/">SideTree</a> and <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">DIDComm v2</a>.

<p></p>      Bonifii partnered with Entersekt, a global company, to improve MemberPass functionality. 
          <p>Upon initial consumer feedback, the need to download a second app to enable MemberPass 1.0 became a barrier to adoption for credit union members. In 2022, the primary focus was to improve the functionality of MemberPass, allowing for an easier enrollment and authentication process to protect credit unions and its members from becoming victims of fraud. Now, there is no need to download a second app and the enrollment process was reduced from 16 to 6 steps. 4Front Credit Union and Team One Credit Union rolled out the enhanced MemberPass 2.0 app-less product in the fall of 2022 and the adoption and usage numbers have already exponentially exceeded the initial MemberPass enrollment numbers.</p>
                <p>MemberPass integrated into the banking app of one of the Top 10 National Credit Union.</p>
<p>Additionally, in 2022, MemberPass made major strides in the development of becoming an identity and authentication option developed directly into the banking app of a major, top 10 national credit that will formally launch to its membership in Q1 2023.</p>
                 Since commercialization in 2020, there have been no reported incidents of fraud with members enrolled in MemberPass. 
           Bonifii completed a POC with GlobaliD and Lone Star Credit Union to create the “Bonifii credential” 
<p>Throughout 2022, Bonifii and Lone Star Credit Union worked together to prove the concept that a new member could bring their own “BonifiID” digital identity credential. It gives underserved individuals a secure, private way to access traditional banking services.</p>
<p>Bonifii created the digital credential along with<a href="https://global.id/"> GlobaliD</a>, a trust platform and digital wallet. This credential transforms the new account opening process for unbanked or underbanked consumers. It streamlines how financial institutions get the information they need to open an account. Plus, the credential’s end-to-end digital online application process offers a secure entry point into a financial account.</p>
<p>For underbanked people, this could be a pathway to greater financial stability.</p>
 MemberPass Express (No Code / Low Code) Bonifii’s achievements in 2022 continue to build the on the product value that MemberPass will bring to the credit union industry and beyond. 
<p>Each one is unique, and each addresses a different aspect of how digital identity functions in the real world. By extension, each agreement has made MemberPass stronger, and a more effective personal digital ID solution for credit unions and members.</p>

<p>February 8, 2023</p>



<p>Most New Zealanders believe it is not easy to protect their information online and they find the idea of being more in control of their digital identity appealing, according to a new Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ) survey just released.</p>



<p>DINZ is a not for profit member association of the New Zealand Tech Alliance and their latest research highlights issues holding back more rapid uptake of digital identity and the growth of the digital economy have remained consistent for the past four years.</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final.pdf">Their study</a> found:</p>



  90 percent of New Zealanders believe it is not easy to protect their information online  



  90 percent of New Zealanders find the idea of being more in control of their digital identity appealing  



  78 percent of New Zealanders are concerned about the protection of their identity and the use of personal data by organisations  



  70 percent of New Zealanders place some onus on the organisation holding their data, but there is some sense of shared responsibility  



  60 percent of New Zealanders don’t feel they know how to protect their information  



  60 percent of New Zealanders were satisfied with the process of registering personal details with Government agencies in response to the covid pandemic  



  60 percent of New Zealanders have experienced some form of misuse, with credit card theft being most common  



  50 percent of New Zealanders know their rights regarding the protection of personal data  



  50 percent of New Zealanders have adapted their online behaviour due to concerns around data privacy  



  50 percent of New Zealanders have some issue with registering new accounts online, although there has been a significant increase in satisfaction since 2020  



  80 percent of businesses know where to find relevant legislation for their digital security obligations  



  33 percent of businesses feel equipped to protect their customer’s personal data, while just 25 percent find this easy to do  



  33 percent of businesses believe the pandemic has impacted the way they manage their customer’s personal data  



<p>Digital identity allows people and organisations to use their personal information, including date of birth, income and other proof attributes to access services. Essentially, digital identity is a shorthand for the processes used to confirm identification, authentication and authorisation.</p>







<p>“There is more desire to have control over one’s personal data, says Colin Wallis, executive director of DINZ, and it seems that the Covid experience has driven some progress towards greater understanding of the importance of data protection.”</p>



<p>“Our research found that opening accounts for digital services and having to remember usernames and passwords is a major cause of friction for consumers.</p>



<p>“Three quarters of respondents were wary of the transparency amongst organisations using their data and a similar proportion were unhappy about the idea of organisations sharing/selling their data.</p>



<p>“The results support the consumer research conclusion that there is a trust problem which is why businesses and experts are gathering at the <a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">digital trust hui taumata</a> conference in Wellington in August to identify opportunities to increase digital trust in New Zealand.”</p>

<p>An ardent supporter of OASIS since 2003, Jim Cabral is a recognized thought leader in the justice and public safety technology communities. </p>







<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/board/">OASIS Board of Directors</a> is comprised of industry leaders who play an integral part in the organization’s success. Each month, we’ll interview one OASIS Board Member to give you a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.&nbsp;Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimcabral/">Jim Cabral</a>, Vice President of Court Relations at <a href="https://www.infotrack.com/">InfoTrack</a>, Vice Chair of the OASIS Board of Directors, and long time OASIS member. </p>



<p>Jim serves as Chair of the LegalXML Electronic Court Filing Technical Committee (TC) and the LegalXML Member Section. He is a member of the Code List Representation, LegalDocumentML (LegalDocML), Litigant Portal (LP), and LegalRuleML TCs. Jim also participates in NIEMOpen as co-chair of the NIEM Technical Architecture Committee and is an expert voting representative to the Project Governing Board. In 2020, Jim was named an OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/members/distinguished-contributors/">Distinguished Contributor</a> for his significant impact on the advancement of open standards and/or open source projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re happy to have you on the OASIS board. Can you tell us about your role at InfoTrack?<br>I am a Vice President of Court Relations at InfoTrack, a legal technology provider. We integrate attorneys and their information systems, especially their law practice management systems, with the courts and their technology.</p>



<p>You’ve been involved with OASIS for years. How did you first get involved?<br>I joined OASIS to work on LegalXML. I got involved not just with the courts, but also to work on standards for integrated justice such as electronic contracts, electronic notary, etc. As a management consultant for more than 20 years, I’ve mostly worked in the areas of public safety and justice within courts. I have extensive experience partnering with courts to integrate their systems with legal systems. </p>



<p>Years ago, I was involved with Justice XML, which&nbsp;became the Global Justice XML Data Model and finally the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM). NIEM is now <a href="https://github.com/niemopen/oasis-open-project#readme">NIEMOpen</a>, an OASIS Open Project. We were working with what was known as “integrated justice,” helping to connect law enforcement with prosecutors, and the courts with prosecutors, corrections, supervision, probation, and various other justice partners. Working in management consulting with justice and public safety, we&nbsp; talked about standards from the very beginning.</p>



<p>Tell us about your professional background…<br>I have degrees in electrical and biomedical engineering, and have done a lot of networking and security IT work as a graduate student. I’ve been working with Extensible Markup Language (XML), application programming interfaces (APIs), and things like that for most of my career. Whenever it came to the technology side of certain projects, I was always the one that was brought in because I had the engineering background.</p>



<p>What inspired you to join the OASIS board?<br>I have been an OASIS member for a long time, involved in LegalXML and other TCs before I had any aspirations of joining the Board. I contributed to those committees for a while and wanted to make sure that perspective was represented at the Board level. I started serving as an interim board member as a result of a special board election. After a brief hiatus, I decided to run again after hearing about NIEM transitioning to OASIS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s your connection with NIEM?<br>I’ve been involved with NIEM almost as long as I’ve been involved with OASIS. I have been there through the evolution of NIEM from the Justice XML Model to the Global Justice XML Data Model,​ and then finally to NIEM. I am excited to be here now as it transitions to NIEMOpen at OASIS.</p>



<p>What excites you about OASIS and why are you so passionate about its mission?<br>I’ve always been an advocate of OASIS as standards are very important to me. I’m often frustrated by people, especially those working in technology, who want to innovate as quickly as possible and end up with one-off proprietary solutions to problems. To me, those can only go so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To really make a difference in the world, to really get the type of adoption and broad support that you need for these kinds of innovations to take hold and make a difference, they need to become standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve been involved with OASIS and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for a long time, and in my opinion, they are two of the best standards organizations in the world.</p>



<p>What are the benefits to becoming involved with the OASIS community?<br>The idea that we’re all at OASIS to work collaboratively, even with some that may be competitors, really creates a safe space for doing that work.</p>



<p>As far as what sets OASIS apart from some of the other standards organizations are things like NIEM, UBL, and ebXML. These are all very big projects that helped build our reputation. You consistently find others coming to OASIS because of that reputation for doing great work and for being independent.</p>



<p>OASIS has an incredible brand that’s well known and well respected and I want to make sure that we continue to preserve that.</p>



<p>What are some of the reasons why people should bring their projects to OASIS?<br>OASIS is a mature and successful organization. The OASIS process has shown to work time and time again. As long as you follow the process, you’ll end up with a truly open standard, free of intellectual property concerns, and ready for you to use in your implementation.</p>



<p>What type of skills and expertise do you bring to the OASIS board?<br>In addition to my work on the legal technology side with LegalXML and so on, I’ve also had experience working with the public sector. There’s a lot of interesting things happening at the state and local government level. I’ve developed and implemented best practices as a management consultant. Having that expertise is something that the OASIS Board values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s your role as Vice Chair?<br>Gershon Janssen is a fabulous chair, and I’m here to help support him in any way I can. I serve as backup in the event that he’s unable to make a meeting. As Vice Chair, I am part of the&nbsp; Executive Committee, which helps craft the agenda and prioritizes the items for discussion by the board.</p>



<p>How do you hope to make an impact as a board member during your term?<br>I want to ensure that OASIS continues to be a sustainable organization and continues to evolve. I’m very proud of how OASIS has expanded beyond standards to include open source and open projects.&nbsp; I’m also excited about our selection of Francis Beland as the new Executive Director of OASIS. I think he’s going to help take OASIS in some new directions that will greatly benefit the organization.</p>



<p>What are your goals as an OASIS board member?<br>One of the reasons I joined the board was to make sure that NIEM and other open projects had a voice at the board level. Open projects are fairly new to OASIS, and it will be impressive to see OASIS&nbsp;absorb and support a project as mature as NIEM. I think we’re going to learn a lot from this process, and ultimately I think it will help us recruit other open projects of this magnitude.</p>



<p>My goals over the next year are to help NIEM continue to transition to OASIS, learn as much as possible about what it’s going to take for OASIS to support additional open projects, and develop best practices to onboard future open projects.</p>



<p>What is an achievement/accomplishment that you’re proud of?&nbsp;<br>I was very proud to be recognized as an OASIS Distinguished Contributor.&nbsp; This award plaque hangs proudly over my desk as a constant reminder to me of what’s possible with collaboration.</p>



<p>What’s the best piece of advice you’ve received?&nbsp;<br>As the African proverb says: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” I mentioned this in my OASIS <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68lWygC6zjk&amp;t=1110s">Distinguished Contributor award acceptance speech</a>.</p>



<p>Can you tell us about a role model or mentor that you’ve had and what inspired you most about that person?<br>When I started out at OASIS, I was very much involved with the Electronic Court Filing (ECF) TC, and I eventually ended up becoming the chair. The previous ECF co-chairs were John Greacen and Tom Clarke, who were some of the founding members of the LegalXML Member Section. John Greacen is an attorney in New Mexico and Tom Clarke, at the time, was a vice president for the National Center for State Courts. </p>



<p>They created a very exciting, collaborative community where they pulled people from various projects to work together on the standard. I was very impressed with their ability to recruit people to the effort as well as their independent voices that made it clear that the objective was to work collaboratively. I appreciated their consistency, their honesty, and even their stubbornness when it came to making sure that the standard was something that everyone could use.</p>



<p>What trends do you see in the industry that are most exciting or thought provoking?&nbsp;<br>All you have to do is turn on the news and everyone’s talking about Artificial Intelligence (AI). One ongoing argument is the need for structured information versus unstructured information. Most of what we collect and what we encounter is unstructured information. At OASIS, one thing that we’ve done very well is come up with models for structured information sharing.</p>



<p>Some believe that AI doesn’t need all that structured information because AI can pull out and extract whatever you need out of the unstructured information. While AI can be very good at pulling out information from unstructured information, the problem is when your AI and my AI pull out different information from the same unstructured information. As a result, we don’t have semantic interoperability. We’re looking at the same data, but we’re coming up with two different sets of knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to figure out how to use both of those together to capture that structured information, and then share it in a way that is consistent, so you and I agree on what that actually means and what the knowledge is in that data.</p>



<p>Can you share an impact story about OASIS or your work in open standards?<br>Electronic Court Filing (ECF) basically created a market. Until standards like ECF, court solutions were kind of one-offs. Let’s say a court selected a particular vendor to come in and provide, for example, their public access system or their report filing system. That was the one available option, and from an attorney perspective or from a self represented litigant trying to work with the courts, hopefully that one option met their needs because that was the only one that was offered.</p>



<p>Standards like ECF allow the courts to publish an API and say, “If you want to interact with the courts, here’s the API that you need to connect to.” That allows market providers like InfoTrack to come in and say, “OK, I recognize that this group of attorneys or this group of self representing litigants have some specific needs. I can build a solution that caters to their needs, but then integrates with the court’s API.” From the court’s perspective, it’s all the same because it’s all coming in through the same place, the same API. From the filer’s perspective, it actually shows a lot more flexibility and adaptability to their particular needs. ECF has created a market allowing legal technology providers like InfoTrack to better serve the needs of the court and legal communities. In the U.S., 55% of the population are in jurisdictions where the courts support ECF.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the future of standards?<br>I think we have to continue to adapt and be open to new ways of developing standards. Open Projects is one of those examples where if you already have some IP and you think it should go through a standards process, OASIS has a path for you to set up a project to do just that. You can pick out the pieces that should go through the standards process and then proceed using the tested OASIS standard track.</p>



<p>What are a few words that come to mind when you think about the work being done at OASIS?<br>You can’t say OASIS without saying “open.” I would also say “collaborative,” “innovative,” and “proven.”</p>



<p>What is a fun fact about you?<br>I’m a bugler. I’m involved with a volunteer organization called Bugles Across America, and we play “Taps” to honor our veterans and our public safety workers at their funerals. Bugles Across America allows families to request a bugler, and a volunteer like myself will show up at the burial site to play “Taps” for them. It’s a song that only has 24 notes, but it means a lot to the families of the veterans, and that’s why I do it.&nbsp;</p>

 Open Workplace Recognition. In practice. Image CC BY-ND Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>We’re publishing this in the wake of mass layoffs in the tech industry, with some people finding out in <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/google-engineer-says-survivors-mass-153122052.html">particularly cruel ways</a> that their employment has been terminated.</p><p>With that as a touchpoint, in this post we want to dig into what Open Workplace Recognition actually looks like in practice. We’ll have a look at what motivates us in the workplace and what Open Workplace Recognition could look like in different types of organisations.</p> Recognition as a&nbsp;driver <p>Let’s just quickly remind ourselves what we mean by <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>:</p><p>“Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.”</p><p>Credentials are usually things that you acquire to be able to unlock an opportunity or increase in status. So degree certificates, drivers licences, and even tickets for a concert can be thought of as ‘credentials’. These abound in the workplace: some group of people (usually ‘higher-ups’), decide what is important and create credentials in line with that strategy.</p><p>This post is not an argument that credentials should not exist. As we have argued elsewhere, the important thing to note is the role of recognition in the act of credentialing. Going further, <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2016/02/26/hiring-by-experience/">we also encourage</a> workplaces to think of non-credential forms of recognition.</p><p>Daniel Pink’s seminal work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us">Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</a> explains that we have three basic needs at&nbsp;work:</p>  Autonomy — the desire to be self-directed and feel like we’re making meaningful choices.  Mastery — the urge to continually improve our knowledge and&nbsp;skills.  Purpose — the impulse to do something that is meaningful and important.  <p>This is not how people tend to be “recognised” at work. ‘Recognition’ is often conflated with ‘reward’ and so we look to award ceremonies, promotions, and company-wide messages from managers for validation. Research shows, however, that these extrinsic rewards can actually replace people’s intrinsic motivation. So what are we to&nbsp;do?</p><p>There is a better way. It’s one that chimes more with the autonomy, mastery, and purpose mentioned above. It’s one that’s more peer-to-peer. And it’s one that can lead to portable, granular, and evidenced-based forms of recognition that employees can carry with them to their next job — whether or not that’s in the same organisation.</p> Recognition in&nbsp;practice <p>As we’ve said before, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">Open Recognition is for every type of learning</a> and it’s for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-workplace-a7533f3f75e7">every type of workplace</a>. So what does this mean in practice?</p><p>If we consider three types of workplace and reference <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">different types of learning scenarios</a>, we can begin to see the types of recognition that are required in each situation. Let’s dig in to find the similarities and differences between Open Workplace Recognition for employees, freelancers, and small business&nbsp;owners.</p> 💼 Employees <p>Employees work for organisations that usually set policies without their input. These could be anything from job requirements and prerequisite skills through to salaries and vacation policies. Depending on the core business of the organisation and progression pathways, this could mean that it doesn’t take long for employees to lack not only autonomy, but mastery and&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>Sometimes, workplaces attempt to remedy this through spurious systems based on ‘points’ to reward colleagues. Our experience suggests this rapidly devolves into either a popularity contest or an empty exercise where colleagues give away all of their points to a peer as it’s the end of the month. Not only are these types of attempts at recognition wide of the mark, they’re actively demotivating.</p><p>Furthermore, employees cannot take any of this with them when you inevitably move on to a new organisation. (LinkedIn recommendations don’t quite cut it.) That’s why Open Workplace Recognition uses a nuanced approach based on <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> to recognise pro-social behaviours as well as knowledge and skills. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Sally has a line manager who notices that she showed up to every company event over the last year. Recognising her dedication her line manager issues Sally an ‘Above and Beyond’&nbsp;badge.  Akaash has learned a lot from his mentor Priya over the last couple of years, and so issues her a ‘Marvellous Mentor’ badge. She reciprocates by issuing him a badge which includes the LinkedIn recommendation she has already written for&nbsp;him.  Junior is committed to professional development but his company’s policy comes with ‘strings attached’ meaning that paying for courses related to anything outside of his immediate job role cannot be sanctioned. One of his colleagues, Blessing, issues him an ‘Onwards and Upwards’ badge to recognise his dedication.  <p>If the workplace functions more as a community of practice, then social learning is visible and recognised. It means that employees would feel more autonomy and mastery, and therefore consider their work to have more&nbsp;purpose.</p> 👩‍💻 Freelancers <p>Freelancers deal with different kinds of recognition problems. They have to have business management and client acquisition skills in addition to whatever product or service they might be offering. These skills are often not recognised at all, with potential clients focusing only on the freelancer’s portfolio, including who they have worked with before. A freelancer’s ability to promote themselves and their work is also explicitly tied to social and cultural factors that they may be unable to&nbsp;control.</p><p>Freelancers may have formal learning credentials and might be able to point to some forms of recognition they have collected over the course of their career. However, if recognition is not a transferable feature of networking events, pro-bono work or career-related participation in a community, freelancers have to find their own ways of showcasing their engagement, talent and&nbsp;skill.</p>  Jayden funds himself to go to one networking event per month. He issues himself an attendance badge and asks the event organisers to ‘endorse’ it to add&nbsp;value.  Valentina agrees to do some work for free to build her brand, but insists on a badge from the company proving her involvement in the&nbsp;project.  Koko organises an online community for freelancers in her industry. She is issued a badge by an industry veteran who is thankful for her voluntary work.  <p>Freelancers could benefit from Open Workplace Recognition between workplaces, and also by conceptualising their own work as happening within a ‘third place’ workplace. As a result, freelancers can be recognised not only by their clients but also by other freelancers, leading to increased autonomy (choosing when and how to work), mastery (being recognised for knowledge and skills development), and purpose (continuing to do what they&nbsp;love).</p> ✊ Small businesses <p>A small agency, business or cooperative often offers more control for the people who work within it. Depending on the organisation and management of an agency, workers may have ways of recognising another that are built into the culture of the workplace.</p><p>Like employees and freelancers, workers in an agency are often initially recognised for their formal learning certification and career history. Just as with larger employers, an agency may use these certifications as a filtering function. And, like freelancers, non-transferrable recognition is often invisible to others within the different workplaces.</p><p>In an agency, a worker is required to advocate for themselves like a freelancer, while beholden to agency-wide decisions and policies like a more traditional employer.</p>  Shiro recognises that a new skillset is required for a new project coming into the agency, and so asks the agency for time to upskill. They are issued a series of badges recognising their increased levels of knowledge and&nbsp;skills.  Mike attends dinners and events on behalf of his small business which often much later turn into business leads/opportunities. His colleagues recognise his networking skills by issuing&nbsp;badges.  Lucas, Amahle, and Diego participate in communities related to growing the co-op movement. Their co-op not only pays them an internal rate for this time, but issues badges under Principle 6 (“cooperation among cooperatives”) of the <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity/">ICA principles</a>.  <p>By thinking about small businesses and networks of small businesses such as agencies and co-ops as communities of practice, we can think of all of the ways that recognition may occur. There are many ways in which autonomy, mastery, and purpose can develop, especially in worker-owned businesses. However, recognition which is portable, granular, and evidence-based does not happen by accident.</p> Next steps <p>Are you interested in Open Workplace Recognition and what it could mean for organisations like your own? Do you have questions about how to get started with Open Badges that recognise pro-social behaviours? What kind of things do colleagues in your organisation really&nbsp;value?</p><p>We’re happy to answer any questions you may have in the comments section. But also, start asking your colleagues, experiment with badges, and join the <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">KBW community</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/i-got-99-problems-but-recognition-aint-one-47e081a749cb">I got 99 problems, but recognition ain’t one</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO Developer Challenge 2022 – India has come to a successful close with the award ceremony held on January 20th, 2023, at the Samsung R&amp;D Institute in Noida.&nbsp;The challenge aimed to educate and support local adoption of FIDO technology.</p>



 
 

 



 

 
 



<p>First place was awarded to MonitorExam for their innovative FIDO-based online exam proctoring system.&nbsp;AyanWorks, with their FIDO-based SSI wallet, and AllSafe, a team of students with a FIDO-based SSO service, were also recognized as the other two top finalists.&nbsp; For the full details of ideas presented by the top three finalists, please view the recorded sessions:</p>



<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVdYFyiTbnY"></a>



<p>We would like to extend our gratitude to our sponsors, including <a href="https://www.visa.co.in/">Visa</a>, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/in/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/careers/our-locations/india/">Infineon</a>, <a href="https://ensurity.com/">Ensurity</a>, <a href="https://www.trustkeysolutions.com/">TrustKey</a>, and <a href="http://octatco.com/">Octatco</a>, for their support in making this event a success.</p>



<p>Departing Thoughts</p>



<p>The Indian government agencies, including Data Security Council India (<a href="https://www.dsci.in/">DSCI</a>), our local liaison partner, and the Controller of Certifying Authorities (<a href="https://cca.gov.in/">CCA</a>), which <a href="https://cca.gov.in/sites/files/pdf/esign/eSign-APIv3.3.pdf">officially endorses FIDO as the 2nd factor authentication</a>, are dedicated to promoting robust and user-friendly cybersecurity measures. We are confident that the India-focused FIDO Developer Challenge has made a positive impact by empowering local developers to rapidly deploy FIDO-based services, which provide enhanced protection against phishing-related cyber-attacks while maintaining ease of use for all online users.</p>



<p>Editor’s Note: This is the final blog posting covering the 2022 FIDO Developer Challenge – India.

<p>The number of Open Data ecosystems and industries covered is constantly growing and very soon people around the world will expect free and open access to their data across a wide range of use cases.&nbsp; But today, these ecosystems end at national or regional borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to share the final version of the whitepaper, “Open Banking and Open Data: Ready to Cross Borders?” More than 50 open data, digital identity and API security technologists&nbsp; globally contributed to this whitepaper to answer the following questions:</p>
 
 What are the differences and similarities between different open data ecosystems? 
 Is global interoperability between different ecosystems possible?&nbsp; 
 Who will be driving this movement and what are the use cases motivating them? How will users benefit? 
 How could cross-border use cases work and what “good might look like”? What are the architecture and governance requirements? 
 What can you do if you believe this is the right direction for Open Banking and Open Data? 
 
<p>The good news is that leading technologists already see a viable path to enable Open Banking and Open Data across borders. Our thanks to the contributing organizations and individuals for their efforts over the past year to visualize and distill these recommendations. If “past performance is indicative of future returns,” we can expect their recommendations will become reality in the months and years ahead. The principles and recommendations highlighted in this paper serve as a robust starting point for public and private stakeholder conversations in the months ahead.</p>
<p>The intended audiences for this paper are government officials, ecosystem implementers of open banking open data, and experts in the adjacent fields of cross-border payments, data privacy, international trade and digital identity. The whitepaper can be downloaded <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Help us to form the Open Data Community Group to take the principles, recommendations and diligence from this paper to brief public and private sector thought leaders, respond to government and intergovernmental requests for comment, and evaluate the optimal governance entities and approach. To join this interest group in crafting the Community Group goals, participation agreement, and roadmap please contact <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2023/02/06/final-version-of-open-banking-and-open-data-ready-to-cross-borders-whitepaper-published/">Final Version of “Open Banking and Open Data: Ready to Cross Borders?” Whitepaper Published</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

<p>Passwords are often an organisation’s weakest link. On World Password Day (May 5), Apple, Google and Microsoft jointly announced that they were building in support for passwordless sign-in, leveraging FIDO2, across all of the desktop, browser and mobile platforms that they control. Crucially, they have all emphasised cross-platform functionality will be a high priority in the development of FIDO2-based passwordless features. With the help of its community of identity, security and biometrics experts, the FIDO Alliance has developed and promoted free, open standards that have taken passwordless authentication to the next level.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar highlights growing cyber threats and e-scams amongst seniors online. As one of the least technologically savvy groups, the elderly is also one of the most vulnerable – and targeted – demographics by online scammers. To achieve a more secure Internet for everyone, we must ensure that the elderly’s needs and preferences are considered. Fortunately, there are readily available standards and best practices to help service providers guide users in adopting passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I want to personally thank all Foundation members who voted in the 2023 elections for representatives to the OpenID Foundation board of directors.</p>
<p>Each year Corporate members of the Foundation elect a member to represent them on the board with all Corporate members in good standing eligible to nominate and vote for candidates. Thank you to Ashish Jain, Chief Product Officer at Arkose Labs, and Dima Postnikov, Head of Identity Strategy and Architecture at ConnectID, for nominating themselves for this important board position that requires a substantial investment of time and energy.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to welcome Dima to the board of directors as the 2023 Corporate Representative. Dima’s ongoing support and contributions to the Foundation including being an active participant in FAPI WG working on supporting Open Banking initiatives worldwide and as co-chair of GAIN PoC working group delivering global interoperability for consumer identity are most appreciated. &nbsp;I look forward to his continued leadership in these regards as well as on the board of directors in 2023.</p>
<p>I want to kindly thank Ashish who served as Corporate Representative in 2021 and 2022 and has been a member of the task force defining the Foundation’s strategy and budget. I welcome Ashish’s continued involvement and contribution to the Foundation as his guidance and technical expertise has been of great value.</p>
<p>Per the Foundation’s bylaws, three individual board members represent the membership and the community at large. George Fletcher has one year remaining on his two-year term and I look forward George’s ongoing leadership in 2023 as he continues to contribute significantly as a member of the task force, executive committee and board of directors.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura and John Bradley were re-elected to two-year terms as Community member representatives. I want to thank Nat and John for their continued leadership of the Foundation in their positions as officers and members of the board of directors. I look forward to continuing to work with both closely as we execute the 2023 Foundation strategy and grow the Foundation.</p>
<p>Please join me in thanking Nat, John and Dima, as well as all of the board of directors, for their service to the Foundation and the community at large. And thank you to all members for your continued investment of time and membership that drives and supports the Foundation’s strategic initiatives.</p>

<p>Whatever security key you choose, it must be FIDO certified, Apple says. Apple has revealed what it believes are the best security keys to add an extra layer of protection to your digital world.&nbsp; The recent release of iOS 16.3 saw Apple add security key compatibility to its iPhone and iPad devices – as well as to its laptops and desktops with the macOS 13.2 update. Now, in a support document, the company has selected its recommendations for the best physical security keys to use with its devices, which comply with FIDO standards – the foremost alliance on credential security that most of big tech are signed up to.</p>

<p>Phishing refers to a variety of attacks that are intended to convince you to forfeit sensitive data to an imposter. These attacks can take a number of different forms; from spear-phishing (which targets a specific individual within an organization), to whaling (which goes one step further and targets senior executives or leaders). Furthermore, phishing attacks take place over multiple channels or even across channels; from the more traditional email-based attacks to those using voice – vishing – to those coming via text message – smishing. Regardless of the type or channel, the intent of the attack is the same – to exploit human nature to gain control of sensitive information (citation 1).&nbsp;These attacks typically make use of several techniques including impersonated websites, attacker-in-the-middle, and relay or replay to achieve their desired outcome.</p>

<p>Public review ends March 4th</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 and Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile Version 4.1 from the LegalXML Electronic Court Filing TC [1] are now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for Version 4.1 of these specifications.</p>



<p>ECF defines a technical architecture and a set of components, operations and message structures for an electronic court filing system, and sets forth rules governing its implementation.</p>



<p>LegalXML Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 (ECF v4.1) consists of a set of non-proprietary XML and Web Services specifications, along with clarifying explanations and amendments to those specifications, that have been added for the purpose of promoting interoperability among electronic court filing vendors and systems. ECF Version 4.1 is a maintenance release to address several minor schema and definition issues identified by implementers of the ECF 4.0 and 4.01 specifications.</p>



<p>Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile defines a Service Interaction Profile, as defined in section 5 of the ECF v4.1 specification. The Web Services Service Interaction Profile may be used to transmit ECF 4.1 messages between Internet-connected systems.</p>



<p>The documents and related files are available here:</p>

We don’t take on just any project — we prefer to work with organisations that are community-focused and trying to make the world a better place. Passbolt is focused on privacy and security, themes that are near and dear to our nerdy&nbsp;hearts.</p><p>As the passbolt community grows, they want to ensure that their values are baked into everything they do. They also want to be in a position to say no to corporate overloads and&nbsp;asshats.</p><p>WAO members have long been interested in the privacy and security space, and we feel like we have a lot to both learn as well as contribute. We’re good at community building, and a strong community means power. The power to say no, the power to influence change, the power to change the&nbsp;world.</p> Who: passbolt, WAO and&nbsp;YOU <p>The majority of the people currently in the passbolt community understand why password security matters and they are people who can help spread the word. They also understand the complexities of internet security and digital identity. These folks care about the ethics of their tech. There are active developers and security savvy people helping out with passbolt&nbsp;support.</p><p>We want to figure out how we can grow the community and to include people like…well, us. Internet savvy, privacy aware people. People who are trying to be safe online. People who love open source and want to contribute to a growing and ever more important conversation around online security, data privacy and the like. We want to learn and contribute to this discussion, and this community has something to teach&nbsp;us.</p> What: a privacy &amp; security focused community cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>We’re lucky to be able to build together with the passbolt community, instead of from scratch. We are starting by looking at the passbolt community using our patented* <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">Architecture of Participation</a>. This framework helps us make sure we’re covering our bases. We’ve written about applying it many times. You can read all about it&nbsp;in:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-architecture-of-participation-for-community-growth-ed9d964ec360">An Architecture of Participation for Community growth</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">Quick wins to improve your Open Source community’s Architecture of Participation</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/howto-create-an-architecture-of-participation-for-your-charity-project-7c83ebdfef2f">HOWTO: Create an Architecture of Participation for your Charity tech&nbsp;project</a>  <p>Other things we’re thinking about include resources that help ensure that community structures, workflows and processes are clear and being implemented. We’ll help the passbolt team and contributors embrace, encourage and distribute leadership.</p><p>* not actually patented because patents are corporate bullshit used to control people, keep people poor and generally stymie innovation</p> How: the tricky&nbsp;part cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>With any growing community there’s a delicate balance to be struck between improving things for new community members and ensuring that OG community members remain engaged. We’ve identified some areas that can help make the community experience more streamlined and robust. We’re also thinking about how to engage with current contributors and help them reach their&nbsp;goals.</p> Improving Documentation &amp;&nbsp;Pathways <p>Open Source projects are often spread out all over the web and that can be confusing for potential contributors. It’s important to ensure a project is navigable for people who aren’t yet members of the community. Entry points can be varied, but they should signpost and cross link to the information that people are looking for. Getting lost causes frustration, and improving documentation and creating explicit contributor pathways can help keep people involved.</p> Solid plans <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/10-reasons-why-people-contribute-to-open-source-d13b86b1e9d3">We found that there are 10 main reasons why people contribute to open source projects</a>. A solid engagement plan will consider these motivations and create pathways for people to level up their involvement with the project. No matter the motivation, contributors are more likely to continue using their skills on behalf of the project if they feel valued. Ensuring that contribution is recognised is an important part of a healthy community.</p><p>Solid engagement also means consistent engagement, so we’re thinking about the patterns and workflows we need to co-design and document in order to ensure that people feel supported. This includes things like transparent roadmaps, moderation plans or updated community resources.</p> Making it Super Easy to Contribute <p>Any time spent in the service of a collective project is an amazing gift to the community that manages it. There are so many ways to contribute to open source. Open source projects need developers, yes, but they also need a wide range of other types of people and skills in order to be a success. Something as simple as providing feedback can change the course of an initiative.</p><p>Creating an inclusive community means encouraging all sorts of people to see their skills as valuable and necessary. Lowering the technical bar to contribution can help, and here modularity is key. We need to think about what ‘Minimum Viable Contribution’ might be for this community, and then make it super easy to contribute.</p> Where: Across the web and at an event near&nbsp;you cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>We are working to tie together and create spaces to engage with anyone who cares about privacy and security. Passbolt will continue to host spaces for people who are highly technical, while also working to spread good practices and knowledge amongst people who are learning. A community is made up of the individuals who join it, so there’s no way of knowing what this community might become. Our intention, though, is that the passbolt community remains a welcoming and inclusive space.</p><p>People from the passbolt community are planning to be at a variety of open source events this year. <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/passbolt/">Next up is FOSDEM!</a> If you’re going to be there, we highly encourage you to say&nbsp;hello!</p> When: Now! <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/steps-to-success-when-building-a-community-of-practice-15bd7ed9ac5c">We know that building a community like this has a lot of ins and&nbsp;outs</a>.</p><p>Over the next months, WAO is going to help the passbolt team grow and engage an inclusive and healthy open source community. In addition to making sure that anyone can contribute to this amazing project, we want to help open sourcers, makers, co-ops, activists, edtechies and charity folks have an honest conversation about passwords. The reality is that people share passwords, and we’re not going to stop just because we are told it is a bad practice.</p> Help us! <a href="https://whimsical.com/community-roadmap-SaDWjPi7c4xKCmnJbkj4fg">Comment directly on the&nbsp;board!</a><p>We are making and sharing our plans with you, and we want your feedback!

<p>Voilà Verified Program Builds Real Trust in Digital Solutions by Spotlighting World-Class Vetted Digital Identity Solutions.</p>



<p>Vancouver, February 1st– The <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> (DIACC) is pleased to officially recognize Consult Hyperion as a Readiness Advisor to help vendors prepare for&nbsp; <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-overview/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a><a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-overview/">TM</a> (PCTF) certification.</p>



<p>A non-profit coalition of over 115 public and private members, the DIACC develops research and opportunities to enable Canada’s confident, safe, and full participation in a global digital economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the PCTF certification goals is to provide certainty and trust in the Canadian market by ensuring that the identity checks will be consistent and trustworthy. Getting Consult Hyperion recognized as a Readiness Advisor will help to prepare vendors to go through this journey,” says Joni Brennan, president of the DIACC. “With the PCTF, and now with Voilà Verified, there is an opportunity to adopt a framework rooted in trust – and to earn compliance recognition. Voilà Verified identifies those who are ‘walking the walk’ and delivering safe and secure access to the global digital economy.”</p>



<p>The DIACC’s PCTF is a publicly available framework for identity solutions that defines client, customer, and individual duty of care. The Voilà Verified program provides a vetting and assessment opportunity where PCTF-compliant solution vendors can earn a public-facing trustmark. The result? Spotlight visibility of trustworthy, safe, reliable, and efficient solutions.</p>



<p>‘Consult Hyperion is excited by the vibrant digital identity and authentication market within Canada and recognizes that the PCTF central to its success. A strong encompassing framework and robust certification process is the foundation for any interoperable service.’ &nbsp;says Justin Gage, Consult Hyperion’s Digital Identity delivery lead for North America. ”Consult Hyperion has over 20 years’ experience designing and implementing global interoperable payment systems, which are currently used by billions of people in every continent every day. More recently we have advised several organizations developing PCTF compliant solutions and look forward to helping them with their successful application to Voilà Verified for accreditation.”</p>



<p>Voilà Verified presents an opportunity to grow provincial-level investments in digital identity solutions. Provincial governments which have launched identity services can now earn a trustmark of their own, and provinces that are on the cusp of entering the digital solution market can do so with confidence by seeking vendors with a Voilà Verified trustmark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ruth Puente, Voilà Verified’s Trustmark Verification Program Manager, says “We are glad to welcome Consult Hyperion as a Readiness Advisor, which will bring its remarkable expertise in the identity domain to conduct gap analysis regarding the requirements that will help service providers to prepare the application for VVP Verification.”.</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is inclusive yet diligent in verifying PCTF-compliant solutions. The program was developed in alignment with ISO standards <a href="https://www.iso.org/benefits-of-standards.html">&nbsp;</a>– and empowers informed decision-making in a rapidly growing ecosystem of identity solutions,” said Puente. “Delivering high-quality service, customer protection, and Increasing access to trustworthy solutions are our priorities. We have formed teams of international experts to perform assessments and to oversee the process through an impartial lens.”</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is a unique opportunity in which I am honoured to share my experience as an advisor and auditor within information security, compliance, and identity,” says Björn Sjöholm, Cybersecurity Entrepreneur of Seadot, and Trustmark Oversight Board Chair.</p>



<p>Vendors are turning to the Voilà Verified program for several reasons, but the leading value proposition is market differentiation. Trustmark holders stand out from competitors by unlocking global business opportunities through international recognition and credibility.</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified puts internationally reputable identity solutions on the map,” says Dave Nikolejsin, the DIACC’s Board Chair. “This is the way forward. With lateral growth of PCTF compliance across sectors – public and private – we establish a common value of trust. Voilà Verified is a monumental stride for Canada to influence a safe and secure global digital economy.”</p>

<p>IBM, Publications Office of the European Union, and Others Advance Open Standard for IT-Enabled Code Lists Used in Transportation, Finance, and Other Areas</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 1 February 2023 – Members of OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, have approved Code List Representation (genericode) v1.0 as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies that highest level of ratification. Developed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/codelist">Code List Representation Technical Committee</a> (TC), the format, known as “genericode,” is a single semantic model for code lists and accompanying XML serialization that is designed to IT-enable and standardize the publication of machine-readable code list information and its interchange between systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A code list in its simplest form is a set of strings that represent an item or idea. Standardized code lists include country abbreviations, currency abbreviations, shipping container descriptors, and airport codes, while nonstandardized code lists used between trading partners include financial account types, workflow status indicators, and any set of values representing the semantics of related concepts known between the parties involved in information interchange. Genericode, a standardized code list representation, is a complete description of a code list, including alternate codes, and any other associated data. Genericode also describes how new code lists are derived from existing code lists, so that the derivation is repeatable, automatable and auditable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Code lists have been used for many years, often published and disseminated in manners that have not been IT-enabled nor standardized. Genericode is needed to ensure that communities, from business sectors to public authorities worldwide, are able to publish, exchange, and process code lists, a key element for business documents and data spaces interoperability, with a standardized IT-enabled representation,” said Andrea Caccia, Chair of the Code List Representation TC. “Since 2007, with the publication as a Committee Specification, genericode has been widely used. With its publication as an OASIS Standard, it’s expected to gain even more traction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Publications Office of the European Union publishes European Public Procurement Notices on the TED website. We are pleased to announce the new generation of these notices, eForms, has been restructured using UBL and the associated genericode files,” said Ms. Hilde Hardeman, Director General of the Publications Office of the European Union. “We have made the genericode files that we use in the notices freely available for reuse in EU Vocabularies under the eProcurement Business Collection.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participation in the Code List Representation TC is open to all through membership in OASIS. Key stakeholders (those who use code lists in their business exchanges) including standardization bodies, registration and source authorities, implementers of software and services, business sectors and public authorities, and others are invited to join the group.</p>

<p>2023 brings a new year and a new Congress – but America is still struggling with many of the same old problems when it comes to digital identity and authentication. Passwords keep getting phished, new account fraud keeps growing, and companies and consumers continue to struggle to prove that they are not a proverbial “dog on the Internet.” It’s becoming a major policy concern – and policymakers are considering a number of new initiatives to better protect people and combat these trends.</p>



<p>On January 25th, the Better Identity Coalition, FIDO Alliance, and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC) came together to present a policy forum looking at “Identity, Authentication, and the Road Ahead.”</p>



<p>This policy forum brought together leaders from government, industry, and non-profits to discuss topics including:</p>



 
 The release of the ID Theft Resource Center Annual Data Breach Report 



 The impact of identity-related cybercrime on industry and government over the last year 



 The human toll of identity theft – and the need to build inclusive digital identity systems that work for everyone 



 What to expect from the new Congress and the Biden Administration in 2023 



 Updates on new products and standards like FIDO that can make identity and authentication both more secure and easier to use 



 Discussions on what can be done to drive better identity infrastructure in America

<p>The identity landscape is set to undergo tremendous transformation in 2023 as lawmakers and regulators alike struggle to help protect individual privacy and improve access to services and the digital economy. A primary underpinning for what will enable the new identity landscape is strong authentication.</p>



<p>On Jan. 25, the<a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/"> Better Identity Coalition</a>, the FIDO Alliance, and the <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">ID Theft Resource Center</a> (ITRC) co-hosted the Identity, Authentication, and the Road Ahead Cybersecurity Policy Forum in Washington, D.C. to discuss the challenges and opportunities of identity and authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The full-day event included sessions loaded with data on the current state of data breaches, presentations by government leaders, panels on the state of passkeys and the path toward better identity in 2023 and beyond. A key theme that was often repeated throughout the day, by experts from government and industry alike, was the complexity of the identity landscape and the need for more collaboration and interoperable standards.</p>



<p>“A lot of our ability to make progress on the set of problems starts with a bigger issue, the recognition that identity is critical infrastructure and needs to be treated as such,” Jeremy Grant, Managing Director, Technology Business Strategy at Venable LLP and Coordinator, Better Identity Coalition said during his opening remarks for the event.</p>



<p>“Until we start to think about identity that way we’re going to continue to struggle to address challenges in this space.”</p>



 Identity risk continues to grow 



<p>In the opening keynote session, Jimmy Kirby, Acting Deputy Director of FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) outlined the identity related issues his agency has seen in recent years.</p>


 
 


<p>Kirby said that in recent years financial services have been increasingly migrating towards a primarily online environment. It’s a trend that creates new opportunities for abuse. As a result, FinCEN has been thinking about how it can leverage all of the data that financial institutions send to it to help stem the tide of abuse.&nbsp; He noted that identity related suspicious activity reports (SARs) submitted to FinCEN grew more than 15%, from 2021 to 2022.</p>



<p>According to Kirby, reports of threats at each stage of the customer identification process continue to grow from the proofing and enrollment stage to the authentication stage, including the use of compromised credentials, impersonation and artificial intelligence to conduct illicit finance.</p>



<p>While there are challenges, there are also opportunities.</p>



<p>“We see opportunities for digital identity to address customer identification breakdowns in customer onboarding, account logins, transaction monitoring, as well as in investigations,” Kirby said. “There are a number of features of a digital identity framework that, taken together, have the potential to address threats and spur innovation across all types of financial services.”</p>


 
 


<p>FinCEN isn’t the only organization seeing a spike in cybercrime. James Lee, COO of the ITRC (Identity Theft Resource Center) presented data from his organization’s <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/publication/2022-data-breach-report/">annual data breach report</a>. Among the top line highlights of the report is that there were 1,802 data breaches during the year impacting over 422 million victims.</p>



<p>Lee commented that a prevailing trend was an increase in supply chain attacks as a preferred attack vector over just malware. He also emphatically complained about the lack of information present in many data breach disclosures. Lee said that 66% of data breaches did not include information about the root cause of the attack which led to the breach or any victims details.</p>



<p>In a panel session, titled “Data Breach Notices Suck,” John Breyault, Vice President, Public Policy, Telecommunications and Fraud at <a href="https://nclnet.org">National Consumers League</a> (NCL) lamented the current state of password usage, which inevitably is a root cause for many data breaches.</p>



<p>“I have been doing consumer education work for 15 years now at NCL, and not a day goes by it seems that I don’t tell consumers to not use the same password across multiple accounts,” Breyault said.</p>



 Towards the U.S. Government plan on secure digital identity 



<p>In a lunchtime keynote, Congressman Bill Foster (IL-11), outlined his view on Congressional efforts to introduce a secure digital identity policy for the U.S.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>Foster emphasized time and again during his keynote that secure digital identity needs to be a bipartisan effort in the U.S. Congress as it’s an issue that impacts all Americans. While he noted that there might be some concerns about the U.S. government having a database of user identities that it issues, he argued that to most people, the real life threat to their privacy comes more from having someone impersonate them online.</p>



<p>The lack of secure digital identity may have also been a factor in the massive volume of fraud experienced by the U.S. government over COVID benefits. Conversely, the fact there wasn’t a secure digital identity scheme in place may have made it more difficult than necessary for some to be able to get benefits. Overall, Foster said that he’s hopeful Congress can put something together.</p>



<p>“It can serve as a gentle reminder that the government does some good in your life,” Foster said. “One of the things that we could do a much better job with is preventing identity fraud, because that’s a real life pain for tens of millions of Americans every year.”</p>



 Bias and diversity is a requirement of digital identity 



<p>In multiple sessions over the course of the event, the topic of fairness, bias and diversity in relation to digital identity was discussed.</p>



<p>Jordan Burris, VP and Head of Public Sector Strategy at Socure commented that in his view, bias a lot of times comes down to the reality that an identity approach is taken that is solving for the majority of the population, and as such, the minority or those who operate on the fringes are being left out of the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Andrew Stettner, Deputy Director for Policy at the Office of Unemployment Insurance Modernization at the U.S. Department of Labor argued that his agency and the entire administration are taking equity in identity very seriously.</p>



<p>“We’re looking at equity in a much more conscious way, for us is a very key element of identification going forward,” Stettner said.</p>



 Why FIDO is critical for better identity 



<p>A critical element of secure identity is having strong authentication.</p>


 
 


<p>In a keynote session, Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO of FIDO Alliance, outlined the ways that FIDO is playing a role in helping to improve the state of identity today across multiple efforts. He also predicted that FIDO will become increasingly relevant in the year ahead.</p>



<p>“The average person on the street will start to understand what identity verification means, and actually start to understand what digital identity means,” Shikiar said. “That’s a net benefit because the more people understand what their identity means, and the importance of it, the more steps they’ll take to actually protect it.”</p>



<p>Among the FIDO efforts to help improve identity outlined by Shikiar are:</p>



 
 Biometric performance criteria. This is a biometric certification program, where FIDO helps to assess the performance of different biometric components that are critical to identity verification. 



 Remote Identity Verification. This includes the Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification for mobile document verification, with ongoing work into face verification for liveness and selfie-match. 
 



<p>Shikiar also talked at length about <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, which brings added usability to FIDO based strong authentication.</p>



<p>“FIDO Alliance’s mission is to reduce the industry reliance on passwords,” Shikiar said. “Simply put, passkeys stand to take passwords out of play for the vast majority of consumer use cases.”</p>



 The passkey future for authentication 



<p>In a panel session on passkeys, panelists discussed the benefits and opportunities that passkeys will bring.</p>


 
 


<p>Tim Cappalli, Identity Standards Architect at Microsoft detailed what passkeys enable, including the ability to take a FIDO credential and use it in a similar way to how password managers work today. Passkeys can also be synchronized with a cloud provider and are interoperable across platform vendors enabling better usability overall.</p>



<p>Panelists emphasized that the promise of passkeys is to more easily enable users to benefit from strong authentication. Christiaan Brand, Product Manager, Identity and Security at Google explained that Google has been supporting FIDO for years, including supporting security key based approaches. In his view, passkeys represent the usability necessary to actually make strong authentication with un-phishable credentials a reality for Google’s users.</p>



<p>Usability was also a theme that Paul Grassi, Principal Product Manager – Identity Services at Amazon emphasized, since in in his view, past efforts to get strong authentication adoption haven’t been entirely successful</p>



<p>“It breaks my heart to say it but consumers are not adopting security keys, they’re not adopting Google Authenticator they’re not adopting two-factor,” Grassi said. “We’re excited to see passkeys as that replacement, and to see the adoption numbers skyrocket, reducing friction while increasing security, which is, I think, the goal of any security practitioner.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/multi-factor-authentication">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>&nbsp;gets touted as a significant security improvement over traditional “username + password” authentication. However, not all MFA processes are created equal. As the opportunities narrow for cybercriminals to pick off the low-hanging fruit of password-only systems, they’ve turned their focus to weak MFA.</p>



<p>A growing number of organizations have suffered security breaches&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">despite having MFA in place</a>, thanks to expanding digital systems, more advanced phishing tools, and the continued allowance of passwords as an authentication factor. The past year, which saw Microsoft,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">Uber and Cisco</a>&nbsp;breached by MFA “prompt bombing,” demonstrates that organizations can’t just deploy any type of MFA and presume they’re safe from breaches.</p>



<p>For these reasons, the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency</a>&nbsp;(CISA) have emphasized the need for phishing-resistant MFA, specifically passwordless MFA built around FIDO standards. We’ve examined&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-fido2-authentication">FIDO standards</a>&nbsp;and what they mean for authentication before, but in this post, we look at one of the most critical elements of the process: FIDO Certified authenticators.</p>

<p>Well-implemented passkeys can improve the user experience and make it harder for cybercriminals to launch phishing and other attacks. </p>



<p>Passwords are a central aspect of security infrastructure and practice, but they are also a principal weakness involved in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2022/summary-of-findings/">81% of all hacking breaches</a>. Inherent useability problems make passwords difficult for users to manage safely. These security and useability shortcomings have driven the search for alternative approaches known generally as passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>Passkeys are a kind of passwordless authentication that is seeing increasing focus and adoption. They are set to become a key part of security in the coming years. Passkeys represent a more secure foundation for enterprise security. Although they are not foolproof (they can be synced to a device running an insecure OS, for example), they are far more secure than passwords for customers, employees, and partners alike.</p>

 Trusted and extensible product master data hub based on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph and GS1 standards  Product master data — the foundation for supply chain visibility <p>Product master data is important in supply chain networks because it provides a consistent, accurate, and up-to-date set of information about the products that are being bought, sold, and moved through the supply chain. This data can be used by various stakeholders in the supply chain, such as manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, logistics providers, and consumers, to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and improve efficiency.</p><p>Having access to reliable product master data also sets the foundation for business partners to generate more advanced insights into their supply chains, including product supply chain visibility, authenticity verification, utilization reporting, and other insights that enable more sustainable supply chain management. For example, product master data, combined with LOT master data and supply chain event data, made interoperable using GS1 standards, is essential to getting a comprehensive end-to-end understanding of what transpired to products as they flowed through the supply chain towards the consumer — and make the necessary business decisions to address any identified issues.</p><p>There are several potential challenges that manufacturers face when it comes to sharing product master data with their business partners:</p>  Data quality — product master data shared with business partners needs to be accurate and up-to-date to avoid misunderstandings and making decisions based on outdated or wrong information. Maintaining data quality is therefore one of the key things for manufacturers to consider when setting up product master data-sharing mechanisms.  Data standardization — manufacturers share product master data with numerous business partners, so they need to make sure it is standardized and not in different formats for every business partner. Standardization significantly reduces the effort associated with sharing product master data and ensures everyone understands it in the same way. This is where GS1 standards, specifically the GS1 Global Data Model (GDM) and GS1 Attribute Definitions for Business (ADB), play a crucial&nbsp;role.  Data security — product master data may contain sensitive information about a manufacturer’s product and business operations. Sharing this data with business partners may increase the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to the data, so manufacturers need to make sure that there is sufficient data security in&nbsp;place.  Data ownership — sharing product master data is often done through third parties that aggregate master data from multiple manufacturers and enable access to their business partners. In these situations, manufacturers might have considerations about handing over the ownership of their data, as this data is inherently valuable.  <p>Some existing frameworks for product master data exchange, such as the GS1 GDSN Master Data Pools where GS1-certified third parties provide infrastructure for sharing product master data between manufacturers and their business partners, help address the first three challenges. However, the data ownership issue still persists, as these third parties aggregate product master data from various manufacturers in centralized systems, making them the de-facto data owners. Additionally, product master data in such systems is relatively isolated from and can’t be linked to other relevant supply chain data, such as LOT master data, supply chain events, IoT data, and others. This prevents manufacturers and their business partners from utilizing product master data to its full potential.</p> Trusted sharing of product master data with the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph and GS1 standards <p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) is an open-source infrastructure blending two powerful technologies, knowledge graphs and blockchains, to facilitate the trusted exchange of supply chain data. This is done by enabling businesses to transform their data into discoverable, verifiable, and interoperable knowledge assets. In the context of supply chains, a knowledge asset can be a variety of things, for example, a supply chain event, business location, trade document, or in this case product master&nbsp;data.</p><p>Turning their product master data into knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG, manufacturers essentially create an index of that data that their business partners can search to retrieve the required product information. This innovative and trusted way of exchanging product master data delivers value from multiple&nbsp;angles:</p>  Even though product master data is indexed on the OriginTrail DKG, the actual data can be kept on the manufacturer’s own IT real estate, allowing them to retain full data ownership and simply authorize their business partners to access it. When it comes to data privacy, the OriginTrail DKG allows for a full spectrum of&nbsp;options.  Product master data on the OriginTrail DKG is trusted and verifiable, meaning business partners can be absolutely certain that the data they need was issued by the product manufacturer.  Created knowledge assets are interoperable based on GS1 Global Data Model (GDM) standard, the same as in a traditional GDSN network, so they can be searched for and understood by all business partners.  Knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG can be easily updated at any time, ensuring that the latest product master data is available to business partners at all&nbsp;times.  <p>All of the characteristics above provide a powerful way to manage product master data, but this is only setting the foundation for a variety of other advanced business applications that can make use of it. As product master data in the form of knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG doesn’t live in isolation, it can be automatically linked to other relevant supply chain data across business partners. For example, it can be combined with instance/lot master data (GS1 CBV standard), relevant business locations (GS1 GLN Data Model standard), supply chain and consumer/end-user generated events (GS1 EPCIS standard), and other relevant data to provide comprehensive insights into supply chains, ranging from end-to-end product traceability to utilization reports, incident alerts, shipment risk profiling, insurance-related proofs, and many&nbsp;more.</p>Product master data and other supply chain data in the form of knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG, utilizing GS1 data standards.<p>Building such a supply chain data management hub with the OriginTrail DKG and GS1 standards can start off simple, focusing only on product master data, and be extended in stages — it is easy to introduce additional components, i.e. supply chain data, IT systems, and business partners. In fact, to streamline the creation and management of assets on the OriginTrail DKG, Trace Labs developed the Network Operation System (nOS) that makes it easy to connect to IT systems, apply the appropriate GS1 standards to the data, and create discoverable, verifiable and interoperable assets. Once those assets are available, specific business applications that make use of them can be built&nbsp;quickly.</p> AidTrust: A BSI and Trace Labs&nbsp;solution <p>Ensuring the transparency and traceability of medicine distribution is important, but it can be challenging. Pharmaceutical supply chains are increasingly complex and often don’t have standardized management controls, leading to issues with security, inventory management, and other aspects of distribution. If product distribution is not properly managed, it can result in suspicious loss, diversion, damaged and wasted products, and uncertainty about whether the medicines reached their intended patients.</p><p><a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/healthcare/donated-medicines-and-vaccines/">AidTrust</a> increases transparency and trust in the distribution of medicines by bringing together BSI’s global presence and supply chain risk management expertise with the OriginTrail DKG, developed by Trace Labs. As a business application built on the OriginTrail DKG, it enables visibility (product flows and utilization, inventory levels, etc.), risk alerts, and real-time decision-making at all stages of the supply chain while protecting the integrity, security, and privacy of data. Ultimately, the goal of AidTrust is to help donor organizations and NGOs demonstrate that donated medicines were handled properly and reached the intended patients, even in challenging environments.</p><p>BSI and Trace Labs have been working with the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), an NGO distributing donated hemophilia medicine to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), to deploy AidTrust across 25+ treatment centers in India. The main objective is to better understand product utilization through increased supply chain visibility, particularly after products arrive at the in-country distribution center and are distributed to treatment centers across India. To achieve this, knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG are created from existing data locked in IT systems, amended by supply chain data generated by warehouse staff, treatment center staff, and physicians using the AidTrust scanning&nbsp;app:</p>  Product master data (GS1 GDM standard), such as manufacturer, GTIN, product description, and packaging level. This is the foundation that enables all other supply chain data to be linked and understood in a comprehensive manner,  Product LOT master data (GS1 CBV standard), such as LOT numbers and expiry&nbsp;dates,  Supply chain events (GS1 EPCIS standard), such as shipping, receiving, destroying, and dispensing to patients. Some events are generated from data already stored in IT systems, while others are created using data captured by users with the AidTrust scanning&nbsp;app.  <p>These verifiable and interoperable knowledge assets from across the supply chain network power the AidTrust business app, where WFH can log in and get real-time utilization reporting, diversion alerts, inventory overview of treatment centers, and other insights. This enables them to manage their donations much more efficiently and helps ensure products reach their intended patients. After successful deployment in India, BSI and Trace Labs are now in discussion for rollout to further countries.</p>AidTrust dashboard and scanning application.<p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing trusted AI — grade knowledge assets.

 What did you work on? 



<p>Project name: <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62242656">GVCR: Secure Verifiable Credential Registries (VCR) for GitHub &amp; GitLab</a></p>



<p>My name is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sarvesh67">Sarvesh Shinde</a> and this is my personal blog that I’m writing to share my experience of working on the GVCR Project. A little background about the project is really necessary to fully appreciate the objectives of this project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a digital identity management model in which an individual or a company has the exclusive ownership over their accounts and personal data. A verifiable credential protocol, in turn, forms one of the three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity, along with the Decentralized Identifiers protocol (DIDs) and Distributed Ledger Technology (or blockchain).</p>



<p>This project was conceptualized to provision secure verifiable credential registries that utilize Github’s data model and API to offer exactly the same APIs for any other verifiable credential registry. This project exists as an extension to the DRMan project.</p>



<p>The DRMan project, inspired by the SDKMan, acts as a tool for managing multiple versions of different software development libraries. These libraries form the necessary dependencies for the extended feature modules that reside inside DRMan, including GVCR.</p>



 What did you learn or accomplish? 



<p>GVCR, along with DRMan, is a command line utility. This project has been entirely written in shell script. Shell script has a distinct advantage of making the tool light weight, easy to install and to use.</p>



<p>As of now, GVCR has been provisioned to utilize Github and Gitlab as its two git based registries. The plugin architecture of GVCR allows it to provision for more VCRs in the relative future. The APIs of these individual git based registries are designed to be a collection of facade functions that provide the same feature on the surface, all the while accommodating for the individual data models of the specific registry under the hood.</p>



<p>GVCR can be utilized in an <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> Framework as an implementation of VCR and collaborates with existing Agent and Wallet open source projects in Hyperledger Aries. It can also be used in <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> projects by providing endpoints of cryptographic verifications for credential issuers.</p>



<p>In near future, GVCR is envisioned to leverage <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a> to implement encryption, decryption and verification functions for verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>I was responsible for the design and implementation of this very GVCR module.</p>



<p>Now coming to the topic of the mentorship program itself, let me give you a rundown of its structure, working mechanism and decision making process. This mentorship was a careful balance of a hands-off approach towards the design planning and realization part that I undertook and the existence of biweekly meetings that acted as an efficient feedback mechanism from the mentors. These biweekly meetings were really efficient in setting the tempo of the progress and made sure that all the involved participants were aware of their individual tasks at hand.</p>



<p>The mentorship started on June 1st and continued until November 16th. Further, the mentorship was broken into two halves. In general, the first half was more focused on the design aspect of this project while the second half came down to its implementation.</p>



 What comes next? 



<p>Overall, this mentorship has been a wonderful experience and has enabled me to pursue my career in blockchain. The future of a secure, verifiable digital identity and its co-operability with a decentralized ledger brings a new outlook to the future of digital identity and just how important its acceptance is to finally realizing the ultimate goal of exclusively owning our own identities. New technologies are constantly coming up to make this future a reality, and I’m looking forward to contributing my part towards it.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of the ADI Association?</p>



<p>The mission of the ADI Association is to create a global digital identity framework for creating, managing, and using digital identity as well as sharing personal information. This system solves some of the most important practical problems attached to the operation and adoption of decentralized identity technology with an accountable governance framework by enabling a business interoperability layer as well as a technological specification.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Establishing an effective model for digital identity is a priority that spans industries. The traditional identity model for the digital world has been an account with a password. Service Providers give each of their customers an account and assume that those accounts can be secured. However, accounts are breached, and data are compromised. Service Providers do not often even know if the person who created the account was legitimate. In the physical world, individuals can prove who they are by presenting formal documents like a driver’s license, passport, or birth certificate. In the digital world, individuals cannot definitively prove who they are, and the malicious can easily masquerade as someone they are not. This gap between physical and digital identity has led to an exponential increase in online fraud as more interactions and financial transactions have gone digital. It has also led to a rapid rise in misinformation and disinformation propagating through online social media. </p>
 



  
<a href="https://adiassociation.org/"></a> 


<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>In the physical world, identities are created at birth by a trusted group of people. Parents choose names; hospitals record birth events; and governments create birth records, which are then used by individuals to register at schools, employers, banks, medical facilities, and so on. Everything an individual does in life is tied to that identity, and that identity becomes the accountable party. ADI Association has defined a similar concept for the digital world, called the “Digital Address.” The next generation of federated identity standards should support the issuance of a lifetime digital identity that a consumer can use across the digital services of their choice. It should eliminate passwords and protect personal data. The Accountable Digital Identity (ADI) Association is developing an open standard, based on decentralized identity, for bootstrapping individual identities online. The work will give identity providers and relying parties a framework to establish secure exchanges of identity-based services for their consumers, customers, employees, and partners. The ADI Association focuses on standards that enhance the digital consumer experience while improving cyber security at the same time.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>As a current leader, Canada has the opportunity to frame how the future gets shaped by digital identity for both online use cases as well as in the physical world.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>The ADI Association believes that this work cannot be done by a single organization, but will only be realized by concerted efforts to create and promote open standards which can be made available to and adopted by all.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>The ADI Association is a diverse coalition of companies and organizations from around the world who have come together to create an interoperable specification and ecosystem for accountable identity. This level of coordination across industries seamlessly connects a global community of businesses, governments, healthcare providers, and other organizations with customers, people, and patients to modernize the way we manage our online digital interactions.</p>

 Documenting our first IRL meetup since the&nbsp;pandemic From left: John Bevan, Bryan Mathers, Doug Belshaw, Anne Hilliger, Laura&nbsp;Hilliger<p>Last week, four members of We Are Open Co-op, plus one collaborator, descended on an American-style villa in the Netherlands for a meetup. We left with three members, two collaborators, a new pair of socks, some plans, and great memories.</p><p>Our aims and ‘rules’ for the week, such as they were, could be outlined&nbsp;simply:</p>  Take some time away from client projects to reflect on who we are, where we’ve been, and where we’re&nbsp;going.  Hang out with each other in real life and have some&nbsp;fun.  The co-op will pay for everything. Except&nbsp;spirits.  <p>Well, we managed two of the three. And it didn’t get too messy after some heavy pouring by the bartender at the <a href="https://tontonclub.nl/">TonTon Club</a>&nbsp;🥃</p> Collaborator pathways &amp; member&nbsp;benefits CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual&nbsp;Thinkery</a><p>After an extended period of <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/guidelines/membership">dormancy</a> in 2022, we knew that Bryan intended to step down as a director of WAO to become a collaborator. We’re looking forward to actually working with him more this year than last, now that he’s done the “wandering and crying” (his words!) needed to find <a href="https://ulster.visualthinkery.com/">what’s been calling&nbsp;him</a>.</p><p>The image above was drawn by Bryan during a session where we though about what it means to be a collaborator with, versus being a member of, WAO. As with any business, it’s about money and power, although that operates in a different way within an organisation with a flat hierarchy and <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2020/08/25/consent-decision-making/">consent-based decision&nbsp;making</a>.</p><p>Essentially, we would love to grow the co-op by working with more collaborators. The benefit for us includes everything from accessing new clients to learning new skills and discovering different ways of working. We would hope that the benefits of working with WAO are manifold and obvious, but for the avoidance of doubt, it’s autonomy, solidarity, and a pathway to becoming a&nbsp;member.</p> Highway to membership CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual&nbsp;Thinkery</a><p>Talking of pathways to becoming a member of WAO, we talked about that too! Outlining a policy for this is a bit of a ‘Goldilocks’ strategy, as while the <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity/">first principle</a> of the International Cooperative Alliance is ‘voluntary and open membership’ there has to be some kind of speedbump. That barrier can’t be too high, though, otherwise we’ll never be able to welcome anybody&nbsp;new.</p><p>What we’ve settled on for now isn’t too much different from what went before. To join WAO, you need&nbsp;to:</p>  bring in work from your&nbsp;network  have worked with every current WAO&nbsp;member  mesh with our&nbsp;values  <p>Some of this is subjective. Of course it is. But then being a member of WAO currently also means being a company director so we want to get it right. While things may change in future with more than one class of membership, for now any additional members of WAO are taking on joint <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10150608">legal responsibility</a>.</p> Introducing the ‘Context Understudy’ CC BY <a href="https://laurahilliger.com">Laura Hilliger</a> of&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>When you’re a small organisation like our co-op, knowledge management can be both easier and more difficult than when you’re either a larger organisation or a single freelancer. It’s not sustainable for one member to be on every project, but nor is it reasonable to spend time documenting every little thing on every&nbsp;project.</p><p>At the meetup, we created the role of the ‘Context Understudy’. It’s a title that may change in name over time, but the idea is that they are the go-to partner for co-working. Just like an understudy in a theatrical play, they can step in as and when needed. They’re also the default person to co-work with on the&nbsp;project.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you have to be a member to lead a WAO project but you don’t have to be in order to be a Context Understudy. In fact, in terms of the ‘highway to membership’, bringing a project to the co-op and working on it in this way is a perfect&nbsp;fit.</p><p>We haven’t got a name we’re completely happy with for other roles on the project. ‘Skills provider’ feels… a bit corporate? Although that’s exactly what other people are bringing. As with everything, it’s a work in progress.</p> And now for something completely different… <p>If you’ve scrolled this far, you deserve more fun photos of our meetup. And we hate to disappoint!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wao-were-almost-seven-8921f530284b">WAO!

<p>The amount of data available about almost anything is growing, but if it’s not collected, processed and used in thoughtful and critical ways, the data increases risk of harm – especially to marginalised communities.</p>



<p>Many organisations doing evidence-based advocacy handle large amounts of data and need to strengthen their capacity to manage, store, and archive the data responsibly, as well as grow their knowledge on how to disseminate and present this data to external audiences in easily digestible ways.</p>



<p>Today we are launching a pilot of our new cohort learning programme: a collaborative course aimed to equip social justice leaders with the knowledge and tools needed for implementing responsible data (RD) practices and policies for their own internal operations, as well as for their advocacy efforts.</p>



 Our approach to cohort learning 



<p>Cohort learning represents a capacity building approach that connects peer support with tailored knowledge and vision, built from research, technical experimentation and community engagement The Engine Room has led over the past years.</p>



<p>Inspired by feminist movements and the “<a href="https://www.freire.org/paulo-freire/" title="">popular education</a>” movement that emerged in Latin America and widely adopted in other parts of the world, we are proposing a participatory learning approach that will allow participants to share their individual knowledge and enrich each other through collective engagements with the cohort. </p>



<p>Through community-facing activities we will stress the “action/reflection” principle; as the Freire Foundation <a href="https://www.freire.org/concepts-used-by-paulo-freire" title="">defines</a> this: “It is not enough for people to come together in dialogue in order to gain knowledge of their social reality. They must act together upon their environment in order critically to reflect upon their reality and so transform it through further action and critical reflection.”</p>



 What will the programme look like? 



<p>The learning process will consist of engaging sessions with experts from The Engine Room, asynchronous activities such as reading guided material and watching videos, and community building activities where participants facilitate conversations within their organisations and movements.</p>



<p>Once a module starts, participants will be asked to read selected material and watch presentations from the responsible data community. In the third week, participants will engage in a 1,5 hour session with the team that will lead to assignments meant to bring their learnings back to their communities for discussion. Throughout the module, participants will have the opportunity to connect online through an immersive virtual environment.</p>



<p>By the end of this learning programme, we hope that members of the cohort will be able to: </p>



 
 Apply responsible data principles to their own work. 



 Evaluate the relationship between power and the data they collect, and be able to identify and reject data practices that cause harm to the communities they serve. 



 Continue building connections with others in the field and accompany each other in their journey. 
 



<p>At the end of the program, participants will be connected to our <a title="">Light Touch Support</a> programme to receive guidance for their organisation to strengthen a responsible data area of their choice.</p>



 Programme content 



<p>Module 1: Introduction to responsible data management<br>During weeks 1 and 2, we’ll focus on everyone getting to know each other and establishing some ground rules together for an inclusive space where we can explore ideas, ask questions and learn from each other. We will also start diving into key concepts and principles that drive responsible data management, and reflect on how your organisation may already be using responsible data practices and how you may be able to apply this framework in future.</p>



<p>Module 2: Justice-based approach to data<br>Given the array of harms that people have caused (and continue to cause) through their use (or misuse) of data, this module considers how to apply justice frameworks to data. The resources cover data justice, data feminism and decolonial approaches to managing and thinking about data through a variety of readings, podcast episodes and videos. We’ll discuss what resonates and how these approaches can be applied in our various contexts.</p>



<p>Module 3: Where to start and what responsible data looks like for an organisation<br>It’s time to dive deeper into responsible data management. We’ll look at what RD means for your organisation, collective or movement, help you to understand where you’ve taken steps already and where you need to fill in gaps, and start strategising about ways to further apply the RD principles.</p>



<p>Module 4: Becoming RAD<br>Using what we’ve learned in previous modules, we’ll now focus on practical applications of RD. We’ll dive deeper into the data lifecycle, spend time on topics relevant to data collection such as informed consent, walk you through activities such as storing and analysing data, and lastly discuss ways of sharing your data safely and securely. Through this session, you’ll learn how to start developing your plan for data retention, archiving and deletion and how to map your organisation’s critical information management processes and assets, as well as potential data risks and harms.</p>



<p>Module 5: Moving Forward<br>RD encompasses every stage of the data process, from data collection to deletion. It’s a lot to work on, so how do you figure out where to start? We’ll explore how to make RD transformations doable by beginning with a few simple changes and developing a plan for identifying and addressing gaps.</p>

     <p>Two of the largest mobility-focused consortia in the world join efforts to co-develop solutions for more robust, resilient, and privacy-preserving connected ecosystems.   </p>
<p>Los Angeles — 23 January 2023: MOBI (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative) today welcomes the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), an innovation and advocacy group representing over 16,000 franchised new-car dealer members, into its global community. </p>
<p>The MOBI community aims to develop and accelerate adoption of zero trust Web3 standards and solutions to enable seamless and secure business processes, while safeguarding sensitive business and consumer data. NADA brings a critical dealer viewpoint to this process. MOBI and NADA agree that the widespread adoption of a shared technology-agnostic framework will be critical to future innovations for members of both consortia. NADA and MOBI also believe that compliance with the Federal Zero Trust Strategy issued by the White House in 2022 will be crucial to maintain their competitive edge. </p>
<p>“We are thrilled to team up with NADA to co-develop solutions to help solve pain points for use cases such as Vehicle Registration, Titling, and Dealer Floorplan Audit,” said MOBI CEO and Founder, Tram Vo. “We look forward to collaborating on additional mobility and geolocation applications that improve security while preserving customer privacy.”</p>
<p>“NADA is excited to work with the experts at MOBI on behalf of dealers to ensure that this important technology improves and modernizes the auto retail experience, generates efficiencies, and brings increased convenience for dealers and consumers alike,” said Mike Stanton, President and CEO of NADA. </p>
<p>MOBI anticipates that NADA’s entry into the community at large will play a critical role in igniting a two-way exchange of expertise between the organizations’ respective communities, enabling greater collaboration on the road to more resilient mobility value chains and accelerating related innovations in research, development, and implementation. MOBI welcomes organizations of all sizes, industries, and locations to share expertise, define industry standards, and improve the sustainability, efficiency, and accessibility of mobility services around the world.</p>

<p>Ceramic’s first hard fork will take place on February 15, 2023.</p><p>All Ceramic nodes operating on Ceramic mainnet must upgrade to (at least) version <code>2.18.0</code> of the <code>@ceramicnetwork/cli</code> package by February 15, 2023.</p><p>The ‘HistorySync release’ will result in changes to Ceramic’s anchoring system, this work will enable the upcoming release of <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/composedb-using-ceramic-as-a-graph-database/">ComposeDB</a>. These changes will allow nodes to discover and sync existing data, for a given data model, from other nodes on the network.</p><p>Nodes that do not upgrade by February 15th will no longer verify anchor commits from the network, which will lead to the corruption and loss of all writes due to CACAO timeout errors. If you are operating a Ceramic mainnet node, please let us know if you have any concerns about upgrading on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a>.</p> Protocol Changes <p>Two main changes will affect how anchoring (time-stamping) works:</p>  There will no longer be simple, or regular, transactions to put Merkle tree roots onto Ethereum. Instead, an anchor smart contract will call an “anchor” function resulting in an “anchor event” that Ethereum RPC clients can subscribe to. This will make it easier for Ceramic nodes to discover when anchors happen and to sync the history of anchor events.  The second change is designed to make the system more resilient to block reorgs on Ethereum. Ceramic anchor commits will no longer include the specific blockNumber and blockTimestamp that the anchor event was included in, as it’s possible the transaction could later be reorged into a new block. Instead, Ceramic will only use the transaction hash and will look up which blockNumber the transaction was included in from Ethereum directly.  <p>Both of these updates require changes to the js-ceramic node implementation, so that the node can still know how to verify and apply anchor commits with the new behavior. Nodes that haven’t upgraded will experience failures when applying anchor commits. Data update commits that are not anchored within the CACAO timeout period will then fail to apply since the node will not be able to verify that the update was created during the time when the CACAO (the capability that gave the app permission to write into the stream on behalf of the user) was valid. Over time this can corrupt the state of streams and invalidate writes that seemed to be applied successfully at first, but then are later invalidated when CACAO times out.</p><p>Please get in touch with us on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a> for assistance or if you have any other questions! </p>

<p>According to a PayPal notice of security incident dated January 18, attackers got unauthorized access to the accounts of thousands of users between December 6 and 8, 2022. The total number of accounts that were accessed by threat actors using a credential stuffing attack is reported as being 34,942. While accepting that PayPal is seemingly doing the best it can for the customers involved in this security incident by recommending password changes, Jasson Casey, chief technology officer at Beyond Identity insists that “passwords – whether unique or complex – are fundamentally flawed.” Instead, Casey says, organizations should be moving to phishing-resistant credentials such as the FIDO Alliance standard blueprints.</p>

<p>On major trend from 2022 is the continued evolution of the fraud industry. A combination of active and passive authentication can ensure that the payments flow is secure while limiting the impact on the customer experience. Major global payment schemes are introducing new regulations that will see banks recognize the authentication work done on the merchant side. This means that merchants are able to leverage industry authentication standards like FIDO Alliance to create their own checkout journey to reduce the friction between the customer and merchant services. This helps combat both fraud and cart abandonment, helping to deliver higher sales conversion rates and a better return on investment.</p>

<p>As an organisation we are committed to <a href="https://responsibledata.io/what-is-responsible-data/" title="">responsible data</a>, which includes practices such as data minimisation, seeking consent, establishing a RAD plan (or a plan for <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Retention, Archival and Deletion</a> of the data we use in our work) and more.</p>



<p>Last week, in the spirit of starting the work year with some RAD energy, our team got together to have a “digital declutter fest”. Equipped with a cleaning-themed playlist (including tunes like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JfEJq56IwI" title="">Outkast’s “So Fresh, So Clean”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDLNmailOwI" title="">Hilary Duff’s “Come Clean</a>”), we went through folders from past projects and listed which subfolders and files needed to be “cleaned” or re-organised.</p>



<p>During the declutter session we didn’t actually archive or delete files from our shared Drive.We used the template below to identify what needed to be deleted or archives and what needed a closer review (by project managers or other team members who worked on the project).</p>



<p>We especially kept an eye out for files that could possibly include personal data and/or sensitive data, and also files that have not been used in a long time and that we wouldn’t need in the future (such as email drafts or notes from calls with partners from projects that are no longer active). In short, every time we saw something that required further action, we made a note of it on the template.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the session, we reflected on the process, noting how this was a practical way of acting on our Responsible Data values. We talked about the importance of&nbsp; taking care of the data and information we might hold on our partners and research participants (like email addresses and interview notes), the usefulness of reviewing our RAD plan frequently (especially when working on long projects in which many years worth of information can accumulate) and the ways we can make a habit out of digital decluttering our organisational and individual files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the call, we divided up the work of actually reviewing the identified files, with plans to responsibly archive the things we want to keep and delete what we no longer need.&nbsp;</p>



 Declutter your own digital space 



<p>If you’re interested in having a similar digital decluttering session with your team, feel free to use and adapt the template we used (reproduced below!).</p>

<p>I would also recommend taking a look at our resource “<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD – How to Retain, Archive and Dispose of data responsibly</a>”. It’s a short collection of tipsheets designed to support civil society organisations taking the first steps towards becoming RAD and developing responsible and streamlined processes for retaining, archiving and deleting data, currently available in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/RAD-Tip-Sheets.pdf" title="">English</a>, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Becoming-RAD-en-espanol-october-22.pdf" title="">Spanish</a> and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Apprentissage-RAD.pdf" title="">French</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 Trace Labs, the core development company of OriginTrail, joins Sustainable Medicines Partnership to help make medicines more accessible and sustainable <p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a>, the core development company of OriginTrail, is excited to announce that we have joined the <a href="https://www.yewmaker.com/smp">Sustainable Medicines Partnership (SMP)</a>, a not-for-profit, multi-stakeholder, action collaborative of 48 organizations. The SMP is committed to reducing waste of medicines and medicines packaging, making medicines more accessible and more sustainable.</p><p>The purpose of the partnership is to bring together leading organizations from across the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry to collaborate and share knowledge, in order to find sustainable solutions to the challenges facing the industry. Trace Labs will play an important role in this partnership by supporting the creation of industry relevant knowledge assets on the <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;(DKG)</a>.</p><p>These verifiable knowledge assets will be used to advance the mission of the SMP by providing data that can be used to identify and track the movement of medicines and packaging materials throughout the supply chain. This will enable the SMP to identify areas where waste is occurring and develop solutions to reduce it. Additionally, knowledge assets will be used to improve the accessibility and sustainability of medicines by providing insights into the distribution and delivery of medicines to patients.</p>The Sustainable Medicines Partnership (SMP) is a not-for-profit, multi-stakeholder, action collaborative of 48 organisations. The SMP is executing a four year programme to build science-based, scalable, sustainable solutions to reduce the waste of medicines and the waste from medicines.<p>Nazneen Rahman, Founder and CEO at <a href="https://www.yewmaker.com/">YewMaker</a>, executive lead of the Sustainable Medicines Partnership, said: “I’m delighted Trace Labs has joined the SMP. Their technological expertise in delivering accessible, transparent, verifiable data in complex supply chains is highly relevant for the SMP’s goals. We are hugely excited about the potential of the collaboration to improve the sustainability and accessibility of medicines.”</p><p>Jurij Skornik, <a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a>’ General Manager, highlighted: “We are thrilled to be joining forces with other member organizations such as Pfizer, British Standards Institution (BSI), GS1, Walgreens, and AstraZeneca, to create a more sustainable and accessible healthcare system for everyone. As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, we believe that partnerships like the SMP are crucial for driving progress and finding innovative solutions. As part of this collaborative effort, we look forward to working with our partners to achieve our shared goal of reducing waste, improving access, and making medicines more sustainable.”</p><p>Trace Labs has already deployed OriginTrail-based solutions in the pharmaceutical industry that make use of verifiable knowledge assets. <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/healthcare/donated-medicines-and-vaccines/">AidTrust</a>, a product developed jointly with our partner BSI, increases transparency and trust in the distribution of medicines by bringing together BSI’s global presence and supply chain risk management expertise with the power of OriginTrail DKG. It enables visibility (product flows and utilization, inventory levels, etc.), risk alerts, and real-time decision-making at all stages of the supply chain while protecting the integrity, security, and privacy of data. Ultimately, the goal of AidTrust is to help donor organizations and NGOs demonstrate that donated medicines were handled properly and reached the intended patients, even in challenging environments.</p><p>By joining the Sustainable Medicines Partnership, Trace Labs will bring the power of OriginTrail knowledge assets to the mission of reducing waste of medicines and packaging and making medicines more accessible and sustainable. We are excited to work together on innovative and impactful solutions in the next months and&nbsp;years.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing humanity’s most important knowledge assets.

<p>by Santiago Lyon, Head of Advocacy and Education, CAI&nbsp;</p><p>We are delighted to welcome Canon, one of the world’s leading camera manufacturers, as a member of the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) joining more than 890 media and tech companies, NGOs, and academics working together to fight misinformation by furthering the implementation of open-source digital provenance technology. &nbsp;</p><p>Founded in 1937, Canon is a leading global manufacturer of both professional and consumer cameras and lenses and brings a long history of innovative and ground-breaking photojournalism projects to the CAI. Canon’s equipment is widely used by photojournalists and others to capture impactful, compelling and beautiful imagery from around the world. Their equipment has been used to capture award-winning images in recent years including Pulitzer Prizes and World Press Photo awards, among many others.&nbsp;</p><p>“Canon enthusiastically supports efforts to fight misinformation by ensuring the authenticity and provenance of digital images that are created and enjoyed by society. Joining the efforts of the CAI is an important step in this endeavor,” said Go Tokura, Chief Executive of Imaging Communication Business Operations at Canon. “We are looking forward to working with other technology companies and media partners to develop technology solutions that achieve these goals."&nbsp;</p><p>Provenance technology provides secure, tamper-evident metadata that accompanies images and other file types along their journey from capture through editing to publication, showing the viewer where an asset came from, and any changes made to it along the way. The CAI looks forward to working with Canon on prototyping and implementing provenance technology into their future products.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Canon also joins the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (<a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a>) as its latest member that will provide creators, consumers, and others with opt-in, flexible ways to understand the authenticity and provenance across media types.&nbsp;</p><p>We encourage diverse organizations and individuals to join the Content Authenticity Initiative to advance our efforts for digital provenance. You can find more information <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/membership">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>January Newsletter</p>



<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>Happy New Year. I hope this finds you well and rested from the holidays. Thank you for reading DINZ’s first newsletter of 2023 on the beach, at the office, or in the tent or caravan out of the rain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud issues tend to surface in the news much more over the holidays as increased online purchases offer greater opportunities for attackers. Matthew Evetts is the director of security at DINZ member Datacom and did a great job of explaining the issues in simple terms in<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/summer-days/audio/2018873139/beware-of-cyber-crime">&nbsp;this piece on RNZ</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with consumers and their data in mind, it is notable that the<a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/25842-further-decisions-on-the-consumer-data-right-proactiverelease-pdf">&nbsp;Government has just released a Cabinet Paper on the proposed Consumer Data Right (CDR</a>) with a framework similar to that of the DISTF.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.russellmcveagh.com/insights/january-en/consumer-data-right-update-proposed-penalties-supervisory-authorities-in-scope-sectors-and-appro">Russell Mc Veigh has summarised its insights in this helpful publication here</a>. While DINZ could debate whether the banking sector is a better starting point for CDR compared to digital identification, we expect to analyse the paper and offer commentary in due course. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For DINZ itself, each new year brings the need to balance its limited resources across a range of activities. In 2022 greater focus was placed on documented evidence based thought leadership with its submissions, the research and the landscape report that will be published in a few weeks time. In 2023, expect to see more focus on events and interactive mahi, now that&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">grounding documented mahi</a>&nbsp;has progressed. Next month we’ll begin with events to showcase the landscape report on digital identity in Aotearoa that integrates the results of the research we highlighted late last year (we are always looking for member premises to host so please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">get in touch</a>). We’ll also be kicking off a two-month Summer Series around perspectives of decentralised digital identity&nbsp;where we expect to feature members (<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">get in touch!</a>) with a decentralised service or pilot leading discussion and debate with their perspectives. Planning is already underway for April with an overseas expert visit intermingling with Privacy Awareness Week. So there’s plenty to look forward to before the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata 2023&nbsp;</a>confirmed for 1 August 2023 at Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington.&nbsp;<a href="mailto:colin.wallis@digitalidentity.nz">Get in touch</a>&nbsp;if you’re interested to sponsor or exhibit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What else is in store for us in the digital identity domain in 2023? Truckloads is the short answer. As I observed in my personal email to members before the break, in legislation alone, we expect to be looking at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/versions.aspx">DISTF</a>&nbsp;in its final run up to enforcement on 1 January next year, MoJ’s proposed amendments to the AML/CFT legislation that&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/11/Digital-Identity-New-Zealand-AML_CFT-Report_20-October-2020_FINAL.pdf">DINZ analysed&nbsp; back in 2020</a>, OPC’s proposed Code of Practice for Biometrics that&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Submission_OPC-Consultation-on-Biometrics_4-October-2022-1.pdf">DINZ responded on last year</a>, the exposure draft of NZ’s CDR legislation and further developments in Open Banking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sheer scale of the compliance undertaking for any digital identity service provider looks quite daunting when you think that most service providers will need to comply with most of the above, and also with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0031/latest/LMS23223.html">Privacy Act 2020</a>&nbsp;and conceivably the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2012/0123/latest/whole.html">EIV Act 2012</a>, even if today it applies primarily to RealMe. Aotearoa is not alone in this regard. The EU is a great example where in the fullness of time the upcoming Data Act will sit beside the Data Governance Act, the GDPR, the Free Flow of Non-Personal Data Regulation, the Open Data Directive, the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act as part of the European strategy for data, not to mention&nbsp;<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">EIDAS 2.0</a>. Will 2023 be remembered as the melting pot year for digital law? We’ll see.</p>



<p>But let’s hope that lawmakers everywhere are setting aside resources in the coming years for legislative harmonisation!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Colin and the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">DINZ Executive Council of 2023</a></p>

After one year of research and analysis, the paper is ready for your review. Can SSI harm people in the real world? Our paper says “yes” and why that’s so. In short: there are many examples of digital identity systems hurting people, and there’s no reason to imagine SSI-based systems will be exempt. We invite your feedback on this paper.

<p>Imagine someone you know has a life-changing tragedy, like…&nbsp;</p>



 
 A voter wrongfully convicted of electoral fraud&nbsp; 



 A gambler’s identity used to fuel addiction 



 An immigrant family unable to work, bank, or get basic services 



 A teen suicide 



 An indigenous people whose relationship with their forest is shattered 



 A soldier’s biometrics targeted them for execution 
 



<p>In this paper we explain how each of these real life examples were the outcome of digital identity abused, misused, or gone wrong. In each case, SSI can make things better, or worse. So, can you do anything about these risks that affect others? And why should you bother?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you do anything? Anything that matters?</p>



<p>We listed some responses to the risk of human harms:</p>



 
 Design for a balance of power. Well-executed decentralized or federated identity systems have a shot at assuring agency by empowering those at the edge of the ecosystem, and recognising the vulnerabilities of the least powerful people.&nbsp; 



 Add human harms to existing risk management. Cybersecurity teams, corporate finance, strategy, and legal teams can add negative externality risk assessments for identity ecosystems they support. Investing in detection, prevention, intervention, and recovery services enables identity ecosystem members to manage their exposure according to their respective risk appetites.&nbsp; 



 Align objectives and incentives to minimize regret. Human harms arise when ecosystem actors’ objectives conflict and when mistuned incentives drive harmful choices. 



 Measure the cost of externalities. SSI’s trustworthy provenance might improve accountability and discourage harmful behavior within an ecosystem. But harms are infectious. The collective resilience of an ecosystem, like herd immunity, reduces harm. 



 Build a community of practice on human harm reduction. New disciplines and practices will emerge, as they have for other areas of risk reduction. Start inside and join forces with your business ecosystem.&nbsp; 
 



<p>You can imagine many more. Still, …&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why should you act?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doing nothing is nearly always the easiest path. It can feel like a distraction from today’s work to be aware of negative externalities that show up downstream from your standards efforts, your product development, your engineering and operations. They are distant from you in time, in space, across regulatory jurisdictions, with many intermediaries between you and people who might be harmed. It’s hard to care about hypotheticals and abstract numbers. Should you care anyway?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us offer you five reasons you should act.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Economics. Prevention is cheaper.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Nearly always.“Shift-left” is the practice of moving security concerns closer to the start of the product development lifecycle. Again, it’s easier and more complete to build security into services from the start than try to bolt security onto an inherently insecure system. Perhaps we can shift-left when it comes to harming others, embed harms work into the identity product and governance checklists so those considerations help us steer clear of foreseeable harms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But who pays for prevention and other harm reduction and remediation work? Who should invest in testing if your trust architectures come with few negative externalities built in? Should it be those closer to the utility side of things? Should governments pick up the slack? Will ecosystem operators that serve more vulnerable humans have a better shot at understanding their risks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We should have an “accountability” conversation sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Financial and Legal Risk. Action reduces liability.&nbsp; 
 



<p>But can you avoid liability if laws and regulations are obsolete or enforcement is toothless or regulators are captured? How can we pool exposure so it’s safer to start digital identity ecosystems or to join them?&nbsp;</p>



 
 Opportunity for value and advantage.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Harm reduction practices improve your understanding of strategic context and unmet customer needs. Harm surveillance practices improve identity ecosystem situational awareness and security. Harm intervention and recovery practices improve customer service and speed crisis response.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Harms are infectious and no-one is immune. 
 



<p>Harms impact beyond the close families and friends of those directly harmed to other actors in the ecosystem and in adjacent ecosystems. The 2022 FTX cryptocurrency exchange bankruptcy amplified and spread the human harms of lost investments throughout DeFi and crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sleep better. It’s good karma.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Being real about the potential for harm makes it easier to put it in perspective, to weigh your tradeoffs, and to act in good conscience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Start small, start together…&nbsp;</p>

 Strategy will see major investments in quantum research, talent and commercialization 



<p>January 13, 2023&nbsp;– Waterloo, Ontario, Quantum science and technologies are at the leading edge of research and innovation, with enormous potential for commercialization and game-changing advances, including more effective drug design, better climate forecasting, improved navigation and innovations in clean technologies. The Government of Canada is committed to supporting the continued growth of this emerging sector as it helps drive Canada’s economy and supports highly skilled, well-paying jobs.</p>



<p>Today, the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, announced the launch of Canada’s National Quantum Strategy, which will shape the future of quantum technologies in Canada and help create thousands of jobs. Backed by an investment of $360 million committed in Budget 2021, the strategy will amplify Canada’s existing global leadership in quantum research and grow Canada’s quantum technologies, companies and talent.</p>



<p>Minister Champagne was joined at the launch by Dr. Raymond Laflamme, professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and Canada Research Chair in Quantum Information at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, and Dr. Stephanie Simmons, associate professor in the Department of Physics and Canada Research Chair in Silicon Quantum Technologies at Simon Fraser University and founder and Chief Quantum Officer of Photonic Inc. Drs. Laflamme and Simmons will serve as co-chairs of a new Quantum Advisory Council, which will provide independent expert advice on the implementation of the strategy.</p>



<p>The National Quantum Strategy is driven by three missions in key quantum technology areas:</p>



 
 Computing hardware and software—to make Canada a world leader in the continued development, deployment and use of these technologies 



 Communications—to equip Canada with a national secure quantum communications network and post-quantum cryptography capabilities 



 Sensors—to support Canadian developers and early adopters of new quantum sensing technologies 
 



<p>The missions will be advanced through investments in three pillars:</p>



 
 Research—$141 million to support basic and applied research to realize new solutions and new innovations 



 Talent—$45 million to develop and retain quantum expertise and talent in Canada, as well as attract experts from within Canada and around the world, to build the quantum sector 



 Commercialization—$169 million to translate research into scalable commercial products and services that will benefit Canadians, our industries and the world 
 



<p>Efforts under the strategy are already under way. To reinforce Canada’s research strengths in quantum science and help develop a talent pipeline to support the growth of a strong quantum community, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) is delivering an investment of $137.9 million through its Alliance grants and Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE) grants.</p>



<p>Mitacs will deliver $40 million to support the attraction, training, retention and deployment of highly qualified personnel in quantum science and technology through innovation internship experiences and professional skills development.</p>



<p>The Quantum Research and Development Initiative (QRDI), a new $9 million program coordinated and administered by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), is being established to grow collaborative, federal quantum research and development. QRDI will bring government—offering expertise and infrastructure—and academic and industrial partners together to work on advancing quantum technologies under the three missions of the National Quantum Strategy.</p>



<p>To help translate quantum science and research into commercial innovations that generate economic benefits and support the adoption of made-in-Canada solutions by businesses, the NRC is receiving $50&nbsp;million to expand the Internet of Things: Quantum Sensors Challenge program and roll out its Applied Quantum Computing Challenge program. As well, Canada’s Global Innovation Clusters are receiving $14&nbsp;million to carry out activities as part of the Commercialization pillar.</p>



<p>In addition, the government’s flagship strategic procurement program, Innovative Solutions Canada, is receiving $35 million over seven years to help innovative Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises grow, scale up, develop intellectual property, export and create high-value jobs in the quantum sector.</p>



<p>The quantum sector is key to fuelling Canada’s economy, long-term resilience and growth, especially as technologies mature and more sectors harness quantum capabilities. Jobs will span research and science; hardware and software engineering and development, including data engineering; manufacturing; technical support; sales and marketing; and business operations. The government will continue working with Canada’s quantum community to ensure the success of not only the National Quantum Strategy but also the Canadian scientists and entrepreneurs who are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>



 Quotes 



<blockquote>
<p>“Quantum technologies will shape the course of the future and Canada is at the forefront, leading the way. The National Quantum Strategy will support a resilient economy by strengthening our research, businesses and talent, giving Canada a competitive advantage for decades to come. I look forward to collaborating with businesses, researchers and academia as we build our quantum future.”<br>– The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</p>
</blockquote>



 Quick facts 



 
 According to a study commissioned by the NRC in 2020, it is estimated that, by 2045, the Canadian quantum industry, once quantum technologies take hold, will be a $139 billion industry (including all economic effects) and account for 209,200 jobs. 



 The Government of Canada has invested more than $1 billion in quantum since 2012. These foundational investments helped establish Canada as a global leader in quantum science. 



 The National Quantum Strategy was developed following thorough public consultations through stakeholder roundtables and an online survey. 



 A number of investments have already been announced through&nbsp;<a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/national-quantum-strategy/en/canadas-national-quantum-strategy#s10">existing government programs</a>, and additional partners are preparing their quantum programs for launch. 



 Innovative Solutions Canada has awarded four contracts valued at a total of $2.1 million to test quantum sensing, communications and computing solutions developed by Xanadu Quantum Technologies Inc., CogniFrame Inc., Photon etc. Inc. and Zero Point Cryogenics Inc. 



 To date, NSERC has awarded 17 grants valued at $1.5 million over three years and expects to announce further results of its quantum initiatives in the coming months, including the Alliance International Quantum grants, Alliance Quantum grants, Alliance Consortia Quantum grants and CREATE grants. 



 The NRC has launched Challenge programs to support collaborations with academia and industry &nbsp;that help drive commercial innovation and build on Canada’s position as a global leader in quantum technologies.
 
 The Internet of Things: Quantum Sensors Challenge program is focused on developing revolutionary sensors that use the extreme sensitivity of quantum systems to enhance measurement precision and sensitivity rates and even expand the kinds of phenomena that can be measured. 



 The Applied Quantum Computing Challenge program is working to build capacity in quantum algorithms and software, as well as establish collaborative research and development projects with academia and industry to efficiently simulate complex physical systems, delivering new technologies for human health, climate change and advanced materials. 
 
 



 The governments of Canada and the United Kingdom have jointly launched a call for proposals open to organizations from Canada and the UK that wish to form project consortia for collaborative projects focused on developing innovative products, processes or technology-based services in the area of quantum technologies. The call is delivered by the NRC’s Industrial Research Assistance Program and Innovate UK.

<p>After years of work, the tech industry finally took major steps in 2022 toward a long-promised passwordless future. The move is riding on the back of a technology called “passkeys” that are built on FIDO standards. Operating systems from Apple, Google, and Microsoft now support the technology, and many other platforms, browsers, and services have adopted it or are in the process of doing so. As much as you might wish it, though, passwords aren’t going to disappear anytime soon, thanks to their sheer ubiquity. And amid all the buzz about passkeys, hardware tokens are still an important protection option.</p>

 European Union supports sustainability of construction industry with the BUILDCHAIN project: Bringing trustworthy knowledge exchange using the Decentralized Knowledge Graph <p>Trace Labs, a Web3 development company, joins EU’s efforts to create a smarter and more sustainable built environment with the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101092052">BUILDCHAIN project</a>. Together with eleven other partners from Slovenia, Italy, Spain, Greece, Hungary, and Serbia, Trace Labs will use the <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)</a> to build a trusted knowledge base aiming to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and increase transparency and trust, ultimately leading to more sustainable construction projects.</p> Construction industry lacks trustworthy data&nbsp;exchange <p>Efficient, transparent, and trusted data exchange is a powerful tool for driving sustainability, resilience, and energy efficiency in construction, however there are several obstacles for trusted data exchange in this industry&nbsp;today:</p>  Data silos: Construction projects involve multiple parties and stakeholders, each of which may have their own systems for storing and sharing information. This can lead to data silos and lack of coordination, which can make it difficult to access and trust the&nbsp;data.  Lack of standardization: Different construction projects may use different formats for storing and sharing data, which can make it difficult to compare and combine information from different projects.  Data security: Construction projects often involve sensitive information, such as building plans, materials lists, and inspection results. Ensuring that this information is kept secure and protected from unauthorized access can be a significant challenge.  Lack of incentives: There are often few incentives for construction companies and other stakeholders to share data and collaborate on projects, which can make it difficult to establish trust and transparency.   BUILDCHAIN to create a complete overview of the building life-cycle <p>Having received financial support from the European Union, BUILDCHAIN aims to develop technological solutions that will enhance data exchange and transparency in the industry and overcome the above-mentioned obstacles. Over the three-year period, the key innovative players in construction engineering, architecture, and research will build a knowledge base that will be used by various actors to trace all activities related to the complete life-cycle of buildings.</p><p>Trace Labs’ main contribution will be the integration of OriginTrail <a href="https://origintrail.io/technology">Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)</a> with the existing EU Digital Building LogBook system, creating a new powerful knowledge base with blockchain and artificial intelligence capabilities. The DKG will provide a tamper-proof and decentralized database that can be accessed by all parties involved in a building’s life cycle, including architects, contractors, building owners and regulators. This helps increase transparency, trust, and collaboration among all stakeholders through:</p>  Connected knowledge assets as digital twins: DKG will provide an open, single source of truth for all building-related data, including plans, materials, inspection results, and more. This will make it easy for all parties to discover, access, and update the information in real time, improving communication and collaboration.  Data verification: Using blockchain technology, all data added to the DKG is fingerprinted and cannot be tampered with, ensuring authenticity of the data of the building’s life&nbsp;cycle.  Predictive maintenance: AI and machine learning can be used to analyze data from the DKG to identify patterns and predict future outcomes, such as maintenance needs. This can help improve building maintenance and reduce downtime.  Compliance and regulations: DKG can be used to ensure compliance with building codes and regulations by storing all relevant information in a standardized way and making it accessible to regulators in real&nbsp;time.   Driving value and technological advancement for construction industry <p>The advancements and benefits of building information modeling, automation, and digitalization encourage the development of more effective and efficient building information management. Given the fact that the <a href="https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/building-information-modeling-market.html">global Building Information Modeling market is worth $14,7 billion and is predicted to grow to $53 billion by 2031</a>, the BUILDCHAIN project enables the possibility of great value creation and a strong impact on sustainability of the entire&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Project information available here: <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101092052">BUILDCHAIN Project | Fact&nbsp;Sheet</a></p>This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe Framework Programme, Climate Neutral, Circular and Digitiesed Production 2022, under grant agreement No 101092052.<p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing humanity’s most important knowledge assets.

 Is 2023 the year of Communities of Practice at&nbsp;work? <p>Communities of Practice (CoPs) are groups of people who share a concern or passion for things that they do. For example, they may be teachers, or parents, or paediatricians interested in helping young people. As they interact with one another on a regular basis, they learn to better do the things in which they are interested, which leads to improved outcomes for&nbsp;all.</p><p>CoPs can be seen as somewhat ‘messy’ from the outside, but they nevertheless integrate rituals and recognition as part of their practice. This post argues that now is the time to shift to a more holistic understanding of recognition in the workplace, one that is established by intentionally building CoPs across a landscape of practice in each&nbsp;sector.</p><a href="https://app.participate.com/assignments/cop-curious/140ca80f-4030-4558-af7a-9757ecca3ed5#chapter-1">a badge from our Community of Practice course on Participate.com</a> Credentials aren’t everything <p>Workplace recognition happens in various ways. For example, recognition in some guise is often a prerequisite for employment. This often takes the form of a list of credentials and experience that a worker is expected to be able to prove. This is for good reason, as employers have to ensure that a worker can perform the functions required of&nbsp;them.</p><p>However, we live in a world where not everyone has the same access to the types of credentials or experience that workplaces may require (or think they require!). For example, too many white collar employment opportunities require, at a minimum, ‘a degree’ of any kind, using this as a proxy for a bundle of knowledge, skills, and behaviours.</p><p>In addition, some of the reasons for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation">the Great Resignation</a> include lack of career advancement, work-related stress, and the desire for a better work-life balance. Workplaces that recognise employees and contractors in meaningful ways are likely to better retain staff and have a happier, more productive workforce.</p><p>Greater workplace recognition practices can also increase resilience: interpersonal relationships at work allow for greater and more fluid knowledge transfer, which leads to greater innovation and the ability to route around problems which may&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>What would recognition in the workplace look like if we started to think of our working world as made up of Communities of Practice?</p> Recognising diversity <p>Let’s start at the beginning of the worker journey. The talent pool for a particular job is often limited by the lack of inclusive recognition. Potential workers don’t always have the opportunity to improve their standing due to socio-economic factors, geographic exclusion, and discriminatory practices. Our existing credentialing systems can unwittingly exacerbate this.</p><p>While employers are good at <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/last-mile-credentials-employment-1103">recognising formal credentials</a>, they often don’t attempt to understand the wider picture of recognition.</p><p>We’re seeing innovative systems, like <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a> and badge pathways, begin to push at the inequity of the current system of employment. These approaches make skills more visible. Instead of hiring someone who simply has ‘a degree’, companies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/why-ibm-wants-to-hire-employees-who-dont-have-a-4-year-college-degree.html">such as IBM</a> are beginning to be more specific about the kinds of knowledge, skills, and behaviours they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>These attempts, while valuable, are in the realm of ‘microcredentialing’ — breaking down ‘chunky’ credentials into smaller, more granular parts. Open Recognition goes beyond credentialing to consider relational factors and the wider, more holistic story. After all, people need us to help tell their story, and we need them to help us tell ours. Every credential involves recognition, but recognition does not have to be in the form of a ‘credential’.</p> Connecting networks <p>No-one works in isolation. We all have current and former colleagues who have seen us in action and who can attest to our abilities. A ‘closed’ (i.e. non-portable) example of this kind of recognition is the LinkedIn recommendation, which can lead to surprising insights for the recipient into the knowledge, skills, and behaviours that are valued by those with whom they&nbsp;work.</p><p>Not only can a recommendation or testimonial serve as a form of ‘credential’ but in addition to this, it also establishes a relationship between the recommender and the person being recommended. This is powerful when instantiated in a badge, which provides the additional benefits of being tamper-proof and portable between online&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Demonstrating the connections between our story and someone else’s helps show underlying networks and relationships. It can make visible the Communities of Practice that may be invisible to corporate hierarchies. Social graphs allow us to see, over time, how communities develop and how expertise is established.</p><p>Conceptualising workplaces as sites for Communities of Practice to flourish leads to meaningful recognition between colleagues. Instead of performative Slack messages which may serve as extrinsic motivators for a limited period of time, true Open Workplace Recognition can help peers encourage one another towards ever-more learning and growing. HR departments can help colleagues co-create interest-based career pathways that make sense across&nbsp;sectors.</p> Open Recognition needs to be pervasive <p>In order to put the power of a story clearly in the hands of the person who owns that story, we have to allow that person to tell it. We need ways to ensure that recognition belongs to individuals and can be used regardless of the type of workplace in which they currently find themselves. Just because you have a good, bad, or indifferent boss should not determine the wider recognition you receive when performing well.</p><p>Giving people the ability to describe their career path and employment history in a non-linear, non-time bound way will help employers too. Allowing a person to say what they look for in a workplace, what they believe they are good at, and how they are looking to grow helps reduce turnover and to get people in the correct roles more&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>Individuals can help potential employers or collaborators understand how&nbsp;they:</p>  keep showing up and learn new&nbsp;things  exhibit pro-social behaviours  support their community  <p>These things will help hiring managers get to know someone more holistically than a single, potentially irrelevant credential ever could. Turning workplaces into communities of practice changes the way an organisation functions. It requires recognition systems where everyone can be “seen” and can “see” others — and makes all learning and knowledge creation&nbsp;visible.</p> Conclusion <p>Communities of Practice provide ways for forward-thinking organisations to engage staff in a virtuous circle of improvement, to ensure positive recognition practices, and to bundle up experiences in credentials that can be used to help both the individual and organisation.</p><p>To establish a CoP within organisations involves both a top-down and bottom-up approach. From the top, it requires time, funding, and recognition, and from below it requires will, engagement, and encouragement.</p><p>We firmly believe that both CoPs and Landscapes of Practice have become one of the most important tools for organisations looking to make a sustained impact in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>2023 is going to be a big year for communities, and we’re here for it.

<p>Schellman Joins the Voilà Verified Trustmark Program<br>Voilà Verified Program Builds Real Trust in Digital Solutions by Spotlighting World-Class Vetted Digital Identity Solutions.</p>



<p>TAMPA, FL, January 11, 2023 – The <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> (DIACC) is pleased to officially welcome <a href="https://www.schellman.com/">Schellman</a> to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/voila-verified/">Voilà Verified Trustmark Program</a> – the first and only certification program to determine digital identity service compliance with the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-overview/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>™ (PCTF).</p>



<p>A non-profit coalition of over 115 public and private members, the DIACC develops research and opportunities to enable Canada’s confident, safe, and full participation in a global digital economy.</p>



<p>“One size does not fit all when it comes to identity solutions – but ensuring a solution delivers upon a defined duty of care is critical,” says Joni Brennan, president of the DIACC. “With the PCTF, and now with Voilà Verified, there is an opportunity to adopt a framework rooted in trust – and to earn compliance recognition. Voilà Verified identifies those who are ‘walking the walk’ and delivering safe and secure access to the global digital economy.”</p>



<p>“Schellman’s participation in DIACC’s Voilà Verified Program demonstrates our excitement and commitment to the Crypto and Digital Trust space. This new step will widen our global footprint as we expand all our assessment services in Canada,” says Avani Desai, Chief Executive Officer of Schellman.</p>



<p>The DIACC’s PCTF is a publicly available framework for identity solutions that defines client, customer, and individual duty of care. The Voilà Verified program provides a vetting and assessment opportunity where PCTF-compliant solution vendors can earn a public-facing trustmark. The result? Spotlight visibility of trustworthy, safe, reliable, and efficient solutions.</p>



<p>“Schellman is excited to participate in this landmark accreditation program. We look forward to serving the DIACC community with distinction as we enable Canada’s world-leading efforts towards true digital trust,” said Scott Perry, Principal at Schellman and leader of the firm’s Crypto and Digital Trust Services.</p>



<p>Voilà Verified presents an opportunity to grow provincial-level investments in digital identity solutions. Provincial governments which have launched identity services can now earn a trustmark of their own, and provinces that are on the cusp of entering the digital solution market can do so with confidence by seeking vendors with a Voilà Verified trustmark.</p>



<p>Ruth Puente, Voilà Verified’s Trustmark Verification Program Manager, says a leading component of the program’s development was to ensure its procedures aligned with the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Organization of Standardization</a> (ISO).</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is inclusive yet diligent in verifying PCTF-compliant solutions. The program was developed in alignment with ISO <a href="https://www.iso.org/benefits-of-standards.html">standards</a> – and empowers informed decision-making in a rapidly growing ecosystem of identity solutions,” said Puente. “Delivering high-quality service, customer protection, and Increasing access to trustworthy solutions are our priorities. We have formed teams of international experts to perform assessments and to oversee the process through an impartial lens.”</p>



<p>Entities responsible for assessing PCTF compliance within the Voilà Verified program are Accredited Assessors, Readiness Advisors, and Testing Laboratories.</p>



<p>The Voilà Verified Trustmark Oversight Board (TOB) will make all final verification decisions based on reports from accredited entities. Made up of third-party volunteers with international expertise in identity management, auditing, compliance, cybersecurity, information security, and law, the TOB is the highest operating body of Voilà Verified. It is subject to impartiality, confidentiality and conflict of interest policies.</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is a unique opportunity in which I am honoured to share my experience as an advisor and auditor within information security, compliance, and identity,” says Björn Sjöholm, Cybersecurity Entrepreneur of Seadot, and TOB Chair.</p>



<p>Vendors are turning to the Voilà Verified program for several reasons, but the leading value proposition is market differentiation. Trustmark holders stand out from competitors by unlocking global business opportunities through international recognition and credibility.</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified puts internationally reputable identity solutions on the map,” says Dave Nikolejsin, the DIACC’s Board Chair. “This is the way forward. With lateral growth of PCTF compliance across sectors – public and private – we establish a common value of trust. Voilà Verified is a monumental stride for Canada to influence a safe and secure global digital economy.”</p>

<p>In early December, we held a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/join-our-community-call-thinking-about-tech-through-the-lens-of-digital-resilience/" title="">community call</a> to discuss the digital resilience challenges we (and our partners) are working through. We were joined by organisers and activists from different countries and talked about what digital resilience meant for our movements in 2022. Here are some takeaways from our conversations:</p>



 Adapting workflows for uncertain times 



<p>During the call, participants shared that when the Covid-19 pandemic started, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/" title="">many organisations were forced to rapidly recalibrate their work and services</a> in online spaces. A few years into the pandemic, attendees shared that adapting to new tech-related needs and infrastructure has been an on-going effort that they’ve taken on. Organisations and activists have been continuously working to adapt their workflows and methodologies to handle the tech and data concerns that emerged since the pandemic, such as digital security threats, restrictions on the ability to organise and increased surveillance.</p>



 Digital resilience needs to include environmental and climate activists&nbsp; 



<p>We also talked about how conversations about digital resilience must include activists and grassroots organisations working on environmental and climate justice (and we’ve also seen this mentioned in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-can-the-digital-rights-community-do-to-support-climate-justice-work-learnings-from-our-community-call/" title="">other conversations too</a>). One participant shared that, in their country, support for civil society’s digital security is often more readily available in metropolitan areas. This means that some local groups who work on environmental justice outside of the cities and who increasingly rely on digital technologies to communicate and collect data for advocacy purposes are exposed to threats such as surveillance from state parties and other actors.</p>



<p>Our recent <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">research on the intersections of environmental and climate justice</a> confirms this: we saw that while the persecution of those resisting land acquisition and forest encroachment by extractive industries has been going on for a long time, digital tools’ ability to follow, surveil and collect information without individuals’ knowledge has expanded governments’ and companies’ abilities to intimidate, harass and in some cases even to physically harm, dissenters.</p>



 A lot of the times, digital resilience is a balancing-act 



<p>Participants who advocate for digital security practices in their own organisations shared that when they start the process of implementing new tools they sometimes are met with: fatigue with learning new tools and reticence when it comes to using tools that are unfamiliar and sometimes, not-so-widely-known in their communities.</p>



 During the call, those attending shared their strategies for facilitating the process of becoming digitally resilient:&nbsp; 



 
 Combining the use of secure tools that are recommended by organisational security practitioners with learning how to use the more familiar tools more safely: One person shared that, in 2023, they are focusing on developing best practices for working with tools that staff are familiar with.Another shared that it’s important to map what types of information shouldn’t be shared on certain platforms and adopt data minimisation as best practices. 
 



 
 Pacing out how the adoption of new tools and starting small: Another participant shared that working with asmall group and onboarding slowly are good ways of keeping people engaged in the process and to prevent staff from being overwhelmed. It’s also important to have conversations about how organisational security does come with tradeoffs: for example, sometimes choosing a more secure tool means that we might not have all the same affordances of privately owned tools. Here at The Engine Room, we’ve been documenting <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/" title="">our journey on adopting new video-conferencing tools</a> and it hasn’t been without a couple of obstacles here and there.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Look for support from peers and partners: As we adapt to new digital infrastructure, it can be so helpful to have contact with someone who knows the tools and who can provide support. Participants found that this can help build staff’s confidence and help with questions that will inevitably arise. You can also <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">reach out to us</a> for support in this process. 
 



 The work ahead: what’s next on our digital resilience journey 



<p>In the past year, we’ve been internally reflecting on digital resilience as an organisation and with our partners. In 2023, we plan on sharing more resources on how civil society can build digital resilience, including on topics such as digital security, adopting different tech tools, organising safely and adapting to context shifts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, we’re curious to know what digital resilience has looked like for you and your organisations! <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/contact/" title="">Reach out</a> to tell us or to share questions, research or projects you’d like us to know about.</p>

<p>Passwords: they can be tricky at the best of times. Proper password hygiene is one of the most important factors in endpoint security, as it keeps sensitive data secure and prevents threat actors from getting into important systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But despite the risks, the use of weak or recycled passwords continues to be a problem even amongst IT professionals. While systems such as two factor authentication have been used as an extra layer of security, groups like the FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium have been working to make passwords a thing of the past, in favour of more secure methods.</p>



<p>This week, we spoke to Richard Meeus, EMEA director of security &amp; technology strategy for Akamai Technologies, to explore the solutions driving secure sign ons, and how the sector can adapt to this change.</p>
