 Google Cloud has struck a deal with <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/solana-price-prediction/">Solana blockchain</a> and as a result, it will add support for the Solana blockchain in BigQuery, a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse. 



 The October 27-announced Blockchain Node Engine by Google Cloud will feature on the Solana chain starting in 2023, allow users to start a Solana node and easily access Solana data. 



 The Solana team also announced the launch of its upcoming Solana mobile, which would be available for preorder in early 2023 but an official date has yet to be confirmed. 
 



 



<p>Google Cloud has recently partnered with <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/solana-price-prediction/">Solana</a> to add support for the Solana blockchain in BigQuery, a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse, leading to easier access to Solana data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the October 27-announced Blockchain Node Engine by Google Cloud will feature on the Solana chain starting in 2023. Users will be able to start a dedicated Solana node in the Cloud thanks to the integration.</p>



<p>During the Solana Breakpoint, a four-day conference scheduled from November 4 to November 7, the Web3 lead at Google Cloud Nalin Mittal announced that the Solana support will go live in the first quarter of 2023.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the recent support comes nine years after Google Cloud first added <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin</a> to the service. Mittal revealed that Google Cloud is learning more about the Solana blockchain by already running a Solana validator. It is figuring out how to operate the same in a cost-effective manner,” he added.</p>



<p>The knowledge gained from this experience will help Google Cloud as it gets ready to integrate the network to Blockchain Node Engine, its service for providing managed blockchain nodes. With its introduction, Google Cloud “really deepened its investment in this space,” according to Mittal, who identified this as the company’s first web3 offering.</p>



<p>Apart from the grand partnership with Google Cloud, Solana made a series of launch announcements during its annual gathering. The CEO and founder of Solana Spaces, Vibhu Norby, delivered an interactive presentation to unveil the Solana Store in Miami. The CEO stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Now anyone, anywhere can build their own Solana Store.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, the team announced the launch of its upcoming Solana mobile, which would be available for preorder in early 2023. However, Solana has not yet announced any official date regarding the same.</p>



<p>Solana went on to announce the opening of the Solana App Store in preparation for the Web3 disruption. During the session, a&nbsp; Solana representative underlined the need for a positive user experience in Web3.</p>



<p>Solana’s DApp store supports the cause by promising to eliminate fees, revenues, and charges. Additionally, the company informed the interested parties that submissions will begin in January 2023.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the Solana phone, which will be powered by a Qualcomm chipset, is unique for its ability to securely store the private keys of cryptocurrency wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Solana Breakpoint is the ecosystem’s highly anticipated annual event, which this year attracted 13,000 people in just one of the four locations where it was held simultaneously.</p>

 Friktion has debuted a new crypto lending product for institutional clients who aim to get higher yields in the space via exposure to cryptocurrencies.  



 The offering will include tranched pools ranging from junior tranches to senior tranches with the former providing higher annualized yields ranging between 11% and 17% in return for covering senior lenders against loan defaults. 



 Friktion stated that third-party underwriters called “conductors” will be responsible for conducting due diligence on borrowers before launching loan pools. 
 



 



<p>Solana-based portfolio management platform Friktion has debuted a new crypto lending product for institutional clients who aim to get higher yields in the space via exposure to cryptocurrencies. This new product comes at a time when the market has seen a significant downside following a decline in cryptocurrency trading volumes. Additionally, the product is tied to institutions, which could mean that there is an increased demand for crypto lending among institutions. </p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/183510/friktion-offers-under-collateralized-crypto-lending-for-institutional-clients">report</a>, Friktion will provide higher yields to the institutions who take part in this new product and also, the firm revealed that its crypto lending product will provide access to under-collateralized loans for borrowers. This means that for any borrower who aims to borrow money from the platform, they will not have to put up any collateral which will be higher or equal to the amount of the loan. Additionally, it could be a capital-efficient form of borrowing.</p>



<p>The firm also confirmed that its crypto lending product will offer enhanced lender protection as it will include tranched pools ranging from junior tranches to senior tranches with the former providing higher annualized yields ranging between 11% and 17% in return for covering senior lenders against loan defaults. In an attempt to reduce counterparty risks, Friktion will also include a diverse cast of borrowers.</p>



<p>The lenders which take part in the senior pools mentioned above can earn yields in the range 8% and 10%. Moreover, Friktion also revealed that third-party underwriters called “conductors” will be responsible for conducting due diligence on borrowers before launching loan pools. This is also a part of investor protection that the platform offers. Background checks are very important because under-collaterized loans can pose serious risks to lenders especially in cases wherein the borrower fails to repay. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Throughout the tenure of the loan pool, conductors will also perform real-time risk monitoring of borrowers’ positions both on exchanges and on-chain,” Friktion said while adding, “In an unlikely event of default, the junior pool serves as first loss capital and provides default protection to the senior pool.” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is crucial to note that DeFi lending is most of the times overcollaterized. For exampe, Aave and Compound require borrowers to put up collateral in excess of the loan amount. Friktion, however, has debuted under-collaterized crypto lending which makes it one of the first firms to do so. This offering has been introduced despite the recent failures of multiple crypto lenders like <a href="https://bitnation.co/celsius-has-been-billed-3-million-in-legal-fees-filing/">Celsius Network</a>, and others. </p>

 Opera has confirmed the debut of a new NFT analytics, tracking, and exploration tool called DegenKnows, which has the capability of helping “users seamlessly discover, track, and verify digital collectibles.” 



 the new tool is aimed at NFT aficionados, newcomers, and traders and is capable of analyzing both on-and-off-chain insights, helping investors to time their investments. 



 Users can gain access to data such as insights into the project’s team info including number of social media followers, active member number, and total mentions over 24 hours. 
 



 



<p>According to an <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/opera-premieres-deep-nft-analytics-tool-degenknows-releases-near-elrond-and-fantom-support-in-the-opera-crypto-browser-301667467.html">announcement</a> earlier this week, the firm behind the world’s first dedicated Web3 browser, Opera, has confirmed the debut of a new NFT analytics, tracking, and exploration tool called DegenKnows, which has the capability of helping “users seamlessly discover, track, and verify digital collectibles.” This comes at a time when the popularity of non-fungible tokens has declined by a huge margin, and the prices have also collapsed. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our aim with the Opera&nbsp;Crypto&nbsp;Browser is to provide a portal into Web3 at its fullest. From browsing dApps to using their funds, our users can explore Web3 from the safe environment of a user-friendly browser by a trusted brand,” said&nbsp;Susie Batt,&nbsp;Crypto&nbsp;Ecosystem Lead at Opera.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is one of the first tools that aims to push for Web3 adoption and also, introduces “next-generation tools dedicated to users interested in exploring the decentralized space.” Additionally, the new tool is aimed at NFT aficionados, newcomers, and traders and is capable of analyzing both on-and-off-chain insights, helping investors to time their investments and save themselves with potential losses.</p>



<p>According to the Opera announcement, DegenKnows&nbsp;will allow NFT enthusiasts get a glimpse of some of the most popular NFT projects along with charts that will depict the popularity of a project. Furthermore, the tool will also help NFT enthusiasts with figuring out scams by combining on-chain and off-chain data which includes data from social media sources, as well as an analysis of the team behind the NFT project.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today, with DegenKnows, we are giving them an innovative tool to explore and understand the world of NFTs and perhaps spot the next big project ahead of others,” Batt said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Users can gain access to data such as insights into the project’s team info including number of social media followers, active member number, and total mentions over 24 hours. Furthermore, Opera’s new tool will also serve as “a curated content feed for each project that allows users to catch the most important posts without time-consuming research.”</p>



<p>As a result, using the Web3 browser’s NFT tool, traders will also get to know if a project’s community is real or consists of bots. Interestingly, once the DegenKnows project figures out the scams and research on a given project has been done, users can utilize DegenKnows to set reminders for raffles and mints.</p>

 Umar Farooq, chief executive officer of JPMorgan’s blockchain unit Onyx, stated that banks have to take precautions and implement steps to ensure consumer protection.

 Farooq also noted that many aspects of the blockchain technology have the capacity to better the current financial infrastructure and make financial services more efficient, accessible and affordable. 
 



 



<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., one of the biggest multinational investment banks and financial services companies, has made another venture into the blockchain industry after it partnered with DBS Bank and SBI Digital Asset Holdings to <a href="https://bitnation.co/dbs-bank-has-tested-blockchain-tech-for-forex-transactions/">conduct transactions</a> in tokenized foreign exchange and government bonds under Project Guardian, as reported earlier by Bitnation. </p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/04/jpmorgan-consumer-protection-should-be-key-in-digital-asset-projects.html">CNBC</a>, Umar Farooq, chief executive officer of JPMorgan’s blockchain unit Onyx, stated that before implementing any experiment in the field of DeFi and blockchain, banks have to take precautions and implement steps to ensure consumer protection. However, he also noted that many aspects of the blockchain technology have the capacity to better the current financial infrastructure and also make financial services more efficient, accessible and affordable. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“What a bank needs to do from a regulatory point of view and customer’s point of view is that we need to protect our customers. We cannot lose their money,” Farooq said during a panel at the Singapore Fintech Festival 2022 on Wedneday.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Farooq believes that without implementing the consumer protection steps, the companies involved in blockchain experiment might expose customers to cybersecurity risks. This statement comes at a time when several crypto firms have been hacked, exploited, and drained last month, making it the worst month for the crypto industry in terms of security in 2022. </p>



<p>According blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, almost $3 billion have been drained in 2022 due to crypto hacks and more could be on the way. Some of the biggest crypto firms hacked include Mango Markets, BNB Chain’s BSC Token Hub, and many others. Moreover, within the first week of November, Panama-based crypto futures and options exchange <a href="https://bitnation.co/crypto-exchange-deribit-suffers-28-million-hack/">Deribit lost $28 million in a hot wallet hack</a> this month.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I do think you need some sort of identity solution or know-your-customer solution which verifies who the human being that is interacting is and what they are allowed to do. Because without that, in the longer term, it just doesn’t work,” he added in an interview with CNBC.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Farooq also confirmed that JPMorgan is currently using a solution called verifiable credentials which reside in the users’ crypto wallets and when any customer will use the new service to trade, their transactions will be secured via these credentials. Interestingly, Farooq also pointed out that the privacy feature of blockchains won’t hold for a long time as “sooner or later they will be in a money laundering incident.”</p>



<p>The CEO of JPMorgan’s blockchain arm believes that “education, protection and identity need to be in place” in order to safely send payments across borders without bringing the attention of the regulatory hammer. </p>

<p>This blog post is written to explain decentralized self sovereign data, snippets of it shared at the <a href="https://www.ifc.org">IFC</a> hosted session on “distributed data ecosystems: heterodox approaches to data portability” at the Singapore FinTech Festival on the 4 Nov&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Let me start with a basic understanding of the economic property of data. It is a “non rivalrous” good. That means one party using it doesn’t deny another party from using it as well. So every institution with data of data subjects can potentially have their data be used by both themselves and the data subject concurrently, if they&nbsp;wish.</p><p>Let’s assume, if you will, that a technology in the form of a <a href="https://www.hubofallthings.com">cloud data server</a>, at a few cents a month, can now be provisioned for a person or a micro SME to be a decentralized legal entity on the Internet, hold any content or data they have rights to with their own set of APIs. This was what was created from more than $10m research funding across 8 universities in the&nbsp;U.K.</p><p>What it means is that data that currently sit in any organisation on their servers can now also be made self sovereign and sit with data subjects or microSMEs on their own servers. Same data, same entitlements to use the&nbsp;data.</p><p>I will repeat for emphasis. It is now technically and legally possible for 2 identical copies of the same data, one centralized and one decentralized, sitting on 2 different servers with 2 sets of APIs for that data, with the same entitlements and licensing rights to share and transfer the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Which would create better functioning markets? For us, the answer is&nbsp;both.</p><p>The centralized organization server has source data that is heavily regulated, terribly siloed, badly portable and facing one of the largest market failures in the digital economy can now have the same data in a decentralized form in their own customer servers, and can now use the self sovereign data across territories and yet be fully verified by the source&nbsp;server.</p><p>Now you’re probably wondering which organization would allow that. The answer may surprise&nbsp;you.</p><p>The same institutions that may not be so willing to share data through open APIs with third parties are now more willing to decentralize data to data subjects because they obtain better engagement and create loyalty. In addition, they are paid for every transaction of the data, thereby creating a market for the data that they can verify (we call this a data asset) and have painfully invested into over&nbsp;years.</p><p>The distribution speed and scalability of the market from such self sovereign data assets is also relevant. It takes 30 days to set up a data wallet in an app, 1 day to set up a new data asset from the source and 3 minutes for a new demand side merchant/partner to sign up to a data terminal to receive verified data. No legal or tech integration is necessary with the source. Across borders. The organisation provide the source of truth, the data subjects transport it, the merchant pays. With that speed and scalability that self sovereign data wallets bring, the revenue multiplier for the source organisation is significant. This creates an incentive for data sources to create and scale their own data ecosystem which I’ve blogged about in an <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/designing-markets-and-scaling-data-ecosystems-1d799e870250">earlier&nbsp;post</a>.</p><p>In a web3 environment, decentralized self sovereign data can move meaningfully between services, carried by data subjects themselves to any service provider. Indeed, the data servers themselves can be hosted by country level custodians. The data is always up to date because there is incentive compatibility and there can be efficient bargaining on the price of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Much like money devolved to bank accounts created markets with payment systems, we expect self sovereign data to create large markets, achieving data at the speed of money as any consumer app can have a data wallet to decentralize data and build their ecosystems across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>This infrastructure is currently scaling up in Malaysia and entering Vietnam, US and Germany in the first quarter of 2023. The stewardship and governance of data flow contracts is under the oversight of a <a href="https://www.hatcommunity.org">foundation</a> set up by the original universities and we welcome public and private sector involvement.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/decentralized-self-sovereign-data-c8dd796d8c12">What is Decentralized Self Sovereign Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things">Hub of All Things</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Information about the candidate OASIS Standard 



<p>This document is the definitive reference for the language elements of CSAF version 2.0. The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) is a language to exchange Security Advisories formulated in JSON.</p>



<p>The term Security Advisory describes any notification of security issues in products to or from product vendors, Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs), product resellers and distributors, and others. The focus of the term is on the security aspect impacting specific product-platform-version combinations.</p>

 Elon Musk’s time as Twitter’s head has not gone as well as many would have expected. 



 The Twitter boss has introduced changes to both the company and its service. 



 Civil rights lawyers believe Musk’s decision to fire some staff on short notice violates federal and state laws. 
 



<p>Elon Musk’s first week as the new Twitter boss has been a nightmare for some of the company’s employees, as the billionaire is said to have imposed strict work rules and demanded more from the staff. However, aside from some controversial business-related decisions, Musk’s biggest criticism stems from his <a href="https://bitnation.co/elon-musk-explains-motive-behind-twitter-purchase/">decision</a> to fire about 50% of Twitter’s employees.</p>



<p>Musk reportedly began a mass layoff on November 4, trimming Twitter’s staff to 7,500. Sources claim that Twitter employees received a mail on Thursday informing them that by 9 a.m. Pacific time Friday, they’ll be notified of their status in the firm. Those who have been fired will be informed via their personal mail, while those who have been retained will be alerted through their work mail.</p>



<p>The message was allegedly the first official communication between Musk’s team and the staff. A part of the mail read,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions to Twitter, but this action is unfortunately necessary to ensure the company’s success moving forward. We acknowledge this is an incredibly challenging experience to go through, whether or not you are impacted. We are grateful for your contributions to Twitter and for your patience as we move through this process.”</p>
</blockquote>



 Twitter Sued for Violating Federal Laws 



<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-04/twitter-sued-for-mass-layoffs-by-musk-without-enough-notice">report</a>, some Twitter employees responded to Musk’s decision with a lawsuit. Aggrieved employees were said to have filed a class-action lawsuit against the new boss in San Francisco federal court. The suit accused Twitter of not giving its employees sufficient notice before termination, thereby violating federal and state laws.</p>



<p>The case alluded to the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which forbids large&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;from implementing mass layoffs without at least 60 days’ notice. As a result, the suit has gained the support and interest of some civil rights lawyers, including Lisa Bloom, who claimed Musk’s decision ignored the law.</p>



<p>The class action suit was filed by Shannon Liss-Riordan, who has had a previous legal faceoff against the new Twitter boss. In June this year, Shannon filed a suit against Tesla after the company decided to let go of 10% of its workforce. The case, however, ended in favor of Tesla, and Shannon believes Musk is repeating the same strategy with Twitter.</p>



<p>Twitter is not the only company to have announced a mass layoff of its staff. Others, like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, have carried out similar practices. </p>

 The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020 for selling unregistered securities. 



 Ripple has received support from about 12 investors, exchanges, and organizations. 



 Crypto users believe this dispute will decide future crypto regulations and the SEC’s involvement in the industry. 
 



 



<p>Ripple’s legal dispute with the SEC seems to be swinging in its favor as more groups have shown support for the blockchain platform. In a recent tweet he posted, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse happily <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1588300462096551936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1588300462096551936%7Ctwgr%5E3803fcf9be4612e6678036fdab8299bbc5c9b06d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fmoonvember-kicks-off-with-sweeping-staff-layoffs-across-crypto">noted</a> that about 12 developers, companies, investors, and exchanges have officially offered support to the payment company.</p>



<p>Several of these individuals and groups have filed amicus briefs, which are legal documents filed in an appeal case to provide a court with extra relevant details. Brad claimed that the briefs, in their own ways, explained “the irreparable harm the SEC will do to every facet of the US crypto economy if it gets its way.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://bitnation.co/sec-crypto-crackdown-a-positive-sign-for-investors-report/">SEC</a> submitted a motion on November 3 to extend the deadline for filing all reply briefs until November 30. It requested that any new amicus papers be submitted by November 11. However, Ripple’s representatives have accused the agency of devising a delay strategy through its request. A representative was quoted as saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is yet another transparent attempt to further delay the resolution of this case and the court should reject it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Ripple’s&nbsp;defense attorney James K. Filan, the most recent amicus brief was submitted by Cryptillian Payment Systems on November 3. Additionally,&nbsp;Veri DAO added its voice to the list of organizations that support Ripple by filing its own amicus brief early this month. </p>



<p>Others on the list include John Deaton on behalf of XRP investors, Coinbase, Valhil Capital,&nbsp;the Investor Choice Advocates Network (ICAN), the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Blockchain Association,&nbsp;I-Remit, Spend The Bits, and&nbsp;Tapjets.</p>



<p>The SEC brought legal action against Ripple Labs in 2020, accusing its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen of&nbsp;raising&nbsp;$1.3 billion in unregistered securities offerings by selling its XRP token.</p>



<p>The SEC claimed that XRP&nbsp;is not a cryptocurrency but rather a security, is subject to securities regulations, and falls within its jurisdiction.&nbsp;Crypto users believe Ripple’s dispute with the SEC will hugely affect the industry and set the mood for future regulations in the United States and other countries. It will also establish if a cryptocurrency is a security.</p>

 The crypto and fintech worlds were the winners of the 2020 pandemic, but these sectors are struggling to survive and have had to cut down their staff strength. 



 Some companies blamed their confidence on the previous good run, which led to “excessive” hiring. 



 Global firms such as Twitter and Meta are also considering a reshuffle of their hiring process in a bid to cut costs. 
 



 



<p>The crypto market has remained difficult for both projects, their users and investors due to the bear market. Investment in some market sectors has seen a remarkable drop, while some projects have suffered low patronage. </p>



<p>Crypto exchanges, which were the busiest and biggest gainers of the bull run, have also been hard hit by the crypto winter. Transaction volumes on some exchanges like Coinbase are far from where they were this time last year. So, some of these platforms&nbsp;<a href="https://bitnation.co/amber-group-lays-off-10-of-its-employees/">trimmed down their staff to cut costs.</a></p>



<p>While some layoffs occurred between May and August, the trend is far from over. Stripe, a payment processor, <a href="https://stripe.com/en-in/newsroom/news/ceo-patrick-collisons-email-to-stripe-employees">announced</a> on November 3rd, via a memo sent by its CEO, Patrick Collison, that it would lay off 14% of its workforce, which is about 1000 employees.</p>



<p>Collison noted that the payment firm overhired as an explanation for the latest job cuts. He also listed other factors such as a massive hiring drive motivated by the global pandemic-driven spike in e-commerce, a period of substantial growth, followed by an economic slump marked by inflation, higher interest rates, and other macroeconomic difficulties.</p>



<p>The memo read,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We overhired for the world we’re in, and it pains us to be unable to deliver the experience that we hoped that those impacted would have at Stripe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The memo also included a payout scheme for the affected employees. Stripe’s CEO pointed out two areas the company missed, leading to its current decision. He wrote,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023 and underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown. We grew operating costs too quickly. Buoyed by the success we’re seeing in some of our new product areas, we allowed coordination costs to grow and operational inefficiencies to seep in.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stripe released a crypto payout product earlier this year for Twitter creators. The company’s decision to lay off some staff represents the widespread instability in the broader finance market.</p>



 Dapper Labs Joins the Trend 



<p>Blockchain developer Dapper Labs revealed in a memo on Nov. 2 that it would be laying off 22% of its workforce, or about 130 people. The news was shared by the company’s CEO, Roham Gharegozlou, who claimed that the firm’s growth from 100 to over 600 employees within two years prevented it from being as community-driven and aligned as it ought.</p>



<p>According to him, Dapper Labs has refined and centered its product strategy around a “more sustainable cost structure,” and is laying off staff based on the future needs of the company.</p>



 Other November Crypto Layoffs 



<p>According to a Bloomberg report published on November 1, Web3 behemoth and venture capital firm, Digital Currency Group (DCG) let off almost 10%, bringing its workforce to 66. A representative for DCG claimed the firm made a series of internal adjustments to prepare for its next phase of expansion, including the “streamlining” of units.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX is also making pullbacks in its workforce in addition to a plan to shift away from spot trading and custody services. The platform now intends to focus on crypto derivatives.</p>

<p>Elrond (<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/elrond-egld-price-prediction/">EGLD</a>), a blockchain protocol that aims to offer extremely fast transaction speeds by using sharding technology to its users, has confirmed its transition to MultiversX and aims to offer a number of crypto, metaverse, and Web3 services to its users. Interestingly, the announcement was made by the CEO and co-founder of the network, Beniamin Mincu, during X Day. Paris, MultiversX’s three-day conference that is taking place from November 3 – 5 in France’s former stock exchange, the Palais Brongniart.</p>



 
<blockquote><p>Today, a new chapter begins.<br><br>A bridge between worlds, at the intersection of worlds, and across worlds.<br><br>This is our new challenge. Our new vision.<a href="https://twitter.com/ElrondNetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ElrondNetwork</a> transforms and expands into MultiversX. <a href="https://t.co/lpk8qvTu1I">pic.twitter.com/lpk8qvTu1I</a></p>— Beniamin Mincu | xday.com | Paris. 3-5 Nov  (@beniaminmincu) <a href="https://twitter.com/beniaminmincu/status/1588162448103612416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>Interestingly, the new venture of the Elrond Network will see the “technology ecosystem for the new internet, which includes fintech, decentralized finance and the Internet of Things,” work on new products that will be focused on the metaverse and related experiences as well. The first product that the rebranding of the firm will be xFabric followed by xPortal and xWorld. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Incredible amounts of creative energy are being poured into multiple compelling metaverse visions. MultiversX is building the collaborative framework and composable toolkit to set up the stage,” said Benjamin Mincu, CEO and founder of MultiversX.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>MultiversX’s (formerly Elrond) first product, xFabric, has been <a href="https://www.nftgators.com/blockchain-company-elrond-rebrands-to-multiversx-to-focus-on-building-metaverse-related-products/">described</a> as a blockchain module capable of heavy customization and that is ready for deployment in just minutes. The second product, xPortal, has been described as a platform for metaverse avatars with financial and social elements while the last product, xWorld, has been described as a network of interoperable metaverses.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“xPortal is a true SuperApp. The portal to the Metaverse. The home for your avatar. Everything finance. A debit card. Friends, chat and social. Accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world,” said Mincu.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The speakers at the X Day.Paris conference, Jean-Noel Barrot, French Minister for Digital Transition and Telecommunications, Sebastian Burduja, Romanian Minister for Research, Innovation and Digitization, were introduced to the new technology and products. Other leading members of fintech and web3 world were also present to witness the new products and hear more about the rebranding of Elrond (EGLD).</p>



<p>However, it is also crucial to note that the rebranding will not effect the working of MetaverX as it will continue to leverage the Elrond blockchain and the EGLD token will continue to power the new platform. The token will be used to secure the network via staking and over the coming months, all the protocols and products development on the blockchain will be migrated to MetaverX ending the rebranding procedure. </p>



<p>Additionally, it is also crucial to note that the firm behind the world’s first dedicated Web3 browser Web3 browser, Opera, announced the integration of NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Elrond (EGLD), as well as Fantom (FTM) blockchains along with existing blockchains Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, BNB Chain. </p>

 Singapore arm of popular crypto fund manager Hashkey has received in-principle approval for the Capital Markets Services (“CMS”) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  



 The local arm of Hong Kong-based firm is now a licensed fund management company (LFMC), and the CMS license will allow the firm to conduct fund management services from Singapore. 



 In September this year, the firm was granted an uplift of its Type 9 licence for asset management by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong allowing it to manage portfolio 100% o virtual assets. 
 



 



<p>The crypto industry continues to struggle in a bearish market as general interest in these blockchain-based tokens have declined. However, despite the ongoing crypto winter, the Singapore arm of popular crypto fund manager Hashkey has received in-principle approval for the Capital Markets Services (“CMS”) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.hashkey.com/en/newsroom/HashKey-Capital-Singapore-Secures-In-Principle-Approval">announcement</a> made by the crypto fund manager based in Hong Kong at the Fintech Festival 2022 on Nov. 4, the local arm of Hashkey is now a licensed fund management company (LFMC), and the CMS license will allow the firm to conduct fund management services from Singapore and “take the next step in bringing digital assets closer to mainstream institutional adoption.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Singapore is quickly becoming the region’s epicentre of Web3 innovation. Being recognised by the MAS as a licensed fund management company will allow HashKey Capital Singapore to contribute to and support the local Web3 community, which is considered a significant accomplishment for us. As one of the top Web3 institutional investors in Asia, HashKey Capital is prepared to make additional contributions to help the local Web3 industry grow even more.” said Mr. Deng Chao, CEO, HashKey Capital Singapore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, it is also crucial to note that once the CMS license is granted, Hashkey Capital will be able to successfully offer its services to institutional and accredited investors. Furthermore, Mr. Chao believes that its approval from the Singaporean authority will give it an edge over other fund managers and “strengthen the company’s position across Asia and even on a global scale.”</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is not the only regulatory approval that the fund manager has secured in 2022. In September this year, the firm was granted an uplift of its Type 9 licence for asset management by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong which allowed it to be responsible for the management of a portfolio consisting 100% of virtual assets.</p>



<p>Moreover, it is also crucial to note that Hashkey Capital is the first firm to be recognized under Tech@SG programme as a “Recognised Investment Firm”. Tech@SG programme is jointly administered by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore to help fast-growing startups to hire key talent to grow and expand their business in Singapore. </p>



<p>Interestingly, a report from professional services network headquartered in Amstelveen, Netherlands, and incorporated in London, England, KPMG, stated that the wealthy classes in Hong Kong and Singapore have an increased interest in digital assets. One of the Big Four accounting firms confirmed in its report that over 90% of family offices and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) are very <a href="https://bitnation.co/kpmg-hnwi-in-singapore-and-hong-kong-are-keen-on-crypto/">leaning towards investing in the digital assets industry</a>.</p>

<p>After publishing our report exploring the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">intersections of digital rights, tech and climate justice</a>, we wanted to make space to collectively imagine what it would look like to turn our research findings into action. So on October 18, we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/join-our-community-call-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">hosted a community call</a> to plot a course for future work in this area. We were joined by activists, researchers and practitioners who are working on issues such as tech policy, environmental sciences, open data, digital rights, health, indigenous data and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the call we focused on two main themes: 1) environmental data &amp; AI for climate and 2) tech sustainability and decarbonization. While it is hard to capture how much collective energy was in the room, we’re sharing some of the main takeaways from the call below.</p>



 Environmental data &amp; AI for climate 



<p>Participants had a lot of ideas for how the digital rights community could support environmental and climate justice activists. One suggestion was supporting indigenous data sovereignty efforts by helping communities apply this lens to the popular FAIR and open data approaches, and avoiding “imposing AI discourse” and data projects that continue extractive methods. These suggestions overlap with the ways environmental justice and climate justice (EJ-CJ) are connected to other types of justice, such as anti-racism. The group recommended that digital rights advocates support data efforts that focus on environmental racism and identify areas where AI and other data initiatives can harm communities even as they further EJ-CJ priorities.</p>



<p>To bring environmental and climate justice activists into digital rights work in an effective way, digital rights communities should use their skills, knowledge and networks to help strengthen environmental justice and climate justice work. Participants said this could be done by providing advice on secure collaboration and communication, facilitating training on digital security and digital rights and showcasing work that could benefit from exposure. Additionally, EJ-CJ and digital rights communities could do skill/knowledge sharing around such topics as digital rights, environmental racism &amp; AI, tech labour issues, how companies collect and use user data, strategic litigation methods, environmental risk assessment, community engagement and trust-building processes.</p>



<p>Another priority was collaboration and adaptation. Participants recommended “identifying issues and models that demonstrate how data sharing collaboration is possible”, sharing “facilitation methods to identify real and perceived data collaboration risks”, and “bringing data back to the community as a model for sharing”. Others suggested sharing designs and source code “to enable tool use and adaptation”, adapting and designing apps for more intuitive and comprehensive monitoring and mapping work or interoperability, and connecting efforts for broader impact (e.g., linking data governance to spatial efforts can support food sovereignty).</p>



<p>Finally, participants identified four top priorities for how digital rights communities can engage on environmental data &amp; AI for climate:</p>



 
 Understand how vulnerable communities are affected by critical AI questions. 



 Ask probing questions like, “What is meant by green AI? Sustainable for whom?” 



 Address the need for more secure monitoring tools and build “better bridges” between them. 



 Facilitate community convenings that emphasise “diverse spaces and backgrounds”.&nbsp; 
 



 Tech sustainability &amp; decarbonization 



<p>These groups quickly zeroed in on the need for the digital rights community to expand their push for transparency around algorithms, platform governance and other technical issues of companies to include transparency around environmental data. Specifically, participants mentioned transparency around the “environmental impact of data-driven processes”, including data centres, and social and environmental issues around the mineral extraction that digital technology currently requires, especially so-called “green minerals” and supply chains.</p>



<p>Relatedly, participants would like to see digital rights activists demand accountability from social media companies regarding disinformation and misinformation. This might include advertising transparency around fossil fuel and energy companies, limitations and better moderation on greenwashing, misleading environmental claims and climate conspiracies across platforms, including in paid ads/content and increased efforts to promote digital literacy.</p>



<p>Two rights were top of mind: privacy and right to repair. One participant said they want to see digital rights communities “consistently use and promote privacy-by-design tools to prevent data collection by big players”. Right to repair was a popular topic of conversation, as participants wanted to see it enforced for product developers along with fixable software that can be supported in older devices and an end to planned obsolescence, which forces people to constantly buy new devices, increasing extractive mining and its harms to local communities. Said a participant, “Back in the day, people around the corner could fix my Nokia, but now tech companies make it hard”. We’re left with an over-reliance on tech companies.</p>



<p>Participants also identified three areas of cross-sector and cross-movement collaboration:</p>



 
 Connecting digital rights and labour organising by “supporting organised labour [especially in all areas of tech], teaching about cooperatives, building scalable tech frameworks for these movements” and supporting digital literacy across movements. 



 Adapting divestment strategies from the climate justice movement. 



 “Anticipating that the transition will be destructive [and] ‘our’ job as privileged people is to cushion the less privileged”. 
 



<p>Ultimately, people emphasised the urgent need for advocacy around climate reparations, tying many of the above issues together. They pointed out that not only are the people most affected by climate change the least responsible for it, but they also tend to be left out of the solutions, which mirrors other areas of the tech sector. Those most harmed by digital rights restrictions are often left out of strategising and decision-making. A commitment to EJ-CJ and digital rights means imagining and advocating for climate reparations on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>

 South Korean prosecutors believe Do Kwon ordered his team to manipulate Terra’s price. 



 A local report claimed Kwon is currently in Europe as an illegal immigrant. 



 Do Kwon has maintained his innocence against all allegations and keeps an active social media presence. 
 



 



<p>South Korean prosecutors have released statements claiming disgraced Terra founder Do Kwon is living in Europe as an illegal immigrant. Local news platform KBS News <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/056/0011367873">reported </a>that Kwon’s exact location remains a mystery. </p>



<p>A Terra whistleblower, Fatman, disclosed Do Kwon’s whereabouts in a Twitter post as the 30-year-old continued to evade his pending arrest. Fatman has published several shocking posts about Kwon and his alleged illegal activities leading to Tera’s collapse.</p>



 
<blockquote><p>Korean prosecutors have obtained a private conversation between Do Kwon and an employee where he gives orders to manipulate LUNA's market price. They have also confirmed that he is currently residing in Europe as an illegal immigrant. <a href="https://t.co/z7Z5R8rtEq">https://t.co/z7Z5R8rtEq</a></p>— FatMan (@FatManTerra) <a href="https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1588209305622306816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>Evidence continues to emerge in the Terra saga that shows that Kwon and his team manipulated the LUNA’s market price. Kwon and his team have been accused of violating the Capital Markets Act. An official of the South Korean Prosecutors’ office told KBS News, </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t reveal the details, but it was a conversation history where CEO Kwon specifically ordered price manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the heavy allegations facing Do Kwon, the Terra founder has continued to insist on his innocence. Regional Korean prosecutors are working on Kwon’s capture. The 31-year-old South Korean has continued to disprove claims that he is hiding from authorities, telling his followers that he is “making zero effort to hide.”</p>



<p>Korean authorities reportedly claimed to have seized $40 million in assets belonging to the embattled Kwon. The funds were reportedly kept on the Kucoin and Okex exchanges. But Kwon denied using both platforms.</p>



<p>Kwon has maintained an active presence on social media, but the KBS report believes the crypto developer cannot travel legally and now resides in Europe as an illegal immigrant. According to the piece,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Do Kwon is now an illegal immigrant, wherever he is, in any country, and he cannot travel legally between countries.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although Kwon’s country of residence&nbsp;has&nbsp;been identified, it is unknown if law enforcement has knowledge of his&nbsp;exact whereabouts or is capable of making an arrest. The Terra founder is currently wanted in many&nbsp;nations after <a href="https://bitnation.co/interpol-has-officially-issued-a-red-notice-against-do-kwon/">Interpol issued a red alert</a> for his whereabouts and arrest on September 25.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, November 3, 2022  – Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Edge’s Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, will lead a session at the Internet2 Technology Exchange (TechEX) “Leveraging the Cloud for Research” December 5-9, 2022. This annual conference brings together thought leaders in technology and innovation, including researchers, analysts, engineers, technologists, and students. Together, attendees will explore the&nbsp; issues facing researchers and which tools and services could be implemented to better support the global research community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TechEX Conference explores the most critical challenges and exciting opportunities in research and education, with expert-led sessions, tutorials and working meetings in advanced networking, cloud technology, research engagement, identity and access management, and information security. Featured under the research engagement track, Dr. Ghahramani’s presentation session will share findings from the the Ecosystem for Research Networking&nbsp; (ERN) Broadening the Reach (BTR) working group’s workshops and surveys conducted within the community, including the challenges and opportunities as institutions are leveraging the cloud to advance their research and education initiatives.</p>
<p>Many smaller, mid-sized and under-resourced campuses, including minority-serving institutions (MSI), Hispanic-serving institution (HSI), Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCU), and Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) institutions, have compelling science research and education activities along with an awareness of the benefits associated with better access to cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources. “These schools can benefit greatly from resources and expertise for cloud adoption to augment their in-house efforts,” says Dr. Ghahramani. “By directly focusing on the under-resourced academic institutions in the region, the ERN BTR working group is learning how to better support these organizations by enhancing advanced computing capabilities and research collaboration.”</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope is a specification for the achitecture of a “smart document”. It supports the storage, backup, encryption, authentication, and transmission of data, with natively supported cryptography and explicit support for Merkle-based selective disclosure. It’s designed to protect digital assets including seeds, keys, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Verifiable Presentations (VPs).</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is currently working with multiple companies on the development and deployment of Gordian Envelopes via regular biweekly meetings; <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us</a> if you’d like to be involved. We are also presenting Envelopes as a prospective Informational Draft for the IETF and engaging in discussions with the W3C Credentials Community Group.</p>

 The Envelope as Metaphor 

<p>The name “envelope” was chosen for this smart-document architecture because that provides an excellent metaphor for its capabilities.</p>

<p></p>

<p>These capabilities include:</p>

 
   Envelopes can have things written on them. Plaintext parts of a Gordian Envelope can be read by anyone. 
   Envelopes can have routing instructions. That plaintext information can include data on how to use the Gordian Envelope, such as how to open or close it. 
   Envelopes can contain things. Things can be placed within the structure of a Gordian Envelope. 
   Envelopes can contain envelopes. The Gordian Envelope structure is fully recursive: any part of an envelope can actually be another envelope. 
   Envelopes can have a seal. A signature can be made for the contents of a Gordian Envelope, verifying their authenticity and that they haven’t been changed. 
   Envelopes can be certified. Beyond just guarding against changes, a Gordian Envelope signature can also act as a certification of the envelope’s contents by some authority. 
   Envelopes can be closed. Encryption allows any part of a Gordian Envelope to be protected from prying eyes. 
   Envelopes can have windows. Selective disclosure allows for some parts of a Gordian Envelope to be readable while others have been redacted. Merkle proofs can proof that those parts were present in the original envelope. 
   Different recipients can open envelopes in different ways. Just as people might use letter openers, their fingers, or a machine to open a normal envelope, special permits can grant people different ways to open a Gordian Envelope. 
 

 Why Envelopes Are Important 

<p>The Gordian Envelope is intended as a more privacy-focused encoding architecture than existing data formats such as JWT and JSON-LD. We believe it has a better security architecture than JWT and that it doesn’t fall victim to the barriers of canonicalization complexity found in JSON-LD —&nbsp;which should together permit better security reviews of the Gordian Envelope design.</p>

<p>However, new features of Gordian Envelope not available in JWT or JSON-LD offer some of the best arguments for using the Smart Document structure.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Fundamental Structure:</p>

 
   Sematic Triples. Gordian Envelopes are built on powerful semantic triples, sometimes known as semantic graphs. (Semantic graphs are a feature of JSON-LD.) 
   Known Values. A set of “known values” for regularly used predicates can reduce the size of content within a Gordian Envelope. 
   Structured Merkle Tree. All parts of a Gordian Envelope can be hashed, creating a tree of digests that forms a structured Merkle Tree. (In this variant of Merkle Trees, all nodes contain both semantic content and digests, rather than semantic content being limited to leaves.) 
 

<p>Elision Support:</p>

 
   Elision of All Elements. Gordian Envelopes innately support elision for all the elements of their triples: subjects, predicates, and objects. 
   Redaction, Compression, and Encryption. Elision can be used for a variety of purposes including redaction (removing information), compression (removing duplicate information), and encryption (enciphering information). 
   Holder-initiated Redaction. Elision can be performed by the Holder of a Gordian Envelope, not just the Issuer (which is a large advance over most redaction designs to date). 
   Consistent Hashing. Even when elided or encrypted, hashes for those parts of the Gordian Envelope remain the same. 
 

<p>Privacy Support:</p>

 
   Proof of Inclusion. As an alternative to presenting redactive structures, proofs of inclusion can be included in top-level hashes. 
   Herd Privacy. Proofs of inclusion allow for herd privacy where all members of a class can share data such as a VC or DID without revealing individual information. 
   Non-Correlation. Encrypted Gordian Envelope data can optionally be made less correlatable with the addition of salt. 
 

<p>Authentication Support:</p>

 
   Symmetric Key Permits. Gordian Envelopes can be locked (“closed”) using a symmetric key. 
   SSKR Permits. Gordian Envelopes can alternatively be locked (“closed”) using a symmetric key sharded with Shamir’s Secret Sharing, with the shares stored with copies of the Envelope, and the whole enveloped thus openable if sufficient  copies of the Envelope with a quorum of different shares are gathered. 
   Public Key Permits. Gordian Envelopes can alternatively be locked (“closed”) with a public key and then be opened with the associated private key, or vice versa. 
   Multiple Permits. Gordian Envelopes can simultaneously be locked (“closed”) via a variety of means and then openable by any appropriate individual method, with different methods likely held by different people. 
 

<p>Future Looking:</p>

 
   Data Storage. The initial inspiration for Gordian Envelopes was for secure data storage. 
   Credentials &amp; Presentations The usage of Gordian Envelope signing techniques allows for the creation of credentials and the ability to present them to different verifiers in different ways. 
   Distributed or Decentralized Identifiers. Self-Certifying Identifiers (SCIDs) can be created and shared with peers, certified with a trust authority, or registered on blockchain. 
   Future Techniques. Beyonds its technical specifics, Gordian Envelopes still allows for cl-sigs, bbs+, and other privacy-preserving techniques such as zk-proofs, differential privacy, etc. 
   Cryptography Agnostic. Generally, the Gordian Envelope architecture is cryptography agnostic, allowing it to work with everything from older algorithms with silicon support through more modern algorithms suited to blockchains and to future zk-proof or quantum-attack resistent cryptographic choices. These choices are made in sets via ciphersuites. 
 

 Usage of Envelopes 

<p>Gordian Envelopes are a foundational architecture that we expect to support many advanced projects involving self-sovereign control of digital assets.</p>

<p>Currently, it’s being used in two major Blockchain Commons projects.</p>

 
   Crypto-request/response. Requests and responses are specified ways to ask for and send information needed for self-sovereign operations, including when transmitting across an Airgap. Our second generation of requests and responses encodes those communications in Gordian Envelopes. 
   Collaborative Seed Recovery. The <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR system</a> requires the use of Smart Documents to store shares of seeds that have been sharded for backup and recovery. The Gordian Envelope is thus the heart of that system. 
 

<p>There are a broad swath of additional use cases, some of which can be found in our [Use Case Overview of Envelopes] (PENDING). These include:</p>

 
   Self-Sovereign Control of Assets. There are many different use cases for helping users to resiliently control their digital assets, going beyond the specific design of CSR. These include the inclusion of metadata for resilience, the usage of salts to block correlation, and the creation of variable-use permits to allow multiple ways to open an envelope. 
   Educational Credential. All sorts of credentials can be created in Gordian Envelopes, but certifications and other educational credentials are likely to be some of the most popular. These can be credentials signed by accredited institutions or by Web of Trust peers. Elision and third-party manipulation can allow these credentials to be safely passed around for a variety of purposes. Herd privacy features can create even greater anonymity. 
   Source-Control Signing. The standardization of Gordian Envelopes is another of their strengths. Case studies involving source-control signing demonstrate how a field that is currently managed in a variety of different ways could allow for real improvements in security.

 New study highlights policy design principles to maximize benefits of digital identity 



<p>(TORONTO) – November 2, 2022 – The Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) and the Human Technology Foundation (HTF) today released a report titled <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4104436-Maximizing-Benefits-of-Digital-ID_Report_FINAL.pdf">Policy Design Principles to Maximize People-Centered Benefits of Digital Identity</a>. This report highlights the latest research, analysis and lessons learned about the ongoing development of digital identity strategies. The report further offers a set of policy design principles to help guide the optimal development and implementation of digital identification policies by governments, institutions and private sector entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This paper has been written with human considerations at the center, to inform policy makers and influencers from the public and private sectors, as well as the general public that may have interest in policy design,” said Joni Brennan, President of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada. “We hope governments and private sector entities will use the report as a tool to define policy design principles that support a common duty of care for organizations that implement digital identification systems and help enable them to consistently apply that duty of care.”</p>



<p>The report is a joint project of DIACC, a Canadian non-profit coalition of over 100 private and public sector organizations, and HTF, a network of several thousand members that operates in Paris, Montreal and Geneva. It offers 3 core policy design recommendations for decision makers, which are then declined into concrete measures:</p>



  Digital identity policy must be people centered. Digital identity policy needs to be designed above all on a user-centric basis that prioritizes citizens’ needs and rights and puts individuals at the center of the process. People-centered means inclusive, voluntary, resilient, and intuitive for both institutions and people.&nbsp;  Digital identity policy must foster empowerment. Digital identity that empowers companies, customers, clients, and citizens builds confidence in relationships, expands usage, and can promote public participation in community, government and political processes. It must be user-controlled, based on informed consent, and allow for data portability.&nbsp;  Digital identity policy must encourage trust through governance. People gain confidence in services when the functioning and governance of the service is transparent and understandable. Digital identity policy must be transparent, accountable, secure, and future-proofed.&nbsp;  



 Keys to a socially accepted digital identity 



<p>This report focuses on the perception and the impact of a digital identity on different groups within society. It lists the characteristics to maximize the benefits of a digital identity for citizens and companies. One core measure includes reducing the amount of information disclosed, and protecting, when possible, the anonymity of the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital identity is a solution to societal issues. For instance, an effective protection of minors requires their identification and the supervision of their access to online services and content. This cannot be done at the expense of the strict respect for privacy. Thanks to the principle of data minimisation, digital identity meets this challenge” said Eric Salobir, President of the Human Technology Foundation.</p>



 A public-private cooperation&nbsp; 



<p>The report reflects the belief that governments and private sector entities must deeply engage in fast-reacting and smart policy-making on digital identity. It also addresses the issue of including the private sector in the processes,&nbsp; and the elements of governance that can build public trust. It highlights the need for extensive public engagement to inform on the digital transformation and promote inclusive and fair solutions that underpin trust in digital ecosystems as the digital economy continually develops and expands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The risks of not moving ahead with the policy design needed to support transformation will include the loss of the strategic autonomy of the nation, worsening cyber security attacks, and failure to realize substantial economic growth potential,” said Eric Salobir, Human Technology Foundation President.</p>



<p>DIACC and HTF hope decision-makers in national and sub-national governments, along with private sector entities, will use the information herein as a tool to work urgently with all stakeholders to establish inclusive, privacy-protecting, and trustworthy digital identity related policies that empower individuals, businesses, the public sector, and civil society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Coalition of Canada (DIACC)</p>



<p>DIACC is a Canadian non-profit coalition of 100+ private and public sector organizations who are passionate about building a strong, trusted and interoperable identity ecosystem in Canada. Originating from Finance Canada’s task force recommendations on moving Canada into the digital age, DIACC delivered their first mandate to develop a digital identity and authentication framework — now known as the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF). Today, DIACC continues to serve Canadians by driving the adoption of the PCTF that defines a duty of care that citizens, clients and customers should expect while using modernized digital services. This defined duty of care puts people’s benefits at the center while enabling adopters to verify their practice.</p>



<p>About the Human Technology Foundation (HTF)</p>



<p>Created in 2012, HTF is a network of several thousand members that operates in Paris, Montreal, Rome, Brussels and Geneva with the intention of placing the human being at the heart of technology development and putting technology back at the centre of social debates. HTF’s mission is to coordinate international multidisciplinary research projects and serve as an interface between academia, society, and the economy. For HTF members, technology must be part of the solution for building a society that is more respectful of everyone.</p>

<p>The world is going digital, offering unmatched flexibility and potential for global interoperability. Mobile credentials allow users to authenticate with their smartphone and use it as their key to accessing everything from a bar where an individual must prove their age to a government web-based service where an individual must verify their identity. Balancing the wealth of opportunities, however, are the risks of having these new levels of convenience undermine any expectation of privacy. The&nbsp;<a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/l/cp/0BXjjcnX">Privacy-Enhanced Mobile Credentials Working Group</a>&nbsp;within&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>&nbsp;is working to help address this challenge, focusing on mobile credentials such as mobile drivers’ licenses (mDL).&nbsp;</p>







<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@aka_opex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Mitya Ivanov</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@aka_opex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>



<p>According to the PEMC WG charter, the PEMC WG exists “to create a set of requirements and conformance criteria to protect the privacy of individuals holding or using mobile credentials such as mobile Driving Licenses.” This work is being done against the backdrop of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en">ISO/IEC 18013-5</a>-compliant mobile driving license ecosystem. While the ISO standard establishes details regarding the credential itself, more work is needed to provide assurances to the holders of mobile credentials that relying parties collecting their identity attributes will only use those attributes for fulfilling the purposes for which the mobile credential was presented. Failing to respect the consent of the mobile credential holder or the legal authority of the verifier to collect the identity attributes could violate the privacy of the mobile credential holder.</p>



 Expected Work Items 



<p>The PEMC WG is working through a phased approach to writing requirements and conformance criteria for the various endpoints of data flows in a mobile credential ecosystem. This ecosystem describes the interactions of the Issuer, Holder and Verifier, and includes the software, hardware, individuals, and entities at the technical endpoints. In ISO/IEC 18013-5, these are the “Issuing Authority”, “Issuing Authority Infrastructure”, “mDL What about including a simple table where you map the ISO term to the “common language” version? Holder”, “mDL” (credential and holding software), “mDL Verifier”, and “mDL Reader”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of the next one to two years, the PEMC WG plans on producing several reports and guidelines, including an Implementors Report, the Requirements for Issuers, Verifiers, and Providers, and various Compliance Profiles.&nbsp;</p>



 PEMC Implementors Report 



<p>The group’s focus today is on creating the outline that will provide the scope and structure for the PEMC Implementors Report. The mobile credential ecosystem includes people and/or organizations that hold the credential and consent to its use (Holders),&nbsp; issue the credentials (Issuers), and verify the credential as valid or legitimate (Verifiers). Each of those entities has roles, expectations, and responsibilities that must be clearly defined such that later work can build upon that information to develop assessment and conformance criteria. The Implementors Report offers the necessary framing, guidance, and description of appropriate evidence that will allow the group to develop the requirements and profiles needed for implementing the best practices described by the PEMC WG.</p>



<p>The goal is to have this report published by the end of the 2022 calendar year.</p>



 Timeline / Milestones

 PEMC Requirements for Issuers, Verifiers, and Providers 



<p>Once the initial report has framed the discussion, the group will produce three additional documents that set out the specific requirements for each type of entity in this ecosystem. These requirements will offer a complete set of guidelines that will serve as the basis for allowing assessors to measure whether an Issuer, Verifier, or Holder (and the specific technology they use) is compliant with the privacy-supporting&nbsp;</p>



<p>While not the focus of the group today, the PEMC WG has spent considerable time discussing the requirements in the past, and will continue to flesh them out once the Implementor’s Report is done. You can see the&nbsp;<a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/l/cp/0ozvM0cB">candidate requirements</a>&nbsp;on the PEMC WG wiki.</p>



 PEMC Compliance Profiles 



<p>With almost every requirement comes an “it depends” caveat as to whether that requirement applies in all cases. For example, any requirement about the handling of age data doesn’t apply if there is no age data being shared. Alternatively, there may be a use case where even more stringent requirements for handling that data are appropriate. The general requirements set the baseline; profiles set the details for common scenarios. Profiles cannot add entirely new requirements, but they can specify how the existing requirements must be implemented in the scenario they are capturing.</p>



<p>The final output of the PEMC WG will be these compliance profiles. Exactly what scenarios will be captured will be determined by the working group participants.</p>



 How to Learn More 



<p>Interest in mobile credentials in general–and mDLs in specific–is growing as governments and commercial organizations move to explore the possibilities. If you are interested in helping developing best practice in this space in a way that’s measurable and globally critical, please join us! Information on joining the group is available&nbsp;<a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEMCP/pages/2097681/Participating+in+the+PEMC+Work+Group">online</a>; no mDL required.&nbsp;</p>



 About Kantara Initiative and the OpenID Foundation 



 
 

 



 

 
 



<p>Support for the volunteer-led PEMC WG is offered by Kantara Initiative and the OpenID Foundation.</p>



<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit open standards body with a vision to help people assert their identity wherever they choose and a mission to lead the global community in creating identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy-preserving. One of the OIDFs strengths is creating identity protocols that serve billions of consumers across millions of applications. In that context, OIDF welcomes the opportunity to help fund and facilitate this ambitious yet pragmatic effort in service to the global community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly,&nbsp; Kantara Initiative believes in the importance of this work to serve the global community by closing the gaps between policy and protocols. Kantara is a non-profit, global leader in privacy certification with a shared goal of offering safe spaces for open conversations by the community. Kantara seeks to materially improve the privacy landscape across all markets and sectors. One of its key strengths is deep dive audits of client implementations to ensure standards like NIST 800-63-3 are met against clear conformance criteria. The joint approach of Kantara and OIDF&nbsp; to both projects serves as a model for the kinds of partnership required to build technically viable policies and policy-supportive protocols.</p>

<p>Over the past year, my <a href="https://www.dataswift.io">Dataswift</a> team and I have been so busy designing, building and rolling out data ecosystems that we’ve not had time to do much else. Thanks to invitations from friends at <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.co.uk">Ctrl Shift</a>, <a href="https://www.ifc.org">IFC</a> and <a href="https://www.adb.org">ADB</a> (thank you!) I now have an opportunity to talk a bit about what we do at the <a href="https://www.fintechfestival.sg">Singapore Fintech Festival</a> Distributed Data Ecosystem session, the ADB reception on their sandbox (Singapore) and at the <a href="https://www.openxcongress.com">OpenX Congress</a> (London). This blogpost is the full version of the&nbsp;topic.</p> The view from here:&nbsp;web2.0 <p>Let’s start with how I view data, as someone who has spent many years working on <a href="https://ireneng.com/markets/">markets and ecosystems</a>. In the web2.0 world, data is mostly fragmented, with disparate pieces of information about a person held across companies. This world, which we currently live in, is populated by centralized systems that have made “platform business models” very popular. These businesses usually design, build and operate the technology of all three business layers – service (applications/website), data (traits/attributes of people), custodian (storing the&nbsp;data).</p><p>Each of these layers in the business stack is tightly coupled with one another with centralized technologies. Almost all businesses use centralized digital technologies today, whether single service or platforms, because they are technically very efficient. Coupling between the layers can be made looser for large conglomerates looking to share data amongst multiple apps/services/businesses, but they are often also built in a centralized fashion. Building decentralized systems require a very different mindset but that’s a subject of a different post.</p> Web3.0 <p>In the web3.0 world (which we are actively engaged in), data is self sovereign and decentralized to individuals. This separation of data from service is important because self-sovereign data provide agency and autonomy. By providing the “nodes, pipes and plumbing” of self-sovereign data, our clients’ data wallets and services have greater freedom to operate on more data and can also compete better in vertical&nbsp;markets.</p><p>This separation also matters for regulatory purposes; while self-sovereign data is compliant and portable across all global territories, services on top of self-sovereign data would still need to conform to a specific country’s regulation. For example, our client in Europe who is creating their “Bring your Own” Identity Service using our decentralized data infrastructure would still require <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.electronicid.eu/en/blog/post/qualified-electronic-signature/en">QES</a>.</p><p>Separated from the service, data is more portable, making it possible for data ecosystems to be designed and&nbsp;built.</p> How we design data ecosystems <p>In web2.0 where data is siloed, it is the virtualization of human traits and attributes. Web2.0 tends to focus on aggregation and prediction for better recommendations with better data products, or to ascertain risks of an individual’s behaviour.</p><p>In web3.0 with decentralized self-sovereign data, multiple traits and attributes can now be grouped together across companies, giving visibility to micro-behaviours. These micro-behaviours can be linked up to form journeys that are enabled by data within a data wallet. At Dataswift, we are often called to design these journeys, together with the types of data that form&nbsp;them.</p><p>Of course, getting multiple data sources to decentralize their data requires them to come together to form a data ecosystem. And many of our clients do so, because it reduces customer churn, improves engagement, and cuts their customer acquisition costs. Much like how Star Alliance competes with One World in the airline sector, data ecosystems also create collective stickiness. Most of all, ecosystem owners potentially increase their income because every use of their customer data in the ecosystem earns them revenue (more of that&nbsp;below).</p> The art of the&nbsp;possible <p>With data ecosystems and data wallets, it is now possible to design and intervene in journeys to achieve large-scale outcomes such as ESG goals. This ability to achieve mass coordination while preserving privacy and enabling agency is what’s most exciting about data ecosystems.</p><p>The following are some examples of data ecosystems we have designed for our clients; the illustrations should be self-explanatory.</p><p>This customer journey is the shortest we’ve ever designed. A KYC process takes only 5 mins and yet its reusability is of such high&nbsp;value.</p><p>This journey is quite unique as it involves self-sovereign data of a micro-SME where the individual is a shop&nbsp;owner.</p><p>This journey will probably have huge potential for the measurement of scope 3 emissions.</p><p>Of course, designing and rolling out data ecosystems is one thing; using a market to scale it is&nbsp;another.</p> How we scale data ecosystems <p>At Dataswift, we design a data ecosystem for a “triple coincidence of wants” (see my rather dry <a href="http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/160054/">paper</a> on&nbsp;this):</p>  Individuals want better offers and more contextual and personalized recommendations.  Partners want to reach audiences with selected attributes.  The app/website and ecosystem owner wants greater loyalty, better engagement, lower acquisition costs and most of all, to generate revenues from the data they hold of their customers.  <p>So when we design data ecosystems, we adhere to certain market design principles that will ensure that the ecosystem is able to grow, reinforce itself and self regulate. When all this happens, revenues for the ecosystem owner should start flowing in and outcomes are achieved with minimal intervention. For example, it should take mere minutes for a completely new partner to sign up to use verified data when an individual shows up at their business; they should not need to deal with cumbersome tech and legal integration. This is how revenues of a data ecosystem can scale exponentially.</p><p>Data ecosystems usually attract the interest of private equity funds. They often partner us by bringing low-performing investees who hold customer data, so that we can help them achieve a larger multiplier of returns with a data ecosystem.</p><p>One of our most visible ecosystems is <a href="http://sejutakg.my">SejutaKG</a>, which is looking to get the whole nation of Malaysia to lose 1 million kg in weight through changing micro-behaviours and micro-habits, and checking the country’s obesity epidemic while using the market to fund its roll-out. SejutaKG has completed their pilot and would be scaling in the next few months. It is a good example of charities/NGOs that struggle to raise funding or donations and may wish to build a data ecosystem that can generate sustainable revenues for their&nbsp;cause.</p><p>We have many more data ecosystems on our design table. Working with NFTs, stable coins and CBDCs are some we can’t quite talk about yet but we’ll put them out when we can. If you want to earn revenues from decentralizing your customer data and think you need a data ecosystem, we usually ask you three questions:</p>  What micro-habits / behaviours do you wish to incentivize?  What customer journey do you wish to transform /&nbsp;improve?  What impact / outcome do you wish to achieve (as a business and as a community)?  <p>If you have answers for each of these, a data ecosystem may be&nbsp;viable.</p><p>In fact, if you have a “wicked” problem, have thrown money at a collective outcome, have had difficulty scaling data portability and want to gain advantage over your competitors, <a href="https://www.dataswift.io/contact">let’s have a chat</a>. I’m in Singapore for the Singapore Fintech Festival week starting 31 Oct and in London for the OpenX Congress in the week beginning 7 Nov, then in the US for a month from 14&nbsp;Nov.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/designing-markets-and-scaling-data-ecosystems-1d799e870250">Designing markets and scaling data ecosystems</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things">Hub of All Things</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Cruz Verde offers a range of pharmaceutical services in Colombia, including wholesale distribution of medicines and other supplies to hospitals. Dosed medication delivered by the company has a lot number and expiration date, but it is coded in a non-standard way. This means that hospital staff receiving the drugs need to manually verify each medication and it takes up to eight hours with an error rate of 1.5%.</p>

  Pfizer (Global): Using barcodes to support efficient clinical trials
 
 
     

 
              Pfizer has introduced a single GS1 standard barcode to all its clinical trial products. This is helping those at Pfizer’s packaging and distribution centres to ensure the right products go to the right sites in the right quantities – and providing a base for greater use of barcode scanning. 

<p>To run a clinical trial for a potential new medicine is to confront a challenging and very precise distribution process. Ensuring every healthcare site involved in the trial receives the right products for the right patients – including placebos, or perhaps several different doses of the active ingredient being investigated – is complicated. There is then the further issue of clinicians being certain that the right patient is being administered the right product.</p>

<p>Getting all this correct is crucial to successfully running trials, which are in turn crucial to testing new medicines which could improve treatment options for patients. A clinical trial is a highly controlled environment, and an incorrect shipment or the wrong drug going to the wrong patient could ultimately impact the integrity of outcomes and patient safety.</p>

              Pharmaceutical firm Aspen has implemented a GS1 standards-based serialisation system, enabling full regulatory compliance across multiple nations. 

<p>Several countries now require serial numbers to be present on pharmaceutical products, and forthis data to be transferred from the manufacturer to the regulator. In 2017, the pharmaceutical company Aspen Australia was awarded a significant contract manufacturing portfolio, with many of the resulting products being exported to nations in which such requirements were in place. The firm therefore needed to implement a solution to ensure compliance.</p>

<p>List of recommendations</p>



  Recommendation 1: That the government drive economic growth by prioritizing and investing in the government’s digital identity mandate.  



  Recommendation 2: That the government strengthen alignment with provinces and territories on digital identity initiatives.&nbsp;  



  Recommendation 3: That the government make strategic investments to combat misinformation and disinformation that is impeding the acceleration of Canada’s digital economy.  



<p>Introduction</p>



<p>On behalf of our members, we would like to thank the House of Commons Finance Committee (FINA) for the opportunity to submit this pre-budget submission. As the federal government continues to build a digital government and embrace a digital-first mindset, the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) is eager to help ensure Canada is leading on digital identity, adapting to our new realities, and playing a leadership role among our global peers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DIACC was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, with a goal to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital identity ecosystem. Our work is guided by an overarching and deep commitment to trust and duty of care, evidenced by the development of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) — a co-created framework that any jurisdiction and industry sector can work with to ensure business, legal and technical interoperability. Instead of a single solution, the PCTF promotes choice and offers a shared hub that distinct solutions can interoperate through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our submission and recommendations reflect the deep experience and expertise of DIACC’s member organizations, and our collective commitment to the success of verifiable digital identity to secure Canada’s full and beneficial participation in the global digital economy.</p>



<p>Canada’s opportunity to lead on the global stage</p>



<p>DIACC and its members applaud the government for its commitments to date on digital transformation in general, and digital identification in particular. We were encouraged to see digital identity as a priority in Treasury Board President Mona Fortier’s mandate letter, and to see the government announced its Digital Ambition plan which recognizes the need for digital options among Canadians, as well as the need for transformation of public and private-sector organizations as they adopt digital technology solutions to better deliver programs and services.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Yet despite the commitments made, Canada risks getting left behind as the global community embraces digital identity. At the recent 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, a broad range of representatives discussed and <a href="https://www.undp.org/press-releases/global-leaders-usher-new-era-digital-cooperation-more-sustainable-equitable-world">agreed</a> to scale up efforts to build safe, trusted and inclusive digital public infrastructure (DPI) for a more sustainable and equitable world. The commitments included an initial $295 million in funding to support the development and adoption of inclusive DPI, scaling technical assistance and deeper capacity building. The event — called ‘The Future of Digital Cooperation: Building resilience through safe, trusted, and inclusive digital public infrastructure’ — was the first significant gathering of countries to advance the development and use of DPI. This is a sign of the momentum and growing priority both the public and private sectors are placing on DPI and digital identity.<br><br>The time to lead is now, but to do so governments must make solving digital identity, with an overarching commitment to privacy and security, a stated priority now and establish public policy that puts people in control of their public and private sector data. That opportunity — and imperative — comes at a time when Canadians are clear about their expectations around digital identity and the desire for privacy and control over how and which personal information is shared. In a recent <a href="https://diacc.ca/2022/04/04/privacy-security-and-choice-drive-canadians-desire-for-digital-id/">survey</a> conducted by DIACC, 91 per cent of Canadian respondents indicated they want control over their personal data collected by provincial and federal governments, 86 per cent of respondents indicated they want control over personal data collected by private organizations, and 80 per cent said they want a secure and unified digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>It is within that context that DIACC offers three key recommendations in advance of Budget 2023.</p>



<p>Recommendation #1: Drive economic growth by prioritizing and investing in the government’s digital identity mandate.<br><br>While the benefits of privacy, choice, and trust in advancing digital identity are clear, the economic benefits — and related cost of inaction — are significant. More than just a part of driving Canada’s post-pandemic recovery strategy, digital identity has the potential to be a powerful economic driver for Canada. A white paper developed by DIACC member Hyperion found that the impact of digital identity used to improve processes could result in a potential <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Economic-Impact-of-Digital-Identity-DIACC-v2.pdf">$4.5 billion of added value</a> to SMEs and reinvestments in the Canadian economy. Further, in a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/strategy/articles/digital-identity.html">recent study</a>, McKinsey found that extending full digital identity coverage could unlock economic value equivalent to 3 to 13 percent of GDP in 2030, with just over half of the potential economic value potentially accruing to individuals.<br><br>Yet the cost of inaction on digital identity goes beyond the loss of potential economic growth and failure to reach Canada’s economic potential. <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Economic-Impact-of-Digital-Identity-DIACC-v2.pdf">Other countries</a> prioritizing identity solutions have begun looking for ways to expand beyond their borders by promoting their digital identity solutions and using their own experiences as a role model for new initiatives, bringing with it revenue potential by letting other countries leverage existing solutions, platforms or infrastructure.<br><br>The strength of Canada’s economic future depends on strategic digital investments making digital identity a priority, and ensuring Canadians can completely and securely participate in the global digital economy.<br><br>Recommendation #2: Strengthen alignment with provinces and territories on digital identity initiatives.<br><br>Multiple Canadian provinces have either launched or made investments in digital identity products and services, yet federal funding and cohesive leadership remains the missing piece. Alberta and British Columbia have launched digital identification, with BC including a mobile card and a Verify by Video option. Significant investments have been made in Ontario and Québec, where proof of vaccination credentials have been launched. Saskatchewan, Yukon, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick are launching pilots, proof of concepts and digital identity components.<br><br>There is demand for and interest in enabling capability across the country — but unequal funding and approaches developed in silos pose a risk. Without cohesive federal leadership, these systems will be disjointed and miss the opportunity to be truly interoperable, efficient and useful for all Canadians. Unlocking these opportunities in a synchronized and equitable manner will ensure Canadians can all access economic opportunities, public services and the chance to manage their own personal information in a safe and controlled way in our digital economy.<br><br>Recommendation #3: Make strategic investments to combat misinformation and disinformation that is impeding the acceleration of Canada’s digital economy. <br><br>According to Statistics Canada, during the pandemic a full 96 per cent of Canadians who searched for and found COVID-19 information online said they suspected the information was misleading, false or inaccurate. Among these, one-quarter saw misinformation multiple times a day. Only four per cent said they never saw misinformation, and 40 per cent of Canadians said they saw information they believed to be true, then later realized it was not.<br><br>Trust in online information, media and government organizations, and the perceived lack of privacy, can be seen on the decline over the years. So it is no surprise that there is so much confusion and mistrust around the benefits and privacy protections gained by implementing digital identity solutions and services.<br><br>Canadians need to feel safe and in control of their information when they engage online. Core to that safety is privacy, security and choice in how they share personal information online. In order to increase trust and maximize the economic benefits of digital identity, we need government-led public education campaigns and initiatives that speak to the facts around digital identity including privacy, security and benefits to Canadians as the world shifts to a digital economy.<br><br>Conclusion <br><br>While Canada has made significant strides in prioritizing digital identity and the shift to a digital economy, there is still work to do on the path to an inclusive, privacy-enhancing digital identity strategy that works for all Canadians.<br><br>As a creation of the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, DIACC wants to support the government in empowering individuals, increasing government efficiency, strengthening companies, and uniting communities across the country with secure access to resources, economic development, trust and support. Our organization and its members are committed to helping the government continue to unlock opportunities for Canadians, decrease costs for governments, consumers and business, improve service delivery, and drive GDP growth. We believe these three recommendations will get us there.<br><br>Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide our input in advance of Budget 2023 and as we collectively move forward on the path to a digitally and economically prosperous Canada.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Energy Web is working with Shell on Avelia, a digital platform for scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), one of the most promising new technologies for reaching net zero in the aviation&nbsp;sector.</p><p>All areas of the economy need to reach net zero in the coming decades. This will be much more straightforward for some sectors than others. In many cases, the deciding factor will be the speed at which technologies develop.</p><p>One way of thinking about large-scale decarbonization is as a triangle with three points, all three of which need to be spoken for to drive change at&nbsp;pace:</p>  Technology: We need technologies which can replace current ways of doing things with low-carbon options — such as electric vehicles replacing petrol&nbsp;cars  Clear targets: On top of the desire to want to reach net zero, we need to maintain clear targets to make sure we progress towards our end&nbsp;goal.  Economics: We need the economic drivers which will make switching to new technologies and approaches financially viable.  <p>For the aviation sector, governments around the world made a major step last month towards evidencing the middle of these three points. At the assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the air transport division of the United Nations, <a href="https://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/States-adopts-netzero-2050-aspirational-goal-for-international-flight-operations.aspx">184 countries signed a landmark treaty</a> agreeing to target net zero carbon emissions for air transport by&nbsp;2050.</p><p>The sector will require major changes to hit this long-term goal in the time allotted, from all actors in the industry, and progress has to start now. Aviation is currently responsible for around 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. With the total number of passengers globally expected to continue growing as flights become more accessible, this is only set to increase.</p><p>Flying, however, has typically been a difficult area for emissions reductions, primarily because the technologies simply don’t yet exist to completely replace the kerosene-powered jet engines which are responsible for emissions.</p><p>Manufacturers and engineers are working hard on this central problem. Airbus’ <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/zero-emission/hydrogen/zeroe">ZEROe concept aircraft</a> explore hydrogen-powered propulsion for zero-emission flight. And <a href="https://www.afar.com/magazine/electric-planes-are-coming-sooner-than-you-think#:~:text=The%20largest%20electric%20plane%20in,BAE%20Systems)%20with%20electric%20batteries.">United will start flying</a> Heart’s 19-seat ES-19 electric aircraft in 2026 for short-hop journeys.</p><p>But these aircraft and the associated infrastructure for fuelling and charging may be decades off from widespread use. And for greater uptake for longer-ranges, electric aircraft will require major battery technology improvements.</p><p>Over the past decades, much improvement has come from advances in flight efficiency through improvements to aerodynamics, engines, weight distribution, and&nbsp;routing.</p><p>But what goes in the engines is proving to be just as important. One of the most promising areas for emissions reductions right now is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a fuel which can be mixed with regular jet fuel and be used without having to modify the jet engine, and is made of renewable sources such as plant or animal material — including cooking oil, urban and agricultural waste, and even&nbsp;algae.</p><p>Over the lifecycle of an aircraft, it can reduce emissions by up to 80%, and has already been successfully deployed by some industry actors, with around 450,000 flights having already used it. It’s a great example of a technology which, if supported correctly, can be worked seamlessly into existing operations to cut emissions.</p><p>There are problems though. SAF is currently much more expensive than traditional jet fuel — often double the price. For all the net zero goodwill, airlines simply can’t operate without workable&nbsp;costs.</p><p>In addition to the massive demand from airlines for this fuel, it’s also scarce. In 2021, 100 million litres of SAF were produced — against the global aviation’s typical yearly usage of <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/sustainable-flying-blog/why-saf-is-the-future-of-aviation/">360 billion litres</a> of jet fuel, accounting for less than 0.03% of industry consumption.</p><p>We’re working with Shell, one of the largest energy companies in the world and a founding member of Energy Web, as well as Accenture and American Express, on a blockchain powered book-and-claim solution that provides fully traceable SAF purchases, to help scale&nbsp;SAF.</p><p>It works like this: corporate travelers use Avelia’s book-and-claim system to purchase a share of SAF for the flight they are taking. If SAF isn’t available on that flight, then the total equivalent SAF paid for is used by another flight — contributing to the overall demand for the fuel, and allowing travelers to claim a purchase. The environmental benefits of this purchase are then recorded in the company’s favor.</p><p>This has benefits for everyone. Airlines access the buying power of corporations for SAF needs, while companies can use the traceable attributes Avelia provides to meet their own sustainability targets, and one day include them as part of corporate reporting.</p><p>The ultimate goal of Avelia is to create and evidence the demand necessary to help SAF to scale up. By creating a straightforward and transparent way to purchase SAF, we send clear buying signals to the market, giving SAF suppliers the confidence to invest in ramping up production.</p><p>At the same time, by furthering investment in production, Avelia will help to lower the price of SAF for all airlines. In this way, we’re contributing to the third point on the decarbonization triangle above: by facilitating the economic drivers needed to make SAF more accessible, we’re aiming to turbocharge its&nbsp;uptake.</p><p>Green Proofs, which you can<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions/green-proofs/"> read more about here</a>, is our solution for registering and tracking low-carbon products — like SAF — in a traceable, efficient manner, helping to validate proof of ownership and environmental benefit for corporate customers.</p><p>In 2022, SAF saw <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/sustainable-aviation-fuels/">$17.0 Billion in forward purchase agreements</a> — fantastic progress. But we need a lot more. With Avelia, we’re hoping to help share the costs of SAF across companies, airlines and travellers, to help the SAF industry — and aviation’s net zero transition — to take off.<br>You can visit Avelia’s website<a href="https://aveliasolutions.com/"> here</a> to see&nbsp;more.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Ceramic recently launched Sign in With Solana (SIWS)—a specification developed in partnership with the Chain Agnostic Standards Association and leading Solana wallets and apps—to provide secure and user-friendly authentication.</p><p>Signing in with a wallet means users don’t have to worry about pop-up modals or needing to sign every action they take on an app.</p><p>Check out an example below, using a Phantom wallet to sign into <a href="https://orbis.club/blog/kjzl6cwe1jw1496mwu9sxirb3rc3bml8tutthakzi7vcd4jee6lybme6fl2qytr">Orbis Protocol</a>. Developers use Orbis to build features such as social timelines, comment systems or private messaging on top of their applications, with the underlying Ceramic data infrastructure facilitating performant social experiences.</p><p>How Sign-In With Solana works:</p>  Ceramic uses the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> standard for users accounts. DIDs require no central authority—users control their data and decide who they share it with.  With the <code>did:pkh</code> DID method, a persistent ID is securely generated from the public key hash of a wallet address. This enables one-click sign-on with a wallet to many apps on Solana.  App developers can pair it with the DID-Sessions library, which allows a stream author (user) to delegate to another entity (app developer) the ability to sign certain read/write actions on their behalf for a time-bound period.  The SIWS spec passes a human-readable message between a Solana wallet, like Phantom, and a Solana app, like Magic Eden. The message includes sign-in, defines which capability permissions the user is offering to the developer, and for how long—similar to a web2 session today.  <p>You can learn how to use DID:PKH by invoking a Solana auth provider <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/authorization">here</a>. Learn more about DID-Sessions <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/accounts/did-session/">here</a> and Capability Permissions <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/">here</a>.

<p>November 17, 2022<br>
11 am EDT<br>
</p>
 
 
<p>For years, Online Program Managers (OPMs) have provided costly, cookie-cutter digital learning options for institutions looking to fast-track a presence in the online market. Now, as many institutions have made investments in their own digital learning capabilities over the last two years, and federal guidelines and regulations on OPM providers continue to tighten, institutions have a perfect opportunity to foster successful home-grown digital learning programs.</p>
<p>In this session, Edge Chief Digital Learning Officer Josh Gaul will share insights into why institutions should take this opportunity to evolve beyond OPM partnerships, and how to do so successfully.</p>
<p>This session will outline:</p>
 
 
 How the drawbacks of OPM partnerships far outweigh the benefits 
 How institutions can take advantage of unique institutional characteristics and intellectual property to evolve beyond OPM branded programming 
 Steps institutions will need to take to effectively replace OPM capabilities, including instructional design, faculty training, student support, and more 
 The role of digital learning leaders in launching and maintaining sustainable online programming 
 How Edge can support a successful shift away from OPMs with support services and collaborative community-building

The programme is designed to help National Governing Bodies (NGBs) across England with digital transformation, so more people from more communities can access and enjoy&nbsp;sport.</p><p>For the rest of the year and into 2023, we’re testing the hypothesis that Sport England NGBs will share more openly (in terms of both transparently within their organisation, and externally with other orgs) if we run sessions that provide access points on a spectrum of openness.</p>Logos of Sport England, CAST, Catalyst and the Innovation &amp; Digital Accelerator<p>This goes from, for example, changing sharing permissions on web-based folders (e.g. Google Drive) through to writing weeknotes on a regular basis. We can capture evidence of success both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially in terms of quotations relating to changed practice and cultural change within&nbsp;NGBs.</p> Badges for Open Org characteristics 5 Principles of Open cc-by-nd&nbsp;WAO<p>In harmony with our work on Open Recognition, we’ve developed a series of badges based on the <a href="https://theopenorganization.org/definition/open-organization-definition/">Open Org Project’s five characteristics</a>. As an Open Org Ambassador for a number of years, I’ve helped create the definition and principles of openness alongside others in the community. I’m pleased that we can now recognise people who have these characteristics!</p><p>We reworked the Open Org Definition to include “I” statements that allow Sport England, and indeed anyone else, to assess themselves in Transparency, Inclusivity, Adaptability, Collaboration and Community.</p>Our “I” statements for the transparency characteristic<p>With multiple “I” statements, people can choose their own adventure. People can choose the statement most relevant to them and then provide evidence to earn the badge. For example, while one person might have published a blog post another might have turned on default sharing, but these activities can earn a&nbsp;badge.</p><p>In our workshops and Open Working sessions, we support people looking to earn these badges with activities and advice on how they can do&nbsp;so.</p> Steps in Open&nbsp;Working <p>We know that working openly is not a binary thing. We are more or less open depending on our context and situation. However, we also know that working openly has been shown to have benefits for organisations and society as a whole, as well as the individuals who choose to work&nbsp;openly.</p><p>Learning to work more openly is a process. There are a variety of themes to understand and find tactics for. We developed the free email course “<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">What We Talk About When We Talk About Open</a>” to serve as an introduction.</p>First Steps in working openly&nbsp;badges<p>We know it takes time to be comfortable working openly, so we’ve created badge pathways to help people take their first steps and then take a few more. The “<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/badges/open-working-badges/">First Steps in Open Working</a>” pathway recognises people who are able to show that they have demonstrated one of the principles of a characteristic in accordance with the Open Organization Definition.

				 <p>Systems Integration Solutions&nbsp;is a Lithuania-based company specializing in blockchain technical solutions in information technology.</p>
<p>Their team is part of the eSSIF-Lab project and participated in Completing the Framework Open Call, which has helped them to develop their open-source SSI solution.</p>
<p>We’ve had the pleasure of interviewing&nbsp;Deividas Umbrasas, project manager at Systems Integration Solutions where he’s leading a team to build an interoperable, decentralized self-sovereign identity framework.</p>
<p>In this interview, he explained to us what Systems Integration Solutions is about, what are their goals for the middle and long time and give us a piece of advice about what other companies like his should do to get a public funding opportunity.</p>
 1. Introduce yourself and your company, and explain what makes you different. 
<p>First and foremost, Systems Integration Solutions would like to thank eSSIF-Lab for the invitation to the interview; it was an incredible journey in which we had to overcome many challenges in order to bring our self-sovereign – decentralized identity product package CorpoSign DID to fruition. I would like to express my gratitude to our amazing team, our CEO Rišardas Bedulskis, our lead software developer Dainius Preimantas, and our application developer Augis Bražiūnas, without them it would never have happened.</p>
<p>To return to the subject at hand, my name is Deividas Umbrasas, and I work as a project manager at Systems Integration Solutions, LLC, a Lithuania-based company specializing in blockchain technical solutions in information technology. I have worn several hats in my career, but blockchain technology sparked my attention in 2017. It all started with trading cryptocurrencies, which inspired my curiosity in blockchain technology, and now I am leading a team to build an interoperable, decentralized self-sovereign identity framework on European Blockchain Service Infrastructure.</p>
<p>At Systems Integration Solutions, we are working with European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) to create a Self-Sovereign identity and European Identification Framework with the product CorpoSign DID. Being the first one to launch an EBSI node in Lithuania and one of the first in the EU to be fully conformant with EBSI, W3C, and the first to offer Self-Issued OpenID v2 – CorpoSign DID main advantage lies in the streamlined process of simultaneous login, authentication, and KYC (know your customer) using trust anchor’s power of attorney verifiable credentials.</p>
 2. What services or products do you offer? 
<p>Everything began with the development of an open-source SSI solution, made possible by eSSIF-Lab CFOC funding. We started in the e-Government domain by enabling government and business entities to participate in the cross-border logistics ecosystem, by authorizing their representatives to conduct relevant acts on their behalf, using an ecosystem-specific scheme (business or government power of attorney).</p>
<p>As there was a clear need for new authorization methods, we have implemented them into our eCMR (<a href="https://sis.lt/projects/diginno-proto">https://sis.lt/projects/diginno-proto</a>). By scanning a QR code with a mobile application, a user can verify or authorize data on behalf of the organization, or just log in. But as we neared completion of this project, we realized that we had produced the majority of tools and components necessary to launch our Software as a Service or White label offerings.</p>
<p>Currently, our novel technology enables CorpoSign users to exchange any sort of data and decide how their data is used and processed, without the need for any login credentials. CorpoSign’s decentralized identity makes it a self-sovereign, privacy-protecting, and user-friendly application that anybody can use and benefit from, to easily communicate any form of data utilizing interoperable DID and SSI solutions; we specialize in Natural, Legal Persons IDs &amp; Diplomas.</p>
<p>Shortly, we offer the issuance of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) via our custom client panels or APIs, the storage of VCs in our mobile application wallet, and the sharing and verification of Verifiable Presentations (VP) via custom or universal verifiers and SDKs. We can also launch public/private blockchains with white-label solutions if needed.</p>
<p>Please view our brief product demonstration at&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/fIo%20Gdz80K8">https://youtu.be/fIo Gdz80K8</a></p>
 3. What milestones have you achieved so far since your project launch? 
<p>In just seven months, we have accomplished things we never imagined we would attain. With the assistance of the eSSIF-Lab community, we have finalized our business case and are on the verge of completely commercializing CorpoSign DID as a SaaS or White label service. We are prepared to adapt this technology to provide streamlined data exchange, KYC, authorization, and SDK logins.</p>
<p>Regarding business potential, we have begun discussions with local institutions and schools about adopting the SSI solution for diplomas and student identification cards. In addition, we are in discussion with government entities to implement SSI for natural and legal persons in cross-border solutions. We are already in discussions with our local AML KYC providers to join forces for a better future, as we are continually pondering simpler KYC procedures.</p>
<p>Also, in our eSSIF-Lab CFOC project CorpoSign DID (also known as eSSIF4Logistics), we have released and described the majority of our APIs and infrastructure decisions to contribute to the standardization and global interoperability (<a href="https://cutt.ly/sBXsHys">https://cutt.ly/sBXsHys</a>), as we are ardent supporters of both W3C and EBSI standards for SSI and DIDs. We take this matter seriously; so, we have also made an envisioned interoperability table with most of the eSSIF-Lab participants.</p>
 4. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to the eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>The purpose of the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) was to enable individuals to control their digital identities and authenticate securely to government and business websites. We knew we were at the right place at the right time since both of our objectives were to drastically lower the expenses of verification; automate notarization, enhance data integrity and security by integrating digital audit trails, and more.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>As previously said, because eSSIF-Lab saw the possibility from the same perspective as we do, they encouraged us to commercialize our contribution to SSI solutions, aided in the development of a detailed business case and increased the exposure of our work. In addition to the financing, consultations, and awareness, the engagement and collaboration with other eSSIF-Lab subgrantees, as well as the consortium’s assistance, were the key benefits. We hope to continue on this adventure together.</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  5. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future? 
<p>Our mid-term objective is to promote Verifiable credentials and decentralized identities, which will enable governments to easily link natural persons to organizations and migrate to a fully digital world, therefore enhancing both export market access and border security. We anticipate that data-sharing technologies will be globally interoperable in the near future.</p>
<p>Some may wonder why and how this is possible. Verifiable credentials have the unique scalability attribute of issuer and verifier separation. Issuers can go fully digital at any time without requiring other parties to invest in EDI and API connections or register on hubs. At any time, verifiers can continue using paper-based methods or switch to automated data extraction and verification.</p>
<p>Regarding the future, we are huge fans of Unece.org’s recently published whitepaper, “eDATA Verifiable Credentials for Cross-Border Trade”, which asserts that World Wide Web Consortiums (W3C) DID approaches for data sharing, are the only way to accomplish worldwide interoperability at now. Currently, we are investigating how to completely embrace our technology for all whitepaper-mentioned use cases, such as mitigating compliance concerns, tampered papers, product counterfeits, illicit trade and items, and easing trade financing, while maintaining scalable and user-friendly technology.</p>
<p>We recognize that the majority of this will be a formidable obstacle, but we are prepared to face it in the hopes that we are not the only ones who desire global interoperability.</p>
 6. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
<p>I am yet to raise a substantial amount of money, so I might be not the one to give this kind of advice. Nobody can answer this question for sure, however, let me try.</p>
<p>Always be searching, learning, and improving, there are opportunities everywhere, you just might be at the wrong place, so do not waver if something went wrong. If your application was rejected – insist to give honest feedback (request to give reviewer’s comments), even if it will hurt you.</p>
<p>Hire a company, that knows how to prepare and submit for public funding or investment, and make sure they have a substantial portfolio.</p>
<p>I would also add that you should never stop seeking like-minded people, since we are stronger in numbers, and the most common reason for public funding rejection is a lack of expertise or project execution plan (wrong program, idea, or budget problems).</p>
<p>Lastly, ask whether you may resubmit during the next grant period and how your application might be improved. Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Passkeys are designed to replace passwords and allow seamless logins for consumers across devices and platforms. Makes online purchases easier for consumers, removes checkout friction for merchants.</p>



<p>SAN JOSE, Calif.,&nbsp;Oct. 24, 2022&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — Today, PayPal announced it is adding passkeys as an easy and secure log in method for PayPal accounts. Passkeys are a new industry standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium that replace passwords with cryptographic key pairs, offering customers a simple and secure way to log in to PayPal based on technology that is resistant to phishing and designed so that there is&nbsp;no shared passkey data between platforms. The new PayPal log in option will first be available to iPhone, iPad, or Mac users on PayPal.com and will expand to additional platforms as those platforms add support for passkeys.</p>



PayPal introduces passkeys as an easy and secure log in method for PayPal accounts.



<p>A founding member of the FIDO Alliance, PayPal is one of the first financial services companies to make passkeys widely available to its users. This cutting-edge security standard is significant as passkeys address one of the biggest security problems on the web, which is the weakness of password authentication. Over 2.6 billion records were hacked in 2017 and of these hacks, 81% are estimated to have been caused by password stealing and guessing1. Many consumers recycle passwords across online services, which can not only be cumbersome but can also lead consumers to reuse the same, potentially vulnerable passwords across services. Passkeys are designed to replace passwords for an even more seamless and secure login experience with PayPal.</p>



<p>Passkeys will also help more consumers complete their purchases with PayPal – once PayPal users create a passkey, they won’t have to remember their password, allowing them to check out with greater ease. According to a recent survey of U.S. consumers, 44% of consumers have abandoned an online purchase because they forgot a password.2</p>



<p>“Launching passkeys for PayPal is foundational to our commitment to offering our customers safe, secure and easy ways to access and manage their daily financial lives,” said&nbsp;Doug Bland, SVP and GM, Head of Consumer, PayPal. “We are excited to provide our customers a more seamless checkout experience that eliminates the risks of weak and reused credentials and removes the frustration of remembering a password. We are making it easier for customers to shop online.”</p>



<p>How to Create a PayPal Passkey</p>



<p>Creating and using a passkey with PayPal is a quick and easy process on an Apple device. Once created, passkeys are synced with iCloud Keychain, ensuring a strong, private relationship between a customer and their device, and an easy sign-in experience for PayPal users with devices running iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, or macOS&nbsp;Ventura.</p>



  Once existing customers log in to PayPal with a browser on desktop or mobile web using their existing PayPal credentials such as a username and password, they will have the option to “Create a passkey.”  Customers will then be prompted to authenticate with Apple Face ID or Touch ID. Then the passkey will be automatically created, and next time PayPal customers log in, they won’t need to use or manage a password again.  



<p>PayPal Passkeys Can Be Used to Log In on Any Device</p>



<p>If they have devices that don’t support passkeys yet, users can still use an iPhone to log in with a PayPal passkey. Users simply scan the QR code that will appear after they enter their PayPal User ID.</p>



<p>PayPal passkeys will start rolling out today to customers in the U.S.. PayPal passkeys will become available in additional countries early in 2023, and on additional technology platforms as they add support for passkeys.</p>



<p>About PayPal</p>



<p>PayPal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution for more than 20 years. By leveraging technology to make financial services and commerce more convenient, affordable, and secure, the PayPal platform is empowering more than 429 million consumers and merchants in more than 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.

<p>The OpenC2 Architecture Specification describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Architecture Specification Version 1.0 from the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyber defense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.</p>



<p>The OpenC2 Architecture Specification describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2 to define a common understanding of the messages and interactions for all bindings and serializations.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

 Exploiting the potential of the e-ID ecosystem 
<p>In chemistry, a reaction can be accelerated by adding a substance called a catalyst. The catalyst reduces the activation energy required for the reaction, which can then be sped up.</p>
<p>The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction can be considered the analogy to the introduction of the trust infrastructure and the government-issued verifiable ID card – the e-ID – into the ecosystem of Swiss society and economy. In our view, it can also be seen as a «response booster» to enhance the performance of economic growth in an increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>In June 2022, the Federal Council opened the consultation on the new e-ID (<a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-89515.html">media release</a>). Its main difference from the previous one is the following three aspects:</p>
 
 The federal government is responsible for issuing the e-ID and operates the e-ID infrastructure. 
 Data protection plays a central role. 
 The e-ID serves as the cornerstone of an ecosystem of digital credentials that supports the issuance and use of government and private digital credentials of all kinds (see also the das digitalswitzerland <a href="https://digitalswitzerland.com/building-a-swiss-digital-trust-ecosystem/">white paper</a>, in which DIDAS was heavily involved). 
 
<p>This ecosystem has great potential in terms of digitization in Switzerland and will strongly influence the way we handle personal data and consume digital services and products in the future.</p>
 Making the e-ID ecosystem tangible with a real application 
<p>To make this ecosystem tangible, three members of DIDAS (SwissSign, cardossier and Adnovum) have built a mini-ecosystem as a PoC in collaboration with the canton of Aargau. This exemplary ecosystem consists of three use cases that build on each other and shed light on the issuance and use of digital credentials in the form of SSI-Verifiable Credentials (VC).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use case 1 – Issuing a basic identity or basic ID: In the first use case, users log in to the SwissID portal with their productive SwissID login. On the portal, users are visually guided – from the installation of a suitable wallet to the issuance and storage of the basic ID as a verifiable credential on the smartphone.</p>
<p>Use case 2 – Issuing a certificate of residence in the eGov portal: With the basic ID created in the first step, the user logs in to the eGov portal of the Canton of Aargau. The login is done by SSI and requires e-mail, last name and first name from the basic ID. The other data of the basic ID is not disclosed. The eGov portal can trust the data of the basic ID and verify it. The data is used to load a residential address for the person from the system. The user can then store the residential address as a verifiable credential in his or her mobile wallet. Upon completion of use case 2, the user has a basic ID and the residential address is stored in his or her wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use case 3 – Initiating a provisional traffic authorization for a vehicle: The registration of a car involves many players such as the policyholder, the insurance company, the garage and, of course, the road traffic authority (StVA). In addition, there are many formalities associated with it. The goal of this use case is to facilitate the registration of a vehicle by providing the cardossier platform with the identity and certificate of residence of the policyholder as verifiable credentials. cardossier then automatically carries out the further registration steps together with the relevant insurance company and the road traffic authority. In the process, the insurance company and the road traffic authority always receive the same and correct address information.</p>
      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By implementing the mini-ecosystem and intensively testing the three use cases, stakeholders gained valuable insights into user interaction, governance, and technology. However, the initiative has primarily demonstrated how an ecosystem of digital credentials can function and bring sustainable added value to data protection and digitization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Expanding the scope of exploration 
<p>Similar to these three use cases, there are endless opportunities to build value-added digital services and products based on the e-ID ecosystem. However, they require an understanding of participation in an ecosystem with possibly distributed benefits versus existing centralized models, i.e. ecosystems characterized by the control of a value stream or the unique positioning of one or more intermediaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog article was written by Stéphane Mingot and Daniel Säuberli. We look forward to your comments and to continuing the dialogue around the topic.</p>

 Consultation for BGEID 
<p>The Federal Council <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-89515.html">opened</a> consultation for the Federal Law on Electronic Proof of Identity and Other Electronic Evidence (BGEID) on June 29, 2022.</p>
<p>As with previous discussion <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/de/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf.download.pdf/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id-d.pdf">paper</a> “Target Image E-ID” from 2021, our members have taken a close look at both the preliminary draft of the federal law and the explanatory report.&nbsp; Our extensive commentary and observations has been submitted to Federal Council and the FDJP.</p>
 Summary of the Position Paper 
<p>The preliminary <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/de/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/vorentw.pdf">draft</a> of the federal law contains the much needed legal foundations, which are formulated in a fairly open manner and is therefore considered by our members to be very good. We are convinced that the proposal for the e-ID law represents a solid basis and sets the framework for a promising trust infrastructure in which a state-issued e-ID represents the core element. We welcome the creation of a legal framework for this trust infrastructure.</p>
<p>In ecosystems of Verifiable Credentials, the state can thus assume the role of enabler and pursue the goal of creating an attractive environment for a wide range of applications. However, a viable ecosystem of Verifiable Credentials can only be successfully designed, piloted and implemented together with the issuers, verifiers and holders of&nbsp; Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>We also recommend that the terms used in the ecosystem be defined uniformly and in line with international standards.</p>
<p>In the context of wider Verifiable Credentials, it is essential to define uniform standards as well as to allow for differences in sectoral governance in the ecosystem. For example, the same attributes should always be used for a residence confirmation, while additional attributes could be used in different sectors.</p>
<p>DIDAS looks forward to the next steps and recommends a priority treatment in the Federal Council. Furthermore, we recommend pushing for technical proof of concepts and minimal viable products (MVPs) involving all stakeholders and civil society in order to make the best use of the planned implementation timeline for the political decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Highlighting the potential to create Metaverse environment’s for a variety of niche and vertical industry requirements, <a href="https://www.avantisworld.com/">Avanti’s World</a> from Avantis Education boasts the first for Education. 
<p>Styled and structured as a theme park Avanti’s World is split into lands, with various zones and learning scenes for students to explore independently. Every learning scene provides a fully immersive experience where students can discover, investigate and research as if they were there in person.</p>
<p>Take your students to places you would never imagine. From the moon, to inside a plant cell, Avanti’s World lets you explore the impossible, all from the safety of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.classvr.com/">ClassVR headset</a>&nbsp;or web browser.</p>
<p>Each virtual reality land comes with a comprehensive set of educational resources to ensure you’re getting the most out of every lesson. Each learning zone and scene incorporates detailed subject information, 3D AR models and 360 images and videos to provide context to the student before exploration begins.</p>
<p>From VR content to engaging curriculum resources, Avanti’s World can be accessed via a secure website to give students everything they need to learn about a topic in the classroom or even remotely.</p>
 ESMS – Pioneering&nbsp;Experiential Learning 
<p>Pioneering Scottish schools are harnessing this technology to transform how they deliver 21st century Education</p>
<p>This includes <a href="https://www.esms.org.uk/">ESMS</a>, where <a href="https://twitter.com/MrLux4DMoore">Mr Simon Luxford-Moore</a>, Head of eLearning, has a deep passion for teaching and importantly, for modernizing it to deliver the best learning experience for students.&nbsp;He was understandably recognised as one of the <a href="https://www.esms.org.uk/news/head-elearning-recognised-edtech-50-list-2020">TES Edtech 50 leaders</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>Mr Luxford-Moore explained how this adds a new category of learning modes. There is visual, auditory and kinaesthetic, and Simon defines ‘Experiential’ as a fourth, with quite profound implications and benefits for teaching.</p>
<p>He is passionate about inclusive learning, where if you design teaching to accommodate a neuro-diverse audience the minority of whom may have the most difficulties, from physical to mental challenges, it will be all encompassing, beneficial to all the students. VR offers a mode of engagement that addresses these challenges and removes barriers to learning in a way that traditional media cannot.</p>
<p>An example of an experiential lesson was a virtual tour of the Mecca pilgrimage, where students participated via VR in the Hajj, something that no non-Muslim can do. This is an excellent and simple example of fostering cultural and religious appreciation and understanding. The students also learned about rainforests through a VR tour and as one young pupil described it enables an experience “beyond the rectangle of a picture”.</p>
 Harnessing the Creator Economy 
<p>Simon reviewed a number of potential VR solutions for the school, settling on ClassVR because of one critical feature – the ability to create and upload one’s own content. Others could only make use of content pre-built by the supplier.</p>
<p>This is the key to unlock Scotland’s digital education future. Using advanced tools like Blender ClassVR can create sophisticated virtual tour content for schools, and being UK-based have been very responsive to Mr Luxford-Moore’s requirements, such as creating a castle siege scenario, even endorsing the flags with the school logo, but critically he can also create his own using simple 360 camera devices and enhancing it with tools like <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/">ThingLink</a>.</p>
<p>For example he used this approach to create a virtual tour of New Lanark, closed to the public due to the pandemic, and has even shared tours of their own school, a historic Victorian building. They also act as a hub centre, where other schools who don’t have the technology can visit and make use of it.</p>
<p>The two biggest trends of the technology industry for the 21st century are ‘the Metaverse’ and the ‘Creator Economy’, an evolution of the Internet to a wholly immersive virtual world combined with the tools that enable everyone to create the experiences within it.</p>
<p>Scotland’s ambition to be a world-leading digital nation lies in harnessing these trends to transform our Education system, where schoolchildren are empowered to create learning content shared with other students, using the tools and technologies central to the future of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Critically it breaks down the barriers between public and private schools, creating a single playing field where investments and learning by one school is contributed to a shared pool from which all can benefit.</p>
 Forfar Academy 
<p>Another keynote exemplar is&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/an/forfaracademy/">Forfar Academy</a>, utilizing the technologies to involve students in building skills that will have huge value in the most modern of workplaces.</p>
<p>Therefore there are multiple benefits to this approach. It’s not only pioneering a state of the art learning approach for students, but it’s achieving what the Scottish Government’s overall goal is for their digital strategy: To put Scotland at the very forefront of technology in global terms.</p>
<p>As they highlight in their tweets below Forfar are leveraging the technology to expose students to knowledge about technology in new ways and crucially, engaging them into scenarios that have massive commercialization potential, such as building virtual tourism experiences or applying the technology in a business setting like a factory production facility.</p>
<p>This will equip them with skills and knowledge of immense value to Scottish businesses.</p>

 Webinar: Into the Eduverse – Challenges and Opportunities 
<p>To learn more about the detail of these technologies and how to apply them in modern Education settings, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnmSiAXc5Jw">this webinar</a>, where&nbsp;Stephen Reid from Microsoft, Ian Stuart from Avantis Education and educators from around the world discuss the challenges and opportunities around the Eduverse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stephen Reid, the first speaker, is from Microsoft and his expertise is in technology and game-based learning. He has used about 140 games to help children learn through gaming.</p>
<p>According to Stephen there are three pillars of game-based learning. The first pillar is an explicit curriculum through which children can have access to science, art, geography, history etc. The second pillar is social and emotional learning which helps children to develop their capacity as human beings. The third pillar is career readiness which helps children to explore their career options.</p>
<p>By using game-based learning children are taught in school important topics like gender equality, refugee crisis, climate change, civil rights etc. There are two types of curriculum for children in school. The first one is an explicit curriculum which must be taught by the teachers and they have to assess the teaching at the end of year of school. The other one is an implicit curriculum which teachers are not bound to teach the children but if they teach these curriculum, it will contribute to developing the moral of children.</p>
<p>In Scotland Stephen was involved in the Pave Project. It was an alternative vocational education program for young offenders. At this program the teachers used digital platforms like Minecraft to teach the children about various topics. Minecraft is a virtual game-based learning platform that promotes creativity, collaboration and problem solving in an immersive digital environment. Game-based learning is a blessing for children from working class families.</p>
<p>Due to their financial restraint, they cannot afford to often go to the beach, hills or the zoo. Through these virtual games they can experience what it feels like to go to these places without actually being there. Thus, by using game-based learning educators bring abstract concepts to life. Educators also teach children emotional vocabulary for writing.</p>
<p>Stephen was also involved in another project named the 100,000 trees project in France. The purpose of this project was to teach children the importance of trees in the environment, to teach them how to maintain and plant trees to reduce global warming and climate change.</p>
<p>They were taught about biodiversity and interaction between humans and plants. At this program the educators created fake scenarios to help children see the wider picture then they observed their reactions and make them feel what it is like to be in that situation.</p>
<p>For example, to teach children the concept of refugee crisis, educators created fake BBC reports where they wrote that their country is under invasion and they have to flee their houses and have shelter in some other countries. Then they let the children find a solution to this crisis. By using this method children learned empathy and critical analysis of a crisis.</p>
<p>According to Stephen, because of the current systematic pressure in the grading system, children are not taught empathy and analysis and for this they often cannot understand the gravity of a crisis. When they will feel empathy, they will learn about the concepts themselves.</p>
<p>By using Metaverse classroom educators have seen drastic change in the teaching system. Children learn more efficiently through these digital platforms and most important is they are really interested to learn about new concepts.</p>
<p>The Metaverse permits an immersive experience into the digital classroom environment where students will be able to interact with the learning content. Thus, it provides users with an empowered learning experience. The experiences in the metaverse space are limited only by one’s imagination.</p>
<p>This digital platform has been recently used in Korea. By using these digital platforms educators make the children problem solvers and creators for real world problems. They are also triggered through empathy to believe in that problem and find an effective solution and will break the barrier.</p>
<p>To make the education system effective the teachers training colleges and organization should be monitored and the educators must be experts in Metaverse education. Educators can collectively change the education system and enhance learning by using Metaverse education.</p>

 Speaking on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltoc2O33z_0">The 8th Wall podcast</a> Tom Emrich (<a href="https://twitter.com/tomemrich">Twitter</a>) shares his views on the key Augmented Reality trends for 2022. 
 Kicking off the talk Tom describes 2022 as being a peak year for the Metaverse, the next iteration of the Internet that will be achieved through the unified convergence of the Blockchain, IoT, AR / VR and AI. 
<p>This peak has been characterized through many investments into the sector and a realization of the potential by corporate brands.</p>
 AR Hardware 
<p>From 4m:50s Tom begins to look at the individual trend of AR hardware, beginning with the smartphone.&nbsp;Due to advancements in chips, displays, cameras, WiFi speed increases and massive changes in form factors such as the Samsung Fold, 2022 has seen a major leap forward for the role the phone will play in AR.</p>
<p>Another key trend he sees is glasses and headsets, highlighting the important point that this will further emphasize of the role of the smartphone not diminish it, such as the fact glasses will plug in to phones for AR features, to offload the compute requirements to the phone.</p>
<p>Tom describes this as “connected eye-wear”, showcasing an example of the <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/application/xr-vr-ar/snapdragon-xr1-platform">Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1</a>.</p>
<p>At 9m:25s he focuses on mixed reality headsets that enable both VR and <a href="https://uploadvr.com/lynx-r1-through-the-lens-view/">video passthrough AR</a>, highlighting important industry developments such as Meta updating the Quest 2 with an <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/">experimental API</a> for mixed reality mode. Tom expects these headsets to target the upper end of the consumer market, for living room not outdoor experiences.</p>
 WiFi 6 
<p>From 12m:10s Tom moves on to infrastructure, stating that connectivity is essential to AR experiences, with the growing adoption of 5G being a major shift forward, adding that a critical dimension of this is activation of the ‘<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/c-band">C-Band</a>‘ frequency. He expects early roll out of this in 2022 expanding into nationwide coverage through 2023.</p>
<p>Another major evolution is the opening of a sixth gigahertz band for Wifi, ‘<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work">Wifi 6</a>‘, the biggest spectrum addition since 1989, for which you will need devices that support it. This will greatly improve speed and latency, important for AR, and enable new modes of device interconnectivity in the home for example.</p>
 Platforms and Tools 
<p>At 14m:50s begins to look at software and the web, in particular the role of the browser in AR/VR.</p>
<p>Tom highlights the success of The 8th Wall in this scenario, where over 50,000 web apps have been created, with over 1,000 being experiences for top brands. To learn more check out <a href="https://www.8thwall.com/discover">8thwall.com/discover</a>.</p>
<p>He sees 2022 as being a big year for accelerating the ‘<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-the-spatial-web-bb8127f9ac45">Spatial Web</a>‘, with Web AR and Web VR in high demand, for a number of reasons including the Metaverse centred around the browser, where Tom anticipates developments that make browsers more able to discover and interact with immersive content.</p>
<p>The second platform trend he talks about from 18m:05s is the increasing sophistication of more complex and contextual AR experiences, unlocked through advanced tools being made available to developers, citing an example of Snap enabling the <a href="https://eng.snap.com/life-with-ar-landmarkers">creation of custom landmarkers</a>&nbsp;with LiDAR scanners.</p>
<p>From 19m:35s he moves on to the last of the platform trends, a focus on creators and developers and how they can be empowered to succeed as AR entrepreneurs, via ideas such as matchmaking for example.</p>
 Consumer Solutions 
<p>At 20m:47s Tom begins the final trend section of consumer solutions, encompassing major markets such as advertising, often one of the first industries to harness new tech trends like mobile and social and now the Metaverse.</p>
<p>He sees a number of brands intelligently using the technology to achieve large scale web engagements that drive sales, with key advanced being display ads that can be better personalized to users through AR.</p>
<p>Tom then looks at QR codes at 24m:05s, describing how they tie in to this trend. For example Pepsi presented QR codes during the Superbowl which led to an AR portal featuring The Weekend. VW and Amazon collaborated to send out boxes with a QR code that led to an AR experience. He expects this approach to become ubiquitous and always on.</p>
<p>From 27m:00s Tom then says that in the same way users will expect AR experiences tied to things they’ll expect the same for places, with a key motivation being to encourage people to return to the outdoors following Covid, such as parks, stadiums and retail spaces, aka <a href="https://metaverse.digital/augmented-reality-metaverse/">The Real World Metaverse</a>.</p>
<p>This is ‘Location Based Entertainment’, an AR experience that requires attendance at a specific place, with an example provided of <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/introducing-dreamground-powerful-combination-samsung-technology-augmented-reality/">Samsung’s Dreamground</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 E-Commerce 
<p>From 29m:15s Tom explores the relationship of AR to e-commerce, where he believes it will evolve from one-off novelty features such as virtual try-on, to becoming a foundational pillar for all retailers. One example of this the development of API integrations with their e-commerce systems, such as CMS and ERP applications.</p>
<p>He cites a keynote case study of <a href="https://www.8thwall.com/blog/post/52534792519/saatchi-art-launches-worlds-largest-webar-deployment-letting-customers-view-over-1-million-works-of-art-in-their-home">Saatchi art</a>, and how they are utilizing “View in a Room” WebAR to allow customers to view over a million works of art in their home before buying online. This resulted in consumers who used the WebAR feature were four times more likely to purchase and purchased 17% more than those who did not.</p>
 Digital Doubles and Virtual Goods 
<p>Tom concludes the webinar with two last topics: Digital Identity and avatars, your ‘Digital Double’, and digital twinning, mapping reality to it’s virtual equivalent.</p>
<p>He highlights how user profiles are evolving from a simple personal picture through the use of NFTs and new ventures like <a href="https://metaverse.digital/ready-player-me-raises-13m/">Ready Player Me</a>, which enable the portability of profiles across multiple virtual world environments.</p>
<p>An example of digital twinning he provides is how Gucci is enabling the creation of ‘virtual goods’, the online equivalent of their offline products. Tom identifies a super hot trend of the intersection of NFTs and AR to accelerate this trend.</p>

 In a <a href="https://metaverse.digital/augmented-reality-metaverse/">previous blog</a> John Hanke, creator of the Pokemon Go app, defines the ‘Real World Metaverse’, a concept of enhancing reality through overlaying it with Augmented Reality features. 
 These can be applied in a practical way to boost success for Scottish businesses. Tourism is a great example. 
<p>Enhancing the experience with these types of exciting innovations will draw in even greater visitor numbers and continue the massive economic success of this industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/tourist-attractions-are-being-transformed-by-immersive-experiences-some-lessons-from-scotland-110860">This Conversation article</a> comments on the details of this economic success and the critical role immersive experiences can play in facilitating this boost.</p>
<p>Simple examples include&nbsp;AR tourism guides, such as this one for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_RppvB4rDo">Inverness Castle</a>, and for <a href="https://thelochsidepress.com/2019/04/19/augmented-reality-is-a-world-first-for-tourist-guide/">Loch Lomond</a> they inserted ‘Zapcodes’ into the local guide magazine, to trigger AR links that enhance the printed word with a virtual experience. You can <a href="https://www.scotsmagazine.com/articles/discover-fife-augmented-reality/">discover Fife</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FOSIT_cMCk">discover the Highlands via AR</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another great example is described in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19241367.castle-first-scottish-landmark-sign-app-tours/">this recent news</a>, about Blair Castle adopting the <a href="https://about.smartify.org/">Smartify</a> app. Via easy-to-use interfaces and well designed technology available as a native and web app, the Smartify guide allows visitors to follow their own interests and curated tours, with additional features such as e-commerce, targeted push notifications and donations.</p>
<p>Other Scottish venues adopting Smartify include the National Galleries of Scotland. The Smartify <a href="https://about.smartify.org/case-studies/national-galleries-of-scotland-ray-harryhausen-exhibition">case study</a> explains how the venue employed the app for their <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/ray-harryhausen-titan-cinema-virtual-exhibition-experience">Ray Harryhausen exhibition</a>, to offer visitors a fun (and COVID-safe) experience on site, as well as access from home.</p>
 Virtual Treasure Hunts 
<p>As we consider larger Pokemon Go-type Real World Metaverse strategies, for more advanced and engaging experience the technology can be combined with features like ‘Gamification’, to enable super fun activities like Virtual Treasure Hunts. As the Conversation article highlights:</p>
<p>“It’s the sort of immersive experience that many tourist attractions want to have these days. At the <a href="http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk/">Burns Birthplace Museum</a>&nbsp;in Ayrshire, dedicated to Robert Burns, visitors can download an app aimed at children called the&nbsp;<a href="https://digit.fyi/augmented-reality-scottish-attractions/">Mighty Mission Trail</a>. It sends them on a virtual treasure hunt throughout the site and surroundings.”</p>
<p>This highlights the other types of technologies that can be called into play. For example <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/14/google-maps-gaming-platform-expands-after-a-year-of-success-stories/">Google Maps Gaming</a> provides a capability for making more use of location data in mobile games, the Pokemon Go type, that can ‘can unlock augmented reality and social gameplay, can increase engagement and retention, and can help bring new life to games that were originally designed without a location component.’</p>
<p>This is complimented by their general capabilities for improving navigation, such as <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/02/11/google-maps-ar-navigation/">AR Navigation</a> and harnessing AI for <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/using-global-localization-to-improve.html">Global Navigation</a>, helping you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWbY5jdJnHg">better navigate cities</a>.</p>
<p>These various innovations provide the building blocks for creating any type of highly immersive, highly engaging experience, that better enables visitors to explore and enjoy attractions, with the ability to ‘gamify’ the experience of particular value for those looking to attract children and young families.</p>
 Whereverly 
<p>An example of a Scottish innovator in this field is&nbsp;<a href="https://whereverly.com/">Whereverly</a>. They develop apps and web platforms that make journeys memorable and allow users to embrace local culture through music, song and stories, whilst discovering hidden gems.</p>
<p>The apps blend together local storytelling with engaging interactivity, from songs to driving routes, with projects delivered for the&nbsp;<a href="https://whereverly.com/north-coast-500/">North Coast 500</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://whereverly.com/explore-stirling/">Explore Stirling</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://whereverly.com/highland-discovery/">Highland Discovery</a>.</p>
<p>Recently they launched&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/whereverly/status/1416062049889685512">Badenoch The Storylands</a>, where users can discover the past through the interactive Augmented Reality reconstructions of Badenoch’s fantastic historic sites.</p>
<p>As part of the last CivTech innovation competition they&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/CivTechScotland/status/1448682642862399490">successfully bid</a>&nbsp;a new solution to&nbsp;to better manage visitors at tourist hotspots, combining&nbsp;IoT&nbsp;data&nbsp;and mobile&nbsp;tech&nbsp;to give public sector&nbsp;rangers access to a live map of remote attractions, improving public safety and engagement.</p>

 Research in Decentralized Identity Yields Confidential Data Storage 


 
 


<p>NEW YORK, Oct. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Self-Sovereign Foundation, a nonprofit focused on equitable solutions for decentralized identity, has unveiled its Self-Sovereign Database. This critically needed software component stores sensitive data in a provably tamper-proof way. We all need to store personal data, and we all know it is not appropriately protected: trade secrets, family pictures, customer information, and healthcare data. Digital identity is not just about passwordless login and a driver’s license — it’s about all data. Because very soon, all data will be verified and credentialed.</p>



<p>The Self-Sovereign Database is a personal, privacy-respecting database management system for storing, searching and retrieving personal data so securely that even the storage provider cannot verify the identity or access the information. The Self-Sovereign Database is the ultimate secret data vault, a database powered by self-sovereign identity and verified credentials where only the individual is in control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This breakthrough technology helps applications quickly achieve decentralization and data immutability without the slowness and expense of blockchain-based solutions while still being redundant, portable, and protected from breaches. The Self-Sovereign Database supports 256-bit AES encryption and optional FIPS security. The Foundation has started beta testing the integration of the Self-Sovereign Database with decentralized identity platforms and service providers and is seeking new partnerships. Currently supporting Microsoft Entra and EBSI, the database is W3C DID standard and interoperable.</p>



<p>About the Self-Sovereign Foundation</p>



<p>The Self-Sovereign Foundation is a nonprofit entity that empowers individuals with self-determination over personal data. The pillars of our Foundation are protecting confidentiality, ensuring accessibility, and equitable participation. Our mission is a future where users decide for themselves what information they share about themselves with different parties to preserve their privacy.

<p>Over the course of 2021 and early 2022, the DIACC worked with a Special Interest Group (SIG) to explore how the integration of Foundational IDs into the digital identity ecosystem could improve identity resolution between silos, introduce new efficiencies in service delivery, and reduce fraud. Members of the SIG included representatives from provincial Vital Statistics agencies and digital identity initiatives, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), representatives from the Canadian financial and insurance sectors, as well as additional participants from the private and public sectors. The SIG members took part in 14 working sessions to explore work streams across various topics including birth records, impacts on service delivery and fraud, and roadmapping.</p>



<p>This report outlines observations, conclusions, and recommendations including a list of 12 proposed initiatives that may be considered as a method to address and resolve some of these challenging issues facing our community today.</p>

It’s not, moderation needs designated time. Schedule at least a half an hour each week to run through your moderation process. Your community will be a lot more engaged for&nbsp;it!</p> 1. Check for new introductions <p>Every community should have a place for people to introduce themselves. Whether a forum thread or an #introduction Slack channel, this space helps community members get to know each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Provide a prompt to help people introduce themselves. In the Keep Badges Weird community, we ask people to tell the community why they’ve joined and a “weird” tidbit or fact. We check for new introductions and reply to people once they’ve written about themselves. The “weird” tidbit provides for some very interesting initial conversations. Oh, and we issue a badge once people have introduced themselves too!</p> 2. Check for new&nbsp;members <p>The introduction thread or channel is also a great place to keep track of new members who have joined the community. Depending on where your community is organised, you might also have the ability to see when people join or sign up. The Keep Badges Weird community is on the <a href="https://www.participate.com/">Participate platform</a>, so moderators can easily see when new folks have joined. We’ve set our notifications to let us&nbsp;know!</p><p>Whenever a new member joins your community, take a moment to reach out and welcome them. We send direct messages and ask people to introduce themselves. We’ve written about how important personal invitations are in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">quick wins to improve participation</a>.</p> 3. Check for comments and&nbsp;shares <p>Discussions and comment threads might be a bit more sporadic then introductions. Check your community forum and channels for any new discussions, questions or comments. If you have ways for people to submit resources or ideas, you’ll want to check those&nbsp;too!</p><p>Use “follow” or “track” functions to allow you to watch discussions so that you don’t miss new messages. People need timely and relevant feedback. It can be disheartening if someone doesn’t receive an answer. Great moderators do their best to make sure that conversations keep&nbsp;moving.</p> 4. Check for event&nbsp;updates <p>A successful community will have regular events and activities. Get into a habit to make sure the community events calendar is up-to-date. Activities grow as communities do! Setting the habit in the beginning means you’ll have updated information when a lot more of it is flowing at you. It seems simple, but outdated links or text often make it impossible for people to take part in&nbsp;events.</p> 5. Post regularly <p>There are a lot of different types of content and one or another might work better for your community. Experiment with various formats and ask people for feedback. Share different kinds of information and share early and often. Make a schedule, though, and post on a regular basis. People will get used to seeing moderator posts, and they’ll know that there is momentum in the community.</p><p>Moderation is both a science and an art. There are practical tactics and processes you can use to increase participation. There are empathetic behaviours need to help community members feel like they belong. Both are essential for building communities.

<p>Kia ora e te whānau<br><br>As signalled in last month’s newsletter,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Submission_OPC-Consultation-on-Biometrics_4-October-2022-1.pdf">DINZ’s submission</a>&nbsp;to<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/news/consultations/use-of-biometric-information-in-aotearoa-new-zealand/">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/assets/New-order/News/Consultations/Privacy-regulation-of-biometrics-in-Aotearoa-New-Zealand.pdf">the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s consultation paper on Biometrics&nbsp;</a>did proceed to plan, and we were grateful to receive OPC’s thanks and acknowledgement of the work put in by our special interest group of DINZ members. Read and note our conclusions as to the adequacy of the Privacy Act in the field of biometrics, the challenge of the limited scope of OPC’s mandate and the need for more structured guidance and targeted compliance before defaulting to all-encompassing legislative intervention – perhaps preemptively.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As biometrics continues to dominate domestic headlines in the context of law enforcement, I am reminded of Ann Cavoukian’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf">7 principles of Privacy by Design</a>, notably Principle 4; ‘Full Functionality — Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum. Privacy by Design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by Design avoids the pretense of false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, demonstrating that it is possible to have both’. Let’s be honest. It’s not always easy to achieve, but if a combination of actions and processes that derive from the 7 principles (or others such as those IPPs in the Privacy Act) can be agreed upon and transparently operated, the right balance can be found. That is what we expectantly hope for as the parties work it out – as I’m confident they will.<br><br>The other great piece of mahi emerging from DINZ over the past month is this&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Inclusive-and-Ethical-Use-of-Digital-Identity-1.pdf">Research and Discussion Paper</a>&nbsp;produced by the leads of the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Uses of Digital Identity working group</a>. Its purpose is to set a baseline from which the real mahi of this member group can build from. The topic area has a range of interwoven themes involving policy, society and culture and the group is keen to target one or more aspects where the development of good practice can positively impact outcomes. If it was easy other groups would have resolved it by now! So please&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Inclusive-and-Ethical-Use-of-Digital-Identity-1.pdf">read the paper</a>&nbsp;and feed back your comments and interest in participating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As with all significant mahi produced in the past year, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">Our Work</a>&nbsp;on our website and browse.<br><br>Lastly, watch out for a slew of Event announcements coming soon. The report that integrates DINZ’s general public and business attitudinal research results into the landscape in which digital identity operates in Aotearoa, is nearly complete. The report and its highlights will be showcased at events planned for later in November.<br><br>Meanwhile members, don’t forget the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2022/10/06/executive-council-nominations-now-open/">annual elections for the Executive Council</a>.

<p>Key Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Standards Put to the Test</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 18 October, 2022 – The OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti">Cyber Threat Intelligence Technical Committee</a> (CTI TC) conducted its first STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 PlugFest, hosted by Peraton. Members of the CTI TC confirmed the multi-vendor interoperability of their CTI tools and verified their compliance with the STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 Interoperability Test Documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2021/06/23/stix-v2-1-and-taxii-v2-1-oasis-standards-are-published/">STIX and TAXII standards</a> are widely used to prevent and defend against cyberattacks by enabling threat intelligence to be analyzed and shared among trusted partners and communities. The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-interoperability">CTI TC Interoperability Subcommittee</a> (SC) helps guide adherence to CTI TC-promulgated standards and interoperability between CTI TC standards-based implementations, while encouraging standards maturity throughout the industry.</p>



<p>“The PlugFest was a collaborative, hybrid experience with both in-person and virtual attendees. It was a successful event, with levels of interoperability achieved among the participants,” said CTI TC Interoperability SC co-chair, Kartikey Desai, of MITRE. “Participants shared ideas about user interfaces and features while planning future opportunities for more efficient data creation and processing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This event brings visibility to the growing list of organizations that support interoperability adoption,” said Marlon Taylor of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS CISA), who co-chairs the Interoperability SC with Desai. “We encourage any organization involved in CTI to collaborate with us and demonstrate their support for STIX and TAXII at future PlugFest events.”</p>



<p>“We have always given great importance to STIX2/TAXII2 interoperability testing and are fortunate to have participated in many PlugFest events over the years, ever since the very first PlugFest in 2018,” said Koji Yamada, Research Manager at Fujitsu System Integration Laboratories LTD. “In this year’s PlugFest, although we passed most interoperability tests, we have identified areas for future improvement. We strongly encourage all software vendors that use STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 standards to participate in future PlugFest interoperability events.”</p>



<p>“Participation in PlugFest events shows vendor commitment to STIX and TAXII interoperability compliance,” said Marlon Taylor. “Standardizing the promotion of STIX and TAXII compliance would ease consumer evaluation of interoperable STIX and TAXII products.”</p>



<p>OASIS and the CTI TC’s Interoperability Subcommittee commends all participants for a successful event and is grateful to Peraton for hosting the PlugFest at their facility outside Washington, DC.</p>



<p>Any organization that is developing STIX 2.1/TAXII 2.1 capabilities is encouraged to get involved. Organizations interested in participating in the OASIS CTI TC Interoperability Subcommittee and future events should contact <a href="mailto:communications@oasis-open.org">communications@oasis-open.org</a>.</p>



<p>About STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1</p>



<p>Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) v2.1 and Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) v2.1 are widely used to prevent and defend against cyberattacks by enabling threat intelligence to be analyzed and shared among trusted partners and communities. The STIX standard defines a JSON-based language for sharing structured threat intelligence in a consistent, machine-readable manner, allowing organizations to better protect against, detect, and respond to cyber threats. STIX v2.1 adds new objects and capabilities, enabling it to better describe the cyber threats we confront today, as well as future-proofing STIX via STIX Extensions. As a result, STIX v2.1 creates a solid and stable foundation for vendors and consumers alike to exchange actionable CTI.</p>



<p>The TAXII standard defines a transport protocol which supports the exchange of STIX data over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). TAXII enables machine-to-machine sharing of CTI by defining an API that supports common sharing models used by industry and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs).</p>

<p>The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada Launches Voilà Verified Program to Spotlight World-Class Vetted Digital Identity Solutions.</p>



<p>Toronto, October 18, 2022 – The <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> (DIACC) has officially launched the Voilà Verified Trustmark Program – the first and only certification program to determine digital identity service compliance with the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-overview/">Pan-Canadian Trust FrameworkTM</a> (PCTF).</p>



<p>A non-profit coalition of over 115 public and private members, the DIACC develops research and opportunities to enable Canada’s confident, safe, and full participation in a global digital economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One size does not fit all when it comes to identity solutions – but ensuring a solution delivers upon a defined duty of care is critical,” says Joni Brennan, president of the DIACC. “With the PCTF, and now with Voilà Verified, there is an opportunity to adopt a framework rooted in trust – and to earn compliance recognition. Voilà Verified identifies those who are ‘walking the walk’ –&nbsp; those who are delivering safe and secure access to the global digital economy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DIACC’s PCTF is a publicly available framework for identity solutions that defines client, customer, and individual duty of care. The Voilà Verified program provides a vetting and assessment opportunity where PCTF-compliant solution vendors can earn a public-facing Trustmark. The result? Spotlight visibility of trustworthy, safe, reliable, and efficient solutions.</p>



<p>“The PCTF being leveraged on a global scale marks a significant opportunity across industries,” says Franklin Garrigues, VP External Ecosystems at <a href="https://clicktime.symantec.com/3RHvB8cGMXspcP51pBTit217VN?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcts.businesswire.com%2Fct%2FCT%3Fid%3Dsmartlink%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.td.com%252Fca%252Fen%252Fpersonal-banking%252F%26esheet%3D52286601%26newsitemid%3D20200915005744%26lan%3Den-US%26anchor%3DTD%2BBank%26index%3D5%26md5%3D372921976ab1c50e42cd675da4f0b96b">TD Bank Group</a>, DIACC Board Vice-Chair. “Voilà Verified is rooted in safety, protection, and reliability. This program enables safe access to the global digital economy with certainty.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voilà Verified presents an opportunity to grow provincial-level investments in digital identity solutions. Provincial governments who have launched identity services can now earn a Trustmark of their own, and provinces that are on the cusp of entering the digital solution market can do so with confidence by seeking vendors with a Voilà Verified Trustmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Going digital is a big step for governments – and now, with Voilà Verified, provincial leaders are empowered to do so with confidence by engaging solution vendors that will protect end-users first and foremost,” says Colleen Boldon, Director, Digital Lab and Digital ID Programs, Public Services and Smart Government, Province of New Brunswick and DIACC Board member.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ruth Puente, Voilà Verified’s Trustmark Verification Program Manager, says a leading component of the program’s development was to ensure its procedures aligned with the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Organization of Standardization</a> (ISO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is inclusive yet diligent in verifying PCTF-compliant solutions. The program was developed in alignment with ISO<a href="https://www.iso.org/benefits-of-standards.html"> standards</a> – and empowers informed decision making in a rapidly growing ecosystem of identity solutions.”</p>



<p>Puente, based in Madrid, Spain, brings international perspective and expertise to the Voilà Verified program with deep experience in internet governance policy and public affairs, trust and privacy innovation, and digital identity frameworks and certification.</p>



<p>“Delivering high-quality service is our priority. Customer protection is our priority. Increasing access to trustworthy solutions is our priority. We have formed teams of international experts to perform assessments and to oversee the process through an impartial lens,” says Puente.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entities who are responsible for <a href="https://diacc.ca/voila-verified-program-public-directory%ef%bf%bc/">assessing</a> PCTF compliance within the Voilà Verified program are known as Accredited Assessors, Readiness Advisors, and Testing Laboratories.</p>

  <p>Geneva, Switzerland, October 2022&nbsp;<br></p><p>After releasing the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) v1.0</a> architecture in July 2022, the Human Colossus Foundation announces the release of Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA). OCA enables “Objectual Integrity”, an essential DDE Principle of the DDE Trust Infrastructure’s Semantic Layer, by providing an interoperable solution for data capture and exchange, agnostic to existing data models and representation formats. The release includes the launch of the <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/">OCA website</a>, which hosts the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/s/HCF-Overlays-Capture-Architecture-OCA-v1.pdf">OCA v1.0 specification</a> and <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/ecosystem/tour.html">reference implementation</a>, and the announcement of the Decentralised Semantics Working Group (DSWG), the formal governing body for further developing the official OCA specification.</p><p>Paul Knowles, a Co-Founder and the Head of the Advisory Council of the Foundation, is the architect of an entirely new data domain, Decentralised Semantics. His conceptual modelling of this new domain led to the invention of OCA, which provides a data harmonisation solution within and across distributed data ecosystems to ensure the objectual integrity of any digital object and its relationships with other objects. OCA facilitates semantic interoperability and privacy-compliant data sharing throughout any DDE-compliant ecosystem, offering a comprehensive solution for defining deterministic metadata, structuring digital objects, and harmonising data payloads.</p><blockquote><p>"OCA is a core utility architecture for capturing the metadata necessary to interpret and preserve the meaning of inputted data. ‘Characters’ provide the essential elements required for written language in the physical world. In the digital world, stored sequences of bytes known as ‘data’ represent these elements. However, without a system of interpretation, data has no inherent morphological, definitional, or contextual meaning. OCA enables this interpretation by providing an architecture to capture the ‘metadata’, sets of data that provide meaning to any stored sequence of bytes. In addition, OCA introduces a comprehensive solution to support data validation, transformation, and presentation requirements throughout a data lifecycle.&nbsp;</p><p>Before co-founding the Human Colossus Foundation, my previous life was as a "data wrangler" in the pharmaceutical industry, repeatedly encountering data aggregation issues when working with supposedly "clean data" supplied by my colleagues in data management. So, after 20 years as a statistical programmer, I took the plunge and transitioned to the sharp end of data capture as a data architect. From that new vantage point, I gained valuable insights into the cause of many of the data aggregation issues I had encountered further upstream, which continued to cost the company millions of dollars daily. I also found that I was in an influential position to improve the company's internal semantic architectural design initiatives.</p><p>So, four years later, after bidding farewell to that esteemed position as a corporate data architect with nothing more than a conceptual draft of a layered architecture for data capture written in the back of my notebook, I'm excited to announce the rollout of OCA as a global solution for data harmonisation at scale. What a journey it has been. I look forward to our continued journey together to take OCA to the next level of technical maturity while helping many of you resolve data harmonisation issues with OCA and the supportive tooling we are developing at the Foundation."</p><p>- Paul Knowles, Co-Founder and the Head of the Advisory Council of the Foundation</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Decentralised Semantics and OCA</p><p>Data Semantics is the study of the meaning and use of data in any digital environment that focuses on how a data object represents a concept or object in the real world. Decentralised Semantics is an emergent domain that provides enhanced data modelling for an evolving data-agile economy comprising distributed data ecosystems where harmonisation between competing standards is essential for data object comprehension in any bilateral exchange.</p><p>This new data domain recognises the reality of standardisation complexities in an ever-evolving digital landscape of peer-to-peer interactions not addressed today; examples of gaps include inaccurate use of data due to its misinterpretation at the point of exchange. In other words, upstream data comprehension erodes without well-defined metadata at the start of the data lifecycle. Therefore, the harmonisation process must occur at the earliest stage of the life cycle, the point of initial data capture, where its contextual meaning is fresh and more manageable than further upstream.&nbsp;</p><p>It is critical to double down on investments in Decentralised Semantics, including supportive standards and tools, because by most estimates, unstructured data accounts for at least 80-90% of the digital data universe and current solutions often disregard the data harmonisation process, leaving no guarantee of the data's objectual integrity throughout a given lifecycle. We invented OCA to offer a comprehensive solution for data harmonisation at the Semantic Layer (Layer 1 in the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack</a>) so that machines and people can precisely understand the intended use of accurate data in the correct context across distributed data ecosystems.</p><p></p><p>Explaining OCA through a Use Case 	</p><p>Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) marks a new paradigm shift in “Objectual Integrity”, with "Overlays" providing the necessary separation of granular tasks to enable seamless semantic interoperability across sectoral and jurisdictional boundaries. An "OCA bundle" consists of a "Capture Base" and "Overlays", which in amalgamation, represent a contextually-rich schema.</p>

<p>This separation of tasks into task-specific objects facilitates the core pillars of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR Guiding Principles</a>, where all objects should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) for machines and people. In addition, the granular separation of semantic “overlays'' enables distributed custodianship of specific objects within a bundle where the responsibility of separate tasks can reside with different actors without compromising the objectual integrity of the overall semantic structure. As a result, actors from various institutions can contribute to defining schemas for complex use cases, supply chains, and data flows supported by multi-stakeholder data governance administrations and frameworks.</p><p>Take Switzerland as an example, a quadrilingual country with German, French, Italian, and Romansh as its national languages and many other minority languages, such as English, becoming increasingly important. The Swiss Constitution Article 70 lets the sovereign cantons define their official language to preserve linguistic harmony in their jurisdiction. The Swiss federal government would enable a collaborative solution to internationalisation by using OCA to separate language-specific overlays from any capture bases and core language-agnostic overlays issued by the federal government. Different cantons will be able to control and maintain their sets of language-specific overlays depending on their primary spoken language. In other words, distributed custodianship of language-specific overlays would enable regional authorities to manage the official translation of any document issued by a national federal government into their region’s official language(s).</p>

<p>A few months ago, we published the findings of our research on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/community-call-digital-ids-rooted-in-justice/" title="">civil society advocacy on digital ID systems across the globe</a>. For this project, we spent a year working with a team of researchers in four countries (Indonesia, Jamaica, Pakistan, and Uganda), looking at how organised civil society actors seek to shape the design, implementation and oversight of digital ID systems, so as to mitigate or eliminate potential harms to vulnerable populations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of our main findings was the fact that, when it comes to digital ID systems, civil society actors have been pushed to work reactively, rather than proactively. We saw that groups were more often pushing for change within problematic proposals and systems, rather than being able to proactively advocate for a system that could meet the needs their communities actually face. In other words, civil society has been grappling with the impact and harms of digital ID systems as they are implemented, and not having the time or space to envision alternative frameworks for identification systems that put people’s needs and wants first. Throughout the research, justice was articulated by these actors as access – to better registration processes and to the services these IDs serve as barriers towards. And while access is crucial, as actors are reacting to material conditions on the ground, our research got us thinking that civil society, especially groups that represent and advocate for the most marginalised populations, could be leading the process of shaping digital ID systems that are rooted in justice for their contexts.</p>



<p>With that in mind, we partnered with <a href="https://www.peoplesguidetotech.com/" title="">A People’s Guide to Tech</a> to develop A Digital ID Handbook for civil society, a resource based on our research and APGT’s wealth of experience in popular education and in translating complex concepts into accessible information. </p>

<p>In the handbook, you will find a primer on digital ID systems, along with activities to support civil society organisations in developing their advocacy strategies for dealing with digital ID implementation and to exercise their ability to visualise what digital ID systems grounded in justice could look like. We hope this resource will be useful to civil society organisations and activists interested in learning more about digital ID and designing their own strategies for addressing these systems.&nbsp;</p>

 From data to assets — gateway to the knowledge economy <p>The upcoming new version 6 of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) is introducing a paradigm shift to the OriginTrail ecosystem and marks the beginning of a new era. Until now, OriginTrail network delivered key enhancements to the world of decentralized data (such as integrity, interoperability and interconnectedness). With the new version, we are making the leap from exchanging data to creating assets from the data. This is possible with features of discoverability, verifiability and ownership of assets on the DKG representing anything in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsCUigu39Hw">physical and digital&nbsp;world</a>.</p><p>The new paradigm enables anyone to create DKG assets and own their connected “real estate” in the global Web3 graph, enabling a plethora of applications previously impossible due to lack of true data ownership primitives on the internet. The new functionality takes nothing away from the original value propositions but rather upgrades them with ownership, the OriginTrail technology and TRAC tokenomics need to be upgraded as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Before jumping into the tokenomics, let’s take a closer look at what the core building blocks — DKG assets — are from the perspective of DKG and how they influence the TRAC tokenomics. Assets consist of 4 components implemented across two network&nbsp;layers:</p>  The DKG layer hosts the asset graph state (1) in semantic form (RDF), identified by a new Web3 primitive — the Uniform Asset Locator (UAL) (2). Similar to how Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) made it possible to reference an object (e.g. a website or document) in Web2, UALs make it possible to reference anything physical or digital, in Web3. UALs extend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">existing web URI standards</a>, revolutionizing URLs as their counterparts in Web2. A UAL also inherits capabilities described in the W3C recommendation on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The UAL format (to be formally specified in further documents) therefore is in the following standardized form:<br> <br>dkg: [// DID] / UAI [“?” query] [“#” fragment]  The Blockchain layer is responsible for maintaining asset ownership record and asset graph state verifiability proofs. Information about ownership is kept in the form of an ERC 721 compatible Non Fungible Token (3). This allows us to tie DKG and blockchain layers even more closely together and enable ownership to be transferable in the form of NFT token transfer. State commit proofs (4) are used to verify that the asset graphs DKG nodes persist are available, haven’t been deleted or in any form tampered with, as well as enabling complex verifiable presentation implementations (according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a>).   Moving from data bundles to unique&nbsp;assets <p>The introduction of DKG assets is expected to induce an update of existing applications built on OriginTrail significantly, as previously bundled publishings (being just “data”) now get “unbundled” and packaged into unique assets, each published with their own asset graphs and UALs for referencing. In versions prior to v6, publishers would publish bundled “data dumps” in consolidated form actually containing information on sometimes hundreds or even thousands of actual physical objects — each of which in v6 is expected to become a uniquely published DKG asset with its own UAL as a verifiable, ownable identifier. Bundling can still be performed if needed by the asset publisher however — builders and developers now have more freedom to create different solutions on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>Assets can be continuously updated by their owners with new (immutable) assertions, allowing assets to increase their asset graph and their value. Assets also act as building blocks — they can be connected to other assets, be indexed in various ways (for search) and extended in many ways to improve the discoverability of the&nbsp;asset.</p> DKG as a Multi-chain Decentralized Knowledge Graph <p>OriginTrail technology is a system of 3 logical layers. The top layer is the application layer where web and mobile applications reside with their interfaces, backends and connectors to the DKG. Sitting below the applications we find OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph as layer 2. It consists of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN), a permissionless network of nodes that are maintaining a distributed knowledge graph of assets. Finally the consensus layer (layer 1) is implemented via blockchain enabling trusted interactions needed for the OriginTrail protocol. Since inception, the DKG was designed to enable multiple blockchains to support a single DKG. This design was for the first time implemented in 2021 when the DKG became multichain and leveraged the many efficiency gains this unlocked which led to over 10-fold jump in its adoption. After the initial Ethereum deployment, we have seen both Gnosis and Polygon blockchains get integrated with the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>After successfully obtaining <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/google-for-web3-specific-blockchain-origintrail-parachain-launches-today-heres-what-s-next-9a0d92bb72ef?source=collection_home---4------6-----------------------">the parachain slot on the Polkadot network earlier this year</a>, OriginTrail will now also receive a tailored blockchain layer network in the OriginTrail Parachain, allowing for yet another jump in its overall capabilities. This is particularly important for the OT-RFC-14 as the DKG v6 will have its inaugural launch on the OriginTrail Parachain. The OriginTrail Parachain and OriginTrail v6 DKG integration is effectively starting with the <a href="https://teleport.origintrail.io/">Teleporting process</a> to bring TRAC tokens from Ethereum to OriginTrail Parachain (explained in OT-RFC-12 and OT-RFC-13). The TRAC holders participating in the Teleport will also be the first to engage with the OriginTrail v6 and its new tokenomics presented below.</p> Guidelines to TRAC tokenomics <p>The OT-RFC-14 document is serving as a foundational piece upon which the first implementation of TRAC tokenomics in the v6 of OriginTrail DKG will be done. As with all TRAC tokenomics so far, the latest version is equally molded to support the adoption of the OriginTrail DKG, however this is the first time it takes full advantage of the upcoming OriginTrail DKG v6. When assessing the various aspects of TRAC tokenomics it’s important to keep a few high-level goals in mind, as they guide us to growing the ecosystem:</p>  Ease of use — asset publishers are the core users of the OriginTrail DKG and in order to allow them to engage with OriginTrail technology, it should be reasonably easy to&nbsp;use.  Cost efficiency — allow the market to achieve attractive prices by not wasting resources.  DKG node rewards — allow DKG nodes to get compensated for providing useful services to the network. By enabling an efficient market for the “supply side” of the DKG network, infrastructure runners can get fairly compensated.  Quality of service — ensure that applications querying the DKG (asset consumers) benefit from a high quality&nbsp;service.  Scalability of network activity — implement a system that has capacity to support the rising levels of adoption.  Decentralization — as a core consideration in any implementation and tokenomics decision, avoiding system control by any single&nbsp;party.   TRAC tokenomics stakeholders <p>The TRAC tokenomics stakeholders can be described through 4 system&nbsp;roles:</p>  DKG asset publishers are agents which create and manage knowledge graph entities (assets) by publishing asset graphs to the DKG according to the OriginTrail Protocol  DKG asset consumers are agents who discover, query and consume the DKG asset graphs created and owned by DKG asset publishers  DKG node runners, who run and maintain the DKG infrastructure nodes, providing the DKG&nbsp;services  TRAC Token holders, who participate in the ecosystem by providing economic support for system activities  <p>The roles indicated above however do not need to be distinct — one ecosystem actor can hold different roles at the same time. For example, DKG node runners are by definition also TRAC token holders as TRAC tokens are necessary for running DKG&nbsp;nodes.</p> DKG node&nbsp;services <p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) natively operates on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) which represents a permissionless decentralized system of nodes communicating according to OriginTrail protocol. Anyone with sufficient technical knowledge is able to run an OriginTrail DKG node and contribute to the system by doing so. By design, the DKG nodes receive compensation for the network services provided in the form of TRAC&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The DKG nodes are able to perform various different activities, specified by OriginTrail core protocol operations or through extensions. On the network level we can categorize these activities into two&nbsp;groups:</p>  Publishing protocols, which introduce additional asset graphs into the DKG (equivalent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_publishing">semantic web publishing</a>, or a database insert operations)  Querying protocols, which enable asset discovery through network queries (equivalent to database query operations)  <p>In OriginTrail v6 we distinguish two generic types of DKG network&nbsp;nodes:</p>  full or service nodes which provide network services implementing full DKG protocol choreographies. Full nodes persist the public DKG state, make it available and execute semantic queries, in return for getting compensated in TRAC&nbsp;tokens.  light nodes which do not provide network services, rather act as network gateways. They are not responsible for persisting the public DKG state as they do not have such capability (don’t respond to publish requests, therefore don’t qualify for rewards). Light nodes are analogous to the notion of light clients in blockchain networks, eliminating the need for gateways such as RPC services with having direct access to the DKG&nbsp;.  <p>Full DKG nodes implement services to facilitate the publishing and querying choreographies. Nodes can generally implement a variety of such protocols, building on the core components: assertions, shards and service agreements.</p><p>Assertions present graph data entries into the system. They constitute asset (data) graphs coupled with corresponding on-chain state commit proofs. In a general sense, assertions are “data building blocks’’ which represent asset graph state, search index entries or any such data structure implemented on the OriginTrail DKG. In OriginTrail v6 graph assertions are natively modeled in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">RDF (Resource Description Framework)</a>, therefore all tooling of the Semantic Web stack is interoperable with OriginTrail on the core level. Assertions can be versioned, and are expected to be further aligned with standards and recommendations, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/07/rch-wg-charter/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20RDF,defining%20RDF%20Dataset%20Canonicalization%20algorithms.">the latest initiative led by Phil Archer of&nbsp;GS1</a>.</p><p>Assertion shards or replicas represent DKG entries positioned in the DKG index space (the index space is formed by all full nodes in the network), centered around a replica key, hosted by a number of DKG nodes. Specific groups of nodes in a replica are subsets of the DKG index space node “neighborhoods” (similar to distributed database shard concept), formed according to service agreements facilitated by the protocol. At any moment, one full node hosts a number of logical shards, and due to node id difference (different positions in the index space), different nodes are intended to host different pieces of the DKG. This mechanism achieves a randomized, yet highly organized, distribution of shards and data over the decentralized network.</p><p>Service agreements are defined on assertion level and incentivise availability for a particular set of assertion shards over a period of time. When service agreements no longer require assertion replicas or expire, the assertion replicas availability is no longer incentivized. For ease of implementation, service agreements are defined in terms of space quants, represented in bytes, and time quants called&nbsp;epochs.</p><p>Full DKG nodes receive assertions from asset publishers, form shards in qualifying neighborhoods hosting assertion replicas, which make assertion graphs available for querying during the service period. For these services, (full) nodes receive compensation in TRAC tokens. “Light” nodes enable interacting with the DKG (publishing, querying) without the capability of providing above mentioned services.</p> Publishing protocol choreography <p>The publishing protocol choreography is a coordinated activity between the publishers and DKG nodes whose goal is to form service agreements and establish assertion replicas on the DKG. Due to the decentralized nature of the system, the DKG nodes receive compensation for their services according to their defined service asks, expressed in TRAC tokens required for kb-epoch units. Using the publishing choreography of the DKG one can publish various different data structures on the DKG (assets, index entries for keyword search, vector search in the future&nbsp;etc).</p><p>A publishing choreography initiates a service agreement and is successful if a service bid provided by the publisher satisfies the required service asks posted by DKG nodes for the assertion replication in the given neighborhood. Service asks are posted by DKG nodes on-chain and updated on a regular basis, forming the service&nbsp;price.</p><p>An asset publishing choreography consists of 4&nbsp;phases:</p>  Preparation phase: the asset publisher prepares an assertion in the format expected by the&nbsp;protocol  Feature phase: initiates the appropriate functionality of the desired feature (e.g. updating an asset state) on the blockchain  Store phase: invokes the store protocol to create an assertion replica on the&nbsp;DKG  Commit phase: used to finalize the choreography and initiate the service&nbsp;period   Service market mechanics <p>The DKG service market is formed between asset publishers &amp; consumers on the demand side, and DKG node runners on the supply side. As the DKG is a decentralized environment no entity controls the market and each participant in the DKG gets to act based on their economic preferences.</p><p>For ease of use in OriginTrail v6, the asset publisher client derives a suggested bid for a service based on the price (according to on-chain asks provided by DKG nodes). Once a publisher creates a bid for their asset on chain (feature phase) and successfully creates required assertion replicas on the DKG (store phase), the nodes from the assertion replica submit commit proofs to the blockchain (commit phase). Once the commit phase is completed, the publisher tokens are locked in the system (in the bid amount, to be collected by DKG nodes), the publishing choreography is completed and the service period&nbsp;starts.</p><p>Assertion replicas are hosted by groups of DKG nodes forming shards, based on the following 3 criteria in order of importance:</p>  Key-space proximity criteria: assertions need to be replicated to nodes and maintained in a specific “neighborhood” of the DKG index space, specifically around the key where an assertion is to be kept. Nodes form neighborhoods based on the XOR distance of the assertion key to the node IDs, similar to how distance is determined <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf">in Kademlia DHT</a>. This criteria needs to satisfy efficient data discovery in the decentralized network environment by deterministically locating assertion replicas in querying choreographies. Additionally, due to assertion keys being consistently hashed, assertion replicas are evenly and randomly distributed across the network key-space. A neighborhood is formed by the R2 number of nodes (neighborhood size) which is a protocol parameter.  Node compensation asks: once the appropriate neighborhood is determined (satisfying the first criterion), the second requirement is to ensure that there are enough nodes willing to provide the service in that neighborhood, indicated by their compensation ask. A bid satisfying a minimum number of R1 nodes (R1 being the minimum set of “willing” nodes within an R2 neighborhood, R1 &lt;= R2) is considered a valid bid in terms of the second criterion, where R1 is a protocol parameter.  Security signal criterion: after both previous criteria have been satisfied, finally R0 nodes get chosen (R0 being the minimum replication factor) out of the R1 set, based on the amount of provided TRAC token stake. A higher stake of TRAC tokens in the system indicates higher quality of service guarantees by nodes, as the stake represents a collateral guarantee for nodes providing expected services and acting according to service agreements.  <p>An illustration of the publishing choreography criteria with regards to R0, R1 and R2 is provided below as an example for R2 = 8 and R0 =&nbsp;3.</p> Service period <p>During the service period, nodes involved in the service agreement need to provide service proofs during each epoch of the service to the blockchain. Providing service proofs consists of answering randomly generated cryptographic challenges for hosted assertions and submitting appropriate answers to the blockchain for verification. Successful proof generation and submission to DKG smart contracts in the designated period of time guarantees that a node indeed hosts the assertions required by the service agreement. Once a successful proof submission is performed on a blockchain integrated with the DKG, a portion of the locked tokens (during the publishing choreography) is released and designated for the hosting&nbsp;node.</p><p>In case a service node fails to provide a proof in an epoch, replacement nodes from the candidate node group can replace it in the service group by submitting service proofs (in case they host the required assertions) during the replacement period. The same criteria (as indicated above) apply for the replacement process (self-healing). Therefore by design, the entire network neighborhood is incentivised to host assertions opportunistically in order to be able to perform “self-healing” of replicas.</p><p>In the case of a node failing to provide services (and submit proofs), it is subject to stake slashing. Slashing is no way intended to punish nodes for reasonable latency in submitting proofs (such as short downtimes for updates, or while under load) but rather acts as a deterrent to longer service outages. Slashing is implemented as a lockup system, where a designated percentage S (S being a protocol parameter, suggested value being 5%) is being locked from the available amount of stake for a period T (T also as protocol parameter, suggested value being 2 years). In this way the node’s stake isn’t lost or redestributed among other stakeholders (which could drive malicious targeting of nodes), but rather incapacitated to be utilised in network activities for a significant time&nbsp;period.</p><p>Additionally, node replacements are possible in case when new (full) nodes join the DKG network. Since new joining (full) nodes will inevitably increase the coverage of the DKG index key space and become part of neighborhoods adjacent to their Node IDs, in order to provide high quality discoverability services (via the querying choreography) new nodes are incentivised to provision assertion replicas expected in those neighborhoods. Therefore all DKG v6 nodes joining the network for the first time will perform an opportunistic synchronization sequence loading the assertions in their immediate neighborhoods, enlarging replicas and making assertions available, with the aim to compete for the available compensation via replacement. The DKG tokenomics are designed therefore to incentivise the maintaining of healthy assertion replicas even with network growth as neighborhoods are changing. Replacements due to better positioning in the DKG index key space (and not due to lack of proof submission) do not initiate stake slashing.</p> Querying protocol choreography <p>We consider querying protocols as any protocols that enable discovery and information retrieval from the DKG. They present coordinated activities between asset consumers and the DKG node runners, aimed at finding and querying assets on the DKG, by leveraging the core protocol querying choreography and the DKG&nbsp;index.</p><p>The querying choreography on the DKG directs a generic query (such as a request for an asset by its identifier — the UAL, a SPARQL query or similar) to one or more assertion shards, effectively querying the appropriate “neighborhood” as designated by the publishing choreography. The query routing is equivalent to the Kademlia protocol among full nodes of the DKG. Light clients are not part of the routing protocol, however can invoke queries and publish assets through the network. (It is the responsibility of clients to implement publishing and querying specifics on the application layer to utilize the DKG sharded nature when designing information retrieval systems).</p><p>An asset querying choreography consists of 4&nbsp;phases:</p>  Preparation phase: the asset consumer client prepares a query in some way (e.g. taking input from a search&nbsp;box)  Feature phase: initiates the query prepared in the previous phase on the DKG, on the appropriate DKG shard, and performs necessary URI resolution if&nbsp;needed  Verification phase: verifies the obtained results from the feature phase using on-chain verifiability proofs (verifying immutability, state consistency, issuer or&nbsp;other)  Presentation phase: presenting the query result to the client in requested form  <p>Note that no global SPARQL endpoint in the system exists, due to its decentralized nature. Each of the nodes can however freely decide to build and expose their own SPARQL endpoints, having all implications of such a decision in mind (e.g. availability). The DKG enables queries on its shards via asset graph traversal facilitated by UALs. DKG nodes also implement local graphs (for storing private asset assertions, in their local triple stores) for which they can perform local SPARQL queries of any sort, on both the local asset graph and the loaded assets from the public DKG. More information on querying capabilities will be provided in the official documentation.</p> DKG Node service&nbsp;market <p>Nodes providing services to the DKG network are subject to the market forces (supply and demand), driven by the choreographies explained above. With the updated implementation in version 6, it is expected that DKG node runners obtain an easier and clearer way of determining the optimal market value of compensation for their services, enabling them to achieve profitability easier. Nodes are expected to maintain their asks on-chain, enabling the asset publisher applications to obtain the current market price for DKG services.</p><p>In unison, the market becomes more efficient due to an improved ability of DKG node runners to differentiate their services based on service quality (through availability, throughput, capacity) and security (proxied through the amount of TRAC collateral posted).</p><p>We envision a set of tools to enable easy management of service parameters for DKG node runners to achieve the best possible market return. Such tools would indicate the fluctuations in supply and demand, for example indicating network load increase (due to higher demand) which would have an impact on the service price in the positive direction, until the service supply is increased (via additional nodes joining the network).</p> Tokenomics role in system&nbsp;security <p>In order to reach the necessary system security level the OriginTrail network requires all full nodes to post an amount of TRAC tokens as security deposit in the system. With the new implementation of tokenomics as proposed above, the stake provided by nodes has a function also in the publishing choreography, as described by the third criterion. As nodes compete in the market based on prices and deployed stake in the network, it is expected from nodes to attract a higher amount of stake (either by directly depositing more TRAC by the node runner, or accepting delegated TRAC from the community) to position themselves better in the market. Delegated node staking becomes one of the additional features in OriginTrail v6 and will allow TRAC token holders to participate even further in the TRAC economy by delegating their tokens to nodes they pick, being eligible for sharing the compensation for services by those nodes. This new component of the tokenomics not only introduces new ways for ecosystem stakeholders to participate, but also motivates them to act as “quality signal providers”, as token holders need to carefully assess who to delegate their TRAC to to minimize the probability of slashing. DKG node runners are expected to become further specialized in capabilities needed to provide a high quality service to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>As stake slashing needs to be a meaningful deterrent to potential service outages, given the proposed slashing implementation above, the minimum required amount of posted stake for a full node will be increased to 50 000 TRAC in order to be eligible for operation. Nodes can achieve this minimum both through direct staking or by collecting delegated TRAC tokens from the community. (Note: delegated TRAC tokens cannot be controlled by node runners, only by delegators). Being a stake delegator is therefore similar to the notion of <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking">nominators in the Polkadot&nbsp;network</a>.</p><p>Detailed delegation and staking mechanics are to be presented in the coming&nbsp;RFCs.</p> OriginTrail v6 scalability considerations <p>The implementation of OriginTrail v6 introduces, as already mentioned, the notion of full and light nodes. It also clearly separates the functionalities to be implemented by clients and network nodes (which were previously one monolithic structure).</p><p>The responsibility of the dkg-client is therefore to implement the preparation and feature phases of both publishing and querying choreographies. DKG nodes implement all the network communication related phases and incentivisation functionalities, however are “relieved” of e.g. the preparation phase complexities and load, which are moved towards the network “edge” (clients). With the separation of concerns between the clients and nodes, as well as the new implementations choreographies illustrated above the DKG implementation becomes far more scalable.</p><p>Furthermore, with the new indexing logic and deterministic shard resolution, the nodes need to communicate significantly less, making the load of publishing even less strenuous on nodes, making them able to run more operations at the same time than previously. In this way the ODN becomes “less chatty” and achieves an order of magnitude scalability improvement in the DKG layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>Another consideration in scalability is the OriginTrail Layer 1 (blockchain), which in the system illustrated above is expected to handle a number of transactions per specific epoch. The limit of scalability in terms of blockchain can be calculated by the following equation:</p><p>Number of assets secured on DKG in one epoch = Epoch_length * block_size / number of proof transactions in an&nbsp;epoch.</p><p>The epoch_length is a system parameter that, based on the equation above, essentially determines the number of assets that can be supported by one blockchain in OriginTrail layer 1. We conclude that architecturally the blockchain layer doesn’t present an immediate bottleneck for the growth of the DKG. Iterative deployments and optimizations on the blockchain level, such as through more efficient smart contract code, or direct implementation of components in Substrate, are also expected over the course of OriginTrail evolution.</p> Conclusion <p>This RFC presents the updates to the TRAC tokenomics in the sixth version of OriginTrail protocol with details of the proposed implementation and activities the system needs to incentivise, grouped around publishing and querying choreographies. It introduces all the system stakeholders, their roles and activities the network needs to support each of the functionalities required from a decentralized knowledge graph.

<p>In April we kicked off new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/upcoming-community-call-new-research-biometrics-in-the-humanitarian-sector/" title="research on the use of biometrics within the Humanitarian sector">research on the use of biometrics within the Humanitarian sector</a>, in partnership with the Open Society Foundation’s migration initiative.</p>



<p>Following on from our previous <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Engine-Room-Oxfam-Biometrics-Review.pdf" title="">2018 report with Oxfam</a> that looked at the risks, harms and challenges of using biometric data for humanitarian purposes, this new research explores what’s changed (and what’s stayed the same) in the sector in the last four years, and takes a deeper look at organisational policies on biometrics, and the benefits risks and potential harms of using biometric systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we wrap up our research and writing, we are keen to share our initial findings and have a broader discussion about what changes are needed when it comes to the use of biometric technologies in the humanitarian sector.</p>



 Register for our second community call on 27 October, 9-10AM EST/ 3-4 PM CET 



<p>All are welcome! Whether you’re a practitioner, a civil society organisation working with impacted communities, or just keen to learn more, join us in our Community Call. Along with presenting our findings, we will create space for dialogue and reflection around the complexities of using biometric technologies within humanitarian contexts.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 What will we be talking about? 



<p>Our focus in this call will be to think through what needs to change in order to encourage a more responsible use of biometrics within the humanitarian sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the key questions that will be guiding our discussions are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 How do we think about necessity when it comes to using biometric systems? (e.g how do we compare biometrics to alternatives, what kind of evidence exists on risks and benefits, and what kind of evidence is lacking?) 



 What sort of policy-making practices and standards are important for creating a more cohesive approach to biometric use? 



 What kind of changes need to take place within the larger humanitarian landscape to facilitate the responsible and thoughtful use of biometric systems?

				 <p>Danube Tech&nbsp;is building the Universal DID Saas, a hosted platform that allows developers to create, update, resolve, and deactivate Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs), as well as to perform several other advanced DID-related operations.</p>
<p>This company has participated in two of the the eSSIF-Lab Open Calls_ the Business-oriented Open Call and the Infrastructured-oriented Open Call.</p>
<p>We’ve had the pleasure to interview,&nbsp;Markus Sabadello,&nbsp;Danube Tech CEO, who has talked to us about what they have been able to achieve so far in his company since its participation in eSSIF-Lab project and what goals they want to accomplish in the medium or long term.</p>
 1. Please introduce yourself and tell us what your company is about. 
<p>My name is Markus Sabadello, I have a relatively large background of working on decentralised identity ideas and technologies. At Danube Tech,&nbsp;we are working on open-source software and commercial products that make it easy for others to build decentralised identity applications and services.&nbsp;Our priorities lie in implementing lower-level infrastructure components in the area of Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). What makes us special is that we put a strong emphasis on interoperability.</p>
<p>To be specific, we try to build technical components that work with different decentralised identity networks, different credential and proof formats, and different protocols.&nbsp;We focus less on building a single, isolated product that we can sell, and more on being part of a larger community and collaborating with others.</p>
 2. What services or products do you offer? 
<p>On the open-source side, we offer Java libraries that implement DIDs, VCs, Linked Data Proofs, CBOR-LD, and others. These libraries are generic and can be used by developers to build higher-level applications and services. Work on these software libraries has been supported by an ESSIF-Lab IOC2 grant. Two additional open-source projects, which are closely related to this, are the Universal Resolver (see&nbsp;<a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a>) and Universal Registrar (see&nbsp;<a href="https://uniregistrar.io/">https://uniregistrar.io/</a>). These projects are quite well-known in the decentralised identity community and have received many contributions. Together, these tools provide an abstraction layer on top of different decentralized identity networks, such as Sovrin, EBSI, IDunion, Indicio, ION, Cheqd, Veres One, and many more. We see this work as an important contribution to building a globally interoperable ecosystem, and to avoid fragmentation of different efforts. As I mentioned before, with our work we are primarily focusing on low-level, foundational infrastructure.</p>
<p>On the commercial side, we are building production-grade enterprise products around the open-source projects. This is sometimes called an “open core” model. The products we are building can be used by companies and governments that want to adopt DIDs, VCs, and related technologies. One of these products is a Software-as-a-Software (SaaS) offering called Godiddy (<a href="https://godiddy.com/">https://godiddy.com/</a>). This has been supported by an ESSIF-Lab Business Oriente Open Call grant and was originally called “Universal DID SaaS”. Godiddy is a hosted platform that makes it easy for developers and solution providers to work with DIDs.</p>
 3. What milestones have you achieved so far since your project launch? 
<p>In our eSSI-Lab IOC2 project, we managed to release “complete” versions of most of our open-source libraries, and to continuously maintain them, since some of the underlying standards are also still evolving. We actively maintain these libraries, since we use them in our own products, and many others in the decentralised identity community use them as well. We also frequently participate in community activities such as developing test suites, or participating in interoperability events (plugfests).</p>
<p>In our BOC1 project, we have by now launched our Godiddy service as a working product, and we have paying customers. We also continuously maintain and expand the functionality of this product, for example by adding support for additional decentralised identity networks.</p>
 4. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>As mentioned in the previous answer, we managed to significantly advance both our open-source libraries and our Godiddy product to the point where both are actively used by other members of the decentralised identity community, as well as by important customers who are building their own applications and services for solving real-life use cases. You could say that eSSIF-Lab has really helped our company to evolve from merely building experimental tools, to a serious and ambitious actor that plays its part within a larger ecosystem, and hopefully helps SSI become successful on a large scale. During eSSIF-Lab, we were able to expand our team and grow the company.</p>
<p>ESSIF-Lab has also helped us to generate additional visibility for our work. And of course another important benefit of eSSIF-Lab (besides the funding and visibility) was the interaction and collaboration with other eSSIF-Lab subgrantees, and the support of the eSSIF-Lab consortium itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future?  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>We believe that DIDs will become as important on the Internet as IP addresses or domain names are today. Our goal is to further improve and expand our products in this area of foundational decentralised identity infrastructure. We want to contribute to interoperability in a global ecosystem and avoid isolated solutions that don’t work with each other.&nbsp;</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>We will continue to play an active role in standardization and community groups such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF), to make sure SSI is built on solid technical specifications. Our goal is also to further grow the company and become a leading provider of solutions for DID and VC technologies.</p>
 6. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
<p>I’m not an expert on this, but I would say:</p>
 
 Be optimistic&nbsp;– try again if an application doesn’t succeed at first, since rejection can happen for various reasons and doesn’t mean that your idea is bad. 
 Be honest&nbsp;– I have seen grant applications that contain outright lies, which is not fair towards the rest of the applicants, and ultimately not good for yourself. 
 Be grateful&nbsp;– I have heard people complain about the bureaucracy associated with public funding, but I think it’s not too much to ask to make an effort to get support for your project.

<p>Trusona, NEC, and Others Advance Open Standard to Improve QR Code Security in Passwordless Authentication</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 13 October, 2022 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the approval of Secure QR Code Authentication v1.0 as an OASIS Standard. Developed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=esat">Electronic Secure Authentication (ESAT) Technical Committee</a>, the standard supports trusted online transactions by establishing a general framework for using QR Codes for “no password” authentication. The new standard is based on an initiative spearheaded by Trusona in order to democratize the mass adoption of passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>“QR codes are popular for fast, simple scanning using a smartphone camera, but privacy and security concerns are growing as QR code adoption has increased during the pandemic,” said OASIS ESAT co-chair, Bojan Simic, of HYPR. “Secure QR Code Authentication shows that passwordless authentication is possible without compromising on security.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The standard provides the layers of security needed to protect against account take-over and identity theft while decreasing the likelihood of potential phishing,” said Trusona’s David Kopack, co-chair of the ESAT TC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“NEC congratulates the ESAT TC on the approval of Secure QR Code Authentication Protocol v1.0 as an OASIS Standard and is pleased to be part of the ESAT TC and has contributed to its release,” said Shinichi Fuchigami, General Manager, Cyber Security Strategy Department at NEC Corporation. “NEC believes that “no password” authentication standards are critical for trusted online transactions and drive its adoption with industry partnerships to benefit customers.“</p>



<p>Vendors involved in authenticating electronic identities, passwordless authentication providers, identity service providers, local and national governments, businesses, and individuals engaged in eGovernment and eCommerce are welcome to participate in the ESAT community.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Earlier this year we started a new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/">project to examine and strengthen our digital resilience</a>, in an effort to further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices and deepen our capacity to support our partners.</p>



<p>We use the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that enable an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its people, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to ever-changing needs and contexts.</p>



<p>As part of this project, we have been <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">reflecting on our own practices</a> in order to better understand our digital resilience needs and also mapping digital resilience issues that social justice organisations we work with are facing, as well as strategies to approach them.</p>



<p>For this mapping process, we are gathering data from our support programmes and research projects to identify common challenges our partners are grappling with, ranging from organisational security and technical concerns, to tool selection and values alignment, and accessibility issues. In this blog post, we share an overview of the main challenges we’ve mapped so far. Given the complex and intricate nature of digital resilience, many of the themes intersect with one another.</p>



 Tool selection: a balancing act 



<p>Tool selection, one of the most pressing challenges cited by organisations, involves two key aspects: 1) a practical aspect, related to selecting tools that meet organisational needs and technical capacities and 2) a principle aspect, related to ensuring the tools align with organisational values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, selecting the right tool is about simultaneously addressing technical needs and aligning with mission and advocacy goals. But addressing both can be difficult. Social justice organisations we work with mentioned limited knowledge about existing tools and an absence of internal expertise to support tool selection as some of the obstacles they face while trying to make tech decisions they feel confident about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Tech choices in low-tech environments 



<p>Tool selection can also be difficult when working in a low-tech or limited-connectivity context. For many social justice organisations — especially those in the Majority World — navigating between selecting tools according to values and facing context-specific limitations can be a delicate and demanding balancing act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organisations frequently ask us questions about managing data responsibly when working within a low-tech environment, or when there are limitations on tools due to organisational capacity. For example, some organisations that had chosen to work with open-source, privacy-respecting tools for video conferencing due to organisational security concerns ended up having to move back to proprietary platforms after facing severe connectivity issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their efforts to improve digital resilience, some of our partners frequently found themselves confronting hard decisions between ease of use and familiarity versus security and privacy concerns. Partners noted that, in choosing to continue to communicate sensitive information across social media platforms, they needed to prioritise convenience and accessibility. While many are interested in finding more secure ways to communicate, they fear that switching from popular platforms could decrease their impact and ability to communicate with audiences/partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making justice-focused tech decisions isn’t always a straightforward process, and it can take a lot of trial and error (like our colleague Steffania explained in this <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">post about our new video conferencing tools</a>!) and many organisations described feeling frustrated and confused on how to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like support identifying tools that fit your needs, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a call with our team!</a> You can also take a look at <a href="https://alidade.tech/">Alidade</a>, an interactive tool that explains what to look for when using technology for social change.</p>



 Pathways to digital resilience: access to information&nbsp; 



<p>Being able to access knowledge about tech and data, including information about digital security, tool selection and responsible data is another important aspect of digital resilience we identified during this first phase of the project. Factors with a negative impact on digital resilience decision-making include:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/takeaways-from-our-community-call-on-intersections-between-data-digital-rights-and-social-justice/">Barriers to information about tech and data</a>.  Lack of language diversity of existing resources for digital resilience.&nbsp;  Insufficient level of context-relevance of existing resources.&nbsp;  



<p>Even when organisations know where to find information to help them navigate conversations about digital resilience, most resources are published in English and aren’t necessarily focused on the realities of social justice organisations in resource-constrained environments.</p>



 Digital rights threats and their impact on civil society organisations&nbsp; 



<p>We also heard repeated concerns regarding government surveillance and internet shutdowns. These are key areas within the digital resilience conversation and they fundamentally influence the way organisations go about their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Internet shutdowns are <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-and-elections-handbook/">“intentional disruptions of internet or electronic communications</a>, rendering them inaccessible or effectively unusable, for a specific population or within a location, often to exert control over the flow of information.” The <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ending-internet-shutdowns-path-forward-report-special-rapporteur-rights-freedom">number of governments imposing internet shutdowns is growing and t</a>he practice is not limited to authoritarian regimes: it has been observed in <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/07/1095142">long-established democracies and more recent democracies</a> alike. At the same time, digital security is being increasingly criminalised and politicised by repressive states, with <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2022/04/2021-KeepItOn-Report-1.pdf">some countries also targeting internet shutdown circumvention tools</a>, such as browsers and tools based on Tor technology, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and proxies that use encryption.<br><br>Government surveillance is one <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/petition/targeted-surveillance-human-rights-defenders/">major cause for concern for human rights defenders</a> and civil society organisations, as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/freedom-of-expression/">many states have been using technologies</a> to surveil: to read activists and journalists’ private emails and remotely turn on their computers’ camera or microphone to secretly record their activities. <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2021/06/Helpline-10000-cases-report.pdf">Governments around the world are investing in their capacity to silence dissent</a>, through tools for both mass and targeted surveillance.&nbsp;Journalists, workers for non-governmental organisations defending human rights, and <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/">women’s rights organisations are particularly at risk of government surveillance</a>. In many countries, <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/disparate-impact-surveillance/?agreed=1">communities of colour are subject to disproportionate levels of surveillance.</a></p>



<p>These digital rights threats need to be taken into account when designing security support interventions, and when thinking about digital resilience of civil society organisations more broadly. Despite the level of concern, we heard that organisations found it difficult to plan for threats or predict impacts. Addressing concerns about government surveillance, for instance, could look very different from one organisation to the next, depending on what they do and where they’re based.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our team offers pro-bono support to social justice organisations interested in improving their digital resilience: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a call with us to learn more!</a> And if you/your organisation are facing a digital security emergency, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/">Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</a> offers real-time, direct technical assistance and advice to civil society groups &amp; activists, media organisations, journalists &amp; bloggers, and human rights defenders.</p>



 Access to resources: digital resilience doesn’t just happen! 



<p>Many social justice organisations we work with face challenges related to digital security and tech infrastructure, and some are unable to fully address these <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/">without access to dedicated funding, resources and relevant networks</a>. Through our work with social justice organisations, we’ve seen how difficult it can be for them to focus on digital resilience, since most are overworked and tending to pressing needs from the communities they serve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even when there are financial resources available, seeking out support (and information!) about&nbsp; digital security and tech infrastructure — from knowing how to find trusted support and networks in the first place, to being able to stay up to date with a shifting landscape for digital threats, to figuring out what tech is right for the organisation – is a process that can consume a significant amount of time, energy and resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">How to think about tech when you don’t have time to think about tech:</a> We know that rethinking an organisation’s use of tech and data does take quite a bit of time (and resources!). So we wrote a short blog post with ideas for low(ish) hanging fruits that organisations can start tackling to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">slowly improve their tech and data landscape</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Use of Digital Identity Working Group (IEUDI)</a> have written a research and discussion paper report looking into inclusivity and ethics in digital identity.</p>



<p>Purpose of this paper</p>



<p>The purpose of this paper is to research existing mahi in the areas of inclusivity and ethics in digital identity. Once we have this understanding, we can identify any gaps and consider how we might address them, consider developing a Code of Practice and make overall recommendations to the Executive Council for DINZ.</p>



<p>Paper Overview</p>



<p>The paper has looked at work happening in Aotearoa and Overseas.</p>



<p>The specific scope of this work is:</p>



  Help ensure inclusive, ethical and responsible use of digital identity technologies that enable equitable digital identity outcomes for all New Zealanders.  Build an understanding of the views and roles of relevant advocacy groups (for example but not limited to Citizens Advice Bureau, NZ Council for Civil Liberties etc) in the adoption of digital identity technologies – inclusive of and accessible&nbsp;to all – with optional alternatives, especially for public services.  Provide constructive forums for discourse with groups that are either clearly disadvantaged in relation to digital identity or have concerns about the potential future uses of digital identity.

<p>A useful way to think about the<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/"> DID standard</a> is as a mechanism to bootstrap trust in an identifier. Implementers can define DID Methods that define how to resolve a DID Document from a DID URL. The most widely used DID method today is the Key DID. </p><p>This method is extremely simple and doesn’t have some of the more advanced features, such as key rotation, that the DID standard enables. However, there are still big challenges with using DIDs. Privacy being a big one. A<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods"> wide range of different DID methods</a> that are not compatible is another. This article explores how to build a DID method that is both<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/upgradeable-decentralized-identity/"> composable</a> (i.e. it builds on existing DID methods) while also adding privacy.</p> 3ID and Its Limitations <p>While Ceramic supports multiple different DID methods, 3ID is the main DID method that leverages the network directly. 3ID has gone through two iterations so far. Let’s take a brief look at them, their limitations, and consider potential future iterations.</p> The static 3IDv0 <p>The first iteration of 3ID kept things super simple and worked similarly to a Key DID in that it was immutable. However, it added some flexibility by allowing the use of a variety of different key types in one DID document. For example, a secp256k1 key for signature verification and a x25519 key for receiving encrypted messages. These keys were simply stored in an IPLD object, the CID of which is used as the DID<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#a-simple-example"> identifier</a>. To resolve a 3IDv0 one simply needs to resolve the IPLD object from its CID, e.g. using IPFS.</p><p>The main limitation of 3IDv0 was that it was not possible to do any sort of key rotation. Once the DID is created the public keys provided up front are the keys for this DID forever.</p> More Flexibility With 3IDv1 <p>The first version of 3ID was designed to enable key rotation and multi-account identity. By using the built-in conflict resolution of Ceramic’s streams, updating the DID document of a 3ID became straight forward. In this case, a<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/stream-programs/tile-document/"> Tile stream type</a> represented the 3ID by storing the public keys in the JSON content of the Tile document. The StreamID of the Tile is then used as the DID identifier. By combining this updatable 3ID with another Ceramic stream type, caip10-links, multiple wallet accounts from different blockchains could be linked to a single 3ID.</p><p>While 3IDv1 is more flexible than its predecessor, there are still some significant limitations, primarily around privacy. All verification methods (e.g. public keys) in the DID document are public. There is no way to add a verification method that is unknown to the public observer. Furthermore, the caip10-links necessitated doxxing of the wallet account, creating a permanent link between the account and the 3ID, that even if removed would leave a trace in the caip10-link event log. Finally, UX for actually using a 3IDv1 was not optimal because the keys referenced in the DID Document were long lived. This led to weak security in a browser context and the reliance on an iframe for key management.</p> Desired properties of 3IDv2 <p>One of the most difficult things to achieve in a publicly verifiable, permissionless system is privacy. This is true for blockchains, and it’s also true for data networks like Ceramic. In blockchains, zero-knowledge proofs are being utilized to provide various sorts of privacy enhancements. Could the 3ID DID method utilize zkp and other techniques to achieve greater privacy as well? First, let’s start by defining what functionality would be desired in a privacy-focused 3ID:</p>  Ability to add and remove verification methods without publicly disclosing their public keys  Selective disclosure of verification methods  Ability to generate a signature issued by the 3ID without revealing which verification method was invoked  Ability to privately graft (i.e. upgrade) existing DIDs to a 3ID (e.g. a caip10-link but private)  Selective disclosure of grafted DIDs   Primitives for Composable Identity <p>Let’s have a look at what primitives we have available to us, or can construct, in order to achieve the properties described above.</p> Generative DID Methods <p>A generative DID method can be defined as a DID where the DID Document can be statically generated from the DID URL. This means that there is no need to look up state from a blockchain or do any other sort of network requests. It also means that it’s not possible to update or remove the DID Document since it is deterministically generated from the DID URL. There are two prominent examples of generative DID methods:</p><p><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a> - every DID URL is a public key with an associated multicode to uniquely identify the key type. In order to generate the DID Document, the public key is simply translated into the appropriate verification method.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">DID PKH</a> - short for public key hash, this method essentially makes all blockchain accounts into DIDs. This is achieved by relying on the CAIP-10 account ID standard to identify a specific account on a specific blockchain. The DID URL gets translated to the DID Document using the special blockchain account verification method, which also relies on CAIP-10.</p><p>The stream type caip10-link in Ceramic was created before DID PKH existed in order to have a simple stream type controlled by a blockchain account. This functionality can now easily be replaced by any stream type, such as Tile Document or Model Instance Document by using DID PKH.</p> Object-Capabilities <p>Signing every data transaction with your DID PKH (e.g. your crypto wallet) makes for less than ideal UX. In order to address this problem, object-capabilities (OCAP) and session keys can be used. The<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/"> article on CACAO</a> explains how this works in detail, but for context let’s have a look at how OCAPs can be used.</p>  A session key (DID Key) is randomly generated  An authorization message (e.g.<a href="https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361"> SIWE</a>) is generated which contains the DID Key URL and an array of resources being authorized  A signature request over this message is sent to the wallet (DID PKH)  The message + signature can now be used as an OCAP, that together with the session key, can be used to invoke actions on the authorized resources  <p>Important to note that these OCAPs can also be chained, e.g. Key A → Key B → Key C, where → implies a delegation.</p> Revocation Registry <p>Delegation using capabilities is powerful, but we don’t necessarily want delegations to be valid forever. A possible mitigation is to add an expiry time to the capability as it is issued. Time based revocation is simple but still quite limited and in the case of a compromised key, damage can still be caused before the capability expires. We need a way to check if a particular capability has been revoked by the issuer. Ideally without leaking information about which capabilities have existed over time—here a revocation registry can be useful. The capability itself can include a caveat that states that it is only valid if and only if the capability has not been added to the revocation registry.</p><p>On Ceramic the revocation registry could be implemented as follows:</p>  An event stream is created where revocation events can be published  The revocation event is a multihash of the CID of the capability (an extra hash is added for privacy)  Once a revocation event has been anchored it is considered valid and is enforceable starting from the anchor timestamp  When a capability is issued it contains a caveat that references the revocation registry using its StreamID  When the capability is verified, the revocation registry must be loaded from the Ceramic network; if the capability was revoked before it was invoked it is considered invalid  <p>The lookup time of this revocation registry would be O(n). However, a Ceramic node could build a merkle tree where OCAP hashes are keys and revocation times are values to reduce lookup time to O(log n). In theory this could also make the revocations verifiable on-chain.</p> Private Capability Invocation <p>When a capability is invoked to perform some action it will generally be publicly disclosed. Up until the point of invocation it can be kept in secret, but if we want our system to remain publicly verifiable an observer must be able to validate the full delegation chain—from the owner of the resource to the key that performed the invocation. A keen reader might, however, realize that we don’t actually need to disclose the delegation chain if we use a ZKP to hide certain information.</p><p>publicInputs = (rootDID, sessionKey, ocapHashes, resources, actions)</p><p>privateInputs = (ocapChain)</p><p>The ZKP from above can be verified to ensure that the session key is indeed authorized to take certain actions on the given resources. The revocation registry can be referenced to make sure none of the capabilities are revoked since the ocapHashes are part of the public input.</p><p>Note that by including the ocapHashes in the public input some metadata is leaked. An observer will be able to see which capabilities have been frequently used, but they won’t learn anything about the content of the capability. A possible improvement could be to include the entire revocation registry stream in the public input. An outside observer could simply compare the included registry with a registry loaded locally. As long as the action performed by the invoker was anchored before any change to the registry was anchored the entire capability chain could still be considered valid. This means of course that the ZKP would need to be regenerated every time the revocation registry is updated.</p> 3IDv2: Composable Identity <p>Combining the primitives above, we can create a composable DID method where verification methods can be added privately using capabilities and revoked using the revocation registry. Similarly to 3IDv0 the first verification method would be added to the initial (public) state of the DID document. After this point, adding a verification method is actually done by using a capability that gives the delegate DID full control to take any action on behalf of the 3ID.</p><p>A cool feature is that the revocation registry includes timestamp information (from Ceramic anchors) so that we can see when revocations happen. This makes it easy to validate signatures done in the past, since we can see that the signature was done by the verification method before it was revoked. However, in the case of a delegation chain this might not be enough. Imagine we have Key A delegating to Key B at time T0; then at time T1, Key A gets revoked. From the perspective of the 3ID, Key B should still be valid since it was added by a verification method that was valid at the time. In order to solve this dilemma we can simply add a timestamp for when Key B was added in the revocation registry. This would allow us to keep using Key B even if Key A is revoked.</p> Grafting DIDs <p>There is a need to publicly or privately link existing DIDs, such as PKH DIDs, to a 3ID. This can now be done rather simply in Ceramic by creating a deterministic stream that is controlled by the DID in question and include an attestation that this DID is grafted to a particular 3ID. The attestation could be public or encrypted. If it is encrypted it could be selectively disclosed to any third party. For example, to check if an ethereum address (PKH DID) has been grafted to a 3ID, one would simply load the Ceramic stream and check the content of the resolved document. For a private link, a decryption key for the encrypted link would also be required to read to which DID the link points to.</p> Implementation <p>An implementation of 3IDv2 might seem daunting at first. It’s worth noting that it can be done in stages, since each primitive builds upon the previous ones. A prototype could easily be built with only support for capabilities for adding new verification methods. The revocation registry could be built after adding the ability to actually do proper key management and would result in a usable version of the system. Finally, private capability invocation could be added on top, providing a layer of privacy when actually using the identity.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we started a new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/">project to examine and strengthen our digital resilience</a>. Through this work we hope to further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices and deepen our capacity to support our partners&nbsp;</p>



<p>After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, the first set of changes we made focused on our video conferencing infrastructure. In this blog post, we’re sharing some reflections about the new tools our team is testing out and how our experience has been so far.</p>



<p>We are using the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members. </p>



 Deciding which video conferencing tools fit our needs and values 



<p>At The Engine Room, we aim for a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-in-the-service-of-justice/">justice-based approach to our technical choices</a>. This means we prioritise choosing technology solutions that intentionally weave anti-oppression strategies into all stages of their creation, maintenance and uptake. As a remote organisation, video conferencing is integral to our day-to-day operations. After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, it became clear that adopting tools that are privacy-respecting and strengthen our organisational security was a priority for us. For this reason, we decided to set up our own instances of <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton</a> (BBB) and <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi Meet</a>. Both tools are encrypted, open source, and incorporate privacy by design.&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 BigBlueButton (BBB) 



<p>BigBlueButton is an open source online learning and video conferencing platform.All traffic from the users’ web browsers to the server goes over standard security protocols when audio, video or screens are being shared.</p>



<p>BBB is<a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/#designed-for-online-learning"> designed specifically for educational applications</a>, with features like whiteboards, break-out rooms, and polling. It also <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/integrations/">integrates</a> with various learning management systems (e.g. Canvas, Moodle). Everything happens in users’ web browsers, so there’s no need for any additional software.BigBlueButton users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser. Access to <a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-overview.html#manage-access">meetings can be limited through a code</a> and joining the room can be dependent on moderator approval.</p>



<p>To use <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/teachers/features/">all the functionalities of the tool</a> it is necessary to have a server to install it on. BBB’s website offers the possibility of <a href="https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/gl/signup">creating an account to access a “demo” version of the tool.</a> Using this version you can make calls of up to 60 minutes.</p>
 



 
 Jitsi Meet 



<p>Jitsi Meet (also referred to as meet.jit.si) is a free and open source video conference service maintained by parent company <a href="https://www.8x8.com/">8×8</a>. By default, Jitsi Meet provides transport-layer encryption between the browser and the Jitsi Meet server of your choice; an end-to-end encryption feature is also available.</p>



<p>Jitsi Meet users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser or through Jitsi’s mobile app.</p>



<p>Meetings can also be password-protected.</p>



<p>Jitsi Meet offers the option of self-hosting and there is a <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">public version</a> of the tool for free use.</p>
 
 



<p>Some of the factors that we took into account while selecting video conferencing tools are included in the list below (which takes inspiration from many resources, such as this “<a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resource-publication/guide-secure-group-chat-and-conferencing-tools">Guide to Secure Group Chat and Conferencing Tools</a>”):&nbsp;</p>



  Maturity and maintenance: We took into account how mature the platforms are, including the amount of time they’ve been running for and whether or not they are still being actively developed. We also considered the existence of active communities of developers and users for both tools.  Privacy: A variety of factors went into consideration: whether or not user data is shared or sold to third parties, if the tools provide encryption (and what type of encryption: end-to-end or to-server), if it’s possible to self-host, what data is stored on platforms’ servers and what data platforms’ owners have access to, if users need to install a dedicated app or software and what data this app or software would have access to.  Reputation: We prioritised tools that are used and respected by social justice organisations and peers we work with, as well as recommended by security experts.&nbsp;  Ownership: We considered whether tools were open source and if the companies provided the source code openly, as well as the history of development and ownership of the platform and potential security challenges (including how owners and developers reacted to those challenges).  Features and affordances: We mapped the platforms according to how well their features would respond to our needs: easiness to connect to these platforms, usage of tools for internal and external calls and more.&nbsp;  Associated costs: We also considered the costs related to each of the tools, including potential subscription fees, learning and implementing, possible IT support needed and hosting costs  



 A brief overview of our experience so far 



  
<p>Hosting and infrastructure details<br>– For BigBlueButton, we hired <a href="https://maadix.net/">Maadix</a>‘s hosting service, who are maintaining both the tool and the servers where it’s hosted. We use a <a href="https://maadix.net/en/big-blue-button-privacy-security-optimizations">version customised by Maadix with performance and privacy improvements.</a><br>– For Jitsi Meet, we are using the <a href="https://open.greenhost.net/greenhost/cloud-init/-/tree/main/jitsimeet">pre-installed stable version</a> that <a href="https://greenhost.net/">Greenhost</a> – with whom we have been already working – offers to their clients.</p>
  



<p>After implementation, we asked our team to use BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet as much as possible. After two months of piloting the tools, we conducted an internal survey and received mostly positive feedback—overall the team appreciated using tools that are aligned with our organisational values. We also identified areas for improvement, which we will work on over the next few months, including user friendliness and video instability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to note that while we try to default to using our own internal platforms, there are occasions where we have a need for features that these platforms do not yet have. For example, we often use webinar registration pages and waiting rooms to ensure that our community calls are safe for participants; however, BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet do not currently possess these features. Additionally, although both platforms aim to be low resource, they often struggle in low bandwidth situations. Lastly, there’s the learning curve of the team for adapting new tools. We often crave for the familiar when it’s not immediately clear how to perform a certain task. We recognize that adapting to the workflow of these tools will take time as is the case with most technological changes.</p>



<p>Here is a summary of some of the benefits and challenges of installing and maintaining these tools on our own servers.&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 Advantages 



  Authonomy: More control over the tools we use, since we are responsible for the installation and can check all code that runs in the application.  Values: Tools that are aligned with our values and principles.  Transparency: Transparency of the open software code—we can inspect every line of code used to build the tools.  Security:&nbsp; With open source tools, more people are inspecting the code, which enables more issues to be found – and fixed. Vulnerabilities are fixed much faster and updates are more frequent.&nbsp;  Cost: Open-source software is very often free or cheaper than proprietary software. Therefore, we save on licensing and maintenance fees.&nbsp;  Open source ecosystem: We are contributing to a community of developers committed to making the internet a fairer place.  Customisation and Flexibility: Using services customised for our use and having exclusive domains.  
 



 
 Challenges 



  Resources: Self-hosted tools require more maintenance time and investment in servers.  Tech expertise: Self-hosted tools require knowledge and availability (internal or external) to troubleshoot issues the team or our partners experience.  Documentation: Using tools that are less widespread or familiar demands an effort to produce technical and user-facing documentation. For example, we developed internal user guides for both platforms containing FAQs, and we also created an external guide that explains our decisions behind specific platform use in community calls.  Adapting to new tools: Functionality is not always the same between tools and even when it is, the user experience may differ. Adopting new tools can take time (as we wrote in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/adopting-new-tech-how-to-give-your-team-the-best-chances-of-success/">this blog post</a>) and can impact the day-to-day work of the organisation.  Stability and availability: Ensuring that self-hosted tools are stable and have high availability (or the ability of a system to operate continuously without failing) is a challenge. Constant monitoring,&nbsp; maintenance, and server redundancy (storing information in more than one server) are steps required to make sure information can be restored in case of problems.  
 
 



<p>This overview represents a snapshot of where we currently are in our journey with these tools: these observations will likely evolve and change over time, as we work on this project and mature our own digital resilience practices.</p>



 Next steps 



<p>During this process, we were reminded of how adopting free and open-source software tools (and self-hosting them!) is a process that takes quite some time and planning, but that ultimately contributes greatly to our digital resilience. Over the next months, we will continue to work on our video conferencing tools, including improving on the tools’ overall performance and stability, refining user documentation and addressing connectivity issues.</p>



<p>If your organisation is interested in going through a similar process, we’d be happy to support you (even if your end result is different!). <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Schedule a call with us</a>!</p>

<p>Background:</p>



<p>From the beginning we have asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. We ask that you do so again this year.  The power of that diversity continues to shine through in the new working groups this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti, equity and inclusion in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Council has identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those organisations involved in kaupapa Māori, civil liberties and business and service sectors are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. As an NZTech Association, Digital Identity NZ adopts its Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy which you can read <a href="https://nztech.org.nz/about/board-diversity-inclusion-policy/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Once elected in December, one of the first responsibilities of the new Council will be to elect a new chair for the EC Council or consider re-electing the current chair. The current chair is Paul Platen (SSS – Security Specialists), supported by deputy chair (and past-chair) Ben Tairea (Āhau). Both are excellent kaiārahi (guides/counsellors/leaders) currently and serving their terms on the Executive Council through to the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2023 is set to be another pivotal year for digital identity with the delayed introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We look forward to stellar nominations to identify, explore and pursue the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference for people in 2023 and beyond.</p>

 Firm Foundations 

<p>Much of our work in Q3 has been forward-thinking, focused on creating the next generation of specifications for blockchain interoperability.</p>

<p>Hello to the Identity Community. Being able to create the next generation of specifications depends on having a wide-spanning community, and we’ve been thrilled to see the Blockchain Commons community continue to grow. That includes not just cryptocurrency nowadays, but also digital identity thanks to sustaining sponsor Proxy. We also reached out to more digital-identity companies at this year’s Rebooting the Web of Trust event, and hope to see that pay out in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tQ9SPek0mnI"></a></p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our specification work is intended to build firm foundations. Our newest foundational work of this sort has been on Gordian Envelope, a new sort of “Smart Container” that can be used to hold secrets and metadata of an arbitrary size and that can be opened by a variety of “permits”, including SSKR shares and public-key cryptography keypairs. Extensive <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/tree/master/Docs">docs</a> are now available as part of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents">BCSwiftSecureCompanents package</a>. Also see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ9SPek0mnI">Gordian Envelope videos</a> on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQ9LtDWZAkfItMF4B5tztw">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>MVA Algorithm Suite. The appendix of the Gordian Envelope docs contains our first <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/09-A-ALGORITHMS.md">MVA ALgorithm Suite</a>. This refers to the algorithmic suite we’ve decided to use in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0deyIHXukk&amp;t=7s">Minimal Viable Architecture</a>: effectively a future-proofed Minimal Viable Product. It overviews current cryptographic algorithms and discusses our decisions about which to use. Gordian Envelope uses BLAKE3, IETF ChaChaPoly, the secp256k1 curve, and more. Our Appendix talks about why we think they’re the best practices for this project.</p>

<p>Collaborative Seed Recovery. This new foundational work is largely in service to Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR): we intend it to add independence, resilience, and openness to seed storage by allowing digital-asset holders to shard their seed and then store it with a variety of different steward services, making recovery painless and resilient. We are currently working with a companies such as Bitmark, Foundation, and Proxy in regular biweekly meetings to make CSR a reality this fall. For more, please see our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR Overview</a>. Our Gordian Envelope videos also lay out the whole foundation, so take a look at the combined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aciTNh402Co&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">CSR playlist</a>.</p>

<p>CSR Use Cases. Why is CSR needed? We’ve written several sequences of <a href="https://hackmd.io/ZbRiwvUfQSy-1RKM15bM8Q#CSR-Focused-Use-Cases">progressive use cases</a> in a preliminary document that discusses options both for CSR and its 2023 successor, Collaborative Key Management (CKM). It covers everything from simple protection of keys to future possibilities where no one actually holds a complete seed, despite its keys being in active use.</p>

 Community Events 

<p>Preventing vendor lock-in via interoperability has been a Blockchain Commons goal from the beginning, but that requires bringing together multiple parties to buy into interoperable specifications. The growth of Blockchain Commons’ community of developers, sponsors, and other interested parties in 2022 has truly made that possible, with those parties coming together in community events such as the biweekly CSR meetings and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/"></a></p>

<p>Silicon Salon 2. Our other ongoing get-together this year has been the <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon</a>, where we’ve facilitated wallet makers and semiconductor makers talking about the creation of the next generation of silicon design that is specialized for cryptography. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/">second Silicon Salon</a> was held on September 14th. Presenters included Bunnie Studios, Cramium Labs, Proxy Labs, Foundation, and the VLS team.</p>

<p>RWOT11. Blockchain Commons got its start with <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, where Christopher Allen first brought community members together to support the future of decentralized and self-sovereign technologies. Unfortunately, Rebooting the Web of Trust went on hiatus shortly after the foundation of Blockchain Commons, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it was back <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague">this September</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons submitted two papers for RWOT11, to bring some of our topics into the conversation in the Netherlands: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/collaborative-seed-recovery-csr.md">an introduction to CSR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/elision-redaction-correlation-smart-documents.md">Elision, Redaction, and Non-Correlation in Smart Documents</a>. The elision topic paper led to a discussion of <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/selective-correlation.md">Selection Disclosure</a> that we’re looking forward to finishing in the coming months. We also participated in an article on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/identity-threats.md">Identity Threats</a>, which returns to some of our early identity work in the field!</p>

<p>Congrats to DIDs. We can’t talk about RWOT without congratulating everyone who worked on turning <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">DIDs into a standard</a>. This has been a long-running goal for both RWOT and Blockchain Commons, so we were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> become a W3C Recommendation this July.</p>

 New &amp; Updated Projects 

<p>We have also continued work on some of our smaller projects:</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit/master/static/images/spotbit-screen.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Beancount. Beancount is a <a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount">simple program</a> that allows double-entry accounting from text files. Because of its textual foundation, it’s very convenient to use in conjunction with command-line Bitcoin tools. As it happens, this type of tool is also crucial to Bitcoin because of regulatory decisions in the US treating Bitcoin as property, not currency, meaning that capital gains need to be calculated for every transaction(!). This requires careful accounting of your Bitcoin, and to support that, we’ve updated our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">SpotBit server</a> to also include a script called <code>beancounter.py</code> that will take a descriptor, look up historical prices via SpotBit, and thus provide all of the data an accountant will need to properly report Bitcoin purchases, sales, and usages. We’ve iterated the software a few times during the quarter, and think we might have a final version; watch for some documentation on the process in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>SpotBit. We’ve actually had a few recent updates to SpotBit, primarily to improve the look, feel, and design of its <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">webpages</a>. Thanks to 2022 interns who supported in this upgrade.</p>

 Advocacy 

<p>The work that Blockchain Commons does on specifications, leading to libraries and reference apps, is bottom-up: we work with developers to incorporate specifications that meet our vision of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. However, we also do top-down work, where we advocate for this vision to lawmakers, agencies, and other organizations.</p>

<p>Law &amp; Advocacy Repo. To better highlight this work, which was also well-supported by our 2022 interns, we’ve added a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/law-and-advocacy">Law &amp; Advocacy repo</a> to GitHub, to report out much of our work. It includes a list of <a href="https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg">Terminology &amp; Definitions</a> produced by this year’s interns, and links to other work.</p>

<p>Private Key Disclosure. That work includes our new article advocating for <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/">protection for private keys in courts</a>, which was published by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/saving-bitcoin-private-keys-from-courts">Bitcoin Magazine</a>. In recent years, courts have begun to request private keys as part of pre-trial discovery motions. It’s dangerous and unnecessary and it needs to end, as is now being considered in Wyoming, where Christopher Allen continues to give regular testimony. Fortunately, the proposed law in Wyoming to protect private keys from disclosure has recently passed a select committee and moved on to others. It still has a ways to go though!</p>

 Web Site Updates 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ third birthday passed without mention this Spring. But, that span of time since our foundation is probably why we’ve been doing a bit of work cleaning up our web presence, to make sure it accurately reflects where we are today!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com"></a></p>

<p>About Page. Didn’t even know that Blockchain Commons had a birthday? It’s referenced on our brand-new <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/about.html">About Page</a> which also highlights our three principals: Founder &amp; Executive Director Christopher Allen; Lead Researcher Wolf McNally; and Lead Tech Writer Shannon Appelcline.</p>

<p>Vision Page. We’ve long known the goal of Blockchain Commons: to make it possible for people to control their own assets and information on the internet, using the decentralized power of blockchain technology. We slightly revised how we write about that vision this quarter. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">newest statement</a> combines two previous statements to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Blockchain Commons advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Projects Page. You may also want to take a look at our updated <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/projects.html">Projects Page</a>. We’ve done a lot of different work over the last three and a half years. Our updated projects page now highlights what we consider most important to our vision, beginning with the Gordian System.</p>

<p>Airgapped Community. Though we continue to believe strongly in partitioning services to encourage the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, that’s today much bigger than the airgaps that we were considering several years ago. As a result, we’ve transformed the Airgapped Wallet Community into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community">Gordian Developer Community</a>. We choose the name “Gordian Developer Community” for this update because the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">Gordian System</a> today incorporates all of our developer-focused work, from Principles and Architecture to Specifications and Libraries, plus the Apps that demonstrate them. We look forward to talking with airgapped-wallet developers and those working on other partitioning techniques alike!</p>

 Doc Updates 

<p>As part of our web updating, we’ve also done some work on our docs.</p>

<p>Revised Gordian Page. How does the whole Gordian system fit together, from our air-gap and tor-gap overview to specifications such as Gordian Envelope? Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#readme">updated Gordian page</a> walks through the whole system from top to bottom, including new pages on topics such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md">Gordian Architecture</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Roles.md">Gordian Architecture Roles</a></p>

<p>New Test Vectors. We’ve also produced some new test vectors, to help people who are implementing our specifications. These include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-test-vector.md#256-bit-seed">SSKR test vectors based on 256-bit seeds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-seed-test-vectors.md">crypto-seed test vectors for both 128-bit and 256-bit seeds</a>.</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>Thank you as always for your support for Blockchain Commons. In 2022, we have truly become the commons that we imagined. Moving forward, we will continue to build firm foundations with our big focus on the architectural and reference work needed to release CSR by the end of the year.</p>

<p>If you’re not already a sponsor of our work, you can become one through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub</a>. Now that we’re back from RWOT11 in the Netherlands, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance our work!</p>

 OIDF Session at Authenticate 2022 — Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
<p>1:45 – 2:40pm PT — <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/session/the-openid-foundation-strategy-a-deep-dive-on-fapi-and-the-global-open-banking-open-data-movement/">The OpenID Foundation Strategy &amp; a Deep Dive on FAPI and the Global Open Banking, Open Data Movement</a><br>
Presenters: Gail Hodges, OpenID Foundation Executive Director and Anoop Saxena, OIDF Member (Intuit) &amp; FAPI Working Group Co-Chair</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation standards are used today for consumer and enterprise login, open banking, open health, digital identity issuance and acceptance, and other federated identity use cases. We will give a brief overview of the OpenID Foundation’s strategy to serve the global community with its standards and certification capabilities. Then we will do a deep dive on the FAPI security profile in the context of Open Banking and Open Data implementations that are cascading around the world. The FAPI Security profile has been selected by public and private networks in the US, UK, Brazil, Australia, Norway and beyond. They are also a leading contender to enable cross border use cases. Background on FAPI and the global Open Banking, Open Data movement can be found in two OIDF whitepapers published this year:</p>
<p>A Primer on the global movement behind Consent-Based movement of Data “Open Banking and Open Data and the Financial Grade API.” (final) https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/03/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-Open-Data-and-Financial-Grade-APIs_2022-03-16.pdf<br>

 OIDF Sessions at FIDO Member Plenary — Wednesday, October 19, 2022 
<p>9:00-9:10 am — Welcome &amp; Opening Remarks<br>
Presenter: Gail Hodges – OpenID Foundation Executive Director</p>
<p>9:10-9:45 am — Shared Signals &amp; Events: A Secure Webhooks Framework<br>
Presenter:&nbsp; Atul Tulshibagwale – SGNL</p>
<p>Lack of interoperability between products from different vendors hampers customer adoption and results in poorer security outcomes. Interoperable standards such as the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) of the Shared Signals and Events (SSE) Framework provide a great way to communicate session assurance changes and other ways in which account and session related information can be conveyed interoperably and asynchronously between parties that share users. Featured by Gartner as an innovation trigger in their 2022 Digital Identity Hype Cycle, CAEP and the SSE framework it relies on is growing in adoption. Learn more about the standard and how to adopt it in your environments in this talk.</p>
<p>9:45-10:20 am — OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC): Addressing Self-Sovereign Identity, Decentralized Identity, or User-Centric Identity<br>
Presenter: Kristina Yasuda – Microsoft</p>
<p>The OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) protocol family is facilitating significant adoption of Verifiable Credentials, empowering individuals to take control of their own identity. By using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, a cornerstone of modern Identity systems as the foundation, OpenID4VC ensures that Verifiable Credentials applications are trusted, secure, interoperable, and easy to deploy. For that reason, OpenID4VC specifications are already being adopted and deployed in a number of implementations, rapidly becoming the foundation of many Verifiable Credentials solutions. OpenID4VC consists of three specifications: Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2 (SIOP v2), OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP), and OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OIDC4VCI). They enable existing OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect Relying Parties to receive Verifiable Presentations and existing OAuth 2.0 Authorization Servers/OpenID Connect OpenID Providers to issue Verifiable Credentials in any credential format including W3C Verifiable Credentials and ISO/IEC 18013-5 mdocs. In this session, we will discuss use cases motivating the work, how these protocols solve the problems, what challenges remain, and how they have come together to weave a web of trust.</p>
<p>10:20-10:55 am — “A Review of the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN): One Year On”<br>
Presenter:&nbsp; Elizabeth Garber – Co-Chair GAIN Proof of Concept</p>
<p>This session will provide a one-year update on the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) initiative including what’s next including seeking your input and contributions as GAIN transitions to focusing on how interoperability in enabled globally.</p>

<p>10:55-11:30 am — OIDF Government Whitepaper Listening Session: “Citizen-Centric Identity Systems”<br>
Presenter: Elizabeth Garber – Whitepaper Co-Author</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is developing a whitepaper for governments and their associated stakeholders with the goal of supporting them in making good decisions when implementing citizen-centric digital identity systems – and to help them understand where OIDC and its extensions fit in. This session will be a facilitated discussion about the key concerns of government when thinking about digital identity:</p>
 
 The Role of Government 
 Key Stakeholders 
 Adoption 
 Balancing privacy/security/trust 
 Resilience 
 Economic Benefits 
 Technology and Interoperability 
 How existing standards fit in 
 
<p>11:30 am-12:05 pm — OIDF Privacy Whitepaper Listening Session: “Help Design a Scalable Future for Personal Privacy”<br>
Presenter: Heather Flanagan – Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting</p>
<p>Government-issued digital IDs have the potential for amazing societal impact but getting there from here means bridging the gaps in identity validation, verification, privacy, and control. In this session, we offer an open conversation to gather different perspectives on how policies and protocols need to evolve to help government-issued IDs fill their role in a global privacy-preserving infrastructure.

<p>Antes de iniciarmos, o que queremos dizer com dados? E tecnologia? Provavelmente você está usando os dois!<br><br>Definimos ‘dados’ como informações que precisam ser processadas, organizadas e estruturadas para que possam ser utilizadas. Em outras palavras, com dados estamos nos referindo às informações que você possui, como os detalhes sobre as comunidades com as quais trabalha, resultados de pesquisas que fez, endereços de e-mail e informações de contato de apoiadores e assim por diante.<br><br>Entendemos ‘tecnologia’ como as ferramentas, os sistemas, métodos e processos que capitalizam o poder computacional para gerenciar, analisar e comunicar informações. Para isso, quando falamos em tecnologia, queremos dizer ferramentas digitais, em termos gerais. Qualquer coisa, desde plataformas de e-mail e apps de mensagens até hosts de sites, plataformas de newsletters por e-mail, CRMs, bancos de dados, processos algorítmicos e mais.</p>

 Primeiros passos – entendendo a visão geral sobre tecnologia e dados 



 P1: Organizações parceiras parecem estar usando mais tecnologia/dados. Também deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?  



<p>A resposta para isso realmente depende do contexto. A tecnologia pode lhe auxiliar a organizar tarefas e operações diárias, permitir comunicação mais segura, coletar e gerenciar informações, cortar gastos e liberar orçamento, entre outras possibilidades. Mas, se usada de maneira ineficaz ou sem estratégia, a tecnologia também pode comprometer a sua capacidade de realizar o seu trabalho com segurança e eficácia.</p>



<p>Por exemplo, se sua organização estiver coletando relatos em primeira mão de violações aos direitos humanos em áreas com pouca conectividade à internet/rede móvel, a adoção de uma ferramenta de coleta de dados que necessite de conexão com a internet dificultará o seu trabalho e impactará negativamente a sua capacidade de cumprir a sua missão.</p>



<p>Se usada sem estratégia, a tecnologia também pode lhe expor e expor as pessoas com quem você trabalha a novas vulnerabilidades e novos riscos. Por exemplo, se você está em um contexto em que a monitoração da sociedade civil pelo governo é comum e está usando ferramentas que não protejam suas comunicações de maneira adequada, isso pode comprometer o seu trabalho e a sua segurança.</p>



<p>Para ter certeza de que você usará a tecnologia estrategicamente e com responsabilidade, separe um tempo para pensar a respeito de como implantar uma nova tecnologia ou coletar mais dados poderia fortalecer ou enfraquecer o seu trabalho. Antes de adotar quaisquer novas ferramentas ou plataformas, tente fortalecer a sua capacidade interna, conectar-se com outras organizações que você respeita.</p>

 P2: Como eu e minha equipe podemos aprender mais sobre tecnologia e como ela é relevante para o nosso trabalho?&nbsp; 



<p>Tecnologias digitais evoluem rapidamente, assim como debates e conversas sobre os potenciais benefícios e malefícios de se usar ferramentas e plataformas específicas. Quando tentamos aprender mais sobre tecnologia, achamos que o mais útil é focar em duas coisas:</p>



 
 Trabalhar para <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/" title="">desenvolver a intuição técnica da equipe de maneira lenta e incremental</a>, fazendo com que seja uma prioridade para toda a equipe tanto quanto possível (em vez de trabalho de uma única pessoa). 



 Em vez de buscar por <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/" title="">ferramentas novinhas em folha</a>, tente antes identificar como a tecnologia e os dados podem <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/" title="">fortalecer o seu trabalho principal</a>. 
 



<p>Quando o assunto são novas ferramentas e aplicações, há muita informação online que pode ser tentadora – mas pode ser difícil identificar o que é relevante para você e o que não é.</p>



<p>Para entender as informações relacionadas à tecnologia com mais facilidade, comece com o desafio que você está tentando entender ou resolver primeiro. Ademais, se puder, busque organizações parceiras que pensem de maneira similar e que possam estar em contextos parecidos ou ter missões semelhantes às suas e aprenda mais sobre quais ferramentas estão usando (e quais foram seus sucessos e desafios!).</p>

 P3: Minha organização acredita que é o momento de começarmos a usar mais tecnologia e dados no nosso trabalho. Por onde começamos?&nbsp; 



<p>Primeiro, tenha uma visão geral clara do que vocês já estão usando! A maioria das organizações já estão usando pelo menos algum tipo de tecnologia e dados para lhes auxiliar no trabalho – desde ferramentas do cotidiano, como e-mail e mensagens instantâneas, até ferramentas de CRM e bancos de dados. Abaixo, trouxemos uma pequena lista de perguntas que podem servir como um exercício inicial para mapear as maneiras que você está usando tecnologia e dados em seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Nota: algumas das informações que você vai reunir como parte deste exercício de mapeamento podem ser sensíveis; antes de começar, garanta que suas notas estão armazenadas em um local seguro e são compartilhadas apenas com pessoas que precisam acessá-las.</p>



 
 Quais ferramentas você usa atualmente para seu trabalho?&nbsp;
 
 Quais plataformas/ferramentas você e sua equipe usam para se comunicar? Dentre elas, podem estar e-mail, mensagens instantâneas, mídias sociais, SMS e sites, para listar algumas. 



 Como você armazena e gerencia seus arquivos e documentos? Quais plataformas você usa? Todos na sua equipe usam as mesmas plataformas? 



 Você está trabalhando em campanhas públicas ou faz parte de esforços coletivos com outras organizações? Se sim, quais ferramentas usa para ativismo, organização e manter a comunidade? 



 Está trabalhando com algum banco de dados ou plataforma de pesquisa? 
 
 
 



<p></p>



 
 Como você está usando os dados?
 
 Que tipo de dados/informações você coleta ou gera no cotidiano? Pense sobre seus fluxos de trabalho individuais e coletivos e liste os momentos em que você coleta ou gera dados. Por exemplo, coletar informações de contatos das pessoas que você entrevistou, conversar por e-mail ou WhatsApp, tomar notas de entrevistas ou reuniões ou realizar pesquisas com comunidades. 



 Onde você armazena os dados? Considere os dados que você já tem e liste todos os lugares onde estão (garanta que está incluindo todos os lugares remotos – e-mails, documentos compartilhados e assim por diante). 



 Onde e como você compartilha os dados? Pense sobre as vezes em que você precisa compartilhar os dados: quando isso normalmente acontece, com quem você compartilha essas informações e quais ferramentas utiliza? Por exemplo, você pode enviar planilhas ou PDFs por e-mail, compartilhar documentos e atas de reuniões pelo Google Docs ou compartilhar senhas através de um aplicativo de mensagens. 
 
 
 



<p>Essas são perguntas iniciais e exploratórias. Para uma versão completa deste exercício de mapeamento, veja <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD!</a> (publicado em 2021) ou <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">entre</a> em contato com a nossa equipe.</p>



<p>Por fim, adotar novas ferramentas leva tempo e necessita de recursos. Garanta que você e sua equipe terão espaços dedicados para aprender novas ferramentas, praticar comportamentos e se atualizar com os novos dados sendo utilizados.</p>

 P4: Como posso garantir que as ferramentas tecnológicas e os dados que estamos usando são realmente úteis para o nosso trabalho? 



<p>Em nosso trabalho de apoio a organizações da sociedade civil, frequentemente nos deparamos com <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">suposições de que dig</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">i</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">tal sign</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">i</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">fica melhor</a> e que qualquer solução tecnológica levará a maior eficiência, eficácia e impacto.</p>



<p>Mas nem sempre é assim. Quando estamos trabalhando mais intensamente com um parceiro, frequentemente começamos com uma avaliação de como seu uso de tecnologia e dados são mapeados para seu trabalho e contexto. Isso pode nos ajudar a entender como, ou mesmo se, a forma com que usam a tecnologia está fortalecendo seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Depois de mapear quais ferramentas a organização está usando e quais dados são coletados, armazenados e compartilhados, vamos a uma segunda rodada de perguntas: quão útil tudo isso é (ou quão útil poderia ser) no contexto do seu trabalho:</p>



 
 Qual é o principal problema social ou político no qual você está trabalhando? 



 O seu uso de tecnologia e dados está lhe auxiliando a lidar com esse problema? Se sim, como? Se não, por que você acha que isso está acontecendo? 



 Seu uso cotidiano de tecnologia e dados está lhe auxiliando a se conectar com indivíduos ou instituições importantes para o seu trabalho? 



 A forma como você usa tecnologia e dados está impactando sua carga de trabalho? Está fazendo seu trabalho mais fácil ou está criando cargas insustentáveis de trabalho para a equipe? Você gosta de usar ferramentas organizacionais?

 Tomando decisões – certificando-se de que os dados e a tecnologia que você usa estão de acordo com seus valores e sua missão  



 P5. Como tomamos decisões acerca de adotar novas ferramentas e/ou coletar dados?&nbsp; 



<p>Há muito a se pensar na hora de escolher uma ferramenta, e há muitas opções por aí – incluindo várias que você talvez ainda não conheça. Então, como começar a reduzir (ou expandir) as suas opções?</p>



<p>Em 2017, com base em uma pesquisa que fizemos sobre escolha de ferramentas em organizações da sociedade civil, criamos um <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/" title="">guia interativo para escolha de ferramentas chamado Alidade</a>, que guia as organizações da sociedade civil por meio de perguntas que podem ajudá-las a decidir que tipo de ferramenta tecnológica seria adequada para seu projeto ou suas necessidades organizacionais. Recomendamos que você teste!</p>



<p>Em geral, quando organizações estão buscando novas ferramentas tecnológicas, achamos que as seguintes diretrizes são úteis:</p>



 
 Pesquise as pessoas, o problema e, depois, a tecnologia. Analise o problema geral para o qual você acha que alguma ferramenta tecnológica poderia ser útil. Pense no seu público-alvo. Faça uma pesquisa e considere opções diferentes em relação a quais opções tecnológicas estão disponíveis. 



 Pense duas vezes antes de criar. Pesquise por ferramentas já existentes que possam fazer o que você precisa. Criar uma ferramenta totalmente nova pode ser mais complexo e arriscado. 



 Obtenha uma segunda opinião. Outra pessoa provavelmente já tentou uma abordagem parecida antes de você. Encontre essa pessoa e peça conselhos a ela. 



 Sempre faça testes. Teste pelo menos duas ferramentas, com as pessoas que você quer que as usem, antes de escolher. O teste destaca problemas logo no início. Também levanta questões que você nunca imaginou que teria. 



 Esteja preparado para o fracasso. Você não vai acertar de primeira. Tenha orçamento separado e se planeje para fazer ajustes regulares à ferramenta ao longo do projeto. 



 Reflita sobre o que você está fazendo. Tenha sempre em mente o que está e o que não está funcionando. Aplique o que você aprender ao trabalho da sua organização e compartilhe com outras organizações. 
 



<p>Certifique-se de que as ferramentas que você escolher também se adequam às suas necessidades de segurança. Quando estiver avaliando a segurança de uma ferramenta, considere o seguinte:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Qual é a política de privacidade da ferramenta? Que tipo de dados a ferramenta coleta e com quem esses dados são compartilhados? Quem tem acesso a quaisquer dados armazenados na ferramenta? 



 A abordagem da ferramenta em relação à privacidade e segurança é bem documentada? O que você consegue descobrir sobre os registros de privacidade e segurança da ferramenta? 
 



<p>Documente e discuta suas descobertas com seus colegas antes de tomar a decisão final a respeito de uma ferramenta.</p>



<p>Perguntas relacionadas: <br>– <a title="">Deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?</a><br>– <a title="">Como eu e minha equipe podemos aprender mais sobre tecnologia e como ela é relevante para o nosso trabalho?</a> </p>

 P6: Minha organização quer integrar novas tecnologias, mas ainda não encontramos a ferramenta certa. Deveríamos criar nós mesmos uma ferramenta? 



<p>Se você está familiarizado com o nosso trabalho, provavelmente sabe que muitas vezes defendemos a adaptação de ferramentas existentes para suas necessidades quando possível (chamamos isso de “reutilização de ferramenta”).</p>



<p>Nossa pesquisa nessa área ao longo dos últimos anos mostrou que reutilizar e adaptar ferramentas existentes pode ter muitas vantagens, como uso mais eficiente de recursos financeiros e aumento do acesso ao suporte para a implementação e manutenção.</p>



<p>Criar uma ferramenta do zero, por outro lado, pode ser um processo custoso e longo que pode levar à frustração: já vimos como ferramentas podem acabar sendo ineficazes ou pouco usadas, ter um custo alto inesperado ou demandar muitos recursos para serem mantidas ou atualizadas.</p>



<p>Mas se simplesmente não consegue encontrar a funcionalidade que a sua organização está buscando e você está considerando criar uma nova ferramenta, aqui estão algumas questões sobre as quais refletir:</p>



 
 Há uma necessidade real e identificável para esta ferramenta? Ela lhe aproximará dos seus objetivos de longo prazo? Criar uma ferramenta responderia a uma necessidade intensa que surgiu no seu trabalho ou a ideia surgiu por outros motivos? 



 Você tem os recursos necessários para criar a ferramenta, mantê-la a longo prazo e fornecer suporte constante para as pessoas que continuarão a usá-la? 



 Qual é a sua visão para a ferramenta no longo prazo? As necessidades ou problemas que a ferramenta está sendo construída para atender e resolver podem evoluir ao longo do tempo?

 P7. Como posso usar tecnologia/dados se meu acesso à internet ou à eletricidade não é confiável? 



<p>Se você tem dificuldades com acesso intermitente à internet, considere adotar ferramentas que permitam que você trabalhe tanto online como offline. Com o Google Docs, por exemplo, você pode <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012?hl=pt-BR&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">permitir o acesso offline aos documentos</a>. Isso vai permitir que você continue seu trabalho offline e depois sincronize os documentos quando a conexão voltar. Algumas ferramentas de coleta e gerenciamento de dados, como <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, também permitem que você colete dados nos dispositivos quando não tem conexão e depois faça o upload dos dados no servidor quando a rede estiver disponível. Para reuniões online em cenários e configurações de baixa conectividade, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> é uma opção gratuita, leve e de código aberto para ligações apenas de áudio.</p>



<p>Se o orçamento da sua organização permitir, também recomendamos investir em uma conexão de backup; por exemplo, uma conexão de rede móvel à qual conectar seus aparelhos quando sua conexão de banda larga não estiver disponível.</p>



<p>Há duas formas de fazer isso: usar um modem de internet móvel ou usar um smartphone dedicado para criar um ponto de acesso ao qual outros aparelhos podem se conectar e compartilhar a conexão móvel. Aqui está um tutorial rápido de <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">como criar um ponto de acesso móvel em um smartphone Android</a>. Você pode limitar a quantidade de dados usados ao compartilhar a senha de acesso apenas com aparelhos ou usuários essenciais.</p>



<p>Em casos em que a conexão à internet e/ou à eletricidade é intermitente e você está trabalhando online, certifique-se de que está salvando seu trabalho com a maior frequência possível para minimizar os riscos de perder trabalho.</p>



<p>Se por quedas de energia com frequência, adquirir um gerador como backup pode ser uma opção interessante, desde que você tenha os recursos organizacionais para isso.</p>

 P8. Como trabalho com pessoas desenvolvedoras e/ou especialistas em tecnologia? 



<p>Há muitos tipos diferentes de profissionais com os quais você pode trabalhar. Tipos comuns de profissões que interagem com tecnologia ou dados incluem:</p>



 
 Design de user experience (UX): Trabalha tanto com clientes (neste caso, é você!) como usuários para criar um produto que satisfaça necessidades diversas e seja fácil de entender e operar. 



 Design gráfico: Cuida dos elementos visuais que um site, ferramenta, app ou publicação usam e é responsável por criar a identidade visual (ou branding). Frequentemente trabalha junto com o UX designer para garantir que a identidade visual também funciona bem para as pessoas que são usuárias. 



 Ilustração: Cria ilustrações, ícones, infográficos e mais, que vão compor a estrutura maior que o designer gráfico e o UX designer criaram. 



 Desenvolvimento front-end:&nbsp; Implementa o design em um site, ferramenta ou app. Em particular, é capaz de programar os aspectos que os usuários vão ver e com os quais vão interagir. 



 Desenvolvimento back-end: Desenvolve e conecta um banco de dados ao front-end (as partes do site, app ou ferramenta que um usuário pode ver) e faz todas as tarefas não visíveis que preencherão o front-end com conteúdo dinâmico. 



 Análise/Ciência de dados: Extrai padrões de grandes volumes de dados. Também pode estar equipado com as ferramentas e o conhecimento necessários para criar visualizações de dados a fim de comunicar padrões importantes. 



 Sysadmin/DevOps: Mantém os servidores onde ficam o site, as ferramentas ou apps. Frequentemente é responsável por coordenar a identificação e solução de problemas se as usuárias encontrarem bugs ou erros. 
 



<p>Às vezes, as funções podem se justapor: por exemplo, você pode contratar uma pessoa que lidera o design e desenvolvimento de um site, ou uma pessoa desenvolvedora que é capaz de trabalhar tanto em front-end como em back-end.</p>



<p>Antes de contratar desenvolvedores e especialistas em tecnologia, é útil:</p>



 
 Ter clareza do porquê você quer criar ou adaptar novas ferramentas. 



 Identificar os recursos que você tem e dos quais vai precisar. 



 Lembrar-se de se planejar para manutenção a longo prazo. 
 



<p>No início de seu trabalho juntos, é importante estabelecer pontos em comum e uma terminologia compartilhada a respeito das necessidades e expectativas. Recomendamos criar um Termo de Referência&nbsp; para documentar e compartilhar necessidades e exigências do projeto. O Termo de Referência deve abordar, no mínimo:</p>



 
 O orçamento disponível para o projeto&nbsp; 



 O prazo necessário 



 Seus objetivos 



 Suas expectativas em relação ao parceiro externo 



 Quaisquer informações adicionais 
 



<p>Vocês também devem chegar a um acordo em relação a ferramentas, canais de comunicação, funções e responsabilidades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tudo isso pode contribuir muito para o sucesso do projeto desde o início. Algumas coisas que você deve fazer ao trabalhar com consultores, uma vez que o trabalho está em andamento, são:</p>



 
 Focar na clareza dos objetivos, grandes processos e marcos organizacionais para melhor apoiar a equipe/o projeto. 



 Fornecer feedback relevante e em tempo hábil. 



 Dar espaço ao e ter respeito pela expertise do consultor. 



 Tentar ser responsivo com as comunicações.

 P9. Minha organização faz muito de seu trabalho online, mas nossa colaboração nem sempre corre tão bem. Como podemos fazer para que a colaboração online funcione melhor para nós? 



<p>Sabemos em primeira mão que, quando se trata de colaborar online, encontrar a maneira certa de se comunicar é essencial – tanto para que o trabalho corra bem como para o bem-estar geral.</p>



<p>Idealmente, sua equipe terá uma seleção de ferramentas ou canais para usar (por exemplo, um mix de apps de chat, e-mail e ferramentas de gerenciamento de projetos seguros), mas é importante que cada um deles tenha uma função clara.</p>



<p>Com frequência, as organizações com quem trabalhamos&nbsp; usam tantas ferramentas diferentes que se sentem sobrecarregados toda vez que precisam compartilhar um documento, ideia ou mensagem. Se este for o caso da sua organização, separe um tempo para listar rapidamente todas as ferramentas diferentes que as pessoas usam para se comunicar – a lista pode incluir apps como Signal e WhatsApp, plataformas de mensagens como Slack e Mattermost, CRMs online como Salesforce, ferramentas VOIP como Skype, Zoom ou Jitsi Meet, e ferramentas colaborativas como Trello, Air Table, Asana e outras. Talvez você também use mensagens SMS ou ligações por telefone.</p>



<p>Quando tiver essa lista em mãos, sugerimos que se reúna com as pessoas com as quais você mais colabora e entrem em um acordo para tentar usar menos ferramentas. Dê um propósito específico a cada ferramenta: por exemplo, talvez e-mail seja para mensagens mais longas e que não sejam tão urgentes, ou para compartilhar documentos, enquanto programas de mensagens são para questões urgentes ou conversas casuais.</p>



<p>Quando tiver identificado algumas coisas que funcionam, documente! O registro garantirá que todos estão na mesma página e será uma ótima referência para pessoas novas que entrarem na equipe ou simplesmente para servir de lembrete dos processos/projetos.</p>

 Segurança e cuidado em foco 



 P10: Como posso garantir que toda minha equipe está usando as ferramentas (ou processos de dados) que escolhemos? 



<p>Mesmo quando estamos animados com uma nova ferramenta ou processo tecnológico para usar dados, de fato adotar novos modos de trabalho é difícil. Ao mesmo tempo, garantir que estamos usando as ferramentas acordadas (e seus protocolos e segurança ou proteção relevantes) é uma maneira importante através da qual podemos praticar o cuidado um com o outro nas organizações.</p>



<p>Um passo a ser tomado para ajudar todos a adotar uma nova forma de trabalho é garantir que a nova ferramenta ou o novo protocolo respondam a uma necessidade concreta e que todos saibam qual ela é. Isso significa que todos sabem que, ao se esforçar para aprender a usar a nova ferramenta, estarão mais próximos da solução de um problema que vêm enfrentando.</p>



<p>Ao mesmo tempo, é importante gerenciar as expectativas – as mudanças podem ser sentidas pouco a pouco, ao longo do tempo, conforme mais pessoas usam uma ferramenta ou um protocolo e se familiarizam com ela/ele. Isso faz parte do processo.</p>



<p>E, porque é um processo, é bom dar espaço e tempo para aprendizado, adaptação e discussão quando uma nova ferramenta é selecionada. Dependendo do que mais estiver acontecendo, as capacidades para aprender algo novo podem variar entre as equipes, e dar espaço pode ser a melhor forma de reconhecer isso.</p>



<p>Por fim, ouvir as experiências das pessoas que estão usando a nova ferramenta pode lhe ajudar a identificar maneiras que você pode ajustar a própria ferramenta, se for possível, ou ajustar como ela vem sendo aplicada.&nbsp;</p>

 P11: O que podemos fazer para manter as pessoas em segurança quando começarmos a usar diferentes ferramentas tecnológicas e práticas de dados? 



<p>Muitas das pessoas com quem conversamos estão curiosas a respeito de como podem incorporar a segurança e o cuidado em todo o trabalho que fazem – especialmente quando se trata de novas iniciativas tecnológicas e de dados. Ao vermos nos noticiários, nas nossas comunidades e em nossas próprias experiências situações como vazamentos de dados e ferramentas hackeadas, pode parecer desafiador adotar ferramentas ou processos tecnológicos com segurança.</p>



<p>Uma abordagem que pode auxiliar a fornecer uma base é a de Responsible Data (ou “dados responsáveis”, em uma tradução livre): a ideia de que compartilhamos um “dever coletivo de prestar contas das consequências não intencionais de trabalhar com dados”.</p>



<p>Algumas áreas a serem exploradas e que estão sob o guarda-chuva dos dados responsáveis são:</p>



 
 Práticas como minimização de dados (apenas coletar os dados que você precisa). 



 Conceitos como consentimento (certificar-se de que as pessoas são capazes de concordar de maneira livre, específica, informada e revogável com como seus dados serão usados). 



 Espaços relacionados, como segurança organizacional (uma rica área de prática em torno da definição de protocolos que podem auxiliar a criar segurança de dados/informações e bem-estar físico e segurança).&nbsp; 
 



<p>Se você não está familiarizado com esses tipos de práticas, há alguns recursos que podem ajudar – desde guias online até suporte do praticante.</p>



<p>Escolher ferramentas que priorizem sua segurança pode ser outro passo a ser dado. Com frequência, essas ferramentas não são tão utilizadas como suas contrapartes menos seguras, então essa pode ser uma oportunidade para consultar colegas com pensamento similar ou contatar um especialista em tecnologia externo em quem você confie. Algumas dessas ferramentas podem incluir:</p>



 
 Gerenciadores de senhas: Criar senhas fortes e exclusivas é uma parte fundamental ao usar a tecnologia com mais segurança. Gerenciadores de senha podem tanto acompanhar suas senhas usadas como ajudá-lo a criar senhas fortes. <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords" title="">Saiba</a> mais aqui. 



 Ferramentas de comunicação mais seguras: Muitas das mensagens que enviamos digitalmente não são criptografadas, o que significa que, se alguém tentar interceptá-las, poderia ler o conteúdo. Ferramentas de comunicação mais seguras oferecem criptografia, tornando mais difícil que pessoas leiam o conteúdo de suas mensagens. Você pode <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures" title="">aprender mais aqui</a>, ou entrar em contato conosco para auxílio a respeito de adoção de novas ferramentas. 



 Redes privadas virtuais: Uma VPN (virtual private network, em inglês) é uma ferramenta que pode ajudar a proteger sua atividade na web contra vigilância na rede de internet que você está usando. Escolher a VPN certa – e conhecer suas limitações – é crucial, e depende do contexto no qual você está inserido (em qual país está, qual VPN escolheu etc.). Ao mesmo tempo, escolher a VPN certa para a sua situação pode ser complexo, então <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you" title="">se informe mais aqui</a> e não hesite em entrar em contato conosco para obter ajuda. 
 



<p>Sempre tenha em mente que segurança é uma mistura tanto de ferramentas como de práticas. É importante ter as ferramentas corretas, mas é igualmente importante usá-las do jeito correto e construir práticas internas fortes quando o assunto for segurança em geral, levando em consideração segurança física e psicológica também.</p>

 Exploraciones iniciales – pantallazo inicial del panorama tecnológico y de datos 



 P1: Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo? 



<p>La respuesta aquí realmente dependerá del contexto. La tecnología puede ayudarte a organizar el trabajo y las tareas diarias, permitir una comunicación más segura, recopilar y administrar información, y reducir costos y liberar recursos, entre otras cosas. Pero si la tecnología se usa de manera ineficaz o no estratégica, también puede comprometer tu capacidad para hacer el trabajo de manera segura y efectiva.</p>



<p>Por ejemplo, si tu organización está recopilando relatos de primera mano sobre violaciones de derechos humanos en áreas con poca conectividad a Internet/móvil, la adopción de una herramienta de recopilación de datos que requiera una conexión a Internet dificultará tu trabajo y afectará negativamente la capacidad para cumplir tu misión.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Usada de manera no estratégica, la tecnología también puede exponerte a ti y a tus colegas, a nuevas vulnerabilidades y riesgos. Por ejemplo, si te encuentras en un contexto donde la vigilancia gubernamental de la sociedad civil es común, y estás utilizando herramientas que no protegen adecuadamente tus comunicaciones, eso puede comprometer tu trabajo y seguridad.</p>



<p>Para asegurarte de usar la tecnología de manera estratégica y responsable, tómate un tiempo para pensar sobre el modo en que adoptar nuevas tecnologías o recopilar más datos podría fortalecer o debilitar tu trabajo. Antes de adoptar cualquier herramienta o plataforma nueva, intenta desarrollar tu capacidad interna, ponte en contacto con colegas u otras organizaciones que respetes.</p>

 P2: ¿Cómo podemos mi equipo y yo aprender más sobre tecnología y cómo ese aprendizaje es relevante para nuestro trabajo?  



<p>Las tecnologías digitales evolucionan rápidamente, al igual que los debates y las conversaciones sobre los posibles beneficios y efectos nocivos del uso de herramientas y plataformas específicas. Cuando tratamos de aprender más sobre tecnología, encontramos que es más útil enfocarse en dos aspectos:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Trabajar para <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">desarrollar la intuición técnica del personal de manera paulatina y progresiva</a> (inglés), y convertir ese objetivo en una prioridad de todo el equipo tanto como sea posible (a diferencia de un trabajo de una sola persona). 



 En lugar de buscar <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/">herramientas da moda</a> (inglés), primero tratar de identificar cómo la tecnología y los datos podría <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/">fortalecer tu trabajo principal</a> (inglés). 
 



<p>Cuando se trata de nuevas herramientas y aplicaciones, hay mucha información en línea que puede ser atractiva, pero puede ser difícil identificar qué es relevante para ti y qué no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Para entender más fácilmente la información relacionada con la tecnología, comienza primero con el problema que estás tratando de comprender o abordar. Además, si puedes, comunícate con profesionales de ideas afines que puedan tener contextos o misiones similares a los tuyos y aprende más sobre las herramientas que están usando (¡y cuáles han sido sus éxitos y fracasos!).</p>

<p></p>



 P3: Mi organización cree que es hora de comenzar a usar más tecnología y datos en nuestro trabajo. ¿Dónde empezamos?  



<p>¡Primero consigue una perspectiva general clara de lo que ya estás usando! La mayoría de las organizaciones ya están utilizando al menos algo de tecnología y datos para respaldar su trabajo, desde herramientas cotidianas como el correo electrónico o la mensajería instantánea, hasta herramientas y bases de datos de CRM. A continuación, encontrarás una breve lista de preguntas que pueden servir como ejercicio inicial para mapear las formas en que estás utilizando la tecnología y los datos en tu trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nota: parte de la información recopilada mediante este ejercicio de mapeo puede ser confidencial: antes de comenzar, asegúrate de guardar tus notas en un lugar seguro y de compartirlas solo con las personas que necesitan acceso a ellas.</p>



 
 ¿Qué herramientas utilizas actualmente para tu trabajo?
 
 ¿Qué plataformas/herramientas usan tú y tu equipo en sus comunicaciones? Estas podrían incluir correo electrónico, mensajería instantánea, redes sociales, SMS y sitios web, por nombrar algunos. 



 ¿Cómo almacenas y administras tus archivos y documentos? ¿Qué plataformas usas? ¿Todo el&nbsp; equipo usa las mismas plataformas? 



 ¿Estás trabajando en campañas públicas o trabajas en equipo con otras organizaciones? En caso afirmativo, ¿qué herramientas utilizas para el activismo, la organización y la construcción de la comunidad? 



 ¿Estás trabajando con alguna base de datos o plataforma de investigación? 
 
 
 



<p></p>



 
 ¿Cómo estás usando los datos?
 
 ¿Qué tipo de datos/información recopilas o generas día a día? Piensa en tus flujos de trabajo individuales y colectivos y enumera los momentos en los que recopilas o generas datos. Por ejemplo, recopilar información de contacto de las personas que ha entrevistado, tener conversaciones por correo electrónico o Whatsapp, tomar notas de entrevistas o reuniones, o realizar encuestas con las comunidades. 



 ¿Dónde almacenas los datos? Considera los datos que tienes actualmente y enumera todos los lugares en los que están (asegúrate de incluir todas sus ubicaciones remotas: correos electrónicos, documentos compartidos, etc.). 



 ¿Cuándo y cómo compartes los datos? Piensa en los momentos en los que necesitas compartir datos: ¿cuándo suele suceder, con quién los comparte y qué herramientas utilizas? Por ejemplo, puedes enviar hojas de cálculo o archivos PDF por correo electrónico, compartir documentos y actas de reuniones a través de Google Docs o compartir contraseñas a través de una aplicación de mensajería.&nbsp;

<p>En nuestro trabajo de apoyo a las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, a menudo nos enfrentamos a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">presunciones acerca de lo digital siempre es mejor</a> (inglés), y que cualquier solución tecnológica conducirá a una mayor eficiencia, efectividad e impacto.</p>



<p>Pero este no es siempre el caso. Cuando trabajamos con un socio de manera más cercana, a menudo comenzamos a evaluar cómo su uso de datos y tecnología actualmente se relacionan con su trabajo y contexto. Esto puede ayudarnos a descubrir cómo, o incluso si, la forma en que usan la tecnología está fortaleciendo su trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Después de mapear qué herramientas está utilizando la organización y qué datos recopila, almacena y comparte, pasamos a una segunda capa de preguntas: ¿Qué tan útil es todo esto (o qué tan útil podría ser) en el contexto de tu trabajo?:&nbsp;</p>



 
 ¿Cuál es el problema social o político central en el que estás trabajando?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 ¿El uso de tecnología y datos te permite abordar mejor ese problema? Si es así, ¿cómo? Si no, ¿por qué crees que eso podría estar sucediendo? 



 ¿El uso diario de tecnología y datos te ayudan a conectarte con personas u organizaciones importantes para tu trabajo? 



 ¿La forma en que usas la tecnología y los datos está afectando tu carga de trabajo? ¿Está facilitando tu trabajo o la carga de trabajo está siendo insostenible para el equipo? ¿Te gusta usar tus herramientas de organización?

 Tomar decisiones – asegurándote de que los datos y la tecnología que usas coincidan con tus valores y misión 



 P5. ¿Cómo tomamos decisiones sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas y/o la recopilación de datos?  



<p>Hay muchos aspectos a considerar al seleccionar una herramienta, y existen diversas opciones, incluso varias que quizás aún no conozcas. Entonces, ¿cómo empezar a reducir (o ampliar) tus opciones?</p>



<p>En el 2017, en base a nuestra investigación sobre la selección de herramientas en organizaciones de la sociedad civil, elaboramos un <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/">guía interactiva de selección de herramientas llamada Alidade</a> (Inglés), que por medio de preguntas puede ayudar a las organizaciones a decidir qué tipo de herramienta tecnológica mejor se adapta a sus necesidades. ¡Recomendamos probarla!.</p>



<p>En general, cuando las organizaciones buscan nuevas herramientas tecnológicas, hemos constatado que las siguientes pautas resultan beneficiosas:</p>



 
 Investigar a las personas, el problema y luego la tecnología. Analiza el problema general donde piensas que una herramienta tecnológica podría ser útil. Piensa en tu público objetivo. Investiga y examina las diferentes alternativas tecnológicas disponibles.&nbsp; 



 Pensar dos veces antes de construir. Busca herramientas ya existentes acordes a tus necesidades. Construir una herramienta completamente nueva puede ser complejo y arriesgado. 



 Conseguir una segunda opinión. Probablemente alguien más haya intentado un enfoque similar previamente. Encuentra a esa persona y pídele consejos. 



 Siempre hay que probar. Antes de elegir una prueba al menos dos herramientas, con las personas con las que quieres usarlas. Ponerlas a prueba permite detectar problemas. También te permite plantearte preguntas que no se te habían ocurrido. 



 Planificar por si falla. La primera vez puede que no salga bien. Prepara un plan y un presupuesto que te permita ir haciendo ajustes regulares a la herramienta a lo largo del proyecto. 



 Reflexionar sobre lo que estás haciendo. Sigue pensando en lo que funciona y lo que no funciona. Aplica ese aprendizaje al trabajo de tu organización y compártelo con otras organizaciones. 
 



<p>Asegúrate de que las herramientas que elijas también se adapten a tus necesidades de seguridad. Al evaluar la seguridad de una herramienta, considera lo siguiente:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 ¿Cuál es la política de privacidad de datos de la herramienta? ¿Qué tipo de datos recopila la herramienta y con quién se comparten esos datos? ¿Quién tiene acceso a los datos almacenados dentro de la herramienta? 



 ¿Está bien documentado el enfoque de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta? ¿Qué puedes averiguar sobre el historial de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta? 
 



<p>Documenta tus hallazgos y coméntalos con tus colegas antes de tomar una decisión final sobre una herramienta.</p>



<p>Preguntas relacionadas:<br>– <a title="Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo?">Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo?</a><br>– <a title="¿Cómo podemos mi equipo y yo aprender más sobre tecnología y cómo ese aprendizaje es relevante para nuestro trabajo?

 P6: Mi organización quiere integrar nuevas tecnologías, pero no hemos encontrado la herramienta adecuada. ¿Deberíamos construir una nueva herramienta? 



<p>Si estás familiarizado con nuestro trabajo, probablemente sepas que a menudo estamos a favor de adaptar las herramientas existentes a tus necesidades siempre que sea posible (llamamos a esto “reutilización de herramientas”).</p>



<p>Nuestra investigación en esta área en los últimos años ha demostrado que la reutilización y la adaptación de las herramientas existentes puede tener una serie de ventajas, como el uso más eficiente de los recursos financieros y el aumento del acceso al apoyo en la implementación y el mantenimiento.</p>



<p>Desarrollar una herramienta desde cero, por otro lado, este puede ser un proceso prolongado y costoso, con resultados decepcionantes: hemos visto cómo las herramientas pueden terminar siendo ineficaces o poco utilizadas, resultar inesperadamente onerosas o requerir para su mantenimiento y actualización del empleo intensivo de recursos.</p>



<p>Pero si la funcionalidad que tu organización está buscando no está disponible y, estás considerando construir una nueva herramienta, aquí hay algunas preguntas para reflexionar al respecto:</p>



 
 ¿Existe una necesidad real e identificable de esta herramienta? ¿Esto te acercará más a tus objetivos a largo plazo? ¿La construcción de una herramienta respondería a una fuerte necesidad que ha surgido durante tu trabajo, o la idea tuvo otro origen? 



 ¿Cuentas con los recursos necesarios para construir la herramienta, mantenerla a largo plazo y brindar apoyo continuo a quienes la utilizarán? 



 ¿Cuál es tu visión para la herramienta a largo plazo? ¿Podrían las necesidades o problemas que se está construyendo la herramienta para abordar potencialmente evolucionar con el tiempo?

 P7. ¿Cómo puedo usar tecnología/datos si mi acceso a Internet o a la electricidad no es confiable?  



<p>Si tienes problemas de acceso intermitente a Internet, considera la adopción de herramientas que te posibiliten trabajar tanto en línea como sin conexión. En Google Docs, por ejemplo, puedes <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102?hl=es">habilitar el acceso offline a los documentos</a> . Esto te permitirá continuar trabajando sin conexión y luego sincronizar los documentos una vez que se restablezca la conectividad. Algunas herramientas de recopilación y gestión de datos, como <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, te permite recopilar datos en dispositivos cuando no tienes conexión, y luego cargar datos al servidor una vez que la red esté disponible. Para reuniones en línea en entornos de baja conectividad, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> es una opción gratuita, de código abierto y liviana para llamadas de solo audio.</p>



<p>Si el presupuesto de tu organización lo permite, también recomendamos invertir en una conexión de respaldo: por ejemplo, una conexión de red móvil para conectar sus dispositivos cuando su conexión de banda ancha no esté disponible.</p>



<p>Hay dos formas de hacerlo: usando un módem de Internet móvil o un teléfono inteligente para crear un punto de acceso móvil donde otros dispositivos pueden conectarse y compartir la conectividad móvil. Aquí hay un breve tutorial sobre <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">Cómo crear un punto de acceso móvil en un teléfono inteligente Android</a> (Inglés). Puedes reducir el consumo de datos compartiendo la contraseña de acceso solo con dispositivos y personas imprescindibles.</p>



<p>En los casos en que la conexión a Internet y/o la electricidad sean intermitentes y estés trabajando en línea, asegúrate de guardar tu trabajo con la mayor frecuencia posible para minimizar el riesgo de perderlo.</p>



<p>Si con frecuencia sufres cortes de electricidad, adquirir un generador de respaldo puede ser una opción útil, siempre que tu organización cuente con los recursos para hacerlo.</p>

 P8. ¿Cómo trabajar con personas desarrolladoras y/o expertas en temas de tecnología? 



<p>Hay muchos tipos diferentes de profesionales con los que puedes trabajar. Entre las profesiones que interactúan con mayor frecuencia con tecnología y datos se encuentran:</p>



 
 Diseño de experiencia de usuario (UX): Trabaja tanto con clientes (¡en este caso, contigo!) como con usuarios para diseñar un producto que satisfaga múltiples necesidades y sea fácil de entender y operar.&nbsp; 



 Diseño visual o gráfico: Supervisa los elementos gráficos que utilizará un sitio web, una herramienta, una aplicación o una publicación, y es responsable de diseñar la identidad visual (o la marca). A menudo trabajan con la persona encargada de diseño de UX para asegurarse de que la identidad visual también funcione bien para las personas usuarias. 



 Ilustración: Crea ilustraciones, íconos, infografías, etc., que vivirán dentro de la estructura más grande que han creado el diseñador visual y el diseñador UX. 



 Desarrollo Frontend: Implementa el diseño en un sitio web, herramienta o aplicación. En particular, es capaz de codificar los aspectos que los usuarios verán y con los que interactuarán. 



 Desarrollo Backend: Desarrolla y conecta una base de datos al frontend (las partes del sitio web, la aplicación o la herramienta que un usuario puede ver) y realiza todas las tareas no visibles que llenarán el frontend con contenido dinámico. 



 Análisis de datos: Extrae patrones de grandes volúmenes de datos. También pueden estar equipados con las herramientas y el conocimiento para crear visualizaciones de datos para comunicar patrones importantes. 



 Sysadmin/DevOps: Mantiene los servidores donde vive el sitio web, la herramienta o la aplicación. A menudo son responsables de coordinar el procedimiento necesario para resolver problemas cuando los usuarios detectan errores o fallos. 
 



<p>A veces, los roles pueden superponerse: por ejemplo, puedes contratar a una persona que lidere el diseño y desarrollo de un sitio web, o una persona desarrolladora que sea capaz de trabajar tanto en el frontend como en el backend.</p>



<p>Antes de contratar personas desarrolladoras y tecnólogas externas, es útil que:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Seas claro acerca de por qué deseas crear o adoptar nuevas herramientas. 



 Identifiques los recursos que tienes y los que necesitarás. 



 Te acuerdes de planificar el mantenimiento a largo plazo. 
 



<p>Cuando comiencen a trabajar juntos es importante establecer puntos de coincidencia y una terminología compartida acerca de las necesidades y expectativas. Recomendamos redactar los TdR (Términos de Referencia) para documentar y compartir las necesidades y requisitos del proyecto. Los TdR deben cubrir como mínimo:</p>



 
 El presupuesto disponible del proyecto. 



 La línea de tiempo necesaria 



 Tus objetivos 



 Tus expectativas para el socio externo 



 Cualquier información adicional 
 



<p>También deben ponerse de acuerdo en lo referido a herramientas, canales de comunicación, roles y responsabilidades.</p>



<p>Todo esto puede contribuir en gran medida al éxito del proyecto desde el principio. Algunos items de la lista de tareas del trabajo con consultores una vez que el proceso está en marcha son:</p>



 
 Concéntrate en la claridad de los objetivos organizacionales, los grandes procesos y los hitos para apoyar mejor al equipo/proyecto. 



 Brinda retroalimentación relevante y oportuna. 



 Proporciona espacio y muestra respeto por la experiencia del consultor. 



 Trata de mantener una comunicación frecuente.

 P9. Mi organización hace mucho de nuestro trabajo en línea, pero nuestra colaboración no siempre funciona tan bien. ¿Cómo podemos hacer que la colaboración en línea funcione mejor? 



<p>Sabemos de primera mano que cuando se trata de colaborar en línea, encontrar la forma correcta de comunicarse es esencial, tanto para trabajar sin problemas como para el bienestar general.</p>



<p>Idealmente, tu equipo tendrá una selección de herramientas o canales para usar (por ejemplo, una combinación de aplicaciones de chat seguras, correo electrónico y herramientas de gestión de proyectos), pero es importante que cada uno de estos tenga una función clara.</p>



<p>A menudo, nuestros socios usan tantas herramientas diferentes que se sienten abrumados cada vez que necesitan compartir un documento, una idea o un mensaje. Si este es el caso de tu organización, destina un tiempo para anotar rápidamente todas las diversas herramientas que usan para comunicarse; la lista podría incluir aplicaciones como Signal y Whatsapp, plataformas de mensajería como Slack y Mattermost, CRM en línea como Salesforce, herramientas de VOIP como Skype, Zoom o Jitsi Meet, y herramientas de colaboración como Trello, Airtable, Asana y otras. Quizás también usan mensajes SMS y llamadas telefónicas.</p>



<p>Una vez que tengas esta lista, te sugerimos que te reúnas con tus colegas, o con las personas con las que colaboras más a menudo, para de manera consensuada intentar usar menos herramientas. Asigna a cada herramienta un propósito específico: por ejemplo, tal vez el correo electrónico sea para mensajes más largos que no sean sensibles al tiempo o para compartir documentos, mientras que los programas de mensajería son solo para preguntas urgentes o conversaciones amistosas.</p>



<p>Una vez que hayas identificado algunas cosas que funcionan, ¡documenta los aprendizajes! La documentación asegurará que todos estén en la misma página y que sea una gran referencia para cualquier persona nueva que se una al equipo o para permanecer consciente de los procesos/proyectos.</p>

 Centrar esfuerzos en torno a la seguridad y el cuidado 



 P10: ¿Cómo puedo asegurarme de que todo mi equipo esté utilizando las herramientas (o procesos de datos) que hemos elegido? 



<p>Incluso cuando estamos entusiasmados con una nueva herramienta tecnológica o un proceso para el uso de datos, es difícil adoptar nuevas formas de trabajar. Al mismo tiempo, asegurarnos de que estamos utilizando las herramientas que acordamos usar (y sus protocolos de seguridad o protección relevantes) es una manera importante de poner en práctica el cuidado mutuo en las organizaciones.</p>



<p>Una medida para ayudarnos mutuamente en la adopción de una nueva forma de trabajar es asegurarnos de que la nueva herramienta o protocolo responda a una necesidad concreta y que todos sepan cuál es esa necesidad. Esto significa que todos saben que el esfuerzo que realizan para aprender a usar la nueva herramienta, los acercará a encontrar una solución a un problema que venían enfrentando.</p>



<p>Al mismo tiempo, es importante gestionar las expectativas: los cambios posiblemente se empiecen a notar poco a poco, con el tiempo, a medida que más personas usan una herramienta o protocolo y se familiarizan con él. Eso es parte del proceso.</p>



<p>Y, como es un proceso, es bueno dejar espacio y tiempo para el aprendizaje, la adaptación y el debate cuando se implementa una nueva herramienta. Dependiendo de qué más esté pasando, las capacidades para aprender algo nuevo pueden variar entre los equipos, y dar espacio puede ser la mejor manera de reconocer esto.</p>



<p>Finalmente, escuchar las experiencias de aquellas personas que usan la nueva herramienta pueden ayudarte a detectar eventuales ajustes que quieras hacer en la herramienta como tal o en el modo en que se utiliza.&nbsp;</p>

 P11: ¿Qué podemos hacer para mantener a las personas más seguras cuando comenzamos a usar diferentes herramientas tecnológicas y prácticas de datos? 



<p>Muchas de las personas con las que hablamos tienen curiosidad sobre cómo incorporar la seguridad y el cuidado en todo el trabajo que realizan, especialmente cuando se trata de nuevas iniciativas de tecnología y datos. Cuando en las noticias, en nuestras comunidades y por experiencias personales nos enteramos de casos de fugas de datos y de hackeos a herramientas,&nbsp; incorporar de manera segura herramientas o procesos tecnológicos puede resultar una tarea ardua.</p>



<p>Un enfoque que puede contribuir a la construcción de una base adecuada es el de Datos Responsables (Responsible Data): la idea de que compartimos un “deber colectivo de dar cuenta de las consecuencias no deseadas de trabajar con datos.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Algunas áreas para explorar que caen bajo el paraguas de Datos Responsables son:</p>



 
 Prácticas como la minimización de datos (solo recopilar los datos necesarios). 



 Conceptos como el consentimiento (asegurando que las personas puedan aceptar cómo se utilizarán sus datos de una manera libremente dada, específica, informada y revocable). 



 Espacios relacionados como la <a href="https://wiki.orgsec.community/">seguridad organizacional</a> (un área rica de práctica en torno al establecimiento de protocolos que pueden ayudar a construir seguridad de datos/información y bienestar físico y seguridad). 
 



<p>Si no estás familiarizado con este tipo de prácticas, existen recursos que pueden ayudarte, desde guías en línea hasta apoyo para profesionales.</p>



<p>Seleccionar herramientas que prioricen tu seguridad puede ser otro paso a seguir. A menudo, estas herramientas no se usan tanto como sus contrapartes menos seguras, por lo que esta podría ser una oportunidad para consultar con colegas de ideas afines o para contactar a una consultoría tecnológica externa de tu confianza. Algunas de estas herramientas podrían incluir:</p>



 
 Gestores de contraseñas: Crear contraseñas fuertes y únicas es una parte fundamental del uso de la tecnología de manera más segura. Los administradores de contraseñas pueden realizar un seguimiento de tus contraseñas y ayudarte a crear buenas contraseñas.&nbsp; <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">Aprende más aquí</a> (Inglés). 



 Herramientas de comunicación más seguras: Muchos mensajes que enviamos digitalmente no están encriptados, lo que significa que si alguien los interceptara, podría leer el contenido. Las herramientas de comunicaciones más seguras ofrecen cifrado, lo que dificulta que las personas lean el contenido de tus mensajes. Puedes&nbsp; <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures">aprender más aquí</a> (Inglés), o puedes <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener ayuda sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas. 



 Redes privadas virtuales: Una VPN (red virtual privada) es una herramienta que puede ayudar a proteger tu actividad web de la vigilancia en la red de Internet que estás utilizando. Elegir la VPN correcta, y conocer sus limitaciones, es crucial y depende del contexto en el que te encuentres (en qué país estés, qué VPN elijas, etc.). Al mismo tiempo, elegir la VPN adecuada para tu situación puede ser complejo, así que puedes <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">conseguir información aquí</a> y no dudes en <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener apoyo.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Siempre ten en cuenta que la seguridad es una combinación de herramientas y prácticas. Así como contar con las herramientas adecuadas es importante, usarlas de la manera correcta y desarrollar prácticas internas sólidas en torno a la seguridad en general, teniendo en cuenta la seguridad física y psicológica también lo es.</p>

<p>Avant de commencer, qu’est-ce que nous entendons par les données (data)? Et la technologie? Il y a de fortes chances que vous travailliez avec les deux! <br><br>Nous définissons les données comme des informations devant être traitées, organisées et structurées pour être utilisables. En d’autres termes, par données, nous entendons les informations que vous détenez, telles que les détails sur les communautés avec lesquelles vous travaillez, les résultats des recherches que vous avez menées, les aboutissements d’enquêtes, les adresses électroniques et&nbsp; les coordonnées des partisans, etc.<br><br>Nous entendons par technologie les outils, systèmes, méthodes et processus qui tirent parti de la puissance de calcul pour gérer, analyser et communiquer des informations. Pour cette ressource, lorsque nous parlons de technologie, nous entendons les outils numériques au sens large. Il peut s’agir de plateformes de messagerie, d’applications de messagerie, d’hébergeurs de sites Web, de plateformes de newsletter, de CRM, de bases de données, de processus algorithmiques, etc.</p>

 Explorations initiales – se faire une idée de votre propre paysage technologique et de données 



 Q1: Nos pairs semblent utiliser davantage de technologie et de données. Devrions-nous également envisager d’utiliser davantage de technologie et de données dans notre travail ? 



<p>La réponse à cette question dépend du contexte. La technologie peut vous aider à organiser votre travail et vos opérations quotidiennes, à permettre une communication plus sûre, à collecter et à gérer des informations, à réduire les coûts et à libérer des ressources, entre autres choses. Mais si elle est utilisée de manière inefficace ou non stratégique, la technologie peut également compromettre votre capacité à effectuer votre travail de manière sûre et efficace.</p>



<p>Par exemple, si votre organisation recueille des témoignages de première main sur des violations des droits de l’homme dans des zones où la connectivité internet/mobile est faible, l’adoption d’un outil de collecte de données nécessitant une connexion internet rendra votre travail difficile et aura un impact négatif sur votre capacité à mener à bien votre mission.</p>



<p>Utilisée de manière non stratégique, la technologie peut également vous exposer, ainsi que ceux avec qui vous travaillez, à de nouvelles vulnérabilités et à de nouveaux risques. Par exemple, si vous vous trouvez dans un contexte où la surveillance de la société civile par le gouvernement est courante et que vous utilisez des outils qui ne protègent pas adéquatement vos communications, cela peut compromettre votre travail et votre sécurité.</p>



<p>Pour vous assurer que vous utilisez les technologies de manière stratégique et responsable, prenez le temps de réfléchir à la manière dont l’adoption de nouvelles technologies ou la collecte de données supplémentaires pourrait renforcer ou affaiblir votre travail. Avant d’adopter un nouvel outil ou une nouvelle plateforme, essayez de renforcer vos capacités internes, de vous mettre en relation avec vos pairs ou avec d’autres organisations que vous respectez.</p>

 Q2: Comment mon équipe et moi-même pouvons-nous en apprendre davantage sur les technologies et leur pertinence pour notre travail ?  



<p>Les technologies numériques évoluent rapidement, tout comme les débats et les conversations sur les avantages et les inconvénients potentiels de l’utilisation d’outils et de plateformes spécifiques. Lorsque nous essayons d’en savoir plus sur la technologie, nous trouvons qu’il est plus utile de se concentrer sur deux choses :&nbsp;</p>

 Au lieu de chercher de <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/" title="">de nouveaux outils</a>, essayez d’abord d’identifier comment la technologie et les données pourraient <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/" title="">renforcer votre travail de base</a>. 
 



<p>Lorsqu’il s’agit de nouveaux outils et applications, il y a beaucoup d’informations en ligne qui peuvent être attrayantes – mais il peut être difficile d’identifier ce qui est pertinent pour vous, et ce qui ne l’est pas.&nbsp;<br>Pour mieux comprendre les informations techniques, commencez par le problème que vous essayez de comprendre ou de résoudre. En outre, si vous le pouvez, établissez des contacts avec des praticien·nes partageant les mêmes idées et ayant éventuellement des contextes ou des missions similaires aux vôtres, et apprenez davantage sur les outils qu’ils/elles utilisent (ainsi que sur leurs réussites et leurs difficultés!).</p>

 Q3 : Mon organisation pense qu’il est temps de commencer à utiliser davantage de technologie et de données dans notre travail. Par où commencer ?  



<p>Commencez par avoir une vue d’ensemble claire de ce que vous utilisez déjà ! La plupart des organisations utilisent déjà au moins un peu de technologie et de données pour soutenir leur travail – des outils quotidiens tels que l’e-mail ou la messagerie instantanée, aux outils de CRM et aux bases de données. Ci-dessous une courte liste de questions qui peuvent servir d’exercice initial pour déterminer comment vous utilisez les technologies et les données dans votre travail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remarque : certaines des informations que vous recueillerez dans le cadre de cet exercice de cartographie peuvent être sensibles : avant de commencer, assurez-vous que vos notes sont stockées dans un endroit sûr et qu’elles ne sont partagées qu’avec les personnes qui doivent y avoir accès.</p>



 
 Quels outils utilisez-vous actuellement pour votre travail ?&nbsp;
 
 Avec quelles plateformes/outils communiquez-vous, vous et votre équipe ? Il peut s’agir de courriels, de messageries instantanées, de médias sociaux, de SMS et de sites Web, pour n’en citer que quelques-uns.  



 Comment stockez-vous et gérez-vous vos fichiers et vos documents ? Quelles plateformes utilisez-vous ? Est-ce que tous les membres de votre équipe utilisent les mêmes plateformes ? 



 Travaillez-vous sur des campagnes publiques ou faites-vous partie d’efforts collectifs avec d’autres organisations ? Si oui, quels outils utilisez-vous pour le militantisme, l’organisation et la construction de la communauté ? 



 Travaillez-vous avec des bases de données ou des plateformes de recherche ? 
 
 
 



<p></p>



 
 Comment utilisez-vous les données ? 
 
 Quel type de données/informations recueillez-vous ou générez-vous au quotidien ? Réfléchissez à vos flux de travail individuels et collectifs et dressez la liste des moments où vous collectez ou générez des données. Par exemple, recueillir les coordonnées des personnes que vous avez interrogées, avoir des discussions par courriel ou Whatsapp, prendre des notes d’entretien ou de réunion, ou mener des enquêtes auprès des communautés 



 Où stockez-vous les données ? Considérez les données dont vous disposez actuellement et dressez la liste de tous les endroits où elles vivent (veillez à inclure tous vos emplacements distants – courriels, documents partagés, et ainsi de suite). 



 Quand et comment partagez-vous les données ? Réfléchissez aux moments où vous devez partager des données : quand cela se produit-il généralement, avec qui le faites-vous et quels outils utilisez-vous ? Par exemple, vous pourriez envoyer des feuilles de calcul ou des PDF par courrier électronique, partager des documents et des comptes rendus de réunion via Google Docs, ou partager des mots de passe via une application de messagerie. 
 
 
 



<p>Il s’agit là de questions exploratoires initiales.&nbsp; Pour une version complète de cet exercice de cartographie, voir <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD!</a> (publié en 2021), ou <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">reach out to our team</a>.</p>



<p>Enfin, l’adoption de nouveaux outils demande du temps et des ressources. Assurez-vous de vous accorder, ainsi que votre équipe, des espaces dédiés à l’apprentissage d’outils peu familiers, à la pratique de comportements et à la mise à niveau avec les nouvelles données utilisées.</p>

 Q4 : Comment puis-je m’assurer que les outils tech et les données que nous utilisons sont réellement utiles à notre travail ? 



<p>Dans notre travail de soutien aux organisations de la société civile, nous sommes souvent confronté·es à des <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">suppositions que le numérique signifie mieux</a>, et que toute solution tech permettra d’accroître l’efficacité, l’efficience et l’impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mais ce n’est pas toujours le cas. Lorsque nous travaillons de manière plus intensive avec un·e partenaire, nous commençons souvent par évaluer comment son utilisation des technologies et des données correspond actuellement à son travail et à son contexte.&nbsp; Cela peut nous aider à comprendre comment, ou même si, la façon dont ils/elles utilisent la technologie renforce leur travail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Après avoir recensé les outils utilisés par l’organisation et les données collectées, stockées et partagées, nous passons à une deuxième série de questions : Quelle est l’utilité de tout cela (ou quelle pourrait être son utilité) dans le contexte de votre travail :&nbsp;</p>



 
 Quel est le problème social ou politique central sur lequel vous travaillez ?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Votre utilisation des technologies et des données vous soutient-elle dans la résolution de ce problème ? Si oui, comment ? Si non, pourquoi pensez-vous que cela pourrait se produire ?&nbsp; 



 Votre utilisation quotidienne des technologies et des données vous aide-t-elle à vous connecter avec des individus ou des organisations importants pour votre travail ? 



 La façon dont vous utilisez la technologie et les données a-t-elle un impact sur votre charge de travail ? Facilite-t-elle votre travail ou crée-t-elle une quantité de travail insoutenable pour l’équipe ? Aimez-vous utiliser vos outils organisationnels ?

 Prendre des décisions – s’assurer que les données et les technologies que vous utilisez correspondent à vos valeurs et à votre mission. 



 Q5. Comment prenons-nous les décisions concernant l’adoption de nouveaux outils et/ou la collecte de données ? 



<p>Il y a beaucoup de choses à prendre en compte lors du choix d’un outil, et il existe de nombreuses options, dont certaines que vous ne connaissez peut-être pas encore. Alors comment commencer à réduire (ou à élargir) vos options ?&nbsp;</p>



<p>En 2017, sur la base des recherches que nous avons menées sur la sélection d’outils dans les organisations de la société civile, nous avons créé un <a href="https://alidade.tech/" title="guide de sélection d'outils interactif nommé Alidade">guide de sélection d’outils interactif nommé Alidade</a>, qui fait passer les organisations par des questions pouvant les aider à décider du genre d’outil technologique qui correspondrait à leur projet ou à leurs besoins organisationnels. Nous vous recommandons de l’essayer !</p>



<p>En général, lorsque les organisations sont à la recherche de nouveaux outils technologiques, nous avons constaté que les lignes directrices suivantes sont utiles :</p>



<p>1. Faites des recherches sur les personnes, le problème, puis la technologie. Examinez le problème global pour lequel vous pensez qu’un outil technologique pourrait être utile. Pensez à votre public cible. Faites des recherches et examinez les différentes options technologiques disponibles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Réfléchissez à deux fois avant de construire. Recherchez les outils existants qui peuvent faire ce dont vous avez besoin. La création d’un outil entièrement nouveau peut être complexe et risquée.</p>



<p>3. Demandez un deuxième avis. Quelqu’un·e d’autre a probablement essayé une approche similaire avant vous. Trouvez-le·la et demandez-lui conseil.</p>



<p>4. Faites toujours un essai. Essayez au moins deux outils, avec les personnes que vous souhaitez voir les utiliser, avant de choisir. L’essai met en évidence les problèmes dès le départ. Il permet également de soulever des questions dont vous ne soupçonniez pas l’existence.</p>



<p>5. Prévoyez l’échec. Vous ne réussirez pas du premier coup. Prévoyez un budget et des ajustements réguliers de l’outil tout au long du projet.</p>



<p>6. Réfléchissez à ce que vous faites. Continuez à réfléchir à ce qui fonctionne et à ce qui ne fonctionne pas. Appliquez ce que vous apprenez au travail de votre organisation, et partagez avec d’autres organisations.</p>



<p>Assurez-vous que les outils que vous choisissez répondent également à vos besoins en matière de sécurité. Lorsque vous évaluez la sécurité d’un outil, prenez en considération ce qui suit :&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Quelle est la politique de confidentialité des données de l’outil ? Quel type de données l’outil collecte-t-il et avec qui ces données sont-elles partagées ? Qui a accès aux données stockées dans l’outil ?&nbsp; 



 L’approche de l’outil en matière de confidentialité et de sécurité est-elle bien documentée ? Que pouvez-vous découvrir sur le bilan de l’outil en matière de confidentialité et de sécurité ?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Documentez et discutez de vos conclusions avec vos collègues avant de prendre une décision finale sur un outil.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Questions connexes :<br>– <a title="">Devrions-nous également envisager d’utiliser davantage de technologie et de données dans notre travail ?</a><br>– <a title="">Comment mon équipe et moi-même pouvons-nous en apprendre davantage sur les technologies et leur pertinence pour notre travail ?</a></p>

 Q6 : Mon organisation souhaite intégrer de nouvelles technologies, mais nous n’avons pas trouvé le bon outil. Devrions-nous créer un nouvel outil nous-mêmes ? 



<p>Si vous connaissez bien notre travail, vous savez probablement que nous préconisons souvent d’adapter les outils existants à vos propres besoins lorsque cela est possible (nous appelons cela la “réutilisation des outils”).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Les recherches que nous avons menées dans ce domaine ces dernières années ont montré que la réutilisation et l’adaptation d’outils existants peuvent présenter un certain nombre d’avantages, comme une utilisation plus efficace des ressources financières et un meilleur accès à l’aide à la mise en œuvre et à la maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Créer un outil à partir de zéro, en revanche, peut être un processus long et coûteux en ressources, qui peut conduire à des déceptions : Nous avons vu comment les outils peuvent s’avérer inefficaces ou sous-utilisés, être étonnamment onéreux ou exiger des ressources intensives pour être maintenus ou mis à jour.</p>



<p>Mais si la fonctionnalité recherchée par votre organisation est tout simplement introuvable, et que vous envisagez de construire un nouvel outil, voici quelques questions auxquelles réfléchir :</p>



 
 Existe-t-il un besoin réel et identifiable pour cet outil ? Cela vous permettra-t-il de vous rapprocher de vos objectifs à long terme ? La construction d’un outil répondrait-elle à un besoin fort qui s’est manifesté dans votre travail, ou l’idée est-elle née d’autres manières ? 



 Disposez-vous des ressources nécessaires pour construire l’outil, l’entretenir sur le long terme et fournir un soutien continu à ceux/celles qui l’utiliseront ? 



 Quelle est votre vision de l’outil à long terme ? Les besoins ou les problèmes pour lesquels l’outil est construit pourraient-ils potentiellement évoluer avec le temps ?

 Q7. Comment puis-je utiliser les technologies/données si mon accès à Internet ou à l’électricité n’est pas fiable ? 



<p>Si vous êtes aux prises avec un accès intermittent à Internet, envisagez d’adopter des outils qui vous permettent de travailler à la fois en ligne et hors ligne. Dans Google Docs, par exemple, vous pouvez <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012?hl=pt-BR&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" title="activer l'accès hors ligne aux documents">activer l’accès hors ligne aux documents</a>. Cela vous permettra de poursuivre votre travail hors ligne, puis de synchroniser les documents une fois la connectivité rétablie. Certains outils de collecte et de gestion des données, tels que <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/" title="">Kobo ToolBox</a>, vous permettent également de collecter des données sur des appareils lorsque vous n’avez pas de connectivité, puis de les télécharger sur le serveur une fois le réseau disponible. Pour les réunions en ligne dans des environnements à faible connectivité, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/" title="">Mumble</a> est une option gratuite, open source et légère pour les appels audio uniquement.</p>



<p>Si le budget de votre organisation le permet, nous vous recommandons également d’investir dans une connexion de secours : par exemple, une connexion de réseau mobile à laquelle connecter vos appareils lorsque votre connexion haut débit n’est pas disponible.</p>



<p>Il y a deux façons de procéder : Utiliser un modem internet mobile, ou utiliser un smartphone dédié pour créer un hotspot mobile où d’autres appareils peuvent se connecter et partager la connectivité mobile. Voici un bref tutoriel sur la façon de <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915" title="créer un hotspot mobile sur un smartphone Android ">créer un hotspot mobile sur un smartphone Android</a>. Vous pouvez limiter la quantité de données utilisées en partageant le mot de passe d’accès avec les seuls appareils ou utilisateurs critiques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dans les cas où la connexion internet et/ou l’électricité sont intermittentes et que vous travaillez en ligne, veillez à sauvegarder votre travail aussi souvent que possible, afin de réduire le risque de perte de travail.&nbsp;<br>Si vous êtes souvent confronté·e à des pénuries d’électricité, l’acquisition d’un générateur de secours peut être une option utile, pour autant que vous disposiez des ressources organisationnelles nécessaires pour ce faire.</p>

 Q8. Comment puis-je travailler avec des développeurs·euses et/ou des technologues externes ? 



<p>Il existe de nombreux types différents d’expert·es externes avec lesquel·les vous pouvez travailler. Les types courants de consultant·es/expert·es externes qui interagissent avec la technologie ou les données comprennent :</p>



 
 Concepteur·trice d’expérience utilisateur·trice (UX) : Travaille à la fois avec les client·es (dans ce cas, c’est vous !) et les utilisateur·trices pour concevoir un produit qui satisfait des besoins multiples et qui est facile à comprendre et à utiliser.&nbsp; 



 Concepteur·trice visuel·le ou graphique : Supervise les éléments graphiques qu’un site web, un outil, une appli ou une publication utilisera, et est responsable de la conception de l’identité visuelle (ou branding). Il travaille souvent avec le/la designer UX pour s’assurer que l’identité visuelle fonctionne bien pour les utilisateur·trices, également. 



 Illustrateur·trice : Crée des illustrations, des icônes, des infographies et autres, qui vivront dans la structure plus large que le concepteur·trice visuel·le et le/la concepteur·trice UX ont créée. 



 Développeur·euse front-end : Met en œuvre le design sur un site web, un outil ou une application. En particulier, est capable de coder les aspects que les utilisateur·trices verront et avec lesquels ils/elles interagiront.&nbsp; 



 Développeur·euse back-end : Développe et connecte une base de données au front-end (les parties du site web, de l’appli ou de l’outil qu’un/une utilisateur·trice peut voir) et effectue toutes les tâches non visibles qui rempliront le front-end de contenu dynamique.&nbsp; 



 Analyste de données/scientifique : Extrait des modèles à partir de grands volumes de données. Il/elle peut également être équipé·e des outils et des connaissances nécessaires pour créer des visualisations de données afin de communiquer des modèles importants.  



 Sysadmin/DevOps : il/elle assure la maintenance des serveurs où vit le site web, l’outil ou l’appli. Il/elle est souvent chargé·e de coordonner le dépannage nécessaire si les utilisateur·trices rencontrent des bugs ou des erreurs. 
 



<p>Parfois, les rôles peuvent se chevaucher : par exemple, vous pouvez engager un/une consultant·e qui dirige la conception et le développement d’un site Web, ou un/une développeur·euse capable de travailler à la fois sur le front-end et le back-end.</p>



<p>Avant d’engager des développeur·euses et des technologues externes, il est utile d’/de :&nbsp;</p>



 
 Être clair·e sur les raisons pour lesquelles vous souhaitez construire ou adopter de nouveaux outils. 



 Identifier les ressources dont vous disposez et celles dont vous aurez besoin. 



 Se rappeler de planifier la maintenance à long terme.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Au début de votre travail commun, il est important d’établir un terrain d’entente et une terminologie partagée sur les besoins et les attentes. Nous recommandons d’élaborer un TdR (termes de référence) afin de documenter et de partager les besoins et les exigences du projet. Les TdR doivent couvrir au minimum les points suivants&nbsp;:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Le budget disponible pour le projet 



 Le calendrier nécessaire 



 Vos objectifs 



 Vos attentes à l’égard du/de la partenaire externe 



 Toute information supplémentaire 
 



<p>Vous devez également vous mettre d’accord sur les outils, les canaux de communication, les rôles et les responsabilités.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tout cela peut grandement contribuer à la réussite du projet dès le début. Voici quelques “choses à faire” lorsque vous travaillez avec des consultant·es une fois le travail en cours :&nbsp;</p>



 
 Se concentrer sur la clarté des objectifs organisationnels, des grands processus et des jalons afin de mieux soutenir l’équipe/le projet. 



 Fournir un retour d’information pertinent et opportun. 



 Offrez de l’espace et du respect pour l’expertise du/de la consultant·e. 



 Essayez d’être réactif·ve en matière de communication.

 Q9. Mon organisation effectue une grande partie de son travail en ligne, mais notre collaboration ne fonctionne pas toujours aussi bien. Comment pouvons-nous faire en sorte que la collaboration en ligne fonctionne mieux pour nous ? 



<p>Nous savons d’expérience que, lorsqu’il s’agit de collaborer en ligne, il est essentiel de trouver le bon moyen de communiquer, aussi bien pour le bon déroulement du travail que pour le bien-être général.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Idéalement, votre équipe disposera d’une sélection d’outils ou de canaux à utiliser (par exemple, un mélange d’applications de chat sécurisées, d’e-mails et d’outils de gestion de projet), mais il est important que chacun d’entre eux ait un rôle clair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Souvent, nos partenaires utilisent tellement d’outils différents qu’ils/elles se sentent dépassé·es chaque fois qu’ils/elles doivent partager un document, une idée ou un message. Si c’est le cas pour votre organisation, prenez le temps de noter rapidement tous les différents outils par lesquels les gens communiquent – il peut s’agir d’applications comme Signal et Whatsapp, de plateformes de messagerie comme Slack et Mattermost, de CRM en ligne comme Salesforce, d’outils de voix sur IP comme Skype, Zoom ou Jitsi Meet, et d’outils de collaboration comme Trello, Airtable, Asana et autres. Peut-être utilisez-vous également des SMS et des appels téléphoniques.</p>



<p>Une fois cette liste établie, nous vous suggérons de vous réunir avec vos collègues, ou les personnes avec lesquelles vous collaborez le plus souvent, pour convenir d’essayer d’utiliser moins d’outils. Attribuez à chaque outil un objectif spécifique : par exemple, le courrier électronique est peut-être destiné aux messages plus longs qui ne sont pas sensibles au facteur temps, ou au partage de documents, tandis que les programmes de messagerie sont réservés aux questions urgentes ou aux conversations amicales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Une fois que vous avez identifié quelques éléments qui fonctionnent, documentez-les ! La documentation permettra de s’assurer que tout le monde est sur la même longueur d’onde et constituera une excellente référence pour toute nouvelle personne rejoignant l’équipe ou pour rester au courant des processus/projets.</p>

 Centrer la sécurité et les soins 



 Q10 : Comment puis-je m’assurer que toute mon équipe utilise les outils (ou les processus de données) que nous avons choisis ? 



<p>Même lorsque nous sommes enthousiasmé·es par un nouvel outil technologique ou un nouveau processus d’utilisation des données, il est difficile d’adopter réellement de nouvelles méthodes de travail. En même temps, s’assurer que nous utilisons les outils convenus (et leurs protocoles de sûreté ou de sécurité) est un moyen important de faire preuve de bienveillance les uns/unes envers les autres dans les organisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>L’une des mesures à prendre pour s’aider mutuellement à adopter une nouvelle méthode de travail consiste à s’assurer que le nouvel outil ou protocole répond à un besoin concret et que chacun·e sait de quoi il s’agit. Ainsi, chacun·e sait qu’en s’investissant dans l’apprentissage du nouvel outil, il/elle se rapprochera d’une solution à un problème auquel il/elle est confronté·e.&nbsp;</p>



<p>En même temps, il est important de gérer les attentes – les changements peuvent se faire sentir petit à petit, au fil du temps, à mesure que les gens utilisent un outil ou un protocole et se familiarisent avec lui. Cela fait partie du processus.</p>



<p>Et, comme il s’agit d’un processus, il est bon de laisser de l’espace et du temps pour l’apprentissage, l’adaptation et la discussion lorsqu’un nouvel outil est déployé. En fonction de ce qui se passe par ailleurs, les capacités d’apprentissage de quelque chose de nouveau peuvent varier d’une équipe à l’autre, et laisser de l’espace peut être la meilleure façon de le reconnaître.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enfin, écouter les expériences de ceux/celles qui utilisent le nouvel outil peut vous aider à repérer les façons dont vous pourriez modifier l’outil lui-même si vous le pouvez, ou modifier la façon dont il est appliqué.</p>

 Q11: Que pouvons-nous faire pour assurer la sécurité des personnes lorsque nous commençons à utiliser différents outils technologiques et pratiques de données ? 



<p>De nombreuses personnes avec lesquelles nous discutons sont curieuses de savoir comment intégrer la sécurité et les soins dans tout le travail qu’elles font- en particulier lorsqu’il s’agit de nouvelles initiatives en matière de technologie et de données. Les fuites de données et le piratage d’outils font la une de l’actualité, de nos communautés et de nos propres expériences, et l’adoption en toute sécurité d’outils ou de processus technologiques peut sembler décourageante.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Une approche qui peut aider à fournir des bases est celle des données responsables (<a href="https://responsibledata.io/" title="Responsible Data">Responsible Data</a>, en anglais) : l’idée que nous partageons un “devoir collectif de rendre compte des conséquences involontaires du travail avec les données”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voici quelques domaines à explorer qui relèvent de la notion de données responsables :&nbsp;</p>



 
 Des pratiques comme la minimisation des données (ne collecter que les données dont vous avez besoin). 



 Des concepts comme le consentement (s’assurer que les personnes sont en mesure d’accepter la manière dont leurs données seront utilisées de manière libre, spécifique, informée et révocable).&nbsp; 



 Des espaces connexes comme la sécurité organisationnelle (un riche domaine de pratique autour de l’établissement de protocoles qui peuvent contribuer à renforcer la sécurité des données/informations et le bien-être et la sécurité physiques). 
 



<p>Si vous n’êtes pas familier·ère avec ce type de pratiques, il existe des ressources qui peuvent vous aider, qu’il s’agisse de guides en ligne ou de l’assistance d’un praticien.&nbsp;</p>



<p>La sélection d’outils qui donnent la priorité à votre sécurité peut être une autre étape à franchir. Souvent, ces outils ne sont pas aussi largement utilisés que leurs homologues moins sécurisés, ce qui peut être l’occasion de consulter des pairs partageant les mêmes idées ou de contacter un/une technologue externe en qui vous avez confiance. Certains de ces outils pourraient inclure :</p>



 
 Les gestionnaires de mots de passe : La création de mots de passe forts et uniques est un élément fondamental pour utiliser la technologie de manière plus sûre. Les gestionnaires de mots de passe peuvent à la fois garder la trace de vos mots de passe et vous aider à créer de bons mots de passe. <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords" title="">En savoir plus ici</a>. 



 Des outils de communication plus sûrs : De nombreux messages que nous envoyons numériquement ne sont pas cryptés, ce qui signifie que si quelqu’un·e les interceptait, il/elle pourrait en lire le contenu. Les outils de communication plus sûrs offrent un cryptage, rendant plus difficile pour les personnes de lire le contenu de vos messages. <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures" title="Vous pouvez en savoir plus ici">Vous pouvez en savoir plus ici</a>, ou nous contacter pour obtenir un soutien sur l’adoption de nouveaux outils. 



 Les réseaux privés virtuels : Un VPN (réseau privé virtuel) est un outil qui peut contribuer à protéger votre activité sur le web contre la surveillance du réseau internet que vous utilisez. Choisir le bon VPN – et connaître ses limites – est crucial, et dépend du contexte dans lequel vous vous trouvez (dans quel pays vous vous trouvez, quel VPN vous choisissez, etc.) En même temps, choisir le bon VPN pour votre situation peut être complexe, alors <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you" title="rassemblez quelques informations ici">rassemblez quelques informations ici</a> et n’hésitez pas à nous contacter pour obtenir de l’aide.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Gardez toujours à l’esprit que la sécurité est un mélange d’outils et de pratiques. Il est important de disposer des bons outils, mais il est tout aussi important d’utiliser ces outils de la bonne manière et de mettre en place des pratiques internes solides autour de la sécurité en général, en tenant compte de la sécurité physique et psychologique également.</p>

<p>Before we get started, what do we mean by data? And technology? Odds are, you’re working with both!&nbsp;<br><br>We define data as information that needs to be processed, organised and structured for the sake of usability. In other words, by data we mean the information that you hold, such as details about the communities you work with, findings from research you have done, results from surveys, email addresses and contact information for supporters, and so on. <br><br>We understand technology as the tools, systems, methods and processes that capitalise on the computational power to manage, analyse and communicate information. For this resource, when we talk about technology, we mean digital tools, broadly. Anything from email platforms and messenger apps to website hosts, email newsletter platforms, CRMs, databases, algorithmic processes and more.</p>

 Initial explorations – getting a feel for your own tech &amp; data landscape 



 Q1: Our peers seem to be using more tech/data. Should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well? 



<p>The answer here will really depend on context. Tech can support you to organise daily work and operations, enable safer and more secure communication, collect and manage information, and cut costs and free up resources, among other things. But if used ineffectively or non-strategically, tech can also compromise your ability to do your work safely and effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if your organisation is collecting first-hand accounts of human rights violations in areas with low internet/mobile connectivity, adopting a data collection tool that requires an internet connection will make your work difficult and negatively impact your ability to carry out your mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Used non-strategically, tech can also expose you, and those you work with, to new vulnerabilities and risks. For instance, if you’re in a context where government surveillance of civil society is common and you’re using tools that don’t adequately protect your communications, that may compromise your work and safety.</p>



<p>To make sure that you use tech strategically and responsibly, take some time to think about how adopting new tech or collecting more data could strengthen or weaken your work. Before adopting any new tools or platform, try to build up your internal capacity, connect with peers or other organisations you respect.</p>

 Q2: How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?&nbsp; 



<p>Digital technologies evolve quickly, as do debates and conversations about the potential benefits and harms of using specific tools and platforms. When trying to learn more about tech, we find it’s most useful to focus on two things:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Work to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">slowly and incrementally build up staff technical intuition</a>, making it a team-wide priority as much as possible (as opposed to a one-person job). 



 Instead of looking for <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/">shiny new tools</a>, try to identify how tech and data could <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/">strengthen your core work</a> first. 
 



<p>When it comes to new tools and applications, there is a lot of information online that can be enticing — but it can be hard to identify what is relevant to you, and what isn’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To more easily make sense of tech-related information, start with the challenge you’re trying to understand or address first. Additionally, if you can, reach out to like-minded practitioners who might have similar contexts or missions to yours and learn more about what tools they’re using (and what their successes and challenges have been!).&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 Q3: My organisation thinks it’s time to start using more tech and data in our work. Where do we start?&nbsp; 



<p>First get a clear overview of what you’re already using! Most organisations are already using at least some tech and data to support their work – from day-to-day tools such as email or instant messaging, to CRM tools and databases. Below, is a short list of questions that can serve as an initial exercise to map the ways you’re using tech and data for your work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: Some of the information you gather as part of this mapping exercise may be sensitive: before you start, make sure your notes are stored in a safe place and only shared with people who need access.</p>



 
 What tools are you currently using for your work?&nbsp;
 
 What platforms/tools do you and your team communicate with? These could include email, instant messaging, social media, SMS, and websites, to name a few. 



 How do you store and manage your files and documents? Which platforms do you use? Does everyone on your team use the same platforms? 



 Are you working on public campaigns or a part of collective efforts with other organisations? If yes, what tools do you use for activism, organising and community building? 



 Are you working with any databases or research platforms? 
 
 
 



 
 How are you using data?
 
 What type of data/information do you collect or generate day-to-day? Think about your individual and collective workflows and list the moments at which you collect or generate data. For example, collecting contact information for people you have interviewed, having discussions over email or Whatsapp, taking interview or meeting notes, or conducting surveys with communities. 



 Where do you store data? Consider the data you currently have and list all the places it lives (make sure to include all your remote locations – &nbsp;emails, shared documents, and so on).&nbsp; 



 When and how do you share data? Think about times when you need to share data: when does it usually happen, who do you share this with and what tools do you use? For example, you might be sending spreadsheets or PDFs over email, sharing documents and meeting minutes via Google Docs, or sharing passwords via a messaging app.&nbsp; 
 
 
 



<p>These are initial exploratory questions.&nbsp; For a complete version of this mapping exercise, see <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/">Becoming RAD!</a> (published in 2021), or <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">reach out to our team</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, adopting new tools takes time and resources. Make sure to give yourself and your team dedicated spaces to learn unfamiliar tools, practice behaviours and get up to speed with new data being used.</p>



<p>Related questions: <br>– <a title="Q1">Our peers seem to be using more tech/data, should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a><br>– <a>How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?</a></p>

<p></p>



 Q4: How can I make sure that the tech tools and data we’re using are actually useful for our work? 



<p>In our work supporting civil society organisations, we are often faced with <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">assumptions that digital means better</a>, and that any tech solution will lead to increased efficiency, effectiveness and impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this isn’t always the case. When we’re working with a partner more intensively, we often start with an assessment of how their tech and data use currently maps on to their work and context.&nbsp; This can help us figure out how, or even if, the way they’re using tech is strengthening their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After mapping out what tools the organisation is using and what data is collected, stored and shared, we go through a second layer of questions: How useful is all of this (or how useful could it be ) in the context of your work:&nbsp;</p>



 
 What is the core social or political problem you are working on?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Is your use of tech and data supporting you in addressing that problem? If yes, how? If not, why do you think that could be happening?&nbsp; 



 Is your day-to-day use of tech and data helping you connect with individuals or organisations important to your work? 



 Is the way you use tech and data impacting your workload? Is it making your work easier or is it creating unsustainable amounts of work for the team? Do you enjoy using your organisational tools?&nbsp;

 Making decisions – making sure the data &amp; tech you use matches your values and mission 



 Q5. How do we make decisions around adopting new tools and/or collecting data?&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a lot to think about when selecting a tool, and there are many options out there – including many that you may not know about yet. So how do you start narrowing down (or expanding) your options?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, based on research we did on tool selection in civil society organisations, we created an <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/">interactive tool-selection guide called Alidade</a>, which takes organisations through questions that can help them decide what kind of technology tool would fit with their project or organisational needs. We recommend trying it out!.</p>



<p>In general, when organisations are looking for new tech tools, we have found the following guidelines to be beneficial:</p>



 
 Research the people, the problem, and then the technology. Look into the overall problem where you think a technology tool could help. Think about your intended audience. Do research and look at different options for what technology options are available.&nbsp; 



 Think twice before you build. Look for existing tools that can do what you need. Building a completely new tool can be complex and risky. 



 Get a second opinion. Someone else has probably tried a similar approach before you. Find them, and ask for advice. 



 Always take it for a test drive. Try out at least two tools, with the people you want to use it, before choosing. Trialling highlights problems at the start. It also raises questions you never knew you had. 



 Plan for failure. You will not get it right the first time. Budget and plan to make regular adjustments to the tool throughout the project. 



 Reflect on what you’re doing. Keep thinking about what is and isn’t working. Apply what you learn to your organisation’s work, and share with other organisations. 
 



<p>Make sure that the tools you choose also fit your security needs. When evaluating a tool’s security, consider the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 What is the tool’s data privacy policy? What kind of data does the tool collect and who is that data shared with? Who has access to any data stored within the tool?&nbsp; 



 Is the tool’s approach to privacy and security well-documented? What can you find out about the tool’s privacy and security record?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Document and discuss your findings with your colleagues before making a final decision on a tool.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 Q6: My organisation wants to integrate new tech but we haven’t found the right tool. Should we build a new tool ourselves? 



<p>If you are familiar with our work, you probably know we often advocate for adapting existing tools for your own needs where possible (we call this ‘tool re-use’).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research in this area over the last few years has shown that re-using and adapting existing tools can have a number of advantages, like more efficient use of financial resources and increasing access to support in implementation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building a tool from scratch, on the other hand, can be a resource-consuming, lengthy process that can lead to disappointment: We’ve seen how tools can end up being ineffective or under-used, be unexpectedly costly, or demand intensive resources to be maintained or updated.</p>



<p>But if the functionality your organisation is looking for just can’t be found, and you are considering building a new tool, here are a few questions to reflect on:</p>



 
 Is there a real, identifiable need for this tool? Will this get you closer to your long-term goals? Would building a tool respond to a strong need that has come up in your work, or has the idea come about in other ways? 



 Do you have the resources needed to build the tool, maintain it over the long term and provide continued support to those who will be using it? 



 What is your vision for the tool over the long term? Could the needs or problems that the tool is being built to address potentially evolve over time?&nbsp;

 Q7. How can I use tech/data if my access to the internet or to electricity is unreliable? 



<p>If you are struggling with intermittent internet access, consider adopting tools that allow you to work both online and offline. In Google Docs, for example, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">enable offline access to documents.</a> This will allow you to continue with your work offline, and then sync documents once connectivity is restored. Some data collection and management tools, such as <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, also allow you to collect data on devices when you have no connectivity and then upload data to the server once the network is available. For online meetings in low connectivity settings, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> is a free, open source and lightweight option for audio-only calls.</p>



<p>If your organisation’s budget allows for it, we also recommend investing in a backup connection: for example, a mobile network connection to connect your devices to when your broadband connection is not available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two ways to do this:&nbsp; Use a mobile internet modem, or use a dedicated smartphone to create a mobile hotspot where other devices can connect and share the mobile connectivity. Here is a brief tutorial on <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">how to create a mobile hotspot on an Android smartphone</a>. You can limit the amount of data used by sharing the access password with only critical devices or users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In cases when the internet connection and/or electricity are intermittent and you are working online, make sure to save your work as frequently as possible, to minimise the risk of losing work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you experience electricity shortages often, acquiring a backup generator can be a useful option, as long as you have organisational resources to do so.</p>

<p></p>



 Q8. How do I work with external developers and/or technologists?&nbsp; 



<p>There are many different types of external experts you can work with. Common types of external consultants/experts who interact with technology or data include:</p>



 
 User experience (UX) designer: Works with both clients (in this case, that’s you!) and users to design a product that satisfies multiple needs and is easy to understand and operate.&nbsp; 



 Visual or Graphic Designer: Oversees the graphic elements that a website, tool, app or publication will use, and is responsible for designing the visual identity (or branding). They often work with the UX designer to make sure that the visual identity works well for users, too. 



 Illustrator: Creates illustrations, icons, infographics and more, which will live within the larger structure that the Visual Designer and UX Designer have created. 



 Frontend Developer: Implements the design on a website, tool or app. In particular, is able to code the aspects that users will see and interact with.&nbsp; 



 Backend Developer: Develops and connects a database to the frontend (the parts of the website, app or tool that a user can see) and does all the non-visible tasks that will fill the frontend with dynamic content.&nbsp; 



 Data Analyst/Scientist: Extracts patterns from large volumes of data. They may also be equipped with the tools and knowledge to create visualisations of data in order to communicate important patterns. 



 Sysadmin/DevOps: Maintains the servers where the website, tool or app lives. They’re often responsible for coordinating the troubleshooting necessary if users encounter bugs or errors. 
 



<p>Sometimes roles can overlap: for example, you could hire a consultant who leads the design and development of a website, or a developer who is capable of working on both the frontend and backend.</p>



<p>Before hiring external developers and technologists, it’s helpful to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Be clear about why you want to build or adopt new tools. 



 Identify the resources you have and those you will need. 



 Remember to plan for long-term maintenance.&nbsp; 
 



<p>At the beginning of your work together, it’s important to establish common ground and a shared terminology about needs and expectations. We recommend developing a ToR (Terms of Reference) in order to document and share project needs and requirements. The ToR should cover at minimum:</p>



 
 &nbsp;The available project budget 



 &nbsp;The necessary timeline 



 &nbsp;Your goals 



 &nbsp;Your expectations for the external partner 



 Any additional information 
 



<p>You should also agree on tools, channels for communication, and roles and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this can greatly contribute to project success early on. Some “do’s” when working with consultants once the work is underway are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Focus on clarity of organisational goals, big processes and milestones in order to better support the team/project. 



 Provide relevant and timely feedback. 



 Provide space and respect for the consultant’s expertise. 



 Try to be responsive with communications.

 Q9. My organisation does a lot of our work online, but our collaboration doesn’t always work so smoothly.&nbsp; How can we make online collaboration work better for us? 



<p>We know first hand that when it comes to collaborating online, finding the right way to communicate is essential – both to working smoothly and to overall well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, your team will have a selection of tools or channels to use (for example, a mix of secure chat apps, email and project management tools), but it’s important that each of these has a clear role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often, our partners are using so many different tools that they feel overwhelmed any time they need to share a document, idea or message. If this is the case for your organisation, take some time to quickly write down all the different tools people communicate through – it could include apps like Signal and Whatsapp, messaging platforms like Slack and Mattermost, online CRMs like Salesforce, VOIP tools like Skype, Zoom or Jitsi Meet, and collaboration tools like Trello, Airtable, Asana and others. Perhaps you also use SMS messages and phone calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you have this list, we suggest getting together with your colleagues, or the people you collaborate with most often, to agree to trying to use fewer tools. Assign each tool with a specific purpose: for example, perhaps email is for longer messages that aren’t time sensitive, or for sharing documents, whereas messaging programmes are only for urgent questions or friendly conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you’ve identified a few things that work, document it! Documentation will make sure that everyone is on the same page and will be a great reference for anyone new joining the team or for just remaining aware of processes/projects.</p>

 Centering safety and care&nbsp; 



 Q10: How can I make sure my whole team is using the tools (or data processes) that we’ve picked? 



<p>Even when we’re excited about a new tech tool or process for using data, actually adopting new ways of working is difficult. At the same time, making sure that we’re using the agreed-on tools (and their relevant safety or security protocols) is an important way in which we can practise care towards one another in organisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One step to take to help each other adopt a new way of working is to make sure the new tool or protocol responds to a concrete need and that everyone knows what that need is. This means everyone knows that by putting in the work to learn the new tool, they will be closer to a solution to an issue they’ve been facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, it’s important to manage expectations – changes might be felt little-by-little, over time, as more people use a tool or protocol and get familiar with it. That’s part of the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, because it’s a process, it’s good to leave space and time for learning, adaptation and discussion when a new tool is rolled out. Depending on what else is going on, capacities for learning something new can vary across teams, and giving space can be the best way to recognise this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, listening to the experiences of those using the new tool can help you spot ways you might want to tweak the tool itself if you can, or tweak how it’s being applied.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 Q11: What can we do to keep people safer when we start using different tech tools and data practices? 



<p>Many of the people we speak with are curious about how to incorporate safety and care in all the work they do – especially when it comes to new tech and data initiatives. As we see things like data leaks and hacked tools in the news, in our communities, and in our own experiences, safely adopting tools or tech processes can feel daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One approach that can help provide grounding is that of Responsible Data (RD): the idea that we share a “collective duty to account for unintended consequences of working with data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some areas to explore that fall under the RD umbrella are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Practices like data minimisation (only collecting the data you need). 



 Concepts like consent (ensuring that people are able to agree to how their data will be used in a freely-given, specific, informed and revocable way).&nbsp; 



 Related spaces like organisational security (a rich area of practice around setting protocols that can help build data/information security and physical well-being and security). 
 



<p>If you’re not familiar with these kinds of practices, there are resources that can help – from online guides to practitioner support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Selecting tools that prioritise your security can be another step to take. Often, these tools aren’t as widely used as their less-secure counterparts, so this could be an opportunity to consult with like-minded peers, or to contact an external technologist who you trust. Some of these tools could include:</p>



 
 Password managers: Creating strong, unique passwords is a fundamental part of using technology more safely. Password managers can both keep track of your passwords and help you create good passwords.&nbsp; <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">Learn more here</a>. 



 Safer communications tools: Many messages that we send digitally are not encrypted, meaning that if someone were to intercept them, they could read the contents. Safer communications tools offer encryption, making it harder for people to read the contents of your messages. You can <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures">learn more here</a>, or reach out to us for support on adopting new tools. 



 Virtual private networks: A VPN (virtual private network) is a tool that can help protect your web activity from surveillance on the internet network you’re using. Picking the right VPN – and knowing its limitations – is crucial, and depends on the context you’re within (what country you’re in, what VPN you choose, etc.). At the same time, choosing the right VPN for your situation can be complex, so <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">gather some information here</a> and don’t hesitate to reach out to us for support.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Always keep in mind that security is a mix of both tools and practices. It’s important to have the right tools, but it’s just as important to use these tools in the right way, and to build strong internal practices around security in general, taking into account physical and psychological safety as well.</p>

<p>The TRAC token is the utility token of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph that is getting deployed on Polkadot through the OriginTrail dedicated Parachain. Becoming a token spanning both Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems has enormous potential, particularly in the benefits offered by the latest generation of blockchain features in Polkadot, such as native cross-chain interoperability and extensibility beyond the VM&nbsp;level.</p><p>The aim of this RFC is to outline the details of different approaches to technical deployment of the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain and collect feedback from the OriginTrail community.</p> TRAC as a multi-chain token <p>Since its inception in January 2018, the TRAC token has been deployed as an ERC20 standardized token on the Ethereum mainnet blockchain as a limited supply, non-inflationary utility token fueling the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). Exactly 500 million TRAC have been created at the token generation event. Since then, the TRAC token has become crucial in enabling a variety of solutions used by notable global organizations as their data footprint constantly increases on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>As a two layer system, OriginTrail has always been based on two tokens — the TRAC token as the utility token of the OriginTrail DKG (Layer 2), and the gas token of the underlying blockchain used such as ETH, Matic and xDAI (Layer&nbsp;1).</p><p>Earlier this year the OriginTrail community provided strong support for the launch of <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/">OriginTrail specific blockchain on Polkadot — the OriginTrail Parachain</a>, with its native OriginTrail Parachain token (OTP) providing blockchain utility on layer 1. Additionally, apart from OTP providing “gas” utility, its tokenomics are designed to directly incentivize network activity in the OriginTrail ecosystem. More information on the interplay between OriginTrail DKG and blockchain layers <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper">can be found in the whitepaper</a>, while detailed OTP tokenomics will be the subject of a separate&nbsp;RFC.</p> TRAC token deployment on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>With the launch of the OriginTrail Parachain, a highly scalable layer 1 blockchain tailored to the DKG has been successfully added to the OriginTrail ecosystem. This comes with the added benefit of native interoperability with the entire Polkadot ecosystem and any network adopting Polkadot’s communication standards.</p><p>Since the TRAC token is an Ethereum ERC20 token with significant adoption, it’s important to carefully consider its implementation in the new Polkadot ecosystem. In the previous request for comments <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges%20(v2).pdf">OT-RFC-12 OriginTrail Parachain Bridges</a>, the use of a third party bridge was deemed unsafe and a final decision alongside the community was made to teleport TRAC using the pre-audited SFC smart contract.</p><p>Polkadot enables advanced blockchain functionalities and customizability, and with the launch of OriginTrail Parachain the OriginTrail ecosystem became a direct beneficiary of features such&nbsp;as:</p>  Cross-chain message passing via XCM enabling Parachains to send arbitrary messages between each other in a trustless manner using the Polkadot Relay chain. This not only enables easy token transfers, but also execution of any arbitrary logic between chains. This opens up room for many integrations across the ecosystem, e.g. a transaction on the OriginTrail Parachain could execute a token swap on the Acala parachain or extend assets available on Moonbeam. More information on XCM <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm">can be found&nbsp;here</a>.  Secure bridging between Parachains via the Relay chain, as well as strong, trustless bridges to other ecosystems built as parachains rather than multi-sig driven implementations, which have seen numerous hacks in the previous year. The OT-RFC-12 focuses specifically on this issue and the transitioning TRAC safely to the OriginTrail Parachain.  Extensibility through “pallets”, enabling forkless upgrades directly on chain level (as opposed to being confined to the EVM environment and needing to fork the entire chain), allowing customizations and advanced features tailored to the use case of every parachain. Many pallets already exist for features such as governance, staking,&nbsp;etc.  <p>More information on Polkadot features and implementation details can be found <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/getting-started">here</a>. With this RFC we present two distinct approaches of TRAC token implementation on the OriginTrail Parachain (and therefore, Polkadot).</p> OriginTrail Parachain TRAC Deployment requirements <p>The end goal of TRAC token deployment on the OriginTrail Parachain is to achieve the following requirements:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach: appropriate measures and planning has to be undertaken to maximize the ease of use and create a simple user experience of TRAC in order to not hinder the value propositions of the OriginTrail ecosystem.  R2 — Maximized security: special care must be taken to remove any unnecessary complexities and potential points of failure to ensure the TRAC token economy is robust and remains decentralized. This includes both the technical decisions and implementations, as well as decision making in an open, public discourse (such as through the OriginTrail RFCs).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability: ability to utilize TRAC token across the universe of Polkadot parachains and ecosystem tools (such as wallets), leveraging the innovations and value generated by the Polkadot ecosystem. This requires native Substrate integration through relevant pallets (such as the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-integrate-assets">Assets&nbsp;pallet</a>).  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility: TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain should remain compatible with existing Ethereum infrastructure and tooling, retaining its standard ERC20 form. To achieve this in the context of the Substrate runtime, a set of precompile contracts need to be deployed on the OriginTrail Parachain (to reach the EVM2.0 deployment).  R5 — Effective time of deployment: The time resources required for TRAC implementation to provide utility (in the context of achieving above requirements) should be reasonably low (and thus effective).  <p>In both proposed approaches, each of the above requirements will be graded with NOT SATISFIED, EVENTUALLY SATISFIED, PARTIALLY SATISFIED or FULLY SATISFIED.</p> Approach #1: Evolutionary deployment (from EVM1.0 to&nbsp;EVM2.0) <p>This approach would entail a transition from TRAC initially getting deployed as ERC20 token on the OriginTrail Parachain (indicated in scheme below as “Temp TRAC”), to reaching a Polkadot native TRAC deployment (“Full TRAC”) in the next step. This initial TRAC token would operate as a standard ERC20 token in the current EVM 1.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain (satisfying R4). However in such an environment, the token would not benefit from the additional features available from Polkadot technology (R3), and therefore would require a future token migration to a fully implemented TRAC in the EVM 2.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>The main advantage of such an approach would be the immediate availability of TRAC on OriginTrail Parachain as no updates to the current Parachain codebase are necessary (OriginTrail Parachain 1.0.x codebase versions). The main disadvantage of the approach is the need to perform a token migration once all features necessary for the Parachain native implementation have been put in place (1.1.x codebase versions). There are two general approaches to such token migration, both introducing a new set of challenges:</p>  User-performed migration (open ended): token holders would “swap” between the initial and fully fledged TRAC token versions through a “one-way bridge” contract, which would be responsible for minting “full TRAC” tokens. While satisfying criterion R4, this approach most likely leads to an “open ended migration” (both token implementations “living” on the OriginTrail Parachain for an undetermined period of time) as users could decide not to migrate for whatever reason, which is problematic in terms of Polkadot compatibility requirement (R3). Additionally, this approach requires significant adaptations to the implementation of OriginTrail DKG nodes which will have to manage working with both tokens simultaneously. The core developers assess this as the least favorable option with regards to time resource expenditure (criterion R5). Finally, the existence of two implementations for the same token would likely cause user experience hurdles for less tech-savvy users (e.g. asset publishers), creating problems in terms of requirement R1 and likely R2 due to additional complexity.  Developer-performed migration (close ended): in this option the core developers would retain the capability of “freezing” the “Temp TRAC” token contract implementation for a small amount of time in order to perform a “snapshot migration” from one contract to another (temp TRAC to full TRAC). This option removes some of the downsides of having two simultaneously living TRAC token implementations on the OriginTrail Parachain, however for the cost of necessarily pausing the operations of the entire TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain for the amount of time needed for migration. This particular approach would still require careful planning and execution from the entire ecosystem involved in the TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain. It is estimated that this migration approach would require significant time expenditure from all actors in the community and is negatively assessed in the context of criterion R5, based on the experience in previous token staking and teleporting activities. Moreover, the pausing capability introduces a problematic component into the token implementation due to enabling additional powerful token control capability on the smart contract level (potential single point of failure), problematic in context of requirement R2 for the period of time until the migration to a native Polkadot implementation (full TRAC). Finally, even with developer lead initiative in this approach, it would still require effort and caution from the TRAC community which is not favorable in the context of requirement R1.  Approach #1: TRAC token migration path from EVM1.0 to EVM2.0 (1a involving the “Bridge” contract, 1b performing a snapshot transition)<p>Approach #1 in terms of defined criteria then can be assessed in the following way:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — as both approach #1a and #1b introduce the need to manage two implementations of the same token and require additional activity from all end users of the OriginTrail Parachain, especially in approach #1a which doesn’t have a time constraint on the token migration. Given that OriginTrail Parachain is a new environment (with new tools, such as wallets) the community is slowly getting accustomed to, having any additional friction is seen as problematic.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — While significant measures need to be taken to ensure safe transition between two token implementations, the approach does satisfy the security requirements as the process can be entirely based on smart contracts. However, additional steps and complexity inherently do add an additional risk component in the&nbsp;process.  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: EVENTUALLY SATISFIED — with the evolutionary approach TRAC would start as a “non-native” Polkadot asset. The additional features provided by Polkadot would only be available post-migration.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — in both approach #1a and #1b TRAC starts as an ERC20-compatible token.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — in order to reach the fully deployed state of TRAC on Polkadot, a significant time investment would be required to plan and execute the migration activities in detail, both by the core developers as well as by the OriginTrail community (estimated at several months). The partially satisfied grading of the requirements stems from the fact that it allows immediate deployment of the (non-Polkadot) version of TRAC tokens as no additional updates to the OriginTrail Parachain are&nbsp;needed.   Approach #2: Direct Polkadot-native deployment (EVM 2.0&nbsp;only) <p>The second approach would be to avoid the deployment of the TRAC token contract in the EVM1.0 environment (Parachain version 1.0.x) entirely, and proceed to direct Polkadot native deployment of TRAC tokens. With such an approach, the TRAC token would from the get-go have all of the benefits offered by Polkadot (as listed above) and would minimize the necessary coordination required by the migration activities detailed in approach #1, all of which would benefit from a better user experience and less friction.</p>Approach #2: TRAC token immediate deployment to EVM2.0 Parachain environment<p>This approach is favorable with regards to all requirements presented above:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — since only one TRAC token deployment would ever exist on the OriginTrail Parachain there would be no migrations or potentially difficult operations the TRAC community would need to&nbsp;perform.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — higher security is achieved through minimizing complexity and need of coordination (compared to approach&nbsp;#1).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — advanced Polkadot features will be available immediately from the moment of token deployment, as the token will be deployed as a Polkadot&nbsp;asset.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — the TRAC token implementation will be performed in such a way that, apart from being a Polkadot asset from the Substrate perspective, it will remain an ERC20 standardized token from the EVM perspective.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — even though approach 2 is not entailing the immediate deployment of TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain, we estimate that significantly lower amount of resources are required for a fully fledged TRAC implementation in approach #2 (compared to approach #1), from both the development team and the TRAC community, due to no migration activities and code adaptations required from the DKG node side. The estimated deployment time is under 1&nbsp;month.  <p>Due to the dynamics presented above, approach #2 is the preferred option of the core development team.</p> Bridging TRAC to other ecosystems <p>Due to Polkadot’s native interoperability features, once implemented, the TRAC token will be available to the entirety of Polkadot and its parachains, as the Relay chain acts as a de facto bridge between Polkadot parachains. This will open up new opportunities for both the token holders as well as builders in the ecosystem to deploy OriginTrail in ways previously not&nbsp;seen.</p><p>The implementation of trustless bridges to other blockchain ecosystems is an ongoing effort of multiple teams and has been discussed in the previous OT-RFC-12. The necessary preparation and discussions with ecosystem developers and Parity have been ongoing in anticipation of the bridge deployment between Ethereum and Polkadot, as indicated in the scheme&nbsp;above.</p> Conclusion <p>This RFC presents the requirements and approaches to implementing the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain, including the details of their execution according to the requirements. As core developers we invite the wider OriginTrail community to provide feedback and comments in the dedicated discussion on the OriginTrail RFC repository.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-13-trac-token-deployment-on-polkadot-c709347583cc">OT-RFC-13 TRAC Token deployment on Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), the research and development arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, today announced the launch of a program that seeks to engineer novel artificial intelligence technologies capable of attributing authorship and protecting authors’ privacy (Linguistic Fingerprint Technology).</p>



<p>The Human Interpretable Attribution of Text Using Underlying Structure (HIATUS) program represents the Intelligence Community’s latest research effort to advance human language technology. The resulting innovations could have far-reaching impacts, with the potential to counter foreign malign influence activities; identify counterintelligence risks; and help safeguard authors who could be endangered if their writing is connected to them.</p>



<p>The program’s goals are to create technologies that:<br></p>



  Perform multilingual authorship attribution by identifying stylistic features — such as word choice, sentence phrasing, organization of information — that help determine who authored a given text.  Protect the author’s privacy by modifying linguistic patterns that indicate the author’s identity.  Implement explainable AI techniques that provide novice users an understanding, trust, and verification as to why a particular text is attributable to a specific author or why a particular revision will preserve an author’s privacy.  



<p>“Each of the selected performers brings a unique, novel, and compelling approach to the HIATUS challenge,” said program manager Dr. Tim McKinnon. “We have a strong chance of meeting our goals, delivering much-needed capabilities to the Intelligence Community, and substantially expanding our understanding of variation in human language using the latest advances in computational linguistics and deep learning.”</p>



<p>Through a competitive Broad Agency Announcement, IARPA awarded HIATUS research contracts to the following lead organizations, which together bring more than 20 academic institutions, non-profits, and businesses into the program:<br></p>

 💼 + 🤗 =&nbsp;🚀 <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed-use-cases/">the draft</a> Verifiable Credentials for Education, Employment, and Achievement Use Cases report was published. It’s worth a read for anyone interested in Open Badges, microcredentials, or certification. The next version of the Open Badges specification (v3.0) will be compatible with Verifiable Credentials (VCs). One thing to note about VCs is that they don’t have to have a visual representation in the form of an&nbsp;image.</p><p>The use cases provided in the report are interesting, and Verifiable Credentials promise to solve many seemingly-intractable problems around how individual people can prove claims in privacy-respecting ways. What we noted, however, especially given our work around <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, is that there are some use cases that are likely to be transformational to learners and workers in the future of work. Both groups need control over the way that they are recognised to unlock future opportunities.</p><p>For example, the report talks about the recognition of prior learning, something which is an equity issue for those who haven’t had the same access to resources than&nbsp;others:</p><blockquote>Josephina decided to return to college to finish her bachelors degree. The college she attended evaluated her work experience and determined that skills and knowledge that she attained while working qualified to replace several of the courses required for the&nbsp;degree.</blockquote><p>There are countries and systems where recognising prior learning is a normal part of the learning landscape. Even in these cases, however, the aim of the activity is to assess whether an individual has met the criteria for admission to a course or institution. What VCs allow is for recognition to be turned into a credential, and therefore used as ‘currency’ not just to be ‘spent’ at that institution, but potentially anywhere.</p><p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">original vision</a> for Open Badges was to create an “open and decentralized [ecosystem] to allow for badges from any contexts where learners are learning, to support any and all types of learning occurring, to provide portable and sustainable value and to give each learner complete control”.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/issuing-open-badges/">Issuing Open Badges</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>The key word here is control. Although a lot of learning happens in formal education institutions, a lot of learning happens on the job through informal and non-formal learning. So how can VCs work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_career">portfolio careers</a>, in a world where people change jobs relatively often and need to take proof of their learning with&nbsp;them?</p><p>We suggest that there are the following three examples where VCs can play an important role in Open Workplace Recognition (i.e. Open Recognition in the workplace):</p>  Recognition of prior learning — as discussed above, this is a way to translate knowledge, skills, and experience gained on the job into credentials that can be used more widely. This depends on an authority (the ‘Issuer’) assessing a portfolio of evidence about a person (the ‘Subject’), who will then also be able to use the VC as proof of their claim (i.e. also be the ‘Holder’).  Defining your own path — no two careers are ever the same, yet the way we present them can often be far too similar. VCs issued for the recognition of niche (or even unique!) things such as knowledge, skills, experience, and dispositions allows individuals to better tell their own story. One way of doing this would be to self-issue a VC (the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) and then have someone else, or an organisation, endorse that&nbsp;claim.  Making recognition portable — combining the other two points, an individual may want to memorialise a particular important form of recognition they have received. This could be a tweet, a comment in an email, or anything that they want to be able to refer to in future. By self-issuing a VC (again, the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) they can ask the person who gave the recognition to endorse their&nbsp;claim.  <p>The purpose of standards, and the working groups which create them, is necessarily to focus on the technical elements and most common use cases. With this post, we want to widen the conversation to consider what VCs make possible that is entirely new, and that which was perhaps always latent in Open&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>Using a lens of Open Workplace Recognition allows us to focus about the norms, behaviours, and expectations within the world of work. We can then go a step further to think about who controls what is recognised, by whom, and how that recognition can be shared more&nbsp;widely.</p><p>What other examples for Open Workplace Recognition using VCs can we come up with together?</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-workplace-recognition-using-verifiable-credentials-fc0134fad7ec">Open Workplace Recognition using Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We asked our Executive Director, Kay Chopard, for her thoughts and learnings from working through the first phase of the UK Digital Identity &amp; Attributes Framework (DIATF):</p>



<p>“It is nearly 7 months since<a href="https://www.ukas.com/resources/latest-news/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-pilot/"> UKAS announced the 5 organisations</a> that would certify Identity Service Providers (IDSPs) against the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> under an initial assessment program.</p>



<p>Digital identity and the provision of trusted credentials will be a vital component in the delivery of future public – and private – services. Through our global identity certification work, we observe first-hand just how quickly the digital identity market is growing. We have been certifying an increasing number of IDSPs against global standards as opportunities for digital identity expand and I’ve noticed, especially, the drive from sectors where identity verification is NOT mandated by regulation – for instance in healthcare.  At Kantara Initiative, we have been running identity assessment programs across the world for nearly 15 years.&nbsp; In the UK, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks#list-of-certified-idsps">17 identity proofing organisations have now been certified to provide services within the Framework</a>. To support this growth, I believe we should consider the following points:</p>



<p>Future-proofing the identity ecosystem</p>



<p>We have been proud to work with the Department of Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS), UKAS and our certification clients over the past 6 months as the DIATF has moved from the Alpha to Beta phase. Organisations that were certified in the first few months were assessed against the Alpha version of the framework. Our certification clients, however, are assessed against the Beta version of the DIATF as this is already much more robust and includes more fully defined assessment criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the program continues to evolve we will identify further assessment criteria that will be vital to roll out robust, trusted, identity solutions that will work for future use cases. Our auditors are dedicated identity specialists with experience across multiple sectors. They have shared with me that the DIATF will continue to benefit from the experiences of other programs across the world – what has worked and what hasn’t.&nbsp; This is vital, especially if we are to support those identity organisations that are planning for international expansion. The UK’s DIATF cannot exist in geographic isolation; individual customers and citizens will eventually require a digital identity that is portable. The DIATF should support organisations in providing this.</p>



<p>One size doesn’t fit all</p>



<p>This first wave of assessments has shown very quickly that each certification client operates quite differently and so a simple “tick box” approach to assessment will not work. We are often asked for a fixed price for our certification services, but I would argue that a fixed price indicates a fixed approach – and a fixed mindset. The underlying assessment criteria must, of course, be met consistently. But each organisation operates differently, and the Kantara ‘modular’ approach ensures each element of the process can be audited in line with requirements AND the business’ operating model. This also supports DCMS’ current model of having separate use cases. As new cases come online, we will continue to add in new assessments that support growth.</p>



<p>Challenge through collaboration</p>



<p>We are a not-for-profit organisation. While commerciality is an important focus, it is more significant that we continue to develop our understanding of emerging trends and issues across all markets. We have been encouraged by the response of parliamentarians, digital identity industry leaders, influencers and media to the Kantara approach and we have appointed a number of key assessors who bring with them experiences of specific sectors, territories and regulatory environments.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Most recently, the appointment of Emma Lindley MBE, Alison McDowell and Andrew Hindle to our UK Advisory Board was a deliberate move to ensure we continue to be challenged and stay abreast of the issues our clients face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our role on the Kantara UK Advisory Board is to provide independent thinking and guidance to Kantara’s UK team. As a UK citizen who has worked in the identity sector for over 20 years, I believe we can help ensure the customer is constantly “in the room” and at the heart of any discussions around the future of the digital identity framework.”  (Andrew Hindle, Kantara UK Advisor, Content Chair at Identiverse and Founding Board Member at IDPro.). </p>



<p>“There is now a clear vision for a digital identity market that is both open and competitive. The DIATF is intended to create choice, improve quality and increase innovation – ultimately improving customer experiences for the UK citizen and reducing the cost for UK PLC. Kantara Initiative has a vital role to play in delivering this vision.” (Emma Lindley MBE, Co-Founder of Women in Identity and MD, International Expansion, at CAF) </p>



<p>Going forward, we believe it is vital that certification bodies continue to work with DCMS and UKAS in a spirit of partnership – bringing together the cumulative value of dozens of great minds! To this end, we have&nbsp; been encouraged by the proactive approach of DCMS in creating forums where the 5 certification bodies can discuss ideas and feedback on the program in action.</p>

<p>Verifying identities and information in a digital world is critical for establishing trust. But there are issues of privacy as well as efficiency, scale and accuracy in models that rely on centralized data collectors and databases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The adoption of a new generation of digital identity solutions that leverage decentralized technologies such as distributed ledgers and verifiable credentials is accelerating. And Hyperledger technologies are playing a major role in this transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on for a cross section of the many Hyperledger-powered solutions that are in production now. For other examples, check out these past #HyperledgerIdentity round-ups:</p>

<p>IBM Digital Health Pass</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass">IBM Digital Health Pass</a>, built on<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric"> Hyperledger Fabric</a>, offers a multi-credential verifier that organizations can use to manage and execute their verification policies for COVID-19 and vaccination status in a way that balances the privacy of the individual with the requirements set by the organization and local health authorities. With IBM Digital Health Pass, organizations can verify multiple types of health credentials, such as Good Health Pass, IBM Digital Health Pass, Smart Health Card and EU Digital COVID Certificate. Privacy is central to the solution, where the verifier application minimizes the personal data that is ever displayed to the user through the execution of business rules and it never lets any personal data leave, or be stored in, the verifier app.</p>



<p>Indicio Network&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a> is a collection of four professionally-staffed, enterprise-grade public-permissioned ledgers that provide a neutral, independent, and reliable network for the exchange of verifiable credentials. <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">MainNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">DemoNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">TestNet</a>, and <a href="https://indicio.tech/deploy-your-own-private-network-for-critical-performance-testing/">TempNet</a> are all Hyperledger Indy-based networks with nodes operating on five continents—and a growing number of node operators. The Indicio Network is one of the networks that can support <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a>, a complete suite of decentralized identity components for authenticating and sharing high value data in a privacy-preserving way using verifiable digital credentials. Built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>, as well as AnonCreds and DIDComm, Proven is designed to make implementing and using these open source codebases simple, providing users with a fully-owned solution that’s easy to integrate with existing systems, to innovate on, and to scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDUnion&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDUnion</a>, the European identity verification network created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organizations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields to enable a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information. In August, 2022, IDUnion spun off Sociedad Cooperativa Europea (SCE) to operate the production network for credential verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IDUnion network, which is built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>, enables the clear verification of individuals, companies and institutions while allowing people and organizations to manage their identity information by themselves and to decide when they want to share this information and with whom. It has a decentralized structure and stores no personal data – not even as a hash. In order to protect privacy right from the start, all personal data is stored on the user’s end device. Users have a choice of wallets for storing and presenting credentials to third parties as required. Credentials are issued, verified and stored using open standards to ensure interoperability. Hyperledger Aries is the framework for managing the credentials.</p>



<p>NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</p>



<p>In 2019, the NHS was preparing to pilot a digital passport project that would allow staff to carry their HR and other records as credentials on their phones as a long-term plan to make it easier to transfer from one facility to another. When the pandemic hit, this went from a pilot to a production deployment quickly. The <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/">NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</a> rolled out in summer to support swift and efficient staff movement between NHS organizations in response to the response health emergency. The COVID-19 Digital Staff Passport provided a solid legal framework for staff to be temporarily deployed into other NHS organizations with evidence available that checks have been completed before staff move. As laid out in the pilot, the information was transferred securely by the staff member as verified credentials stored on their own smartphone, putting them in control.</p>



<p>This staff passport used the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sorvin Network</a>, which is built on Hyperledger Indy, to verify the digital credentials, and the Evernym (now Avast) <a href="https://connect.me/">Connect.me</a> digital wallet app, which is powered by Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, to enable staff to store and share their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NHS is now gearing up to roll out the <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/whats-next.htm">next generation</a> of its Digital Staff Passport, which will streamline transfers and staff movements through the NHS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBook BC&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/search">OrgBook BC</a> is a searchable public directory of organizations registered in British Columbia, Canada, provided by the BC Government’s Ministry of Citizens’ Services. OrgBook BC provides verified data, including legal names and DBA names, business numbers, BC registration status and select licensee and permits, for more than 1.4 million organizations. All of the information in the OrgBookBC is received, stored, verified and displayed using the latest digital trust technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC uses verifiable credentials to ensure that information about organizations are digitally signed by the entity that issues it. Issuers are public sector organizations that hold information about businesses, issue licenses or permits or certify processes. That electronic signature stays with the data throughout its life in OrgBook and is validated before its is display on the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC is part of an overall commitment to digital trust technologies by the Government of British Columbia. In addition to deploying Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, the team there is leading much of the open source development for those projects. Read more on the Government of BC’s investment in verifiable credentials and digital wallet technologies <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/08/23/investing-in-verifiable-credentials-technical-interoperability-and-open-source">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This update provides additional insights on the results of the “snapshot” mechanism currently being used to track the consistency of staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Consortia staking pool. Patrons staking EWT can use the tools provided at <a href="https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/">https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/</a> to check the status of their wallets and snapshots if applicable.</p> Snapshots and Variable EWT&nbsp;rewards <p>We published <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-ewt-consortia-relay-staking-snapshots-insights-32675cdd20db">this blog post</a> that includes a detailed technical analysis of the previous 2 snapshots, together with an explanation of the snapshots mechanism and variable staking rewards. To summarize the mechanics, the Energy Web Consortia staking pool tracks the consistency of staking by taking snapshots of staking balances at random points in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Users who stake consistently, based on the snapshot date, will earn additional rewards from the staking pool. The additional rewards are designed to incentivize consistent staking, as EWT staking will be a major contributor to the cybersecurity of upcoming Energy Web solutions for enterprises.</p> Snapshot 3 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>Snapshot 3 was taken on block #<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/block/19190154/transactions">19190154</a> generated on July 29th at 09:24:50 PM +2 UTC. At this block, there were 6,822 wallets staking, which is 181 more wallets compared to Snapshot 2 and 414 more compared to Snapshot 1. The total balance of all EWT staked in the pool was equal to 6,047,363 EWT, an increase of 316,401 EWT compared to Snapshot 2 and 506,775 EWT more than at Snapshot&nbsp;1.</p><p>Here are the balances of Snapshot 3 (in green), 2 (in orange), and 1 (in blue). Wallets on the bottom, balance on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>The green spikes are wallets adding more EWT between snapshots 1 and 3. The dips are wallets withdrawing EWT. On the far right of the chart, there are green lines and no blue lines: these are the completely new wallets that didn’t participate in snapshots 1 or&nbsp;2.</p><p>During Snapshot 3, there were 181 more wallets staking EWT compared to Snapshot 2, and 414 more wallets compared to snapshot 1. Interestingly, there are 5 wallets that were staking EWT during Snapshot 1, withdrew their stake during snapshot 2, and are now staking during snapshot&nbsp;3.</p><p>Here’s the balance distribution comparison between snapshot 1, 2, and 3 balances. Bounds on the bottom, number of wallets in each category on the vertical&nbsp;scale:</p><p>We can see a slight increase in each category, except for the &lt;1,500–2,500) bound. The highest increase in staking occurred in the highest, &lt;2,500–3000&gt; bound: 84 new wallets staked between 2,500 and 3,000 ETW. For comparison, there were only 42 additional wallets staking under 500&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot 3&nbsp;insights <p>EWT staking in the Consortia pool continues to be consistent, which is exactly the intention behind the design of the snapshot mechanism. This is evidenced by the balance distribution of all snapshots and <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0x181A8b2a5AEb25941F6A79b4aE43dBb1968c417A/coin-balances#address-tabs">EWT balances in the staking contract</a>:</p><p>Such consistent staking will provide a high degree of economic cybersecurity to all enterprise-grade Energy Web solutions (for more information on the connection between consistent staking, cybersecurity, and Energy Web solutions, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">please review our announcement on the upcoming Consortia chain</a>).</p><p>Before the end of the year, there will be 3 more Snapshots taken at random blocks. Patrons who receive at least 1 Snapshot will qualify for additional rewards. The rewards will be calculated and distributed after the Consortia staking pool ends. Again, since variable rewards are impossible to predict, the best strategy for all patrons is to stake as high a balance as possible and do so consistently.</p><p>Also read: <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-ewt-consortia-relay-staking-snapshots-insights-32675cdd20db">Energy Web Token (EWT) Consortia Relay Staking Snapshots Insights part&nbsp;1</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcholod/">Michael Cholod,</a> Executive Director at the <a href="https://peer.social/">Peer Social Foundation</a>. Additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee.<br></p>



<p>Imagine being lost in the woods or walking down a dusty road with only the clothes on your back. What would you do? Thankfully, most of us have never had to ask this question and we should consider ourselves lucky. Unfortunately, this is the plight facing over 100 million people on Earth right now, including 13 million Ukrainians who have been forced to run for their lives to escape the horrible atrocities of war.</p>



<p>As well, millions have fled their communities to find refuge in more stable parts of their country. These people are called Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). And of course, millions of others have left their countries entirely and have become Refugees.</p>



<p>Convenience for us, Lifesaving for others</p>



<p>Most Refugees and IDPs did not have the time to properly prepare by gathering all their important documents such as passports, identity cards, driver’s licenses, and land titles or rental agreements. Fleeing your home may save your life, but fleeing without identity documents can lead to a very long wait – sometimes a decade or more – before your life is stable again. Imagine desperately trying to assert your identity to an overwhelmed volunteer who may not speak your language, hoping to convince them you actually exist.Your have lost your idenitty and you have to beg to be found.</p>



<p>Let’s say the conflict is over, you manage to convince an official who you are, and it’s finally time to go home. Upon return, you find that your house or rental flat has been destroyed, or some stranger is living there with a shiny new land title or rental agreement proclaiming they are the rightful owner.</p>



<p>It has taken ten years to re-establish your identity only to come home and find yourself homeless once again. The futility of living without an identity or without evidence of ownership or occupancy of your home, land, or property (HLP), has become a serious, global problem. UNHCR, IOM, NGOs like the Norwegian Refugee Council and western donor agencies like the World Bank and New America exist to help people in such need.Groups like the <a href="https://www.globalprotectioncluster.org/themes/housing-land-and-property/">Global Protection Cluster</a> have formed special entities to study the HLP problem. It turns out that Digital Identity is fundamental to the solution.</p>



<p>Digital Identity is essential</p>



<p>In Ukraine for example, there are 10 million citizens registered with the national digital identity program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diia">Diia</a>. Diia, which translates to ‘Action’ in English, is a mobile application that allows any Ukrainian citizen with a bank account to create, store, and register their identity and property ownership documents with the government. Since the Russian invasion of February 24, 2022, Diia even allows people to report war crimes and the movement of Russian troops from their mobile phone or computer.</p>



<p>Creating a digital record of your identity and property ownership or occupancy (HLP) makes you easier to find if you become undocumented since a digital copy of your life is safe with the government. Even if you must flee with only your smartphone or a set of credentials you’ve memorized, you can reclaim your identity and quickly file for compensation for damaged or destroyed HLP, and return home far sooner than those without digital credentials.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, digital identity platforms like Diia are not a panacea. Not everyone is registered for Diia. Not everyone has a bank account, a computer, a smartphone, or Internet access, nor the skills to use them. Russia is occupying not just physical territory in Ukraine, they are also occupying Ukrainian cyberspace so it is important that digital identity solutions like Diia are secured against malicious actors bent on stealing people’s identity.</p>



<p>For most people, embracing digital identity might be the difference between being lost and found. That is reason enough for everyone to embrace digital identity as soon as possible.You never know when an explosion, hurricane, forest fire or rising water might wash you and all your possessions away leaving your family homeless. A digital lifeline can be far more than just convenient.</p>

 Collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!) <p>In a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, we looked at a typology of Open Source communities. This got us thinking about other indicators that could be plotted against one another on 2x2 grids. Tools like this are useful when deciding as a community how you want to interact.</p><p>The idea here is not to precisely define reality, but rather paint a broad-brushstroke picture of the kind of community that you want to create. Then you can think about kind of platforms, tools, and processes that might enable&nbsp;that.</p><p>Let’s start with an&nbsp;example:</p>CC BY&nbsp;WAO<p>In the above diagram, we’re plotting how formal the community is (or will be) against how private it is. LinkedIn, in the top-right quadrant, is an example of a ‘formal’ space that is based on reputation. It’s widely accepted as a ‘professional’ platform, and users are associated with their ‘real’ work identities.</p><p>So if you are creating a community that fits with this way of understanding the world, LinkedIn might be a great platform. However, if you’re creating a community where people prefer to remain anonymous and have an informal chat, you might use something in the bottom-left quadrant such as&nbsp;Reddit.</p><p>So let’s take another example. If we plot ‘Scale’ (as in how large you want the community to potentially get) with ‘Intentionality’ (i.e. deciding in advance what it’s for) then you might get something like&nbsp;this:</p><p>This is similar in some ways to the 2x2 grid from our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, except it’s focused on social relationships rather than audience. Its value comes in being explicit about the goals of the community, all the while bearing in mind that groups can morph from one into&nbsp;another.</p><p>The reason this is important as it helps current and potential community members have a mental model of what’s going on, helping them be on the same page as their peers. Someone joining a ‘Club’ when they thought they were joining a ‘Movement’ is likely to be disappointed, and vice-versa.</p><p>During our brainstorming sessions around this, we came up with plenty of examples of X and Y axes you could use to plot 2x2 grids. We’re still thinking about this, but so far have three buckets around Interaction, Identity, and Intention.</p> Interaction   Infrequent posting vs Frequent&nbsp;posting  Maintaining existing relationships vs Building new relationships  Low support requirements vs High support requirements  Asynchronous vs Synchronous   Identity   Informal vs&nbsp;Formal  Anonymous vs Reputational  Social vs Professional  Single group identity vs Multiple groups /&nbsp;factions   Intention   Thematic vs Goal-oriented  Receiving updates vs&nbsp;Learning  Small scale vs Large&nbsp;scale  Place-based vs Non-geographical  <p>As ever when it comes to community work, it’s the conversations around these grids that are the most interesting. These are all different lenses you can use to imagine a new community or look at an existing one. At the end of the day, they do not describe ‘objective reality’ but rather collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!)</p><p>What other labels could you come up with? What other lenses can you produce to help you conceptualise your community? 🤔</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-2x2-grids-for-open-source-community-development-b3a3824b1682">Using 2x2 grids for Open Source community development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Towards a new typology of projects based on user and contributor growth <p>I’ve just finished reading <a href="https://literal.club/dajbelshaw/book/working-in-public-d4nqv">Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</a> by Nadia Eghbal (now <a href="https://nadia.xyz/">Nadia Asparouhova</a>). I discovered it via an a16z podcast episode entitled <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/open-source-communities-creators-rerun-_j2VDSSF">Learning from Open Source Communities</a>.</p><p>People often use the term ‘Open Source’ in a way that downplays the extremely heterogenous landscape:</p><blockquote>The term “open source” refers only to how code is distributed and consumed. It says nothing about how code is produced. “Open source” projects have nothing more in common with one another than “companies” do. All companies, by definition, produce something of value that is exchanged for money, but we don’t assume that every company has the same business model.&nbsp;(p.54)</blockquote><p>So if we can’t easily refer to ‘Open Source communities’ in general, how are we to understand them?</p><p>There are many different scenarios for Open Source projects and the communities around them. One of the most useful parts of Working in Public is a typology based around comparing user growth with contributor growth.</p>Original image from ‘Working in&nbsp;Public’<p>The version of this typology below is WAO’s interpretation, which flips the columns in the original to make the high contributor growth and high user growth appear in the top-right quadrant. This is to make it easier to read. We also rename ‘toy’ projects as ‘side’ projects to avoid being dismissive of some types of Open Source projects.</p>Image CC BY WAO, based on ‘Working in Public’ by Nadia&nbsp;Eghbal<p>Taking each in&nbsp;turn:</p>  🛹 Side projects — low contributor growth and low user growth. These kind of projects serve to scratch an itch or made just for fun. This is not to say that they can’t be used for more serious activities, but that the original intention wasn’t to scale. Usually, there’s only a single ‘project lead’ (although even that term seems a bit too formal) and it’s unlikely anyone else really uses the product. As a result, there doesn’t really need to be much governance.  👥️ Clubs — high contributor growth but low user growth. These kind of projects tend to be a group of people working on something that may be potentially niche but personally or professionally relevant. Most users in this scenario will also be contributors and they are collectively scratching an itch. There is likely to be more governance and collective decision-making necessary around this kind of&nbsp;project.  🏟️ Stadiums — low contributor growth but high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be either super-niche projects which nevertheless are relied on as infrastructure or popular projects because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction">parasocial</a> (i.e. one-sided) relationship between ‘creator’ and ‘audience’. Although there will be many ideas and suggestions as part of this community, in terms of governance it’s likely that a very small number of people, make the decisions.  🔱 Federations — high contributor growth and high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be larger and more mature projects which may be backed by an incorporated organisation. As a result, they are more likely to have a governance model which includes established procedures such as decision-making workflows.  <p>This quadrant-based approach is a broad-brushstroke attempt to roughly define how a project sits relative to others. The boundaries are&nbsp;fuzzy:</p><blockquote>The difference between these project models is not precisely defined. At either extreme, we can see clear differences. We can say that Linux, a project with multiple subprojects and working groups, does not look like tslib, a small helper library for the programming language TypeScript. But the middle is a little murky. There are some projects with four or five maintainers, and other projects with many contributors who are not deeply involved. (p.77)</blockquote><p>Eghbal’s focus is mainly on technical projects which are hosted on GitHub, but I think this is much more widely applicable to some of our client and community work. I’m looking forward to applying this as I think it helps clarify thinking around governance in particular.</p><p>For example, presenting the four different types of community around a project makes it easier to ask whether the project lead conceptualises the community as more of a club or a&nbsp;stadium?</p><p>If you need some help with your community, get in touch! WAO are specialists in the Venn diagram overlap between learning, technology, and community 🙂</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">How Open Source communities are evolving</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>When I first started this site a few years back Scotland’s Blockchain industry was non-existent. 
 Given it’s critical role as a foundation technology for a digital society this was disappointing and concerning. 
<p>On <a href="https://podcasts.scot/episode/scotland-europes-blockchain-capital/">a podcast</a> in 2021 Zumopay stated the lofty ambition for Scotland to become Europe’s Blockchain capital, and this would have seemed like nothing more than a pipe dream.</p>
<p>However when you consider the evolution of the sector over just the last year or two, you can see that the roots have formed such that this is actually now an achievable goal.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
 
 Zumopay themselves are of course a keynote exemplar. Just one year on from their £1.3m seed round <a href="https://zumo.money/press_releases/zumo-reports-100x-user-growth/">they reported</a> a 100x year on year user growth, are pioneering the <a href="https://zumo.money/press_releases/zumo-receives-government-funding-to-continue-crypto-decarbonisation-push/">decarbonization of crypto</a>, and <a href="https://zumo.money/press_releases/zumo-launches-first-full-stack-b2b-crypto-as-a-service-platform/">have launched</a>&nbsp;a B2b ‘Crypto-as-a-Service’ platform. 
 CD Corp is making the very smart move to specialize in helping small businesses integrate NFT’s into their business model. Following on from their <a href="https://digitalscot.net/whisky-on-the-blockchain/">Whisky Barrel client win</a> they just <a href="https://twitter.com/cdcorp__/status/1573000432317878272">announced a new project</a> with Aberfam. 
 In Nov 2020 <a href="https://siccar.net/siccar-connects-with-par-equity-to-secure-a-1-3m-investment-round/">Siccar raised</a> a £1.3m funding round, and in July 2021 Blockchain Technology Partners <a href="https://medium.com/blockchaintp/blockchain-technology-partners-raises-2-million-seed-round-led-by-force-over-mass-and-signature-865e346ece10">raised £2m</a>. Both specialize in the massive enterprise Blockchain market, addressing requirements such as secure data sharing and distributed ledger, smart contract, provenance, and cloud technologies. 
 Nov 2021 – Carbon Based Lifeforms <a href="https://scottishgames.net/2021/11/16/project-gateway-returns-with-1-7m-funding-for-blockchain-based-mmo/">launched</a> as a new game studio with $1.7m funding, announcing Project Gateway, a MMO/RPG underpinned by a Bitcoin and NFT asset-based play-to-earn, player-owned market economy. 
 Executives from one of Scotland’s giant tech successes Fanduel have also expanded into the sector, launching <a href="https://vault.fan/">Vault</a> and <a href="https://www.betdex.com/">BetDEX</a>. Both are innovating atop the Solana Blockchain platform, building a creator platform where fans unlock access to exclusive content by owning the key to a creator’s vault and a decentralized sports betting exchange. 
 
<p>A relatively short list but the breadth and depth of these ventures is considerable, each market they serve alone is very large, from enterprise technologies through global betting.&nbsp;BetDEX in particular is the heavyweight player, raising a massive <a href="https://www.betdex.com/post/former-fanduel-executives-launch-betdex">$21m seed round</a> from world-class investors and leading the development of the <a href="https://beststartup.scot/monaco-protocol-provides-foundation-for-web3-sports-betting-applications/">Monaco sports betting protocol</a>.</p>
 What more can we do? 
<p>Given this leap from nothing to a very significant industry footprint it begs the question what more can we do? If this is ‘first gear’ for Scotland’s Blockchain industry, what would it look like to step up through gears two, three and beyond, what benefits would that bring and how can we make it happen?</p>
<p>Naturally each is focused on their individual business success, but what could be achieved if we consolidated our efforts to grow their collective success and further expand the industry as a whole?</p>

 The single most important project relative to the goals of the Scottish Blockchain Network has been pioneered by <a href="https://www.thewhiskybarrel.com/">The Whisky Barrel</a> and their tech experts <a href="https://cdcorp.co.uk/">CD Corp</a>. 
<p>It’s so important because the primary challenge the industry faces is that it can be an extremely confusing, jargon-filled sector, to the extent it’s perceived as a very cliquey community populated only by hard-core techies and is thus inaccessible, and critically, irrelevant to others especially businesses.</p>
<p>Therefore’s it’s essential to showcase case studies that explain in plain english how businesses are adopting the technology, what use case it has been employed for and what benefits this has brought the company.</p>
<p>The Whisky Barrel project demonstrates i) how they have integrated it into and enhanced their e-commerce strategy, and ii) the technology field is still so young that it’s possible to achieve world firsts, and thus significant competitive advantage and associated PR potential.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/scotch-whisky-bottler-releases-one-26433299">Insider reported</a> they have released one of the world’s first single-cask Scotch whiskies with a digital provenance certificate, using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to digitally certify its whisky, which securely transmits essential product information on a public ledger, helping collectors and connoisseurs alleviate the risk of investing in counterfeit whisky.</p>
<p>Each of the 152 individually-numbered bottles feature a unique QR code that links to its corresponding digital certificate. This token provides digital proof of ownership, as well as the provenance of each bottle.&nbsp;Each NFT is minted on the Solana blockchain platform, which was chosen for its carbon-neutral and low-energy consumption qualities.</p>

<p>This article explains how verifiable credentials can be used to benefit event organizers and visitors alike based on a practical usage of the Lissi&nbsp;team.</p> Introduction <p>Currently, the majority of event tickets are issued in paper form or as&nbsp;.pdf files, which contain the relevant information about the event as well as the visitor. However, since these files can be easily transferred to another person, a personalisation of the ticket in combination with a verification of an identity document at the entrance is required to ensure that the buyer and visitor are the same person. This creates unnecessary overhead and complications for both the visitor and organizer. Therefore, we propose using verifiable credentials to avoid ticket scalping and provide direct access to online resources with the&nbsp;ticket.</p> Benefits of using verifiable credentials for&nbsp;tickets   Ownership binding and verifiability — tickets are bound to a specific owner and are not transferable  Prevention of ticket fraud — tickets are digitally signed by an&nbsp;issuer  Usage of the ticket for authentication (e.g. to access a digital stream, online presentations etc.) — Your ticket is your username and password!  Avoiding ticket scalping and ticket bots and therefore retain control over the secondary market — tickets are bound to a specific person and are not transferable  Directly communicate with a user in a messenger like way — a peer-to-peer connection between the event organizer or ticketing provider is being established and can be used for the exchange of further information  Cheap and convenient user identification and the possibility to verify multiple credentials at the same time (e.g. ticket, covid test, studentID, etc.)   How it&nbsp;works: <p>The user registers for an event via a website. For our pilot integration we used an established ticketing provider for the registration process. However, this process can also be fully executed based on decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. We sent an e-mail containing the required steps to derive the ticket into a wallet, which supports verifiable credentials. The following screens illustrate the process of receiving the ticket and presenting it to a verifier such as an access control authority at a physical&nbsp;event.</p>Illustration of the user flow of using the event ticket with&nbsp;Lissi. The verification process <p>As illustrated in the flow the access authority presents an QR-code, which is scanned by the visitor. Once scanned with the wallet, the visitor is requested to share his or her ticket (as well as additional information if required). Given the visitor agrees to share the information the verification status (valid / invalid) is presented as well as the attributes of the ticket. The access authority can use any device, which supports a web application (such as an laptop, mobile phone etc.) to verify the tickets of the&nbsp;visitor.</p> Our experience with verifiable tickets <p>We used verifiable tickets as part of our monthly <a href="https://neosfer.de/events">Between the Towers</a> event series. It was visited by around 70 people. While the download of the Lissi Wallet and derivation of the verifiable ticket was optional, more than 90 percent of visitors got the verifiable ticket in advance. While there were minor user experience issues (mainly due to work profiles on the phone) the vast majority of visitors were very satisfied with the user experience.</p><p>During the verification process most of the users started to show the verifiable credential within the wallet instead of directly scanning the QR-code presented, because the concept of scanning a QR-code to present a credential isn’t intuitive to users yet. However, once users present a credential with the wallet they understand how the process&nbsp;works.</p> Possible expansion for future&nbsp;events:   Identification of the visitor in advance of the ticket purchase.  Issuance of a picture of the visitor as part of the&nbsp;ticket.  Usage of the ticket for the authentication (login) to an online platform.  Communication with the&nbsp;visitor  Provision of further information to the visitor via direct communication channel  Usage of the ticket for discounted access (e.g. 10 % discount for the ticket next&nbsp;year)  <p>If you are interested in diving deeper into the topic, the research paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12525-022-00573-9.pdf">Exploring the use of self‑sovereign identity for event ticketing systems</a>” by Simon Feulner, Johannes Sedlmeir, Vincent Schlatt and Nils Urbach will provide a great overview.</p><p>We would be delighted to hear your ideas about the usage of verifiable tickets in your next events.

While Trust Frameworks are not a novel concept, their application to the digital identity space is much more recent, and new to Aotearoa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report-DISTF-1.pdf">DINZ’s Reflections Report</a>&nbsp;is industry’s response to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/reports/document/SCR_122616/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Final Report</a>&nbsp;published in April by the Select Committee members of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee that responds to and makes recommendations based on the submissions made on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/LMS459583.html?src=qs">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bil</a>l at the end of last year. The Select Committee is not expert in the subject matter of Digital Identity Trust Frameworks. However DINZ does have essential subject matter and operational expertise with an inherent obligation to share its experience for better outcomes in Aotearoa. DINZ welcomes the continued passage of the bill through Parliament recognising that the opportunity to change it substantially during this period is small. It is more likely that the detail contained in the DINZ Reflections Report will be considered once the regulatory operation of the Act is underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a classic example of the demonstrable value of DINZ – Aotearoa’s own digital identity industry association – and for that matter all associations operating under the&nbsp;<a href="https://techalliance.nz/">NZ Tech Alliance</a>&nbsp;banner.

<p>Nearly one billion people on earth lack any form of widely recognized identity.</p><p>Let me say that again…a billion people! Looked at another way, that is one person in eight alive today living without any official record of their existence.</p><p>These individuals are mostly women and children, the majority are poor, and many are refugees or displaced persons. Their status — or rather, lack of official status — represents a constant barrier to participation in modern social, economic, and political life.</p><p>Many of us are lucky enough to live in countries where we have multiple forms of ID; a driver’s license or transit pass, which enables us to get where we need to go, a work ID to access our place of employment, credit or debit cards to make purchases, health ID cards to receive medical care, logins to access our work, financial, and social media accounts, and more. We use them without thinking about it and generally take them for&nbsp;granted.</p><p>But, if you want to get a sense of what life is like without a formal identity, try leaving all your forms of ID at home for one day. It will open your&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>If you are lucky, you will make it to work without being pulled over by a police officer (caution: your day is likely to get much worse if you do). Without carrying a driver's license, you will probably be looking over your shoulder and driving more slowly and carefully, experiencing — though to a lesser degree — the fear and uncertainty that those without ID experience on a daily basis, across all of their activities. You may return home hungry because you were unable to pay for lunch, or do any of the other activities that require a credit card. And, hopefully, the security guard in the lobby recognizes you — or can call someone to admit you — otherwise, you might be heading home early to “work remotely.”</p><p>Seriously… try a day of not using any form ID to recognize just how much you depend on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Digital ID can be a powerful tool that both empowers individuals and protects their basic human rights and civil liberties.</p><p>Those who lack an official identity find it difficult or impossible to access basic services, such as education, employment, health care, and financial services. They are unable to exercise their rights as citizens and voters and participate in the modern economy. Giving these individuals an official identity unlocks countless opportunities.</p><p>Article Six of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.” Adopted in 1948, the Declaration defines a variety of rights to which we are all entitled; equal treatment before the law, dignity, nationality, privacy, education, mobility, and more. Being able to prove one’s identity is fundamental to the full exercise of these&nbsp;rights.</p><p>In 2015, the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDG 16.9) established a target of providing legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030. The UN, World Bank, and nations around the world have made admirable progress toward closing the “identity gap.” In a recent <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/un-expects-350m-more-people-worldwide-to-get-legal-identity-by-2025">Biometric Update 16.9 Podcast</a>, UNDP’s Niall McCann predicted that, by 2025, 350 million more people will have a recognized form of identity. This would be a remarkable accomplishment. But, from our perspective, closing the identity gap is necessary, but, ultimately, insufficient.</p><p>The world would be a simpler place if having an ID guaranteed these rights. Of course, it doesn’t. For some individuals who do have an ID — religious and ethnic minorities, political dissidents, for example — relying on a national ID system can have the opposite effect, making them more susceptible to exclusion, oppression, and persecution. For these individuals, alternative forms of ID are necessary to ensure that their rights — and, in some cases, their lives — are protected.</p><p>Done properly, “good ID” can help address both challenges, offering the promise of both empowerment and protection. And yet, all ID systems — digital or paper-based — come with attendant risks, which must be understood and intentionally mitigated through technology, design, policy, and enforcement choices by public and private sector decision-makers.</p><p>At ID2020, we often say that “good ID = good technology + good policy + good governance.”</p><p>There is a dangerous tendency to think that we can “tech our way out of any problem.”</p><p>The reality is that technology alone cannot adequately prevent exclusion, oppression, surveillance, and a variety of other undesirable outcomes. Building ID systems — especially digital ID systems — in an ethical manner requires governance frameworks and robust policy and regulatory safeguards that add an extra layer of protection. This is why collaboration between governments, multilateral and bilateral funders, civil society, and the private sector is so essential.</p><p>We are encouraged by the progress being made. At the same time, we are humbled by the task ahead of us and know that we must do&nbsp;more.</p><p>Living up to the intent of SDG 16.9 and the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights </a>will require not only expanding access to ID, but also ensuring that these systems are designed, built, and implemented in ways that protect fundamental human rights, enhance equity, and promote social and financial inclusion.</p><p>We hope that you will join us today in celebrating Identity Day by taking a moment to reflect on how our community — and, indeed, each of us individually — can help enhance equity, inclusion, and social and economic justice through our&nbsp;work.</p><p>Thank you.</p>

In <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">Quick wins to improve your Open Source community’s Architecture of Participation</a>, we talk about some tactics any project can implement quite&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>In this post, we continue using our Architecture of Participation, and present some strategies that will help this successful project. In one way or another, they all deal with developing empathy.</p> Clear mission <p>LocalGov Drupal has a fantastic mission. As the project grows, it’s important to ensure that the community stay on course with that&nbsp;mission:</p><blockquote>The publishing platform created by councils, for councils.</blockquote><p>This is expanded to explain&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>LocalGov Drupal is a publicly owned asset that delivers a better digital experience for citizens, improves service outcomes, and saves&nbsp;money.</blockquote><p>In order for councils to continue creating the platform, there needs to be clarity around how it is publicly owned and operated. What mechanisms exist for the community to influence the direction of the&nbsp;project?</p>Diagram via <a href="http://sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/">Sociocracy for&nbsp;All</a> Recommendations   Involve the community in decision making through defined workflows and&nbsp;roles.  Share information and be transparent about financials (e.g. shortfalls in funding, investment opportunities) by creating a ‘funding’ circle that members can&nbsp;join.  Use consent-based decision making within relevant Sociocratic circles to guide relationship establishment with partner organisations.   Invitation to participate <p>The advice in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">our blog</a> post to take the time to personally invite people stands true, this is a game changer for participation. Another helpful way to ensure that you are inviting a diverse group of people is to establish some repeatable norms for the community.</p><p>At the beginning of meetings, invite people to check in by saying how they are arriving at that meeting. This gives people an opportunity to say how they are feeling, what might be bothering them or what they hope to get out of their participation.</p><p>In addition, create repeatable norms by inviting people to check out places they can get involved. Ask for feedback early and often, model pro-social behaviours around invitations that extend across the&nbsp;project.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/?s=participation">Participatory Culture</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a> Recommendations   Get in the habit of using check–ins / checkouts in ALL meetings to make people feel welcome, bring their ‘full selves’, and be ready for participation. Sign-ins and written check-ins are&nbsp;great!  Feed the #showyourwork channel by encouraging people to share what they’ve done, however&nbsp;small.  Share v0.1 of your work for feedback (rather than v1.0) to get feedback around direction as well and not just the ‘final&nbsp;polish’.   Easy onboarding + modular&nbsp;approach <p>A successful open source project like LocalGov Drupal has A LOT of information to wrap your head around. There are a lot of ways into the project, different places communication is taking place and a variety of technical and social skills required to participate.</p><p>In order to make onboarding to a project or community easy for anyone, it can help to present information in several different ways. Thinking about (and documenting!) pathways people might be using to come into a project can help the community see where information could be tidier. This in turn can help the community identify places where a different view of the information might be&nbsp;helpful.</p><a href="https://whimsical.com/contribution-pathways-8sy99ptgRoxG4DTtJAsQeW">Visualised contribution pathways for&nbsp;LGD</a> Recommendations   Create a step-by-step checklist of onboarding and interview new community members regularly to help improve&nbsp;it.  Develop and promote the documentation system (aka the wiki) to ensure that contribution guidelines are up-to-date.  Ensure the full context of the LGD project isn’t just held in the heads of core team members by creating standing agenda&nbsp;items.  Help prevent confusion for new community members by using (and updating) <a href="https://whimsical.com/contribution-pathways-8sy99ptgRoxG4DTtJAsQeW">contribution pathways</a>.  Identify the “most used” resources and make sure they are accessible in multiple ways (e.g. record a screencast of the most popular slidedeck or write a blogpost about the most popular&nbsp;graphic)   Strong leadership + celebration of milestones <p>There are many different types of leadership. Strong leadership in an open source project is both distributed and diverse, marked by empathy, fair processes, and the establishment/encouragement of positive relationships.</p><p>The approach being experimented with by LocalGov Drupal, and which we have seen work extremely well within the co-operative movement is Sociocracy. LGD already has a product group, steering group, and technical group, however consent-based decision-making is not necessarily the norm within these groups’ meetings.</p><p>Governance is a work in progress and so we should celebrate both milestones in the project (e.g. technical development) but also milestones in the maturity of the organisation. Those with more mature governance are able to devolve decision-making to relevant circles, encouraging democratic processes and removing bottlenecks.</p> Recommendations   Arrange a Sociocracy refresher workshop and invite everyone in the community. Document the content of the workshop and include it in the LGD knowledge base.  Ensure that each circle has an established “lead” and ask that person to participate in creating standing agenda items together with the other&nbsp;leads.  Celebrate milestones by issuing badges for everything from onboarding, to pro-social behaviours the LGD community wants to encourage, through to membership of groups/circles.  Plan for a specific role around governance and operations to allow ‘business as usual’ to flourish as well as innovation work.  Share progress around governance issues as well as technical development on the blog, newsletter, and in presentations about the&nbsp;project.   Ways of working open + backchannels <p>There are bits of information that need to be kept confidential for the good of the project, but as an open source community, you should default to the highest level of openness you&nbsp;can.</p><p>As you work openly, try not to make judgements about what’s “relevant” to the community. Community members will decide for themselves what is relevant and what isn’t. Just remember to add an appropriate license (e.g. Creative Commons) to help people know in what ways they can share and contribute.</p><p>In order for people to bring their full selves to the project and contribute in diverse ways, they need to be able to talk about things which may be slightly off-topic. These are opportunities to strengthen relationships between community members, much as people who work in the same office bond by sharing stories around the watercooler.</p><p>Positive, pro-social behaviours need to be modelled by those in leadership positions. This is why the habits of those leading meetings, giving presentations, and otherwise having responsibility within the LGD community are so important.</p>CC-BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Recommendations   Establish at least one #backchannel in Slack to enable community members to get to know one another without being disruptive in a work-related channel.  Provide guidance on licences which relate to documentation of the project, over and above the code. For example, Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC&nbsp;BY-SA</a>.  Make decisions about technology used for community interaction based on established processes and criteria.  Revisit the Code of Conduct on at least an annual basis to ensure that nothing is standing in the way of diverse community contribution.  Issue badges based on regular (monthly/quarterly) mini-workshops on what it means to work openly and model/encourage open behaviours.   Onwards! <p>Open source is about collaboration, not just code. Finding ways to help people feel welcome and seen is a good way to help your open source project be sustainable.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-architecture-of-participation-for-community-growth-ed9d964ec360">An Architecture of Participation for Community growth</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Department of Homeland Security Signs on as First Premier Sponsor of New Public/Private Partnership</p> 


<p>14 September 2022 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, today announced that NIEM (formerly known as National Information Exchange Model), will transition to NIEM Open, an OASIS Open Project, in October 2022. A collaborative partnership between private industry and all levels of governmental agencies, the NIEM framework enables the effective and efficient sharing of critical data as currently demonstrated in the justice,&nbsp;public safety,&nbsp;emergency and disaster management,&nbsp;intelligence, and&nbsp;homeland security&nbsp;sectors. NIEM is designed to facilitate the creation of automated enterprise-wide information exchanges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology">Science and Technology Directorate</a> (S&amp;T) has committed to support NIEM Open at the Premier Sponsor level to advance the critical work of the project.</p>



<p>This October, when NIEM transitions from the U.S. Department of Defense to OASIS, an ANSI-accredited and ISO-recognized standards development organization, NIEM’s expansion into global markets will provide access to a larger pool of stakeholders and developers to contribute to the project, creating a path for NIEM to become an official standard in national and international policy and procurement. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Transitioning to an OASIS Open Project allows NIEM to become more readily available to international communities and organizations that want to adopt NIEM,” said Stuart Whitehead of the U.S. Department of Defense. “We look forward to working with new alliances in the private sector to assist in the integration of NIEM into even broader user communities, allowing NIEM to become the gold standard for public-private partnerships. This is an exciting time to continue to advance the NIEM model technically as it transforms into an open, international standard.”</p>



<p>“At OASIS, there’s an extensive set of processes for collaborative development of standards. This is the type of environment that technology companies and government agencies need to accelerate interoperability initiatives across boundaries,” said Katherine Escobar, Deputy Division Chief for the Joint Staff’s J6 Data and Services Division. “We will continue to look for ways to simplify use, embrace emerging technologies, and welcome new communities. We look forward to expanding the NIEM footprint and seeing NIEM Open help organizations exchange information to improve decision making, increase efficiency, and advance their missions.”</p>



<p>“DHS S&amp;T is excited to see the evolution of NIEM to an OASIS Open Project,” said Philip Mattson, Standards Executive and Senior Standards Advisor at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;“This will strengthen NIEM’s overall development, raising the level of collaboration in diverse communities.”</p>



<p>NIEM Open’s Sponsors will provide strategic vision, governance, and technical guidance for future efforts and have the option to serve on the Project Governing Board, where they approve work produced by the community as well as proposals for new open source projects. To learn more about becoming a Sponsor and joining the Project’s Governing Board, please contact <a>join@oasis-open.org</a>.</p>



<p>Additional Information:</p>



<p>About NIEM:</p>



<p>Established in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, NIEM is a community-driven, standards-based approach to facilitate information sharing. U.S. and International organizations across Federal, State, Local, Tribal, Territorial, Public, Private and Commercial sectors use NIEM as a common base data model and methodology to promote interoperability of data and software, reduce design and development time for information exchange applications, and allow the reuse of intellectual capital and skills across multiple projects.</p>

<p>As the world works towards climate goals, a government project from Canada is using digital trust technology to make it easier and more secure for natural resource companies to share sustainability data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) was established by the Government of British Columbia in recognition that we must do more to facilitate the transition to a clean, resilient economy. British Columbia (B.C.), Canada’s western-most province, was the first province in Canada to implement greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and mandatory sustainability reporting for major sectors of the provincial economy. As leaders in climate change legislation, B.C. is well positioned to explore cutting-edge technology in the journey towards a low-carbon economy. To improve trust, accuracy, and efficiency when sharing sustainability data, EMDT is coordinating a digital ecosystem – a network of organizations including environmental auditors, government bodies, mining and energy companies, and non-government organizations.</p>



<p>Improved Sustainability Reporting&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, reporting sustainability data can be challenging. Data is difficult to exchange internationally, and consumers cannot always access, or trust, reported data, not to mention the administrative burden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT’s digital ecosystem makes it possible to exchange sustainability information simply and securely, using digital credentials.</p>



<p>Digital credentials:&nbsp;</p>



  Can be shared quickly and are tamper-proof.&nbsp;  Allow companies to control their data.&nbsp;  Guarantee the integrity of the information.&nbsp;  Preserve privacy in business-to-business interactions.&nbsp;  



<p>Digital Trust Ecosystem: EMDT Pilot&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT has been testing and refining their technology and governance through multiple pilot projects to demonstrate how sustainability reporting can be made more efficient and trustworthy. Two pilot projects explore greenhouse gas emissions reporting in the mining sector and the natural gas sector. These pilots allow participants to test sharing and receiving digital credentials that include verified GHG emissions data for a specific mine site or natural gas facility.</p>







<p>*Because this is a pilot, the process depicted in this diagram does not satisfy or replace existing regulatory reporting obligations.</p>



<p>The greenhouse gas (GHG) mining pilot builds upon the existing regulatory emissions reporting process in British Columbia. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an environmental auditor, issues a digital credential to Copper Mountain Mining Company containing verified GHG data. Copper Mountain can then use the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report Verification Credential as part of their GHG emissions report to British Columbia’s Climate Action Secretariat. Copper Mountain can use the same digital credential to complete voluntary reporting to organizations such as the <a href="https://openclimate.org/">Open Earth Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increased Connections&nbsp;</p>



<p>To facilitate the broad exchange of sustainability data, EMDT used Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries to create a highly interoperable tool, called Traction. Traction is an API accelerator built on top of Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-PY). Traction streamlines the process of sending and receiving digital credentials for governments and organizations.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries makes Traction highly interoperable with the technological solutions of companies and organizations around the world. “While two wallets might be different implementations or might be written in different code, they can still exchange data because both wallets use Aries,” explains Kyle Robinson, EMDT’s Senior Strategic Advisor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traction makes it easier to integrate digital trust technology into existing lines of business:&nbsp;</p>



  API-first Architecture: Traction is designed with an API-first architecture. This RESTful API allows for integration into existing line-of-business applications already being used by organizations. The Tenant user interface is built on this API to enable adoption prior to integration and for low-use functions.  Multitenancy: ACA-Py is implemented on a cloud-based server so multiple wallets can be managed with one Traction instance.&nbsp;  Higher Scalability: Traction is open-source technology, encouraging collaborative refinement, faster release, and higher scalability of the technology.  



<p>Collaborative Climate Change Progress</p>



<p>With an increasing emphasis on responsibly sourced products, simplified methods for exchanging sustainability data ensures that B.C. natural resource providers can compete in a global market. Digital trust technology streamlines access to trustworthy sustainability data, allowing businesses, governments, and non-government organizations to work towards climate change goals more efficiently and effectively. <a href="http://digital.gov.bc.ca/emdt">Visit our website</a> to learn more about Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust.</p>

<p>Until now, integrating with the Commercio blockchain required an IT framework and in-depth technical knowledge.</p>
<p>The two options available to date were:</p>
 
 develop a native integration (in case using the sdk),<br>
develop an integration in Rest Api (using the Commercio.app). 
 
<p>Both options require a large number of tasks that added together really take up a lot of time and energy.</p>
<p>This is where automation comes in.&nbsp;It gives you back this valuable time and makes a complex concept, such as blockchain, accessible to anyone who needs to use it.</p>
<p>Starting today, thanks to the invaluable work of the brilliant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ncontin/">Nicola Contin</a> of We Can Consulting SpA, you can use Zapier to connect your Commercio app to 5000+ other services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to get started with Zapier 
<p>Zapier is a tool you can use to automate different tasks, connect different Apps, and integrate them. It then allows you to tell Zapier what you want to achieve, without having to write a single line of code.</p>
<p>For example, whenever you get a new lead, Zapier can ask Dropbox to tell it what files you have uploaded, and in real time notarize them on Commercio.network.<br>
With more than 5,000 integrations, you can integrate any storage system or any action produced by one of these integrations with Commercio.network.</p>
<p>To use Zapier, you must first <a href="https://zapier.com/app/billing/plans">create an account.&nbsp;</a> There are different plans, including a free plan that includes 5 single-step zaps and 100 activities.</p>
<p>But before we begin, here are some terms you need to know:</p>
<p>Zap<br>
A Zap is an automated workflow between your Apps.&nbsp;They are a set of instructions you define in Zapier to perform predefined tasks.&nbsp;A zap is triggered when a certain event (a trigger) occurs in an app.</p>
<p>Trigger<br>
Triggers are basically events within software that initiate a workflow.&nbsp;The trigger sends a set of information to Zapier that can be used in zaps to perform actions in other online services, which are also connected to Zapier.</p>
<p>Action<br>
The action is any step taken by zap.&nbsp;For example, each time a row is added to a Google sheet, a zap updates the stock of a product.</p>
<p>Task<br>
A task is how Zapier keeps track of your actions.&nbsp;This is important when you choose your plans.&nbsp;Each time a zap performs one of its “Action” steps, Zapier considers it to be a task.&nbsp;For example, your zap updates the product stock twice a day, Zapier considers this as two tasks.</p>
<p>Remember this when you select your rate plan.</p>
 Commercio Network + Zapier 
<p>Grazie al nuovo Add-On Zapier, ora puoi connettere la blockchain di Commercio ad altri servizi online e impostare l’automazione, sempre senza scrivere una sola riga di codice.</p>
<p>Prima di tutto ti devi collegare a https://commercio.app/ , creare un account, confermarlo e acquistare una membership.</p>
<p>A quel punto, colleghi l’account tramite l’estensione Zapier inserendo username e password dell’account di Commercio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now your connection is complete, and you can start configuring triggers and ready-to-use actions.</p>
<p>Your App automatically notifies Zapier whenever one of these two triggers occurs:</p>
 
 List of share doc processes initiated 
 Wallet amount 
 
<p>For example, you can create a zap that checks your wallet funds in real time, or that checks whether a new document has moved from the process queue to actual notarization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can automate the following actions in your Commercio.app using the information collected in Zapier:</p>
 
 Creating a new share doc 
 Searching for a specific process id to check the status of a transaction 
 
<p></p>
 Killer APP: Dropbox integration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of a Killer APP might be the Dropbox integration:</p>
<p>connect your Dropbox account, and with each file upload start a new share doc and notice it in real time.</p>
<p></p>

  💡  Read the <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Getting Started Guide</a> to start building with ComposeDB&nbsp;   What is ComposeDB on Ceramic? <p>ComposeDB on Ceramic is a decentralized, composable graph database. It provides different configurations (building blocks) that allow developers to quickly build applications on Ceramic—including the ability to discover, create, share and reuse composable data models using GraphQL. </p><p>ComposeDB provides a complete data solution that supports multi-player use cases—like those demanded by social and DAO applications. Popular <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/highlighted-projects/">use cases</a> include projects around user profiles, reputation (publicly verifiable attestations for skills, credentials, and contribution scores), and user-generated content (portable social graphs, social media apps, networking, messaging, and blogs). </p><p>Today, Ceramic applies to a wide variety of use cases across different markets and segments. Its many examples include:</p>  Storing user-generated content as Ceramic streams for app interoperability  Storing contributor credentials for DAOs  Issuing and storing verifiable credentials  Creating unified conversation layers that can work across applications  Enabling fully encrypted wallet-to-wallet messaging  Storing user profile data  Storing dynamic NFT content and metadata attached to user identities  Dynamically appending metadata to NFTs over time<br>  <p>Following the production-ready release of ComposeDB, we expect to see applications that offer extremely rich end-user experiences—all built by developers who contributed to the community-driven data ecosystem on Ceramic. </p><p>Ceramic’s core team will present a production-ready version of ComposeDB in early 2023, one that will:</p>  Enable developers to define and query complex graph database schemas that feature many different forms of relations between accounts (e.g. a user) and their content (e.g. a social post)  Make indexing and querying possible on Ceramic  Make data models and data more easily reusable on Ceramic  Support advanced permissioning   Overview of ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>This section outlines the five features and components that make ComposeDB on Ceramic possible. Click <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.2.x/guides/concepts-overview">here</a> for a full overview of concepts.</p> Composites &amp; Data Models <p>Composites are composable building blocks used by developers. They are groups of data models (e.g. profiles, blog posts, and comments) that together define the graph database schema for an application. Content streams in Ceramic have metadata that automatically associates them to a data model, which defines the shape and schema of that data, as well as to accounts and other content (e.g. User X liked a post by User Y). Composites aggregate these lower-level data models into higher-level groups for application development. Composites are created by developers in the community and all feed into Ceramic’s ecosystem, making it easy for different applications to reuse and share data.</p><p>As we shift toward Composites, we’ll be sunsetting the previous data models module and discouraging using TileDocument streams.</p> Database <p>There are a few important changes required when running a JS Ceramic node after the ComposeDB release. Every node must now be backed by a SQL database, SQLite or Postgres, that will be used to index the data and construct the database for the data models in your Composite. Each node decides what to index and store in the database based on the models contained in its Composite, which must be passed to the node during development time.</p><p>Ceramic acts as a syncing protocol that maintains your local database state against a global network of documents and interoperable data models, maintained via the same verifiable event streams that have always been at the core of Ceramic—allowing you to trust the integrity of your index.</p> GraphQL <p>Developers only need to use one library, the ComposeDB Client, which provides a GraphQL interface to Ceramic. This client needs to be passed a Composite in order to saturate its own APIs and know which data models you’re using. Once your ComposeDB Client is loaded with your Composite, you can make GraphQL queries and mutations against your Ceramic node. Using ComposeDB will be much easier and more streamlined than building directly with previous developer packages on Ceramic—such as IDX or DID DataStore.</p> Data Model Reusability and Marketplace <p>Composites and their underlying data models are designed to be reusable, making it simple to build complementary and interoperable apps. Apps that reuse each other's Composites create instant interoperability, without any integrations needed. To date, developers have had to manually submit data models to the Registry on Github. Data models are now automatically indexed, enabling easier discovery and reuse. In the first release milestone, getting existing models happens through commands in the ComposeDB CLI, but we’ll follow closely with a UI.</p> Object Capabilities <p>One of the biggest challenges in Web3 is offering the ease of use of Web2—one-click sign-in and user sessions—while also preserving the user’s control of their data. To enable this, we have a new library called “did-sessions” built with CACAO (Chain Agnostic Capability Object), offering a permissions model called<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/"> capability-based access control</a>. CACAO will integrate with ComposeDB to grant granular permissions to specific models. Permissions open up a range of new use cases, sign in flows, and data access patterns on Ceramic. This includes capability-based permission scoping, which allows a developer to specify which Composites or data models they’re asking permission for.</p><p>The first major use case we’re enabling with CACAO is Sessions. We’ve paired CACAO and did-sessions library with a new DID method, called did:pkh, and the Sign-In With Ethereum specification (with more chains to come). This will allow users to seamlessly sign-in with their wallet and delegate actions (e.g. “liking”) and storage permissions to the developer for time-bound periods.</p> Ceramic Today vs. ComposeDB on Ceramic <br><p>Ceramic Today</p><p>ComposeDB on Ceramic</p><p>DB Type</p><p>Key-Value Store</p><p>Graph Database</p><p>Models</p><p>Account to single JSON object (Data Models)</p><p>Property graph supporting one-to-many relationships (Composites)</p><p>Storage</p><p>TileDocument streams</p><p>Model streams, MID streams</p><p>Indexing</p><p>None</p><p>Indexing by each Ceramic node</p><p>Queries</p><p>Many JS Library Method Calls</p><p>GraphQL Queries</p><p>Clients</p><p>HTTP Client, ModelManager, DID DataStore, Self.ID SDK</p><p>HTTP Client, GraphQL Client</p><p>Accounts</p><p>3ID as default</p><p>did:PKH as default</p><p>Authentication</p><p>All-or-nothing permissions</p><p>Granular permissions per model</p><p>Composability</p><p>GitHub Data Models Registry</p><p>Marketplace for models</p><p>DX</p><p>Patchwork of client libraries</p><p>Streamlined flow and tooling</p><p>UX</p><p>Specific Ceramic sign-in popups</p><p>Familiar, Web3 wallet-native</p><p></p> Milestones for ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>The following milestones represent different releases of ComposeDB on Ceramic. The dates are targets, not commitments. Please join our mailing list or Discord Server to find out when new releases go live.</p> Developer Preview <p>The <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Developer Preview</a> will be available for developers who want to familiarize themselves with the new ComposeDB stack. Over the coming months the Ceramic core team will release new versions with improved functionality and documentation.</p><p>Available Early September </p><p>The earliest Developer Preview will offer the CLI and GraphQL Client, Composites, Sign-In With Ethereum, DID-Sessions, and the ability to explore models in the CLI. The core team will provide a Getting Started Guide, high level docs and js-ComposeDB API documentation. </p><p>Limitations: Currently, ComposeDB only supports defining relations between an account and the documents created by this account. Relations between documents and accounts are under development. In addition, there will be no scalability guarantees, no access to historical third-party data, it will not be available on mainnet and there will be no retroactive data availability.<br></p><p>Available Early October at Devcon in Bogota, Colombia</p><p>This release milestone provides simple relations between documents and accounts, enabling developers to test graph models so they can build richer and more engaging applications on Ceramic. </p><p>This version of the preview will offer simple (as compared to the following release) model relations, an improved docs portal with updated API documentation (js-compose, js-did, js-ceramic), Sign-In With Solana functionality and an updated way to index models that doesn’t require developers to restart their nodes. </p><p>Limitations include no access to historical third-party data, no optimization for deeply-nested queries with many relations and, at this time, ComposeDB will allow duplicate relations (e.g. liking the same post twice); therefore, developers will need to build preventative logic.</p><p>Available Late December </p><p>This release enables support for interfaces, allowing developers to evolve their application through extending existing data models, and unifying queries across different data models. This will also make it easier for developers to build shared interfaces with other applications (e.g. an interface for comments) as well as extend models for their app (e.g. adding more fields to a model).</p><p>For example, there could be a generic verifiable credential interface, this interface could be implemented by an education credential and a job employment credential. An application could make a union of these two credentials and seamlessly query across both of them. Verifiable credential MID streams won’t belong to the generic VC interface, but they will belong to more specific data models that implement the verifiable credential interface (e.g. education credential, job employment credential, DAO contribution credential, etc.).</p><p>Developers can expect support for sets, and indexable anchors that enable historical data sync retroactively. Historical data sync will enable a node to connect to the network and sync previous data (before the point in time that the particular node started indexing the data model). Historical data sync also means that if Node B goes down it will still be able to index the data via Node A, allowing historical data to sync between applications that share the same data model.</p><p>Available January 2023</p><p>This release enables developers to build on an open data ecosystem and define the data standards for their app (and others to come) to interoperate. </p><p>At this stage, queries will be executed more efficiently than before (server-side query execution), improvements will come to the dev portal, and easy-to-use node metrics will be available—in addition to self-serve mainnet access. </p><p>Limitations at this stage include multi-node deployments and a lack of hosted node options. </p> Production<br> <p>Available Early 2023</p><p>Developers can build quickly on ComposeDB to offer rich end-to-end user experiences on their apps—providing data models and interoperable data within the Ceramic ecosystem. </p><p>At this point, Ceramic will handle a standard deployment of millions of writes and reads per day, in addition to a UI for searching Composites (data models) and improved Getting Started documentation. A UI for searching data models and Composites will make building with ComposeDB on Ceramic faster than before. Templates for scaled deployments and a hosted infrastructure option will also become available.</p>  💡  Read the <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Getting Started Guide</a> to build with ComposeDB and let us know what you think via this <a href="https://m6mc0n6phdp.typeform.com/to/c9XafeHl">2-minute survey</a>

 How to take steps to recognise and encourage pro-social behaviours Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Anyone can create a badging system, if by ‘badging system’ we mean ‘lots of badges for discrete things’. Too often, though, these badges focus on credentialing rather than recognition.</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.”</blockquote><blockquote>(<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>We’re so conditioned into getting certificates and trophies for achievement (aka ‘credentials’) that sometimes we have to remind ourselves what we mean by recognition.</p><p>So instead of talking about this in an abstract way, let’s talk about it in the context of the <a href="https://badges.community/">Keep Badges Weird (KBW) community</a>, which currently has over 300&nbsp;members.</p> Identifying pro-social behaviours <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosocial_behavior">Pro-social behaviours</a> are those intended to benefit others, or society as a whole — for example, helping, sharing, donating, co-operating, and volunteering. Within a community, they’re the behaviours that make it an attractive space to belong to, and which encourage its growth and/or development. It’s a central part of the value cycles that underpin the Communities of Practice&nbsp;model.</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Within the KBW community, we already have a series of fine badges including those shown above. These also happen to be<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wtf-are-stealth-badges-41130a75a1a9"> ‘stealth’ badges</a>, awarded to community members without them actively seeking&nbsp;them.</p><p>The particular pro-social behaviours we have identified with these badges&nbsp;are:</p>  Coming to someone’s rescue — is someone stuck with a problem, or in an awkward situation?  Kicking off a discussion — has someone gone out of their way to prompt discussion or debate on an&nbsp;issue?  Keeping it positive — is there someone who’s done a good job of keeping the community focused on solutions rather than endlessly talking about problems?  <p>People don’t have to reach a high bar of have done something out of the ordinary to earn a badge that recognises a pro-social behaviour. For example, the first badge that most people in the KBW community earn is the ‘Keep Badges Weird’ badge, issued to those who <a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/introductions/9e0fa7d1-f307-4839-b1c8-5d95472c61a2">introduce themselves</a> in a dedicated thread.</p> Encouraging participation <p>The best badging systems evolve over time with communities. A great example of this is the <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/explore/badges">Fedora Linux community</a>, which has a badging system which at this point is around eight years old and contains hundreds of badges. These range from commonplace badges such as making a single contribution to the codebase, through to ultra-rare badges such as overall project&nbsp;leader.</p>Screenshot of Fedora&nbsp;badges<p>It’s interesting to note the different types of badges that are issued within this community:</p>  Content  Development  Community  Quality  Event  Miscellaneous  <p>These categories can emerge over time, and may not even be necessary at all. It’s important to understand that these emergent badge systems are built with community members, not for&nbsp;them.</p> A worked&nbsp;example <p>One of the resources that the KBW community helps maintain is <a href="https://badge.wiki">Badge Wiki</a>, a knowledge base for the entire Open Badges community. While it’s true that anyone with an account can edit the wiki, not so many&nbsp;do.</p><p>So the first thing we did was to create a time for us all to come together and work on it. We call this <a href="https://lu.ma/barn-raising">Badge Wiki barn raising</a>, and we do it monthly. Ideally, there are always new people on this call, as well as those who have been to at least one previous&nbsp;session.</p>Screenshot of Barn Raiser badge, description and&nbsp;criteria<p>The badge that those who come to a session can earn is shown above. This serves several purposes, from validating attendance (for those who need it) through to recognising the contribution they have&nbsp;made.</p><p>But where do we go next? How do we go from a single badge to start building out a badge system around stewardship of this particular resource?</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Perhaps the easiest place to start is to recognise people turning up on multiple occasions. They don’t have to be consecutive, and it doesn’t need to be the organiser of the session that keeps track. Instead, this could be a claimed badge based on pointing to evidence.</p><p>This kind of approach can be repeated ad infinitum. There’s value in doing so — the Fedora badges system has a badge for people who have performed 10,000 builds! But what else can we recognise and encourage? After all, people contribute to communities (including Open Source communities) in many and varied&nbsp;ways.</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>People also have different interests and talents, so why not recognise those? We chose three types of people from <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiAgent">this helpful list</a> as a way of helping people identifying roles for themselves, and to help people understand that there are lots of different ways to contribute and create value. Every Badge Wiki barn raising call starts with this, as a ritual and routine and a way for people to feel&nbsp;welcome.</p>Image CC BY&nbsp;WAO<p>Even this small demarcation of roles helps in a number of&nbsp;ways:</p>  People can start small and work their way onto bigger&nbsp;tasks  Contributors arrive with varying energy levels, so may be in the mood for different tasks on different days  People can follow their interests as well as their talents for contributing to the&nbsp;project.  <p>Inevitably, even in the first session, those who turned up as contributors to the Badge Wiki barn raising started identifying themselves as ‘FairyGardeners’&nbsp;. That is to say they felt like doing a couple of different things, or mashing up those roles. This is absolutely to be encouraged!</p> Conclusion <p>This has been a brief guide with worked examples of how to create a culture of recognition, taking steps to recognise and encourage pro-social behaviours. WAO don’t have all of the answers, so we’d love to hear from you! Please do comment below if you’ve got examples (or questions)</p><p>Recognition within a community of practice is best as a varied and emergent system, and so our next task is to create badges from these reflections for the <a href="https://lu.ma/barn-raising">Badge Wiki barn raising sessions</a>. If you would like to come along, please <a href="https://badges.community">join the KBW community</a> and turn up for the monthly sessions!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/creating-a-culture-of-recognition-39ffdb6cf943">Creating a culture of recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A roundup of previous seasons and a sneak peak into Season 5&nbsp;planning <p>After summer holidays, sunshine and lollipops, we’re getting back into the groove. This includes some thinking and planning around Tao of WAO Season&nbsp;5.</p><p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">The Tao of WAO is a podcast</a> about the intersection of technology, society, and internet culture — with a dash of philosophy and art for good measure. We <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/announcing-our-new-podcast-e38aaba57066">announced the podcast in May 2021</a>, and since then we’ve been pumping out season after season. We haven’t summed up the previous seasons, ever, so this is a quick post to do that and talk about what we’re planning for Season 5. Don’t want to read about it? <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">Then just go give it a&nbsp;listen</a>!</p>Our <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao">Soundcloud</a> header Season 1 <p>When we started the Tao of WAO, we weren’t sure what kind of format we wanted to have. We kicked off the podcast talking about cooperatism because, well, we’re a co-op. Over the course of the season we talked about being geriatric millennials, doing digital detoxes and had our first guest, John Evans from <a href="https://code-operative.co.uk">Code Operative</a>.</p> Season 2 <p>We started to hit our stride in Season 2. We kicked off the season with a trailer, and then had great conversations with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamjessklein/">Jess Klein</a> on Ethical Design and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kudzayingwerume/">Kudzayi Ngwerume</a> on Creativity and Movement Building. We also chatted about working remotely, unframeworks and keeping badges&nbsp;weird.</p> Season 3 <p>Our first episode of Season 3 had all the <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-o</a>p folks on. We talked about some of our internal policies around dormancy in the co-op. This was also the season we talked to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrilemoie/">Kerri Lemoie</a> about Verifiable Credentials, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexworradandrews/">Alex Worrad Andrews</a> about Networks of Networks, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/procter/">Adam Procter</a> about Social Impact Games. When we weren’t interviewing these amazing people, we recorded an episode on Misinformation and used our final episode of the season a somewhat random conversation about stuff we’d been working on and newsletters we like to&nbsp;read.</p> Season 4 <p>Again in Season 4, we managed to have amazing guests. We talked to <a href="https://outlandish.com/person/kayleigh-walsh/">Kayleigh Walsh</a> about Restorative Justice, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherleson/">Heather Leson</a> about Opening Up Social Impact Organisations and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryannalexander/">Bryan Alexander</a> about Futurism. In between our guest focused episodes, Doug and I talked about participation in Civic Society, Self-hosting IT and Reentering Events after&nbsp;Covid.</p> Season 5 (coming&nbsp;soon!) <p>You can probably tell from this short summary that we cover a wide variety of social, cultural and techie issues. In the new season, we’re planning to talk about edtech, communities of practice, feminism and more. We’ll have more book recommendations from our guests and more laughs coming soon to wherever you listen to your podcasts.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch! <p>We’re always looking for interesting folks with interesting things to say, so if you’d like to be a guest on the Tao of WAO, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">let us know</a>.

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Jason Sherman, Developer at <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/energy-mines-and-petroleum-resources">Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust, Government of British Columbia’s Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation</a>.</p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on and how you got into blockchain</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) is a pilot project enabling a collaborative digital ecosystem between the B.C. government, natural resource companies, and organizations around the world, making it simpler and more secure to share sustainability data. I am currently working on EMDT’s technology, called Traction. Traction is basically a layer above Hyperledger Aries&nbsp; Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) that enables the Government of British Columbia to use our technology for line of business applications. This allows the government to onboard into the world of digital credentials easily, and to track their business data with their credential and presentation exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Hyperledger frameworks or tools are you using in your projects? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>We are using Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and Hyperledger Indy. Using Hyperledger frameworks has increased Traction’s interoperability, making it possible to incorporate a broader range of participants, tools, and technologies into the digital ecosystem EMDT is coordinating. We’re using Hyperledger’s open-source software to accelerate the Government of B.C.’s ability to adopt these tools. My experience with Hyperledger technologies is that things change quickly! And any problem or use case I identify is usually already being addressed.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger Foundation to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>I think the Hyperledger Foundation should focus on multiple ledger support (which is already underway) and onboarding users (not developers) of the implemented technology.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a very steep learning curve, but it’s extremely worthwhile. You will very quickly identify areas where the technology could benefit your clients.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s projects continue to mature, what do you see as the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result?</p>



<p>I am interested in the ability for Hyperledger projects to enable more automated business flows using truly trusted and tamper-proof data. The number of personnel hours that can be saved just through automated conversation and interchange of data programmatically is massive.</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>I am hopeful that blockchain has the potential to improve trust between businesses. By exchanging information using blockchain technology and digital credentials, the validity and origin of the credential can always be verified, and businesses can proceed with their interactions confidently.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I would hope to see blockchain as a viable and easily selected technology, along the lines of Postgresql or MongoDb. I would hope that blockchain could be adopted as a mainstream technology that development teams can look at as a solution to solve their problems.</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>Your code isn’t precious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>

<p>The Universal Resolver is a utility developed by the community at DIF to resolve Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) across many different DID methods, based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID Core 1.0</a> and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">DID Resolution</a> specifications. It is a work item of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/">DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>, and is provided as a tool to support interoperability efforts and enable testing.</p>
 New DID methods 
<p>We continue to receive great contributions from the community in the form of new drivers as well as updates to existing ones, in order to support as many DID methods as possible. Several more DID methods have recently been added to the Universal Resolver, including:</p>
 
 
<p>did:indy (the long-awaited upgrade of the original did:sov method) - See <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:cheqd (from the Cheqd community) - See <a href="https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver">https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:com (from Commercio Network) - See <a href="https://commercio.network/">https://commercio.network/</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:ala</p>
 
 
<p>Did:everscale</p>
 
 
<p>The Universal Resolver can now resolve 45 DID methods, and more are being added regularly. Visit <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> to see the full list of supported methods, and visit <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/main/docs/driver-development.md">this github page</a> to contribute a driver for a DID method.&nbsp; In the event of a problem resolving a did or with driver functions, the contributor has 30 days to resolve the issue before the driver and DID method get delisted. This ensures that the list of methods on the Universal Resolver is regularly tested, and remains updated and functional.</p>
<p>For example, try the following commands to resolve DIDs to their DID documents:</p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE</a></p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:cheqd:mainnet:zF7rhDBfUt9d1gJPjx7s1JXfUY7oVWkY">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:cheqd:mainnet:zF7rhDBfUt9d1gJPjx7s1JXfUY7oVWkY</a></p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:com:1l6zglh8pvcrjtahsvds2qmfpn0hv83vn8f9cf3">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:com:1l6zglh8pvcrjtahsvds2qmfpn0hv83vn8f9cf3</a></p>
<p>Or try opening the UI to resolve the above DIDs:</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE">https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE</a></p>

 New hosting environment 
<p>It seems the community has been just as excited about the Universal Resolver as we are, and it has seen traffic grow steadily over the past few months: In order to serve this increased demand the hosting environment of the Universal Resolver has been upgraded and should now be able to handle additional load. DIF's public instance of the Universal Resolver can be reached at <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> and <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind however that this instance is meant for experimentation and testing only, NOT as a production service. It should not be used in situations where a reliable DID Resolution service is needed, or when DIDs are being resolved that are potentially sensitive from a privacy perspective. In general, self-hosting the Universal Resolver, or using other client-side DID Resolution tools, is preferable over relying on the public DIF-hosted instance.</p>
<p>Do you have any interesting applications or examples of where you have used the Universal Resolver? We would love to hear your experiences of it; constructive feedback is always welcome. Get in touch with us directly at <a href="mailto:ops@identity.foundation">ops@identity.foundation</a> or attend one of the meetings of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">DIF Identifiers &amp; DIscovery Working Group</a> to discuss. For further backstory on the Universal Resolver, see this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">blog post</a> and this <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/did-resolution-given-did-how-do-retrieve-document-markus-sabadello-webinar-13/">webinar</a>.</p>
<p>This new-and-improved Universal Resolver joins other tools, such as the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, a DIF community-maintained tool to create, update and deactivate Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIF has also recently published <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">version 2 of the DIDComm protocol spec</a> and version 2 of the Presentation Exchange Protocol. Other community tooling includes items like the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/vui-donation/">Verifier Universal Interface</a>, standard APIs to enable interoperability between ID Wallets and Verifier components, and the completed <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree specification</a>, a protocol for creating scalable Decentralized Identifier networks that can run atop any existing decentralized anchoring system and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The most popular implementation of Sidetree currently is <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION (the Decentralized Identity Overlay Network)</a>, a layer 2 system.

<p>The Finnish Ministry of Finance has granted the Findynet Cooperative a three-million-euro government grant to build a pilot environment for a self-sovereign identity network. The aim of this public-private cooperation is to strengthen Finland’s leading position in digitalization and support the emergence of investments in new digital services.</p>
<p>The Findynet Cooperative aims to develop a network that ensures that digital wallets developed by different service providers are interoperable, and work seamlessly for both organizations and individuals. Digital wallets enable individuals and organizations to share information about themselves in a reliable and secure manner in various situations. The funding will enable the Findynet Cooperative to develop a common and secure self-sovereign identity network, which can be used to ensure the correctness of information in electronic interactions.</p>
<p>– We are very happy to have received this government grant, which allows us to continue our long-term work with public and private sector actors and build a trust network covering all of society, comments Markus Hautala, Chairman of the Board of the Findynet Cooperative.</p>
<p>The trust network, which will now be built, promotes digital and human-centered data economies. This means that end-users manage their own data and can decide for themselves what information they share about themselves with different parties to preserve their privacy. For example, this exchange of information could involve electronic receipts, credit information, and proof of professional qualifications.</p>
<p>The founding members of the Findynet Cooperative include nine public and private sector organizations: Finance Finland, Finnish Post, Nixu, Nordea Bank, OP Financial Group, Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela), Technology Finland, Tietoevry and Vastuu Group.</p>
<p>The announcement by the Ministry of Finance on the subject can be found <a href="https://vm.fi/-/valtiovarainministerio-myontaa-valtionavustusta-itsehallittavan-identiteetin-luottamusverkon-kehittamiseen">here</a> (in Finnish).</p>

This release includes major updates to the front-end Switchboard web application as well as the back-end libraries and components, giving companies access to the full suite features offered by legacy identity access management solutions in a decentralized architecture.</p><p>Why we built Switchboard<br>Digital identity is integral to every facet of the energy sector, from basic administrative procedures (processing customer rebates for smart thermostats, or registering new solar systems) to high-stakes operational tasks (granting access to customer data, or sending control signals to generators). Given the importance of keeping identity data accurate and secure, as well as the risks and limitations of centralized management approaches as energy systems become increasingly diverse and distributed, SSI has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/decentralized-identity-market-worth-6-822-million-by-2027--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-301557216.html">fastest-growing segments</a> of the enterprise IT landscape in recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>We began developing what is now Switchboard in 2019 to address two gaps in the market that were hindering SSI adoption in the energy sector and&nbsp;beyond:</p>  Most SSI solutions are focused narrowly on end-users (individual identity wallets to store credentials) or organizations (platforms to issue credentials to internal users). We saw a need for a harmonized solution that not only addressed both of these requirements but also provided sophisticated features like role-based access control and identity management for non-human actors (i.e. hardware and software systems).  The end-to-end solutions that do exist align with open standards, but are based on proprietary technology, costly contracts, or permissioned back-ends (either private blockchains or centrally-administered databases). We saw a need for a fully open-source, low-cost solution built on a public network and tightly integrated with the Ethereum ecosystem to improve interoperability (e.g. support for multiple wallets) and usability.  <p>The alpha version of Switchboard was <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-unveils-ew-switchboard-2f71bc82daa0">launched on the Volta test network in late 2020</a> with basic tools for users to manage identities and credentials, and for application, developers to define roles and implement simple role-based access control for users. Since then the Energy Web team has overhauled both the user interface and back-end components to turn Switchboard into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade solution.</p><p>What’s new in production?<br>The production release of Switchboard incorporates several exciting new features that are critical for enterprise adoption:</p>  Credential Revocation: Identity and access management is a dynamic process, and when circumstances change they need to be reflected in user credentials. For example, when an employee resigns from the company, access rights need to be revoked in order to keep confidential information secure. Switchboard now offers tools for administrators to manually or programmatically revoke credentials based on customized business&nbsp;logic.  Credential Expiration: To maximize security credentials should never grant indefinite or permanent access to a given system. Just like driver’s licenses and passports, credentials should carry expiration dates and require ongoing renewal processes. Switchboard now allows role definers (e.g. organization administrators) to set default validity periods for credentials, which can be optionally overridden by&nbsp;issuers.  Full Support for Role-authorized Issuance: This feature allows administrators to delegate responsibility for the issuance of certain credentials to other entities based on their role within or relationship to the organization. For example, a user within a utility company who holds credentials to acquire the role of “IT Manager” may then inherit the ability to issue credentials to other internal users, or an external contractor with credentials granting the role of “Solar Hardware Installer” may inherit the ability to issue credentials to new photovoltaic systems. Multi-level hierarchies are now supported (for example, “Solar Hardware Installer” may be issued by “Installation Coordinator”) and the full hierarchy is verified upon each credential presentation.  Credential Issuance Based on Email Verification: Switchboard is currently used to support Energy Web’s staking system, which issues a verified email role credential based on email verification. This role credential is then used to authorize users to stake. (If you have participated in any Energy Web staking pools, you already have a DID with this credential and you can view its status in Switchboard under the “My Enrolments” page.) This functionality is now available for any other credential issuance and authorization use case that requires email verification.  Better Alignment with Verifiable Credentials Standards: We’ve made significant improvements to Switchboard’s underlying libraries and components to better align with new W3C Verifiable Credential Standards. Switchboard now supports the issuance of JSON-LD format Verifiable Credentials using an EIP-712 signature.  Asset Administration: Switchboard allows asset owners to assign identities to individual assets so they can be enrolled in applications and services, or managed throughout their lifecycle.

<p>Avast (LON:AVST), a company best known for its antivirus and other cybersecurity products for consumers, has joined the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation as a Steering Member. Avast recently acquired Evernym, a founding ToIP Steering Member, and SecureKey, a ToIP Contributor Member since 2020.</p>



<p>Avast’s ToIP Steering Committee member will be Drummond Reed, Director of Trust Services at Avast. Mr. Reed has served as Evernym’s Steering Committee member since the founding of ToIP in May 2020. He currently co-chairs the ToIP Governance Stack Working Group and Concepts and Terminology Working Group and is a vice-chair of the Technology Stack Working Group.</p>



<p>“Avast brings a new perspective to the Foundation’s mission of defining Internet-scale decentralized digital trust infrastructure,” said Mr. Reed. “Avast has a 30 year history of protecting the digital devices of over 435 million consumers. Now Avast wants to extend that protection to individual’s digital identity and relationships online because identity is at the very heart of cybersecurity.”</p>



<p>Avast, headquartered in Prague, is rapidly building one of the largest decentralized digital trust teams in the world. In June of 2021, they hired Charles Walton, a former Mastercard executive (and Mastercard’s original ToIP Steering Committee member), as General Manager of their new Digital Trust Services division. Then in December 2021, Avast acquired Evernym, one of the global leaders in self-sovereign identity (SSI). In March 2022 they announced the acquisition of SecureKey, operators of the Verified.Me network in Canada that is one of the largest bank ID networks in the world.</p>



<p>In a keynote speech at the European Identity Conference in Berlin, Mr. Walton said Avast would be focusing its efforts on the “empowered consumer”—giving individuals the tools they need to have portable, reusable digital identity credentials that do not depend on any one device, operating system, or identity federation. “It is finally time we had digital wallets with digital credentials that work exactly the same way our real-world wallets do,” said Mr. Reed. “We can take and use them anywhere to privately prove just what another party needs to know in the context of a particular transaction. We don’t have to go through any third-party gatekeeper to do this. That’s the way it should work in the digital world too.”</p>



<p>The challenge, of course, is interoperability—the entire raison d’etre of the ToIP Foundation. According to Mr. Reed, this is the reason that Avast intends to participate very actively in advancing the work of ToIP Working Groups. “Avast is a global company, and the #1 challenge in establishing digital wallets and credentials that work around the world is interoperability,” said Mr. Reed. “It is a key focus of the European Digital Identity Wallets initiative as well as other government-sanctioned digital wallet projects. Avast believes that the ToIP stack is the answer, and we want to help drive its completion and adoption as quickly as possible.”For more information about Avast’s digital trust services and products, please visit <a href="https://www.avast.com/digital-trust">www.avast.com/digital-trust</a>.

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>This video shares a talk from the <a href="https://www.scottishaisummit.com/summit-2022">Scottish AI Summit</a>, addressing how best we can support the commercialization of AI technologies to meet real-world needs. 
<p>The University of Edinburgh has programmes to nurture data-driven entrepreneurs at different stages on their journey from the seed of an idea to scaling globally. As well as supporting both technology transfer from academic research and home grown businesses, the University is also attracting high growth global AI start-ups.</p>
<p>In this panel session, Katy Guthrie and Laura Bernal from the University’s Data-Driven Entrepreneurship programme will be joined by founders of some the companies they have supported, across different sectors including MedTech and ClimateTech.</p>
<p>The discussion will focus on the opportunities and challenges for companies using AI, how scaling AI driven business can benefit the people of Scotland and the world and what can be done to stimulate activity and address issues.</p>
 Introductions – (3m:15s) 
<p>Katy Guthrie, the Manager for the University of Edinburgh AI accelerator program commenced the summit by stating the purpose of the panel, which is to explore how best to support the commercialization of AI technologies.</p>
<p>The university has entrepreneurs at different stages on their journey from the seed of an idea to scaling globally, as well as supporting both technology transfer from academic research and home-grown business. The University is also attracting high-growth global AI start-ups.</p>
<p>She introduced the other members of the panel who are founders of AI-driven companies at different stages. They’ve all taken entrepreneurship programs at the university too.</p>
<p>After the introduction, at about 4m:20s Katy listed the topics to be discussed which are:</p>
 
 The role of AI as an enabler. 
 The areas of opportunity. 
 Challenges faced and how well to overcome them. 
 
<p>She describes how they had a recent program that supported 12 AI-driven companies over a period of 6 months and it’s helped companies to build commercial skills, connect them into networks, and to learn from each other.</p>
<p>At 6m:47s Laura Bernal talks about how they supported Ph.D. students and early career researchers who are looking to commercialize IP or research, and that their program helps companies to be more business-minded. They help scientific background people to think about business because they believe academia can have a relationship with industries. She was formerly a founder before she joined the program.</p>
<p>At 8m:14s they are joined by the other panel members introducing themselves and what they do. Xiaoyan Ma, founder and CEO of <a href="https://danurobotics.com/">Danu Robotics</a> introduced herself and talked more about her company.</p>
<p>Then at 9m:00s, she hands over to Lorenzo Conti, a founder and managing director at <a href="https://www.crover.tech/">Crover</a> who talked about his Edinburgh-based startup which focuses on helping grain storage operators like grain merchants, port operators, and cooperatives.</p>
<p>On to Debbie Wake (10m:28s), a medical doctor and clinical academic with the University of Edinburgh. She is also a Co-founder of a digital health company <a href="https://mywaydigitalhealth.co.uk/">MyWay</a>. She gave a brief talk on how they manage conditions like diabetes, drug response and diagnostic prediction as well as how they offer tools to Education platforms.</p>
<p>Joseph Twigg, CEO of <a href="https://aveni.ai/">Aveni</a>, introduces his company (11m:56s), also an Edinburgh-based startup, where they focus on natural language processing, delivering and helping with solutions in the service industries. They derive insight and automation from customer conversation.</p>
 Scaling AI in Scotland 
<p>From 13m:40s Katy moves on to the detail of the discussion, with the main perspective being to identify why it is important to support the scaling of these businesses, which is to boost economic growth and productivity because these companies are creating high-value jobs.</p>
<p>They also support companies that tackle societal issues in Scotland. They have a strong capability in AI in Scotland which is attractive to companies who want to work not just at the University of Edinburgh but in Scotland.</p>
<p>They are often seen as being great at inventing things but not as good as commercializing them. For example from a review it was identified that the UK is ranked third in the world for research in AI but only 11th in its ability to realize Impact from it. So they want to change that and make Scotland seen as an excellent place to build a high-value AI-driven business.</p>
<p>It’s partly about supporting homegrown businesses and also attracting AI start-ups from elsewhere. The key point is about building the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In Scotland, they’ve got lots of big corporates in industries and they need innovative smaller businesses like start-ups that can bring new ideas. Developing and fostering that ecosystem is a key part of what they do at the Bayes Centre of the University of Edinburgh with the data-driven entrepreneurship support program at the university.</p>
 The Role of AI as the Enabler (16m:23s) 
<p>Here Katy asks the panel why they use AI, to explore what role the technology plays as an enabler.</p>
<p>For example at 17m:04s Joseph said he worked in the financial services industry for 15 years and identified a number of potential scenarios for improved efficiencies through using the technology.</p>
<p>Debbie highlights how they didn’t start as an AI business, but rather as an educational web site for diabetes information, and they came to realize how important data was to that process, and it became clear that AI could play a key role in facilitating better personalized access to that data.</p>
<p>For Lorenzo (20m:00s) they were working with a very novel and complex technology that involves hardware locomotion through a very kind of unstable environment data and they employed AI to tackle several technical challenges in a different part of their product, and to reach the required level of performance. In a very efficient way, AI helped them in the prediction of the robot’s movement around the environment, and since then they have employed it in other areas like the accuracy of their sensors.</p>
<p>At 23m:41s Katy asked Laura if she has any other companies looking up to AI for solutions to early-stage academic problems.</p>
<p>In response to this she mentioned a company that didn’t start as an AI company but later employed AI to model how the results of diagnosis will perform and how effectively it could put them to an advantage over their competitors. She said she has seen many companies that are AI-driven and need AI to increase their competitive advantage.</p>
 Finding Opportunities 
<p>Laura takes over at 25m:11s and asks the panel if there are other areas where AI can be applied.</p>
<p>For Xiaoyan it will have a huge opportunity in traditional industries such as agriculture risk management and manufacturing. AI can help people in the space to improve their operational efficiency, profitability, and sustainability, and&nbsp;can help in changing the procurement processes.</p>
<p>For Lorenzo (29m:35s), what is needed for the AI solution to work is assistance on how to manage funding.</p>
<p>There’s a need for access to another company’s customers’ data and regulatory bar set very high to train models (Joseph 32m:58s), and AI also needs to make a product that compensates for the risk companies are taking.</p>
 If you could do something different this time what it be? (Laura 34m:14s) 
<p>According to Joseph, partner selection would be the first thing to do differently, especially in the first critical phase of developing and validating the concept.</p>
<p>Debbie seconds this at 35m:25s, describing their challenge with Information Governance in the NHS, and how bringing in an expert consultancy to address this early on for them would have saved them up to two years of work.</p>
<p>At 38m:00s&nbsp;Laura asks Katy what opportunities she has seen and the ones coming up next. Katy replies that she sees many, in key areas like Natural Language Processing, and that you can view them through a lens of industry vertical or horizontal technology specialisms, and that there is potential to cut across multiple use cases.</p>
<p>She cites an example of a body scanning app that took part in their accelerator, which can be used for e-commerce scenarios where it can be used to match customers sizes to reduce returns, and it can also be used in Healthcare.</p>
 Challenges Faced by AI-Driven Business 
<p>At 43m:45s the panel moves on to the final topic: Challenges Faced by AI-Driven Business.</p>
<p>These include&nbsp;the volume of data (Debbie 44:23), and when dealing with AI there’s high-risk complexity often that brings in regulatory burden, therefore there’s a need for additional research evaluation risk assessment.</p>
<p>Joseph makes a critical point at 45m:42s, that the Scottish startup support ecosystem is great, but it’s not so great when it comes to encouraging large enterprise organizations to work with those startups. For example providing them incentives to choose to work with a local startup vs AWS.</p>
<p>From 49m:18s, Debbie talked about what can help:</p>
 
 Support within the Scottish ecosystem. 
 Support from using wider support. 
 Support from Scottish Enterprise. They support in a lot of ways around market scoping internationally and have amazing networks and obviously the AI accelerator program. 
 
<p>From 51m:58s Lorenzo adds that there’s a need for support programs that truly understand deep hardware innovators, a challenge globally not just in Scotland.</p>
<p>At 54m:45s Katy asks Joseph: Should early-stage businesses worry about the public perception of AI, or should they just get on with making the best possible solutions?</p>
<p>Lorenzo believes it’s a lot to do with perception, that most people assume AI is intelligent robots when really what is in use is the type of business applications improved by algorithms that have been discussed on this panel. Similarly Joseph adds that while AI is used to augmented processes like those in financial services it is still ultimately a decision made by a human.</p>
<p>Debbie also added that though changing public perception is really hard but as SMEs she thinks they’ve got restricted resources as to how to do that. Working with policymakers and bodies to try and support the industry image is a good thing.</p>
 Wrap Up 
<p>At 57m:32s: Katy handed over to Laura to round off the summit.</p>
<p>Laura started by accepting the fact that there are always going to be challenges in the process. Therefore she encouraged us to think about how we could help companies that are developing in AI and how we can start changing that infrastructure to overcome those challenges as an ecosystem in general.</p>
<p>In her closing remark, she said the AI accelerator would be opening applications for their next intake in April to start the program in September. And also if anyone wants to scale an AI company should contact Katy through her LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katy-guthrie-edinburgh/">Katie Guthrie</a>.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNx3f74AmVQ">this video</a> Kate Forbes, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy, delivers a statement to the Scottish Parliament, about transforming Scotland’s tech sector. 
<p>In August 2020, the Scottish Government published the “Scottish Technology Ecosystem Review”, which is a blueprint to establish Scotland as a leading hub for tech start-ups. The report was written by Mark Logan, the former Chief Operating Officer of Skyscanner, which was one of Scotland’s first tech companies to achieve a valuation of more than £1 billion.</p>
<p>Professor Logan’s report was greeted with acclaim on publication. It was described as an “exciting route map for how the government and the private sector can work together to build Scotland into a global leader.</p>
<p>Last October, the Scottish Government invited suppliers to tender for a contract to establish a national network of five ‘tech scaler’ hubs in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Inverness.</p>
<p>The hubs will provide Scottish companies with commercial education sourced from the best providers in the world. That education will be complemented with physical co-location, first-rate mentoring and vibrant peer communities. Through state-of-the-art remote technologies, all of that will be available virtually in every community in Scotland.</p>
<p>Those tech scalers are a game changer. The government has established a new organization named Scottish Teachers Advancing Computing Science (STACS) which helps driving improvements in equipment, teacher training and the curation of best practice. Working with Toni Scullion and Brendan McCart, the government has invested more than £1 million pounds to add to schools’ existing stocks of computing hardware.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government also invested a further £500,000 in the digital skills pipeline, a bespoke set of modular courses running from beginner level all the way through to advanced coding. They provided grant funding of £150,000 to CodeYourFuture, a truly exceptional organization that supports refugees with the skills and networks necessary to progress in education and employment.</p>
<p>The Scottish National Investment Bank has agreed to support the all-female investor group, Investing Women Angels, to establish a new investment fund focused exclusively on women and minority founders based in Scotland. That makes Scotland one of very few European nations with a bespoke seed investment fund focused on stimulating the growth of female-led companies, delivering yet another of Mark Logan’s recommendations.</p>
<p>STACS ensures that there is greater choice for young people in their formal subject choices and informal extracurricular activities. It is a teacher-led organization, which starts with teachers. It aims to provide support and expertise to and promote skills among computing science teachers across Scotland.</p>
<p>Many young people in Scotland are choosing to work and study simultaneously, and a number of tech businesses are already taking advantage of that apprenticeship model. According to the government, work has also started on expanding the young person’s guarantee.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is progressing a number of recommendations specifically around investment and investment funding, to avoid the situation whereby, for a Scottish start-up to expand, grow and develop, it needs to access funding elsewhere. Although no one would dispute that Skyscanner has been a success, some of the recommendations looked at, for example, establishing a series A funding partnership between the Scottish Government, Scottish venture capitalists and external investors; investment vehicles specifically for certain groups, such as female founders.</p>
<p>In the opinion of Kate Forbes, the government has much to do with the 95 per cent of access to broadband that already exists. Clearly reaching the goals of the R100 program it needs to ensure that every property has access to broadband. They will progress that and ensure that it is delivered despite the fact that it is a reserved area and they are stepping into the breach to do that and the work is progressing.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem fund has supported multiple events for and by women, with more than £160,000 of funding given to Women’s Enterprise Scotland, Female Founder Squad, Mint Ventures and other organizations providing learning and peer networking opportunities and helping to overcome some of the challenges faced by women in tech. There is a clear gender gap in business participation in Scotland. Closing that gap and unlocking the full economic potential of women in enterprise will have a transformative impact on Scotland’s economic performance.</p>
<p>According to Kate Forbes, being able to provide extracurricular activity that creates equity of access to opportunities to learn is so important. The young women are being role models as female founders and in celebrating female computer science teachers, which is critical to all of this. Right now, Education Scotland has a dedicated team that is working with schools and early learning centers specifically to deal with early gender stereotyping and to ensure that that engagement carries on throughout primary school and high school and ultimately into the university years.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is keen to see more small and medium-sized enterprises embracing the opportunities of technology, and that needs to go hand in hand with cybersecurity. In the past, they have provided financial support, such as vouchers, to help SMEs to do that. She has referred to some of the cyber apprenticeships that all goes hand in hand with promoting best practice across the public, private and third sector.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>Speaking at the Barclays Glasgow Campus on 13 July 2022 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlines the Scottish Government’s commitment to supporting entrepreneurship and innovation through the launch of the Tech Scalers network. 
 Video Summary 
<p>Barclays will be the host of the Glasgow Tech Scaler hub and that is good news, a further demonstration of how important this campus is going to be not just to Glasgow but to Scotland as a whole.</p>
<p>Over the last few years Scotland’s tech sector has really developed a very strong sense of community, and you can see, hear and feel this. Businesses are constantly sharing and learning from each other’s experiences.</p>
<p>Within the context of the Scottish Government’s overall&nbsp;approach to the economy the establishment of the Tech Scalers are central to the ambition of creating a more entrepreneurial nation, making sure that the commitment to and success in entrepreneurship in a future Scotland is very much chiming with that reputation for enterprise innovation and entrepreneurship that we have down through past generations.</p>
<p>A few months ago, we published the new Scottish government national strategy for economic transformation looking at how particularly we emerge from the Covid pandemic. We want to build a country that is greener, fairer and wealthier for this and generations to come, and to help us achieve those aims that we’ve set very clearly.</p>
<p>There is a need to establish a sense of common purpose among businesses trade unions, government and the many other partners that all need to contribute to building a successful economy and that sense of common purpose is already very striking in the tech and entrepreneurship sectors.</p>
<p>This has been developed in recent years by the likes of CodeBase, FutureX, the Bayes Centre EIE team,&nbsp;as well as by networks like Startup Grind, The Female Founders Squad, the Scottish Games Network and many others besides.</p>
<p>So, it’s something that as government we want to support and encourage across other parts of the economy. In recent years, for example, we funded SCDI to run productivity clubs to bring companies together to learn from each other about how to operate more effectively and how to benefit from new technology. So, it’s a simple but really powerful way of tackling what is one of the biggest issues facing our economy and how do we sustainably increase productivity.</p>
<p>The benefits of that approach where businesses and organizations cooperate and collaborate for a common purpose is already very clear in this sector. In the tech sector, the efforts you’ve made in recent years are already making this sector a very significant Scottish success story. Scottish startups and scale-ups employ more than 135,000 people which is more than anywhere else in the UK outside of London and the south east.</p>
<p>Our universities are recognized rightly as world leaders in areas like data analytics and informatics and we have got enormous strengths as a country in really key areas for the future like AI robotics and FinTech. So we’ve got lots to be proud of we’ve got lots to be enthusiastic and optimistic about.</p>
<p>The sector can still do much better and to illustrate that with just one example in recent years – Scotland has produced three unicorn companies of course valued at more than one billion dollars and two of these have been tech companies. It is something be celebrated but over that same period that Scotland has produced three unicorns, Ireland has produced seven, Estonia ten, Israel sixteen and Sweden thirty five.</p>
<p>Obviously, the creation of unicorn companies isn’t by any stretch of the imagination the only measure of a country’s success but it is a strong indicator and one that we should take seriously. We can and should be doing even more to build on the current strengths that this sector has. Scotland’s ecosystem before the pandemic was closer to this tipping point than at any time in its modern history.</p>
<p>It highlighted that relatively limited interventions by government could help reach that tipping point and it set out what those interventions should be in the three key areas of education, infrastructure and financing. The Scottish government has started implementing these recommendations.</p>
<p>For example, we’ve established a new organization called Scottish Teachers Advancing Computing Science and are designing a new plan for skills development for computer science and teaching. It will help to shape and transform how computer science is taught in our schools. We also establish the tech ecosystem fund which provides support for organizations that help entrepreneurs connect with their peers and with potential investors.</p>
<p>We invited tenders last year to establish the Tech Scalers. The bidding process generated a lot of interest which is really encouraging and has already led to new collaborations between Scottish and international organizations.</p>
<p>The contract has been awarded to CodeBase, who already run a very successful tech incubator in Edinburgh and under the contract they will establish seven Scalers in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling.</p>
<p>These hubs will be delivered in partnership with universities, local authorities and businesses. The Scalers will provide the basic infrastructure but also a complete support service for startups, will offer five separate courses for companies at different stages of development from new startups onwards. The course for advanced companies will include free access to a program called Reforge, which is Silicon Valley’s most prestigious education program for tech startups.</p>
<p>CodeBase have also promised to develop a national calendar of events for the tech community and companies led by women and minorities, currently significantly underrepresented amongst tech startups will be prioritized for entry to the incubators.</p>
<p>These companies will also be given extra support that recognizes the greater challenges they currently face in raising investment and developing peer networks. Supporting entrepreneurship is one of the most important interventions any government can make in an economy, so that’s why the new role Mark Logan is taking up as chief entrepreneurship officer is so vitally important.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is determined to do everything we can to create a more entrepreneurial nation indeed that’s why we’re investing in these tech scalers at a time when we’re facing a tough public spending environment, because we know that by providing the right environment for business government action can help to support a much stronger and more sustainable economy.</p>

<p>While many self-sovereign identity solutions offer tools for individuals, a government team from Canada is using digital trust technology to improve sustainability reporting in the natural resource sector for organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
Nancy Norris 


<p>The Government of British Columbia (B.C.) – a Trust Over IP (ToIP) Steering Committee Member – initiated the Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) project under the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation (EMLI) to facilitate the transition to a resilient, clean economy. EMDT’s pilot enables a collaborative digital ecosystem between the B.C. government, natural resource companies, and organizations around the world to improve sustainability reporting using digital credentials. Digital credentials make sustainability reporting more efficient, enhance business-to-business trust, and protect data from manipulation. Digital credentials can be checked in real time, expediting access to trustworthy information. These trusted, verifiable digital credentials are the core digital trust technologies being piloted and the trust ecosystem in which they operate are defined in ToIP architecture, governance, and related documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join members of the open-source community as they share projects, discuss problems, and collaborate on new solutions at three Linux Foundation conferences this September. Attend one of three sessions featuring EMDT’s business application of digital credentials with Nancy Norris, Senior Director of ESG &amp; Digital Trust in the Ministry for Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation for the Government of British Columbia, and Kyle Robinson, Senior Strategic Advisor.</p>


 
Kyle Robinson 


  <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/hyperledger-global-forum/register/">Hyperledger Global Forum</a>, September 12: Learn how EMDT is enabling and accelerating the B.C. government’s entry into a digital trust ecosystem by creating a simple and secure way to share sustainability data, certifications, and credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://trustoverip.org/summit/">Trust Over IP Summit</a>, September 14: In Session 2, witness a demo, exchanging digital credentials between an environmental auditor, a mining company, and the Government of British Columbia. Stay for Session 4, to learn how and why digital trust ecosystems benefit government bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open Source Summit Europe</a>, September 15: EMDT will participate in the “Blockchain in Action in the Fight Against Climate Change” panel session with Hyperledger’s Daniela Barbosa and others to discuss the role of government in creating digital trust ecosystems and how enhanced sustainability reporting supports climate goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>In this guide you will learn how to configure and run a Ceramic node for development in AWS. AWS is not the only cloud provider you can use to run a Ceramic node, but we will cover the other major providers in a separate blog post. The general steps are going to be the same regardless of cloud provider, so you could adapt what you read here for your favorite cloud.</p><p>This post will cover running a Ceramic node in <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/run/nodes/nodes/#things-to-know">bundled mode</a>, which is suitable for development and testing purposes.</p> Prerequisites <p>Before you can run a Ceramic node on AWS you’ll need a few things.</p>  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/account/">AWS Account</a>. Although billing information is required to create an account with AWS, this post will make use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&amp;all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&amp;awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all">AWS Free Tier</a> services to minimize cost  Basic understanding of the <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/">Linux Command Line</a>   Preparing AWS for Ceramic <p>Once you have an AWS account you will need to configure a few things in AWS so that your Ceramic node can be accessed.</p><p>You will be creating a Linux EC2 instance, which you will then connect to using SSH. The recommended way to do this through AWS is to configure and use an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console">Amazon EC2 Key Pair</a>.</p><p>If you already have a key pair you wish to use you can head directly to the Configuring Security Groups section.</p> Creating a key pair <p>Step 1<br>From the AWS Management Console use the search bar to locate the EC2 Key Pair Feature page by typing in <code>key pairs</code> and selecting the corresponding EC2 Feature.</p><p>Step 2<br>Click the Create key pair button in the top right corner of the page.</p><p>Step 3<br>Configure the new key pair with the following options:</p>  Name: ceramickeypair  Key pair type: RSA  Private key file format: <code>.pem</code>  If you are using a Windows machine select <code>.ppk</code> and make sure you have <a href="https://putty.org/">PuTTY</a> installed  Tags: you do not need to add any tags, but you can if you’d like to organize your resources  <p>Once you have those options selected click the Create key pair button.</p><p>You should be prompted to download the newly created key pair file. Save it somewhere that you will remember.</p><p>You will need this in a future step so don’t lose it!</p><p>You should now have a key pair populated in the management console as well as downloaded to your local machine.</p><p>This will be the private key used when connecting to the EC2 instance we will create using SSH.</p> Configuring Security Groups <p>The next thing you will need is an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.">AWS Security Group</a> for your soon-to-be-created EC2 instance. Security groups act as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances. To reach your Ceramic node you will need to have the proper ports configured in a security group.</p><p>Step 1<br>From the AWS Management Console use the search bar to locate the EC2 Security Groups Feature by typing <code>security groups</code>.</p><p>Step 2<br>You will most likely see a default security group. You can ignore this security group for now.</p><p>Click the Create security group button in the top right corner of the page.</p><p>Step 3<br>Configure the new security group with the following parameters:</p><p>Basic details</p>  Security group name: ceramicservers  Description: allow access to Ceramic services  VPC: Leave as default unless you have a more complex AWS environment  <p>Inbound rules</p><p>Rule 1:</p>  Type: Custom TCP  Port range: 7007  Source: Anywhere-IPv4  Description: Ceramic port  <p>Rule 2:</p>  Type: SSH  Source: Anywhere-IPv4  Description: SSH port  <p>Outbound Rules</p>  Leave as default  <p>Tags</p>  Leave as default  <p>Once you have filled in these configuration options click the Create security group button.</p><p>You should now see the newly-created security group in the management console.</p> Creating a Ceramic Node <p>Now that all of the AWS environment setup is complete it's time to begin building a Ceramic node in the cloud.</p> Creating an EC2 Instance For Ceramic <p>Step 1<br>From the AWS Management Console use the search bar to locate the EC2 Service by typing <code>EC2</code> and selecting the corresponding service.</p><p>You should now be able to see the associated EC2 Resources that you set up in previous steps. If you are working from a new AWS environment you will see that there is 1 key pair and 2 security groups.</p><p>If you do not see these resources, ensure that you are viewing the proper region. Sometimes the AWS Management Console will display resources from different regions and can make it appear as though resources are missing when they are in fact in a different region.</p><p>Step 2<br>Below the Resources box you will see a Launch instance section. Click the orange Launch instance button in this section and select Launch instance from the drop down menu that appears.</p><p>Step 3<br>You are now ready to begin configuring an EC2 instance for your Ceramic node. This screen can seem a little daunting with all the options, so take extra care to configure options properly before launching your instance.</p><p>Improper configuration could result in charges to your AWS account. 3Box Labs and the Ceramic Network are not responsible for any charges you incur while working with cloud resources. Please double check all your work and understand the AWS billing process before proceeding.</p><p>Configure your EC2 instance with the following options:</p><p>Name and Tags</p>  Name: Ceramic  <p>Application and OS Images</p>  AMI: Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) - Kernel 5.10, SSD Volume Type (Free tier eligible)  Architecture: 64-bit (x86  <p>Instance Type</p>  Instance type: t2.micro (free tier eligible)  <p>Key pair</p>  Key pair name: ceramickeypair  <p>Network Settings</p>  Firewall: Select existing security group  Common security groups: ceramicservers  <p>Configure Storage</p>  1x: 15gb  GiB: gp2  <p>Advanced details</p>  default  <p>Once you have added these configuration details, set the Number of instances to 1 and click the orange Launch instance button located at the bottom of the Summary</p><p>Step 4<br>The Launch an instance page should now have a button that allows you to View all instances. Click the View all instances button to continue.</p><p>You will now see a new EC2 instance named Ceramic Server running in your environment.</p><p>In the next section you will connect to this instance and configure your Ceramic node.</p> Connecting to The Newly Created EC2 Instance <p>Connecting to this newly created EC2 instance will vary based on your operating system. If you are using Windows you will need an SSH client, such as <a href="https://putty.org/">PuTTY</a>. If you are using Linux or MacOS you will be able to use the built-in SSH client located in the Terminal.</p><p>The instructions that follow will only cover the Linux and MacOS terminal. Once connected to the instance all commands and steps will be the same regardless of which operating system you are using.</p><p>Step 1<br>In the AWS Management Console select the Ceramic Server EC2 instance and click on the Connect button located near the top of the screen.</p><p>After clicking the Connect button select the SSH client tab to see the connection instructions for your instance. Your details will be different from what you see in the screenshot below since AWS populates this information dynamically.</p><p>Step 2<br>This step will guide you through the instructions located on the SSH client tab of the Connect to instance page.</p><p>Open your terminal and locate the key pair file you downloaded in Step 3 of the <a href="https://hackmd.io/ahqZ7_OeRp2f7vAKQyOP_Q#Preparing-AWS-for-Ceramic">Preparing AWS for Ceramic</a> section, it should be named <code>ceramickeypari.pem</code> if you followed along with the earlier steps.</p><p>This file may also have a <code>.cer</code> extension. This is perfectly fine and can be treated as a <code>.pem</code> file.</p><p>In this example the <code>ceramickeypair.cer</code> file is located in the Home directory of the logged in user.</p><p>When you download this file from AWS it downloads with improper permissions for use. If you try to use this file with your SSH client you will see an error explaining that the file has too many permissions to be used safely. Let’s fix that now by reducing the permissions granted to this key file.</p><p>In the terminal run the following command:</p><p><code>chmod 400 ceramickeypair.cer</code></p><p>There will be no output from this command, but if you inspect the permissions you should now see that this file is only able to be read by the owner. <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php">Learn more about file permissions</a>.</p><p>Now that your file permissions are properly restricted, use your terminal to connect to your EC2 instance. The connection information can be found in the example at the bottom of the Connect to instance page you opened above in Step 1. Your details will differ from what you see below.</p><p><code>ssh -i "ceramickeypair.cer" ec2-user@ec2-54-215-186-11.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com</code></p><p>When prompted to accept the fingerprint, type the word <code>yes</code> to continue connecting to your instance.</p><p>You should now see the terminal change to reflect that you are connected to the EC2 instance.</p><p>You are now connected to your EC2 instance using SSH. Any commands you run inside this terminal will execute on the remote instance located on AWS.</p> Installing Ceramic Dependencies <p>Step 1<br>When you launch a fresh AWS instance, it’s always a good practice to start by updating the package manager. This Amazon Machine Image(AMI) uses <a href="https://linuxconcept.com/yum-package-manager-a-complete-guide/">yum</a> as its package manager. To update the packages on the system run the <code>update</code> command as an administrator. In this case we will add the <code>-y</code> flag to skip being prompted if we are sure we want to apply the updates.</p><p><code>sudo yum update -y</code></p><p>There will be an overwhelming amount of information on the screen after you enter this command. The most important piece is at the end where the result of the command says complete and you have control of your prompt once more.</p><p>Step 2<br>One great thing about cloud computing is that the virtual machines provided for use are slim and often do not contain unnecessary software.</p><p>One downfall about cloud computing is that the virtual machines provided for use are slim and often do not contain the necessary software for our use case!</p><p>For a Ceramic node, your server will need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> version 16 installed on it. The simplest way to manage different version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> is through the use of a tool called [Node Version Manager(NVM)].</p><p>To download and install NVM on your EC2 instance run the following command in the terminal:</p><p><code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash</code></p><p>It is important to note that NVM is frequently updated, you should always check the GitHub repository to ensure you are getting the most up-to-date version of NVM. This guide will NOT be updated as NVM versions change.</p><p>Once you see the information about what was added to the <code>.bashrc</code> file, NVM has been successfully installed.</p><p>However if you try to run NVM right now the terminal will display an error telling you the command <code>nvm</code> is not found.</p><p>To fix this error you need to “source” the <code>.bashrc</code> file to reload it into the current terminal session. Use the terminal to accomplish this. There will be no output from this command.</p><p><code>source .bashrc</code></p><p>Now if you type <code>nvm</code> into the terminal you should be greeted with the help text for this command.</p><p><code>nvm</code></p><p>Using NVM, install NodeJS Version 16.</p><p><code>nvm install 16</code></p><p>Your instance is now set up and ready to run Ceramic. Let’s get Ceramic running next!</p> Install and Run Ceramic <p>If you’ve made it this far then rejoice… the hard parts are over! Now you simply need to download and run Ceramic, and your AWS Ceramic Node will be fully accessible for your application.</p><p>Step 1<br>Use NPM to install the Ceramic daemon.</p><p><code>npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli</code></p><p>The amount of output from this command will be overwhelming; however, near the bottom of the output, you should see a message telling you that new packages have been added to your system.</p><p>Step 2<br>Run the Ceramic daemon to make this a usable Ceramic node.</p><p><code>ceramic daemon</code></p><p>Since you are running Ceramic in bundled mode, the output of this command will contain information about IPFS, to include peer discovery as well as Ceramic configuration information. When you see the message saying “Ceramic API running on 0.0.0.0:7007” you are ready to go.</p><p>Congratulations, you now have a Ceramic node running on AWS!</p><p>As you may have guessed, this is not an ideal setup. If you disconnect from this terminal session, shutdown the EC2 instance or perform many other tasks this process will terminate and your Ceramic node will be unreachable.</p><p>You may want to look into creating start-up scripts for your instance to ensure that the Ceramic daemon runs when the instance starts.</p> What’s next? <p>The only thing left is to connect to your instance using a Ceramic client.</p><p>Example using the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/http">Ceramic HTTP Client</a>:</p> <code>import CeramicClient from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'

 Our 20 Year Journey 



<p>Like many provinces and territories in Canada, British Columbia (BC) has a long history of providing secure access to online government services. We started our journey 20 years ago with the introduction of BCeID, a simple username and password solution. A lot has changed since then!</p>



<p>Today, we are investing in Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and a digital wallet. We see these as the cornerstones in the evolution of our digital strategy, adding a much needed layer of trust to the digital economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to share what we are doing, why we focus on interoperability and open-source, and why we are excited about VCs being our natural next step.</p>



 Why We Care 



<p>As a public sector organization, BC has a strong interest in seeing the adoption of technologies that are secure, privacy-preserving, and convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital is obviously everywhere. In 2021, 94% of BC citizens said they are online, and 90% of Canadians have smartphones. Also, according to the Business Council of Canada, in the last decade Canada’s digital economy grew 40% faster than the overall world economy.&nbsp; In Digital ID terms, this growth is an opportunity to make people’s online lives easier and safer.</p>



<p>We also know that cybersecurity threats are growing and there are no signs of it slowing down. BC sees an astonishing 496 million unauthorized access attempts per day – that’s 5,741 every second! Identity theft and fraud also continues to rise. We need digital trust solutions that counter this increasing risk.</p>



<p>In responding to this new reality, we recognize that people are familiar and comfortable with the many credentials that governments issue today. Things like physical copies of drivers’ licenses, health cards, passports, permits, and reports are widely accepted and trusted.&nbsp; In BC, we are building on that trust and moving towards providing the same things digitally. We are also enabling confidential connections through the wallet to give people choice and confidence in their digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 BC’s Approach&nbsp; 



<p>Clearly, digital trust goes far beyond just the government. Canadians expect more access, with greater security, to high-value services in both the public and private sectors. VCs and the wallet provide a highly flexible way to achieve that goal.</p>



<p>Collaboration is critical to achieving that goal and it’s important to us. BC’s Chief Information Officer, CJ Ritchie, strongly advocates for us working together to meet the expectations of Canadians.&nbsp; She notes, “If we don’t all act together to deliver solutions that protect privacy and interact securely, trust will erode and there will be negative impacts for businesses, people’s livelihoods, and the broader digital economy.”</p>



<p>As our approach evolves, we also remain keen to support open source solutions that interoperate with other national and international efforts. There is no dominant design yet, no one network or technology, so we must remain nimble and flexible in our exploration. We also need to coexist with existing identity solutions that millions of British Columbians already rely upon.</p>



 Technology Interoperability 



<p>In exploring VCs, BC is contributing to solutions that allow agents to verify credentials from multiple networks. Indeed, through one of our Code With Us initiatives, DID indy, we contributed over 11,000 lines of open-source code to support and prove the viability of a “network of networks”.</p>



<p>We also are focused on the interoperability of Hyperledger Aries agents themselves, another key success metric.&nbsp; We are leading contributors to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH)</a>, open-source software that runs a series of Hyperledger Aries interoperability tests and delivers the results to the <a href="http://aries-interop.info/">AATH website</a>. Great interoperability requires that we test—and re-test!—that interoperability on a regular basis.</p>



<p>__</p>



<p>Side note: If you want to test the interoperability of any Aries agent with this ecosystem, please sign up to join the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-aries-interoperability-event">Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Event on August&nbsp; 31</a>.</p>



<p>__</p>



 Driving Adoption 



<p>In BC we have a lot of technical skill in working with VCs and with Hyperledger Aries agents. However, for VCs to be successful, it needs to be easy for others to join in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the agents side, to complement our extensive contributions to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py)</a> and other Aries and Indy projects, we also contribute to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">Hyperledger Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ)</a>, the agent commonly used for mobile digital wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why, when thinking about mobile digital wallets, we opted to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native">Hyperledger Aries Bifold</a> project, helping it also essentially become “Bifold as a framework”. Bifold uses AFJ, and BC and others can use it to easily deploy a custom-designed digital wallet. Jurisdictions within Canada and elsewhere in the world are already taking this approach for their own wallet explorations. It’s an open-source stack right the way down.</p>



<p>VC adoption will be helped by a thriving open-source community, and we are giving back wherever we can.</p>



 Open-Source Success 



<p>We believe the community’s success becomes our success. For years we’ve been committed to open-source, interoperable solutions in this space. Our approach is always evolving, but our contributions and commitment to various digital trust open-source projects and technologies continue.</p>



<p>We hope that even more organizations will join in and contribute. Our goal in BC is a new layer of trust for the internet, making it easier for people to work and play online with confidence.&nbsp;</p>

 By <a href="https://medium.com/u/61f092fa8507">Michal&nbsp;Bacia</a> <p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-threat-report/">According to security analysts, nearly 80% of cyberattacks are identity-based</a>. In these attacks, bad actors steal administrators’ usernames and passwords or issue fake credentials to themselves. With credentials in hand, unauthorized parties can infiltrate enterprise information technology systems and go undetected for long periods of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Many of these attacks can be prevented via security architectures that embrace decentralized authentication and authorization of users and assets. These architectures, based on decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs), can unlock value across many segments of the global economy. But the energy sector, in particular, stands to benefit greatly. The number of energy sector assets (e.g., electric vehicles, smart inverters, batteries) and actors interacting with them is growing exponentially. A centralized, “Web 2” approach to digitizing these assets and their users (creating a centralized data silo and a super administrator of the silo) is expensive, fragile, and creates lucrative honeypots for malicious actors to attack. At Energy Web, we believe a more effective solution is to embrace a decentralized architecture for user and asset authentication and authorization.</p> The role of verifiable credentials <p>A critical component of any security architecture is the process by which users’ credentials are verified in order to be assigned specific roles. As shown below, when a user with a <a href="https://www.bcdiploma.com/en/blog/blockchain-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credential</a> presents it to a verification service, the service validates the VC and issues an access token. As shown in figure 1, this token can be used to unlock access to smart contracts on a blockchain or to perform certain roles using legacy information technology infrastructure.</p>Figure 1 | Security architecture process to verify credentials to specific&nbsp;roles<p>Conducting this verification process is not computationally intensive and has a binary outcome: whether the VC is valid (cryptographically signed by the authorized issuer) or not. There are several ways to conduct the verification process. It can be performed internally by an organization or via a third-party service provider. These traditional, centralized options create a single point of vulnerability since the verification service itself can be compromised, approve false VCs, and (inadvertently or not) whitelist attackers.</p> A decentralized verification service is a far better&nbsp;solution <p>As shown in figure 2, a decentralized verification service uses a diversity of nodes to perform the verification task independently and then reach a consensus about the outcome with other nodes on the same system. In this setting, validator nodes vote on whether or not a VC is valid. If consensus is reached, the user presenting the VC will be whitelisted or receive an access&nbsp;token.</p>Figure 2 |Decentralized verification service With a decentralized verification service, each node is required to stake economic value in order to verify VC presentations and earn&nbsp;rewards <p>Only honest nodes receive rewards. Misbehaving nodes that vote against consensus are penalized by having their stake reduced or removed entirely (for an overview of staking and “slashing” mechanisms on different blockchain-based networks, check out this explainer). The most practical way to implement this mechanism is to use public blockchains, paired with cryptocurrency, for staking and distributing awards to nodes performing the verification work. By doing so, the execution of the verification mechanism is completely automated, immediate, and impartial. This is a far better solution than relying on an opaque, centralized entity and/or process to perform the same verification service.</p><p>Under the decentralized architecture described here, honest nodes can sound an alarm if they don’t agree with the consensus. They receive the stake from misbehaving nodes in case they can prove wrongdoing. Attackers in this setting need to either a) hack each node individually or b) bribe all nodes needed to reach the consensus. The cost of bribing the nodes is equal to N*S+N*N*S, where N= number of nodes and S = stake of one node. Bottom line = more economic value staked across more nodes, more security.</p>Figure 3 | Decentralized verification service<p>Furthermore, consensus requirements can change based on the value of the VC itself. For high-value transactions or important access rights, consensus may require several rounds of voting. For VCs with relatively lower values, only 10% of nodes, for example, may need to approve the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>In summary, decentralized VC authentication powered by public blockchain and cryptocurrency shown in figure 3 can produce significant business benefits for enterprises in comparison to Web 2-based approaches to authentication and authorization. Don’t take our word for it: multiple Energy Web member companies have recently confirmed that public blockchains present a superior way to securing energy infrastructure and internet-connected devices alongside the findings of many research papers on the subject such&nbsp;as:</p>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8355182">Blockchain: A game changer for securing IoT&nbsp;data</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8605485">Secure IoT Communication using Blockchain Technology</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8012302">Can Blockchain Strengthen the Internet of&nbsp;Things?</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9013413">Cloud-Based Secure Service Providing for IoTs Using Blockchain</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7828539">Securing Smart Cities Using Blockchain Technology</a>   Cybersecurity through staking on Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Currently, Energy Web is working in partnership with Parity Technologies (the company behind Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate) to design, build and launch the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain, a public blockchain tailored to enterprises. The new blockchain is designed explicitly around the VC verification process described in this post. Our aim is to enable decentralized authentication and authorization for any energy company in any regulatory environment in a way that integrates with existing enterprise information technology systems.</p><p>Since identity management is a foundational component of this new blockchain, Validators on the new network who perform the decentralized VC verification service will be required to stake Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in order to secure the service and the network. In this way, all identity-related processes, together with other blockchain transactions, will be secured by the combined economic value of all <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dSLA-Lightpaper.pdf">EWT staked by Validators and their&nbsp;Patrons</a>.</p><p>With this staking mechanism in hand, the Consortia Relay Chain will unlock security solutions that are impossible to achieve using a centralized, Web 2 paradigm. It will provide unparalleled cybersecurity alongside a robust, flexible DID infrastructure for identity and access management.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.</p><p>Our solutions for enterprise asset management, data exchange, and Green Proofs, our tool for registering and tracking low-carbon products, are underpinned by the Energy Web Chain, the world’s first public blockchain tailored to the energy sector.

<p>Kia ora e te whānau<br><br>It has been three weeks since the Digital Trust Hui Taumata at Te Papa Tongarewa and yet it still resonates with many delegates, judging by feedback I continue to receive. It’s a clear indicator of a great event that Digital Identity NZ and NZTech worked hard to bring to the community, overcoming the significant challenges of the time.&nbsp;<br><br>Digital Identity NZ’s Executive Council (EC) remained in Wellington the next day for its annual strategy workshop. It developed a co-creation framework and questions to put to DINZ members – shown further down – regarding what activities our community want to undertake that returns overall value to our members, to DINZ and to Aotearoa’s digital economy in the next 12 months and beyond. &nbsp;<br><br>Let’s refresh our memory of the mahi undertaken in the past 12 months – still some&nbsp;‘work-in-progress’ – but nonetheless impressive for a group comprising of volunteers and minimal staff:</p>



  Creating the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework working group to review the draft Bill and prepare submissions and&nbsp;reports, which have been received positively;  Creating the Te Kahui te Tiriti o DINZ working group to develop and recommend an action plan for DINZ. The plan will help us to deliver on our Te Tiriti obligations SOI and support &amp; promote Māori representation and participation in Digital Identity, though still formative, looks promising;  Creating the Inclusive &amp; Equitable Uses of Digital Identity working group to develop guidance for industry and the Government to help give&nbsp;all&nbsp;New Zealanders equal access to the potential benefits of digital identity – again formative but active engagement underway with civil society organisations;  Completing benchmark consumer and business research in a challenging Covid environment. The results to be made public in a few weeks;  Delivering three&nbsp;in-person member Connect events, again, in a challenging Covid environment;  Delivering the much praised all-day Digital Trust Hui Taumata both in-person and online together with 23 online-only events to the community worldwide&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>  



<p>The 2022 EC reviewed last year’s annual member survey feedback and took the opportunity to review DINZ’s purpose,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">vision and mission</a>&nbsp;to ensure it remains incredibly relevant to the opportunities in Aotearoa’s digital economy.&nbsp;<br><br>The 2022 EC then proceeded to draft a ‘Pillars and Roles’ framework whose purpose is to give better definition and structure to the mahi and associated activities that this communication calls upon members to contribute to; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Four Pillars under which the mahi and associated activities can be categorised – Ecosystem Enablement, Sustainability, Privacy and Trust, Inclusion &amp; Diversity – to be positioned under;  Five Roles that DINZ would play (one or more) applicable to any given mahi and activity – Connect, Communicate, Guide, Develop, Promote;  



<p>DINZ’s Executive Council of 2022 seeks your feedback* on its proposal by August 31st 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YJ225RX">using this&nbsp;Survey Monkey link here</a>.<br><br>The EC’s proposals will be tested against your compiled member feedback and modified where necessary for confirmation through the annual member survey later in the year.<br><br>*Feedback is primarily sought from individual and organisation members of DINZ but feedback from non members is also welcomed.<br></p>



<p>Ngā mihi nui,</p>



<p>Colin and the DINZ Executive Council</p>

<p>As part of the Human Colossus Foundation's rollout of <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">Dynamic Data Economy</a> (DDE) in July, the HCF founders delivered <a href="https://hasgeek.com/PrivacyMode/data-gov-and-sem/">Data Governance and Semantics</a>, a three-part series of talks to the Indian tech community as part of <a href="https://hasgeek.com/">Hasgeek's</a> <a href="https://hasgeek.com/PrivacyMode">Privacy Mode initiative</a>, a forum of discussion for understanding the privacy and security needs of the Indian tech ecosystem through guides, research, collaboration, events, and conferences.</p><p>This Hasgeek initiative aims to help its audience become acquainted with the most efficient approaches and practices to data management, reducing operational risk to businesses. As a forum for experts across multiple sectors, blending in tools, frameworks, principles and design sensibilities, the project encourages organisational teams to address blind spots and treat data governance as a shared responsibility instead of a siloed approach to policy-making, processes and requirements.</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>The "Data Governance and Semantics" project featured three webinars introducing DDE as a decentralised trust infrastructure acutely aligned with the current movement toward data exchange models in the Economic domain where actors regain transactional sovereignty to share accurate information bilaterally.</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en">European Data Strategy</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/data-strategy/data-strategy.html">Canadian Data Strategy</a>, and new <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id.html">Swiss e-ID</a> initiatives demonstrate governmental support for a new paradigm shift in national data management schemes. Moreover, this particular Hasgeek project aligns with the revision of India's current <a href="https://digitalindia.gov.in/writereaddata/files/6.Data%20Protection%20in%20India.pdf">data protection regulation</a>.</p><p>The DDE conceptual infrastructure gives an equal weight of importance to the three core data domains of decentralised semantics, decentralised authentication, and distributed data governance. The HCF founders presented the core DDE concepts in three webinar sessions which interested parties can access via the Hasgeek platform or the Human Colossus Foundation video platform.&nbsp;</p><p>By incorporating first-principle design methodology into the foundational modelling of the core data domains, a network-agnostic system is possible, offering the cryptographic assurance of verifiable digital interactions and the human accountability of socio-economic governance frameworks.</p>


 

 Part 1: Decentralised semantics <p>Presented by: Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 5th, 2022&nbsp;</p><p>This talk focused on decentralised semantics and how the segregation of task-oriented objects within a standard layered architecture can provide a long-term solution for unifying a data language within distributed data ecosystems. From that lens, decentralised semantics is ontology-agnostic, offering a harmonisation solution between data models and data representation formats while providing a roadmap to resolve privacy-compliant data sharing between servers, networks, and across sectoral or jurisdictional boundaries.&nbsp;</p> What is “Decentralised semantics”? <p>Data semantics is the study of the meaning and use of data in any digital environment. In data semantics, the focus is on how a data object represents a concept or object in the real world.</p><p><br>Decentralised semantics describes a data modelling methodology of layering and cryptographically binding task-specific objects (overlays) to a standard capture base, which, when combined, defines a complex digital object. The segregation of task-specific overlays enables dynamic semantic interoperability in the construction process of any digital object without compromising the objectual integrity of the semantic structure, its modular components, or the relationship between those objects.</p><p>Decentralised semantics provides a powerful solution for semantic interoperability, data harmonisation, internationalisation, and dynamic presentation.</p>

 Part 2: Decentralised authentication <p>Presented by: Robert Mitwicki, Head of the Technology Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 12th, 2022&nbsp;</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>The second talk focused on decentralised authentication and how a decentralised key management infrastructure, providing self-certifying identifier (SCID) issuance underpinned by one-way cryptographic functions, can offer information uniqueness from captured entropy. Furthermore, a decentralised authentication system must be ledger-agnostic, with its identifiers interoperable across ecosystems, platforms, and networks.</p> What is “Decentralised authentication”? <p>Data provenance refers to the tracing and recording of the origin of data and its movement between locations. If digital data is tamper-proof (i.e. provable to have not been corrupted after its creation), it can be assumed to be authentic. Data authentication focuses on timestamping data inputs at index time, determining each event as factual.</p><p>Decentralised authentication describes a key management methodology of cryptographically binding SCIDs to an associated log that compiles the history of all uses or changes to the public/private key pair, ensuring verifiable identifier provenance throughout any ambient infrastructure. Immutable ordering guarantees the factual authenticity of the recorded event underpinning any systematic data input. Furthermore, all system identifiers must remain network-agnostic, enabling identifier interoperability within and across any distributed data ecosystem.</p><p>Decentralised authentication provides a powerful solution for identifier interoperability, data provenance, data-intensive event streaming, and event sourcing applications.</p>

<p>Presented by: Dr Philippe Page, Head of the Knowledge Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 19th</p><p>The final talk focused on distributed governance and how a multi-stakeholder Data Governance Administration (DGA) provides the legal provision to assume responsibility for the consensual veracity of data transactions under its administrative control on behalf of the citizens and legal entities it serves. The role of a DGA aligns closely with that of a “data intermediary” as described in the European Parliament’s recently proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0767">Data Governance Act</a>, serving as a mediator between those who wish to make their data available and those who seek to leverage that data.</p> What is “Distributed data governance”? <p>Data governance is a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models, which describe who can take what actions with what information and when, under what circumstances, and using what methods.</p><p>Distributed data governance describes an operational framework for the provision of rules, common standards and practices, infrastructures and a distributed governance framework to empower individuals through increased digital access to (and control of) their electronic personal data, nationally and across borders, fostering a genuine single market for electronic record systems, relevant components and high-risk artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Multi-stakeholder participation within DGAs guarantees the consensual veracity of purpose-driven ecosystem policy while providing a consistent, trustworthy and efficient set-up for personal data use for research, innovation, and regulatory activities.</p><p>Distributed data governance provides a powerful solution for multi-stakeholder collaboration of rules and regulations for safe and secure data sharing within and across distributed data ecosystems.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: Digital assets are only as safe as their private keys. Securing private keys through responsible key management has thus been a major focus at Blockchain Commons, under our <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a> initiative. Unfortunately, securing keys ultimately isn’t just a logistical problem or a technical problem. It’s also a legal problem because US courts have inserted themselves into the process by demanding keys, often as a part of discovery.</p>

  <p>Turning over keys to courts not only introduces major threats to the digital assets controlled by the keys, but it also fundamentally misunderstands the purpose and use of private keys. There are better tools for court-based discovery, public keys prime among them. There are better, more traditional ways to enforce the turn over of assets. Requiring the disclosure of private keys instead is a needless threat not just to digital assets, but to our rights as well.</p>
</blockquote>

 

<p>Increasingly, attorneys in the United States are asking courts to force the disclosure of private keys as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions, and increasingly courts are acceding to those demands. Though this is a relatively recent phenomenon, it’s part of a larger problem of law enforcement seeking back doors to cryptography that goes back at least to the U.S. government’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures">failed introduction of the Clipper Chip</a> in 1993.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, today’s attacks on private keys in the courtroom have been more successful, creating an existential threat to digital assets, data, and other information protected by digital keys. That danger arises from a fundamental disconnect between this practice and the realities of technologies that leverage public-key cryptography for security: private-key disclosure can cause irreparable harm, including the loss of funds and the distortion of digital identities.</p>

<p>As a result, we need to support legislation that will protect digital keys while allowing courts to access information and assets in a way that better recognizes those realities. The private-key disclosure law <a href="https://youtu.be/61c3sYGqO-E?t=1063">currently being considered in Wyoming</a> is an excellent example of the sort of legislation that we could put forth and advocate for in order to maintain the proper protection for our digital assets and identities.</p>

<p><a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0105">Wyoming Senate Filing 2021-0105</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    No person shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key known to any other person in any civil, administrative, legislative or other proceeding in this state that relates to a digital asset, other interest or right to which the private key provides access unless a public key is unavailable or unable to disclose the requisite information with respect to the digital asset, other interest or right. This paragraph shall not be interpreted to prohibit any lawful proceeding that compels a person to produce or disclose a digital asset, other interest or right to which a private key provides access, or to disclose information about the digital asset, other interest or right, provided that the proceeding does not require production or disclosure of the private key.
</blockquote>

 The Realities of Private Keys 

<p>The forced disclosure of private keys is deeply harmful because it fundamentally runs at odds with how private keys work. Attorneys (and courts) are usually trying to force the disclosure of information or (later) the relinquishment of assets, but they’re treating private keys just like they’re physical keys that they could demand, use, and give back.</p>

<p>Private keys do not match any of these realities. As Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///1971">Chris Rothfuss</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no perfect analog for a modern cryptographic private key in existing statute or case law; it is unique in its form and function. As we build a policy framework around digital assets, it is essential that we appropriately recognize and reflect the characteristics of the underlying public / private key and cryptographic technologies. Without clear, unambiguous legal protection for the sanctity of the private key, it is impossible to ensure the integrity of the associated digital assets, information, smart contracts and identities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That appropriation recognition and reflection requires us to understand that:</p>

<p>1. Private keys are not assets.</p>

<p>Private keys are fundamentally the way we exert authority in the digital space, an interface between our physical reality and the digital reality. They may give us the ability to control a digital asset: to store it, to send it, or to use it. Similarly, they may give us the ability to decrypt protected data or to verify a digital identity. However, they are not the assets, the data, nor the identity themselves.</p>

<p>It’s the obvious difference between your car and your electronic key fob. The one is an asset, while the other lets you control that asset.</p>

<p>As Jon Callas, Director of Technology Projects at the EFF, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  “They don’t even want the key, they want the data; asking for the key is like asking for the filing cabinet rather than the file.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. Private keys are not the proper tool for discovery.</p>

<p>Treating private keys as a tool to ensure the discovery of information fundamentally misunderstands their purpose. Private keys are not how we see something in digital space, but instead how we exert authority in digital space!</p>

<p>Turning back to comparisons, it’s the difference between a ledger and a pen. If you wanted accounting information, you’d ask for the ledger; you wouldn’t ask for the pen, especially not if it was a pen that allowed you to write undetectably in the handwriting of the accountant!</p>

<p>Former Federal Prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan, when offering <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a> in favor of Wyoming’s private-key disclosure law, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  “the court could order a disclosure or an accounting of all the digital assets that are held, and then those assets could be disclosed and the location of whether they are held across different platforms or even different wallets. But giving the key is actually giving access to those assets. That is the difference.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, there is an electronic tool that meets the needs of discovery: public keys. Wyoming has recognized that in their <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">legislation</a>, saying that a private key should never be required if a public key would do the job (and they parenthetically noting at hearings that their current understanding is that a public key will always do the job). If our concern is revealing information that will help to catch and prosecute criminals, then public keys are the answer.</p>

<p>3. Private keys are not physical.</p>

<p>Electronic private keys and physical keys are very different. A physical key could pass through many hands and there could be the expectation that it was very likely not duplicated (especially if it were a special key, such as a safety-deposit-box key), and that when the key was returned to the original holder, they would once again have control of all of the linked assets. The same is not true for a private key, which could be easily duplicated by any of the many hands it passed through, with no way to ascertain that had happened.</p>

<p>Returning to the example of a car’s key fob, it would not be appropriate to force the disclosure of the unique serial number stored within a car fob for the same reason it’s not appropriate to force the disclosure of a private key. Doing so, would give anyone who gets that serial number the ability to create a new fob and steal your car!</p>

<p>4. Private keys serve many purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, private keys are likely to have a lot more purposes than physical keys, especially if a court decides to go after not just a specific private key, but the root key from an HD wallet or a seed phrase. Root keys (and seeds) might be used to protect a wide variety of assets as well as private data. They may also be used to control identities and to offer irrefutable proof that the owner agreed to something through digital signatures.</p>

<p>The authoritative uses of private keys are so wide and all-encompassing that it’s hard to come up with a physical equivalent. The closest analogy, which was brought up by Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen at one of the Wyoming hearings, would be if a court demanded access to a hotel room by requiring the hotel’s master key, which can provide access to all rooms. But, a private key is more than that, so it would be as if the court also required that someone with signatory powers at the hotel sign a bunch of blank contracts and blank checks. The potential for harm with the disclosure of a private key is just that high for someone who is using it for a variety of purposes — and there will be more and more people doing so as the importance of the digital world continues to increase.</p>

 The Realities of Courts 

<p>Going beyond the fact that a private key is the wrong tool for courts and that it’s often being used in the wrong way, there are a number of other problematic realities related to the courts themselves and how and when they’re trying to access private keys.</p>

<p>5. Courts are not prepared to protect private keys.</p>

<p>To start with, courts don’t have the experience needed to protect private keys. This danger is made worse by the fact that a single private key is likely to pass through the hands of many different court staff over time.</p>

<p>But, this isn’t just about courts. The problem of creating safe ways to transfer public keys is far bigger. It’s something that the cryptographic field as a whole does not have good answers for. Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen attested in his  testimony in Wyoming that the “immense difficulties of transferring a private key are a risk that allows bearing of false witness.” Putting courts, without crypto-expertise, in the middle of the problem could be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Perhaps cryptographers will resolve these issues in time, and perhaps someday courts will be able to share in that expertise if they decide doing so is a good use of their time and resources, but we need to consider keys whose disclosures are being forced now.</p>

<p>6. Courts are requiring premature disclosure.</p>

<p>The current situation with key disclosure is even more problematic because it’s occurring as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions. Discovery rulings are <a href="https://www.resolvingdiscoverydisputes.com/appeals/obtaining-review-of-discovery-rulings/">almost impossible to appeal</a>, which means that in today’s environment key holders have almost no recourse for protecting the token of their own authority in digital space.</p>

<p>7. Courts are more demanding of digital assets than physical assets.</p>

<p>We recognize that courts should be able to require the usage of a key. Compelling usage is nothing new, but the private key is not required for that, simply a court order.</p>

<p>If someone refuses to use their private key in a way compelled by a court, that’s nothing new either. The physical world already has plenty of examples of people refusing such orders, such as by hiding assets or just refusing to pay judgements. They are handled with sanctions such as contempt of court.</p>

<p>Asking for more from the electronic world is an overreach of traditional judgements that also creates much greater repercussions.</p>

 The Repercussions of Disclosure 

<p>Using the wrong tool for the wrong reasons and putting it in hands not ready to deal with it will have calamitous results. Here are some of the most obvious repercussions.</p>

<p>1. Asset Theft</p>

<p>Obviously, there is a danger of the assets being stolen, as a private key gives total control over those assets. These assets could go far beyond the specifics of what a court is interested in, because of the multitude of uses for keys.</p>

<p>2. Asset Loss</p>

<p>Beyond the problem of purposeful theft, keys could be lost, and with them digital assets. Former federal prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan raised this concern in her <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a>, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Evidence is lost all the time.” If that evidence was a private key, which might hold a variety of assets, information, and proofs of identity, the loss could be tremendous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Majority Whip <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///2035">Jared Olsen</a> agreed with this concern at a recent Wyoming hearing, noting that a judicial assistant could delete a key and cause a loss of $8 billion dollars in Bitcoin when there was only a judgment for $100,000. He said he was “concerned about just simply handling it”.</p>

<p>3. Collateral Damage</p>

<p>Thefts or losses resulting from the disclosure of a private key could also go far beyond an individual before the court. Increasingly, assets are being held in multisignatures, which may grant multiple people control over the same assets. By requiring the disclosure of a key, a court could negatively impact people entirely unrelated to the proceedings.</p>

<p>4. Identity Theft.</p>

<p>Because private keys might also protect the identifier for digital identity, their loss, theft, or misuse could put someone’s entire digital life at risk. If a key was copied, someone else could pretend to be the holder and even make digital signatures that are legally binding for them.</p>

 Support This Legislation 

<p>Protecting private keys is one of the most important things that Blockchain Commons has ever worked on. As Blockchain Commons’ founder Christopher Allen said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I find the protections of this Private Key Disclosure bill crucial for the future of digital rights.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader Chris Rothfuss affirmed this, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>” Christopher Allen has been an invaluable member of our blockchain policy community, bringing a lifetime of technical expertise to advise our committee work and inform our legislative drafting. Mr. Allen has emphasized the particular importance of protecting private keys from any form of compulsory disclosure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need your help to make it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re an experienced member of the cryptocurrency or digital asset field or a human-rights activist, please submit your own testimony in support to the <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Committees/2022/S19">Wyoming Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology</a>. The bill will be coming up for further discussion on September 19-20 in Laramie, Wyoming.</p>

<p>But, Wyoming is just the start. They are doing an excellent job of leading the way, but we need other states and countries to follow. If you have connections to another legislature, please suggest they introduce <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">similar language to Wyoming’s bill</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t feel comfortable talking with a legislature, you can help by advocating for the protection of private keys as something different than assets.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our new world of digital assets and digital information will succeed or fail based upon how we lay its foundations today. It could become a safe space for us or a dangerous wild west.</p>

<p>Properly protecting private keys (and using public keys and other tools for legitimate judicial needs) is a keystone that will help us to build a sturdy edifice.</p>

<p>Frankfurt, 16th of August 2022</p>

<p>IDunion, the consortium created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, has reached the next stage in building a productive, cross-border ecosystem by founding a European cooperative with limited liability (Sociedad Cooperativa Europea, or SCE for short). </p>

<p>Founding meeting of the IDunion SCE on 20.07.2022 (from left to right: Mirko Mollik/TrustCerts GmbH, Markus Sabadello/ Danube Tech GmbH, Dr. Carsten Stöcker/ Spherity GmbH)</p>

  With the spin-off into the SCE, the infrastructure for verifiable credentials, which was researched and developed in the research project can now go live into production.   The European cooperative will be deploying and operating the necessary technical network to provide the operations.  This will allow citizens, private-sector organisations and government institutions to augment the digital identifications (eID) provided by governments with use of secure digital credentials for  identity attributes required across a wide range of use cases.   The legal form of the SCE was chosen as it offers a legally secure basis for the operations of an independent infrastructure for digital credentials.  While the IDunion research project was initiated with funding from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action (BMWK), the European cooperative aims to secure private sector funding to provide a stable, non-profit business operation.   The decision to use the legal form of a Sociedad Cooperativa Europea was driven by IDunion’s core principles of neutrality and openness. It allows all legal entities that adhere to the community values to apply for membership to the SCE. Furthermore a future takeover or control by a single entity is prohibited by this legal form. The guiding principle of the cooperative is the joint establishment of the ecosystem – a task that no individual member can achieve on its own.  
<p>On 20.07.2022, the founding members Spherity, Danube Tech and TrustCerts signed the articles of association of the SCE in Essen. “We are very pleased to have achieved this milestone for the IDunion project,” says Helge Michael, consortium Leader of the IDunion research project. “With the IDunion SCE, we have created the ideal basis for building a future-proof identity ecosystem for Europe in which all members can work together as equals. Special thanks goes to the BMWK for providing the funding support as part of the research project ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’, which was an essential prerequisite to this next stage,” Michael continues. Dr. Carsten Stöcker, Managing Director of Spherity GmbH, adds: “IDunion SCE provides the legal basis for a cooperative governance structure, which strengthens the interests of individual participants in the interplay of decentralisation and cooperation without allowing a central platform operator to exploit its users economically.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>IDunion: The IDunion research project is a European network that brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organisations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields. Its aim is to develop a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information.</p>

<p>IDunion SCE: IDunion SCE is a cooperative (European Cooperative Europea) with limited liability that will operate the production network for credential verification, based on the findings of the research project. The SCE and the network are subject to the community governance of its members. Initial founding members of the SCE are:</p>

<p>TrustCerts GmbH: The cyber security start-up TrustCerts from Gelsenkirchen focuses on verifiable credentials and digital identities. TrustCerts’ solution is based on a specially developed blockchain that is compliant with German data protection and security requirements.</p>

<p>Danube Tech GmbH: One of the first companies supporting the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, the Vienna-based Danube Tech specialises in interoperability between different SSI networks across national borders. Among the products developed by Danube Tech are the Universal Resolver and godiddy.com.</p>

<p>Spherity GmbH: The German software provider Spherity provides secure and decentralised identity management solutions for companies, machines, products, data and algorithms. Spherity provides the enabling technology to digitise and automate compliance processes in highly regulated sectors. Spherity’s products strengthen cybersecurity and create efficiency and data interoperability between digital value chains.</p>

<p>Public key cryptographic token API ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1 from the OASIS PKCS 11 TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>The Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) are a group of public-key cryptography standards devised and published by RSA Security LLC, starting in the early 1990s. The OASIS PKCS 11 Technical Committee addresses the ongoing enhancement and maintenance of the PKCS #11 standard.</p>



<p>PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1 defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules and smart cards. The API itself is named “Cryptoki” (from “cryptographic token interface” and pronounced as “crypto-key”). This specification defines data types, functions and other basic components of the PKCS #11 Cryptoki interface for devices that may hold cryptographic information and may perform cryptographic functions. It also defines mechanisms that are anticipated for use with the current version of PKCS #11.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>What has your career journey looked like?<br>I have been in payments and technology industry for over 20 years. My career has ran the gamut from developing innovative products and solutions, engaging with customers through executive account management to being highly engaged in standards and trade organizations around the globe. The last few years I’ve had a keen interest in focusing on developing inclusive, fit for purpose, privacy preserving and user centric digital identity. Social impact solutions to bridge the digital divide is a part of that as well.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?<br>My dream job was to practice law, as I wanted to play a role in assisting underserved communities in navigating legal matters. I grew up in a very rural area where I witnessed certain segments of the population not being able to obtain legal representation on a variety of things simply because they could not afford to do so.</p>



<p><br></p>



<blockquote><p>❝I truly believe that women being engaged in the digital ID space is critically important because solutions need to be inclusive for everyone.❝</p></blockquote>



<p><br><br>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?<br>When I started in the tech industry, there were not many women with a “seat” at the table. Even those women that were involved were typically not given the same voice as male counterparts and had to work extra hard to prove their value in any conversations and in creating products, services and solutions. Quite literally, it always felt like a “boys club” and I never felt comfortable speaking up in the beginning of my career for fear that my voice would not be heard. Often I would carefully tailor questions and responses as not to seem to be a dissenting or diverse voice. As my career grew, I began to embrace my authentic self and the unique viewpoints that I have and started speaking up and realizing my own influence. Today, I encourage women to embrace their authentic self and voice. Also, helping elevate and empower others to their full potential is a key focus area that brings me great satisfaction, as I embrace the concepts of servant leadership to those around me.<br><br>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?<br>I really think of this as just “life balance”. My work self is as much a part of me as everything else. So first and foremost, I have learned that I need to take care of myself. If I am feeling burnout in my work responsibilities, that easily spills over into my personal life (and vice versa). Therefore, I have to stay focused on making sure I am doing things that I enjoy, spending time with family and friends (even if only virtually), exercising, etc. If I am not taking care of myself, I cannot be 100% present in anything. Also, I have learned that I have to unplug. I know personally, in the past, I have felt the need to be the best at everything. But it is an impossible goal. I’ve learned that it is absolutely ok to not overachieve at everything in my life. Some things, I will. Some things, I won’t. That’s perfectly fine</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>❝When I started in the tech industry, there were not many women with a “seat” at the table. Even those women that were involved were typically not given the same voice as male counterparts and had to work extra hard to prove their value (…). I began to embrace my authentic self and the unique viewpoints that I have and started speaking up and realizing my own influence. ❞</p>Marie Jordan</blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?<br>I truly believe that women being engaged in the digital ID space is critically important because solutions need to be inclusive for everyone. As someone extremely passionate about uplifting economies, women are an integral part of that and if more women became aware of the important role that they play in all parts of ensuring identity is fit for purpose and inclusive, I feel strongly they would understand the need for more diverse thoughts and opinions in this space. Educating women on the importance of identity becoming digital and the need for women’s unique perspectives will go a long way towards achieving that goal. Also, encouraging men as well to be supporters of bringing women into the space is equally as important.</p>



<p></p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?<br>Be a team player, who collaborates with everyone, but also understand your value add to the culture of an organization. A lot of times I believe women try and fit in whereas they should recognize that they can be extremely successful by being themselves. I have personally had some of the greatest successes in my career by being genuine and authentic. This creates trust with those around you, which in turn can lead to great achievements. I’ve also learned the importance of networking and getting to know those around you. By having a supportive, diverse network, you will always have a sounding board and mutually beneficial relationships. A network isn’t transactional. It’s about building meaningful relationships.</p>



<p></p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?<br>I believe the biggest challenge will be women continuing to bridge the gender gaps that exist, particularly with women taking prominent roles at the executive levels within tech organizations. This starts with education that focuses on women in technology, which I still feel is not where it should be. It has slowly shifted over the years but there is still a lot more that can be done.<br><br>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?<br>Be bold. Take chances. Get involved. Understand your value. Do not let fear of failing hold you back. Network and uplift others. Be the one who always empowers others to succeed.</p>

<p>Dublin, Ireland is the place to be this September.</p>



<p>The Hyperledger Foundation, a multi-project open source collaborative effort hosted by the Linux Foundation, is holding their annual <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/hyperledger-global-forum/bal-forum-2022-dublin-ireland">Hyperledger Global Forum</a> (HGF) September 12th -13th at <a href="https://www.theccd.ie/">Convention Centre Dublin</a> with workshops to follow on the 14th at the Gibson Hotel.&nbsp; The Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) will be present in the exhibition hall as a community partner at HGF.&nbsp; Please stop by and visit to learn more about the foundation.</p>



<p>ToIP Steering Committee member, Scott Perry, Principal of Crypto and Digital Trust Services at Schellman, will be speaking at HGF on Monday, September 12th on the topic of Governance and Audit of Blockchain Networks.</p>



<p>While blockchain technology creates strong cryptographic controls securing the integrity of data, successful, cooperative blockchain networks must establish trust between a variety of independent entities to create overall trust.&nbsp; In this presentation, Scott Perry will discuss how trust is created when using blockchain technologies in the utility layer of the Trust Over IP stack.  Scott will discuss how blockchain networks can add accountability within stakeholder roles to ensure that blockchain-based trust ecosystems are trustworthy above the embedded cryptographic trust assertions.&nbsp; Come learn which role systems auditors, cybersecurity professionals, and risk management experts play in ensuring how trust is built within the ToIP stack focusing on how blockchain-based trust ecosystems are maintained when adopting such cutting-edge technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-located at the Conventions Center Dublin the same week is the Linux Foundation <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open Source Summit Europe</a> September 13th to 16th.&nbsp; ToIP will be having a co-located <a href="https://trustoverip.org/summit/">Trust Over IP Summit 2022</a>, during the OSS.&nbsp; So when you<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/register/"> register for OSS</a>, don’t forget to add on the free registration for ToIP Summit 2022.<br><br><a href="https://trustoverip.org/summit/#agenda">Agenda for the ToIP Summit 2022</a>:</p>

No! No Payment Implants



 Walletmor, the world’s only manufacturer of payment implants, has just sold its thousandth implant, which is a breakthrough in the company’s development. 



<p>LONDON, UK, August 12, 2022 /<a href="http://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — Walletmor, the world’s only manufacturer of payment implants, has announced another success story. The company has just sold its thousandth implant, which is a breakthrough in the company’s development. The implant number 1000 was purchased by a resident of Turku, Finland. This geographic location is no surprise to Walletmor, as Scandinavia accounts for 20% of the company’s global sales.</p>







<p>– I believe that exceeding the barrier of 1000 implants is our startup’s transition to the next, higher level. A similar milestone was the obtaining of the ISO 10993-5: 2009E biocompatibility certificate in 2021. It was the first significant turning point in the company’s history. We proved internationally that our technology is safe. From now on, the sale of implants, which we will count in the thousands, will be a clear signal to the market that our startup is just accelerating – says Wojtek Paprota, CEO and founder of Walletmor Ltd.</p>



<p>The Walletmor implant, placed just under the skin, is the only commercially produced solution of this type in the world. The microprocessor with the antenna covered by a safe biopolymer works like a regular credit or debit card. That means that the implant can be used almost anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>2022 is the second year of Walletmor operation. At the moment, sales are conducted in the European Economic Area and the United States. This year’s expansion plans also apply to the Middle East countries. Walletmor has already actively participated in the Expo in Dubai and fruitful talks with partners from countries in the Persian Gulf. Currently, Walletmor is working with research units on the possibility of safely placing medical data in implants, including, for example, about allergens and past diseases. The price of the implant in the US is $299, while in the European Union it is €199.</p>

<p>This update provides a brief overview and technical analysis of the results of the “snapshot” mechanism currently being used to track the consistency of staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Consortia staking pool. Patrons staking EWT can use the tools provided at <a href="https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/">https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/</a> to check the status of their wallets and snapshots if applicable.</p> Snapshots and Variable EWT&nbsp;rewards <p>A series of Snapshots are being taken of wallets that have staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Energy Web Consortia staking pool. The purpose of the snapshots is to measure the consistency of staking. Specifically, snapshots track how much EWT is deposited into a staking contract by a given wallet and how long that stake is maintained throughout the life of the Consortia staking pool. Since staking will be a major contributor to the cybersecurity of Energy Web solutions tied to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">the upcoming Consortia blockchain</a>, having a consistent, high stake of EWT is crucial. Therefore, EWT staking pools reward consistent stakers with higher rewards compared to stakers who withdraw EWT before the staking pool&nbsp;ends.</p><p>In the case of the current Consortia staking pool, there will be an additional, variable reward distributed to all Patrons (individuals who have staked EWT into the pool) with at least 1 snapshot. This reward comes from redistributing all unallocated rewards from the Consortia staking smart contract. The staking contract was deployed with the maximum possible reward balance in order to provide rewards for Patrons staking a total of 7.5 million EWT for the entire 9 month duration of the staking&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Because the staking pool has yet to reach its capacity, not all fixed rewards will be distributed. This is where snapshots come in: the reward balance that is left unallocated will be distributed to Patrons who have snapshots. Rewards vary depending on the number of snapshots and the amount of EWT staked. For each wallet, the reward will be determined by an exponential formula taking into account the number of snapshots and average EWT stake. The exponential formula will incentivise Patrons to collect all snapshots, since a wallet with all snapshots will earn much higher rewards than wallets with 5 and less snapshots and the same EWT&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Similar to the timing of the snapshots, variable rewards are impossible to predict as they depend on the timing of snapshots and actions of other staking patrons. Therefore, the only rational behavior that maximizes variable APY is to stake as much EWT into a single wallet as possible and leave it staked consistently until the end of the Consortia staking pool. To be clear, the variable rewards will be distributed in addition to the fixed award already awarded by the Consortia staking&nbsp;pool.</p> Snapshot 1 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>In total, 6,408 wallets were included in the first snapshot. These wallets staked 5,540,589 EWT. The individual balances vary from 1 EWT (the lower limit for snapshots) to 3,000 EWT (the upper staking limit for a single wallet). The chart below shows the balances of all snapshot wallets: wallets on the horizontal axis, balances on the vertical&nbsp;axis.</p><p>The next chart shows the stake balance distribution with balance bounds on the horizontal axis and the number of wallets in each section on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>Almost 2/3rd of all wallets have balances under 500 EWT (out of which 334 are staking just 1 EWT), and 17% of wallets have balances higher than 2,500 EWT. This is surprising, as normally such distributions follow a power-law distribution (the higher the balance, the lower the number of wallets). In the case of Consortia staking, the relatively large number of wallets can be explained by Patrons holding many EWT (more than the upper limit of 3,000 EWT) staking with multiple wallets. Out of 1,110 wallets staking over 2,500 EWT, 970 are staking the maximum allowed 3,000&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot 2 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>Snapshot 2 was taken on block #<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/block/18648235/transactions">18648235</a> generated on June 27th, 2022 at 9:16 PM UTC+1. This time, there were 6,641 wallets staking (up 233 from the first snapshot), staking a total of 5,730,962 EWT, so (up 190,373 EWF from snapshot&nbsp;1).</p><p>Here are the balances of snapshot 2 (in orange) compared to snapshot 1 balances (in blue). Wallets on the bottom, balances on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>The orange spikes are wallets adding more EWT between snapshot 1 and 2. The orange dips are wallets withdrawing EWT. On the far right of the chart there is the orange line and no blue line: these are the completely new wallets that didn’t participate in snapshot&nbsp;1.</p><p>In total, 880 wallets increased their EWT stake and 350 of were completely new (not staked during snapshot 1). 180 wallets decreased their stake, 117 of them withdrawing all their EWT and not qualifying for snapshot&nbsp;2.</p><p>Here’s the balance distribution comparison between stake 1 and 2 balances. Bounds on the bottom, number of wallets in each category in the vertical&nbsp;scale:</p><p>We can see a slight increase in each category, even in the highest balances section: 41 new wallets staked between 2,500 and 3,000 ETW, out of which 40 staked the 3,000 EWT maximum. For comparison, there are now 150 additional wallets staking under 500&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot insights and what to expect&nbsp;next <p>So far, staking in the Consortia pool has been consistent in line with the design of the snapshot mechanism. This is evidenced by the balance distribution of snapshot 1 and 2 and <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0x181A8b2a5AEb25941F6A79b4aE43dBb1968c417A/coin-balances#address-tabs">EWT balances in the staking contract</a>:</p><p>Such consistent staking will provide a high degree of economic cybersecurity to all enterprise-grade Energy Web solutions (for more information on the connection between consistent staking, cybersecurity, and Energy Web solutions, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">please review our announcement on the upcoming Consortia chain</a>).</p><p>As mentioned above, the next 4 snapshots will be taken randomly between now and the end of the Consortia staking pool in December 2022. Patrons who receive at least 1 snapshot will qualify for additional rewards. The rewards will be calculated and distributed after the Consortia staking pool ends.

<p>This blog post outlines the revised version of <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges.pdf">the initial RFC</a> detailing the TRAC bridging approach from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain based on the feedback received on the initial version from the OriginTrail community.</p> Teleporting TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>The <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges.pdf">previous version of this RFC</a> proposed the initial TRAC bridge for near-term utilisation be implemented via the Chainbridge system, while enabling emergent bridging infrastructure (such as the Snowfork bridge) as potential long term bridging solutions.<br>Due to the concerns expressed by the TRAC community regarding the inherent risks associated with such a bridge implementation (details below and in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/16">RFC comments</a>), and demonstrated vulnerabilities of similar bridges seen recently within the crypto space (even while writing this update of the RFC), an alternative approach will be implemented — “one way teleports”.</p><p>A one way teleport is an already proven approach within the OriginTrail community as it was successfully executed during the Starfleet stage of the OriginTrail Parachain development. Via a “one-time” TRAC bridge from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain the OriginTrail community has successfully staked 100MM TRAC tokens to be transferred to the (then stand-alone) OriginTrail tailored blockchain.</p><p>The exact approach and details of the smart contract implementation are specified in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC%2010%20Starfleet%20boarding%20(staking)%20smart%20contract%20specs.pdf">OT-RFC-10</a>, however for practicality an outline is presented here:</p>  A special smart contract is deployed on Ethereum blockchain designed to lock a specific amount of TRAC tokens, to be teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain. The contract is permissionless and anybody can deposit (lock) TRAC into&nbsp;it.  The equivalent amount of TRAC tokens gets minted on the OriginTrail Parachain to the same address as the one that locked tokens on the Ethereum side (so tokens can be utilised by the same&nbsp;wallet).  Special care is taken to ensure security of the smart contract — a thorough smart contract audit has been conducted, together with functionality minimization (to lower complexity and thus risk surface) as well as coding and testing best practices.  <p>The near-term TRAC bridging proposal therefore is&nbsp;to:</p>  Perform one way TRAC teleports from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain by reutilizing <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/starfleet-boarding-contract">the same smart contract</a> already proven in the previous 100MM TRAC Starfleet staking procedure. This contract implementation has <a href="https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/origin-trail-starfleet-staking">been security audited by Quantstamp</a> and proven functional and secure in a production environment. Additionally, the smart contract is built in such a way that the locked funds can be used to integrate with the future&nbsp;bridges.  Execute teleports in a total of 15 batches in two week intervals.  This approach removes third-party code (non-OriginTrail ecosystem) from the bridging infrastructure, additionally minimising the risk surface until a more trust-minimising solution is available.  The approach enables continued exploration of bridging solutions within the Polkadot ecosystem for the mid- and long-term viability of a two-way TRAC bridge. It is expected that multiple options will be available, such as common-good parachain bridges, Snowfork and others, developed by the wider Polkadot community. Once a suitable bridge is available, all teleported tokens will be migrated (subject to the same RFC process as with this implementation).   Teleporting details <p>Teleporting will occur in 15 batches, each of which will be performed with a process similar to the previously executed Starfleet staking. Due to the nature of the smart contracts and them being audited and tested, only parametric changes can be implemented and no changes in smart contract code will be performed.</p><p>Each of the 15 teleportation batches will deploy a separate Teleport contract on Ethereum, managed by a multisig wallet. The illustration below shows the lifecycle of each Teleport contract and its phases as per smart contract design (specified in OT-RFC-10). There are 5 distinct periods defined in the life&nbsp;cycle:</p>  Preparation period: used for contract preparation and deployment on Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  Boarding period: the period during which TRAC can be deposited in the smart contract for teleportation. The boarding period will last 2 weeks for each batch (except for the first batch lasting 3&nbsp;weeks).  Lock period: the period during which tokens are immobile (locked) in the teleportation smart contract on Ethereum. TRAC tokens are teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain and available for use with the same address as used for locking. Each lock period will be set to expire on March 31st&nbsp;2023.  Bridge period: the period during which locked tokens can be transferred from the teleportation smart contract on Ethereum to a fully fledged bridge implementation (which is expected to be available in the bridge period). The bridge period lasts for 12 months (latest until March 31st&nbsp;2024).  Fallback period: period used in the fallback scenario of a fully fledged bridge not becoming available, after all previous periods have expired. In this period it will be possible to teleport TRAC tokens back to Ethereum, using the accounting feature as described in the contract spec (OT-RFC-10).  <p>To incentivize the teleportation process and utility of the OriginTrail Parachain and the (then deployed) OriginTrail DKG v6, a designated amount of OTP bounty tokens will be made available for the users (to be announced).</p><p>The teleport timeline is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  August 18th (tentative): first Teleportation contract deployment and Batch #1 teleporting start, the first boarding period lasting 3&nbsp;weeks  September: first minting of TRAC on OT Parachain, added OTP bounty to enable the use of the OriginTrail Parchain (bonus size&nbsp;TBD)  Mid-September: Once TRAC is available, execute OriginTrail DKG v6&nbsp;launch  Batch #2 and further teleportation batches continue immediately after the first teleportation is completed and validated as successful.  <p>The detailed timeline will be shared in the following documents as soon as this RFC is approved.</p><p>The complete and updated OT-RFC-12 v2 document can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges%20(v2).pdf">here</a>.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-v2-teleporting-trac-to-the-origintrail-parachain-on-polkadot-de535a9d2693">OT-RFC-12 V2: Teleporting TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We’re excited to share that we launched the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network">Ceramic Community Forum</a>! The forum is the place to ask technical questions and receive support from your fellow community members and Ceramic’s core team.</p> Why did we launch the forum? <p>If you have been a part of Ceramic’s developer community for a while, you probably know that we've been exchanging knowledge and receiving updates from the Ceramic core team on a <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord Server</a>. One piece of feedback we received from multiple members of the community is that, over time, the RSS feed-like nature of Discord made it difficult to get answers to technical questions and search for information. It became clear that we need a better platform for facilitating technical support and empowering our developer community to share technical knowledge about Ceramic.</p> What do I use the forum for? <p>The forum is dedicated to asking and answering technical questions about Ceramic. It consists of a few main categories dedicated to specific aspects of Ceramic tech. If you have a question to ask, simply open it under the most relevant category. The questions asked on the forum will be answered between the Ceramic community and Ceramic’s core team.</p><p>The forum includes a few additional features that should improve the technical-information sharing and question answering across the Ceramic developer community:</p>  Better search—you can use the forum’s built-in search tool to discover questions that might be similar to yours  Sign-in with Ethereum—to begin using the forum, you can sign up using your Ethereum wallet.   And what about the Ceramic Discord server? <p>The Ceramic Discord Server is not going anywhere. Going forward, the server will be focused on facilitating more high-level discussions around Ceramic—e.g. talking about community projects, sharing ideas and feedback about specific aspects of the Ceramic Network. Over the next month, expect to see some architectural changes in the Discord server as we transition technical support to the Ceramic Forum.</p><p>Try out the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Ceramic Forum</a> and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbtubbs/">David Tubbs</a>, Director of Marketing Communications at <a href="https://www.applyboard.com/">ApplyBoard</a>. Additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee.</p>



<p>Relationships are built on one thing: trust. It is the basis to which we form opinions and develop long lasting associations with who and how we make decisions in our everyday lives. Trust is typically established through one of three ways: 1) personal experience, 2) opinions from others we trust, and 3) third party verification in the form of reviews or trustmarks.</p>



<p>Let’s explore this third avenue and find out exactly what a trustmark is, how they come about, and most importantly, why they matter. In the digital era with an increase of online and accessible services, trustmarks matter more than ever before trustmarks matter more than ever before.</p>



<p>What is a trustmark?</p>



<p>Trustmarks are all around us every single day. They are woven into the fabric of our daily lives in the community, but more importantly in our digital lives.</p>



<p>When you login to a website and see the lock icon on your browser to denote a secure connection, when you walk into a bank in Canada and see the purple Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) logo right at the entrance, or when you go to a hotel website and see their Trip Advisor rating posted. These are all trustmarks and they exist to establish consumer confidence.</p>



<p>Trustmarks are less about what it stands for and more about how it makes the user feel. Do they feel a familiarity and understanding as to what the trustmark means? Do they feel like a third party actually verified something? And, does the user feel safe? These are questions a trustmark needs to answer to both communicate what it stands for and serve a wider purpose. Both of these factors can only come from a shared understanding of the trust to be built.</p>



<p>Creating a shared understanding</p>



<p>Crafting a universal and shared understanding for what a trustmark stands for is not easy. A trustmark must cross cultural, age, socioeconomic, and educational boundaries to make its ubiquity and utility impactful. It must also be supported by enough parties to gain critical mass so that adoption begins crossing traditional boundaries.</p>



<p>This often begins with an organization or group of entities to establish the need for a trustmark, its use, and also its limitations. It is vital that this organization remains unbiased. From there it is expanded through a virtuous cycle of education and adoption by more organizations until that critical mass of adoption is met. No matter what, the establishment of a solid foundation of a shared understanding is essential if widespread adoption of the trustmark is to be found. Without it, the trustmark will simply be a niche symbol for something only a small group will understand and recognize.</p>



<p>Creating mass adoption of a trustmark</p>



<p>The start of this shared understanding is happening right now as previously covered by Julianne Trotman in her article on <a href="https://diacc.ca/2022/03/11/digital-id-trust/">the development and adoption of trust frameworks</a> and the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF). The PCTF is the set of established needs and expectations around what validates that trust. The development of the iconography for a digital trustmark, in this context, is an important part of the process, but not as important as the actual adoption.</p>



<p>Adoption of a trustmark must be done across all our digital platforms. It should be shared on partner websites, on platforms, social media, traditional materials, and more. Ubiquity is not a bad thing, but should be embraced.</p>



<p>To continue with the example of the PCTF, because DIACC was the central source of its development and articulation, any trustmark would begin with its collaborative members. Its members would act as evangelists to start creating a distribution network for the trustmark. The key after this is repetition and growth. There is no set timeline for a trustmarks societal adoption, only that it is a journey that is wholly dependent on ongoing adoption by other organizations, companies, and if applicable, government.</p>



<p>Trustmarks take time. That being said, they start with a collective of people looking to reassure and build trust in our society. The more we talk about and show off a trustmark, subtly or overtly, the better adoption will be. It is a journey, but a journey worth starting.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, this will operate a ‘Multi-vendor Marketplace’ – A site where multiple sellers can each create their own e-store, and visitors can browse and buy from any of them.</p>
<p>This will accelerate our Digital Nation Action Plan, specifically the digital enablement and support of micro and small businesses. It’s still the case that many don’t even have a web site.</p>
<p>So this will provide them an ultra simple way of achieving that, with the key distinction from other options like EBay or Amazon obviously being that it’s entirely Scotland focused. This means a much more local, hands on technical support, and a concentrated market focus.</p>
 Features 
<p>Key features will include:</p>
 
 A powerful set of digital marketing tools – As well as loading up your products, you’ll be able to send e-vouchers, email marketing etc. 
 Cryptocurrency – Accept Bitcoin payments et al. This is another key technology field where SMEs know they should be doing more but it is simply beyond them. 
 
<p>In short it will leverage the SaaS (Software as a Service) model to make easily accessible the powerful e-commerce and digital marketing technologies that most small businesses would greatly benefit from but don’t have the resource or expertise to deploy themselves.</p>
<p>There is also great potential to team up with other Scottish innovators, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/">Miconex</a>. They offer a gift card system that could tie in with #1, with a particular focus on local towns, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/casestudy/case-study--the-perth-gift-card">Perth</a>.</p>
<p>Shops.scot will be able to provide the core e-commerce tools for selling their products, and organized into similarly local sections, like Shops.scot/Perth. This will provide a powerful combined solution to achieve key Scottish Government goals like <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scottish-government-offers-support-local-online-firms">boosting local commerce for local merchants</a>.</p>

  🚀 Foundation News  
 W3C DIDCore spec approved as an open web standard 
 
 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have approved the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) V1.0 specification as an official W3C Recommendation. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. Announcing the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) v1.0 specification as an open web standard signals that it is technically sound, mature, and ready for widespread adoption. Having an established v1.0 specification allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus, not only at the many groups meeting at DIF, but across the digital identity community.<br>
Read about this decision <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec-2/">on the DIF blog here</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/07/pressrelease-did-rec.html.en">the official W3C Press release here</a>. 
 
 <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">DIDComm v2 reached DIF approved spec status</a> 
 
 DIF is delighted to announce the approval of the DIDComm v2 specification from the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm working group</a>. This, along with the W3C decision on DIDs, represents a major step forward in the acceptance of decentralized identity, one that opens the path to widespread adoption and further development especially with regard to the types of peer-to-peer communication now possible. <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">Check out the DIF blog here</a> for more on the path to this milestone, what's new in v2, and where work goes from here! 
 
 <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/vui-donation/">The Verifier Universal Interface (VUI), an international self-sovereign identity interoperability initiative has been donated to DIF</a> 
 
 Together, 12 SSI organizations have led the definition of the minimum set of standard APIs necessary to implement or interoperate with the Verifier component. After months of hard work and collaboration, the VUI work has been successfully donated to DIF with the goal of furthering its evolution and reach to the international community.

 Alternative Device Binding ideas without device binding attachments
 
 revocation of the wallet authentication credential
 
 alternative linkage solutions enables the certifying entity to revoke the wallet authentication credentials based on upcoming security flaws of hardware mechanisms
 
 e.g. TEE of a specific vendor/version is vulnerable 
 certifying entity revokes wallet authetncation credential and the issuers crednetials is not usable anymore 
 some open questions if the certifying entity is not the wallet issuer

 Members of the Ethereum Foundation joined the SIG to review Ethereum's Decentralized Identity discussion in general, and ideas around a 'portable KYC' system in particular. You can find the discussion on the Ethereum website <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/decentralized-identity/">here</a>, and a problem statement draft on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sustany/dvg/wiki/Problem-Statement-Framing">here</a> 
 Invited speaker&nbsp;Anessa Allen Santos.&nbsp;Anessa's legal practice is largely dedicated to blockchain and fintech by helping innovative corporate clients navigate the evolving regulatory landscape for securities, commodities, and financial services. 
 John Popeo, a Partner at The Gallatin Group, joins the group. Before entering private practice, John spent a decade in various roles at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Having been on both sides of the regulatory divide, John brings a unique perspective to our discussion towards untangling the externalities of current AML and KYC regimes.

  Sometimes solving two complex problems together from an alternative 
perspective is more manageable than tackling them separately. So, slowly 
but surely, we are bringing our contribution toward more robust 
cybersecurity and seamless interoperability through our Dynamic Data 
Economy vision.

<p>Two years ago, we launched an atypical foundation with a societal mission to create synergies, exposing the formidable challenges of inclusiveness and privacy in digital transformation. Nevertheless, the core design of the Human Colossus Foundation is about experimentation, progressive development, and testing.</p><p>We want to thank our early supporters in the private and public sectors for providing nearly CHF 0.5 Mio of seed funding for prototyping core components to support data harmonisation, digital event authentication and distributed ecosystem governance</p><p>Our focus now shifts from experimentation to progressive development. Funded by the EU Horizon 2020 eSSIF-Lab initiative, the closing of our DKMS-4-SSIproject marks that transition as we hit the road of no return in our journey. Here we present our path to inclusiveness and privacy in digital transformation.</p> 0. Today <p>Every day more private and public services are available online. Users receive the digital benefits of increased availability and mobility. Digital services are available everywhere all the time. But the advantages come at a price: accessibility to the platform delivering the services. Moreover, with the current economic incentive that values data over the purpose of usage, platforms collect more data than they need for the intended purposes of the service. Furthermore, data are kept behind a walled garden, forcing users to share too much data with too many institutions. </p><p>Therefore services are restricted to users with the technological capacity to access the platform. Unfortunately, the same platforms too often force a form of consent, allowing them a secondary usage of user's information outside the initial purpose.</p><p>As a result, we evolve towards a two-tier society, excluding individuals that can not access the platform or are not willing to open their private sphere for an unclear rationale.</p> 1. Inclusiveness Needs Interoperability <p>Early in the 20th century, Georges Orwell introduced the "Big Brother" concept in his novel "1984". Although, at the time caricatural, it recognised early that no single over-centralised system could cope with the diversity and complexity of society. </p><p>When it comes to digital transformation, there is a direct technological corollary: digital platforms can not scale beyond a specific limit. If they grow outside their intended purpose, societal friction appears as they can not cope with the complexity of society as a whole. The diversity of our daily activities as individuals, of our customers as businesses or citizen's needs as a government requires digital services to focus on a clear purpose. Interoperability between services tailored to their user base is the natural solution to include every specific case in our digitalised society. Interoperability should be to services what cooperation is to humans; a natural core capacity enabling growth as a group. </p><p>This interoperability of services requires first machines to talk together (the unfortunately too narrow technological definition of interoperability) while the ultimate exchange of information remains under the user's control. Thus we started with the essential element: the tooling for a decentralised cryptographic key management infrastructure (DKMS). Then, within the creativity nest provided by the eSSIF-Lab, we started building libraries allowing developers to begin their journey into the most advanced decentralised authentication architecture: KERI, the brainchild of the prolific veteran of network security, Samuel Smith. Designed for secure authentication, KERI provides the grounds for an alternative form of interoperability. The user and platform authentication does not rely on an administrative intermediary. Instead, an ambient infrastructure under the separate control of each party lets them choose an adequate level of security according to the context. Security is distributed, and interoperability can follow. </p><p>Michal, a core team member of the DKMS-4-SSI project states: </p><blockquote><p>"Distribute the responsibility and decision making for authentication and authorisation among network participants and let them decide. No more castles with giant walls but a synergistic approach where network participants interact and make decisions based upon other participants' reputations. The foundations for our alternative are very similar to what the US National Institute of Standards (NIST) proposes with the "Zero-trust concept" -- distribute". </p><p>Michal Pietrus -Senior Developer &amp; Co-Founder of ArgonAUTHs</p></blockquote> 2. Privacy Needs Cybersecurity + Information Security = Human Governance <p>Interoperability requires more than secure authentication; it requires trust between participants. The user naturally becomes the central point of overall control of his digital experience. And trust requires meaning, not faith in technology providers. </p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation sees privacy as a fundamental factor enabling human cooperation at all levels. If cybersecurity protects data, privacy protection is at a higher level where data acquires meaning. A text string becomes a name only when the data model unambiguously links it to an attribute. Our equation is simple, Data plus Meaning equals Information. It is information usage that must be governed to protect privacy.</p><p>Like authentication, to be effective at the complexity scale of the Internet, a peer-to-peer mechanism to define the meaning of data has to supplement available standards. This requirement is the motivation behind the decentralised semantics domain. As a result, we elevate privacy protection to the governance of information. In other words, securing privacy requires more than data protection regulation. It requires adherence to the complete existing legal framework of an ecosystem. </p> 3. The ambition: valuing information usage, not data itself. <p>In conclusion, to address the challenges of inclusiveness and privacy, the journey starts by solving thorny technological questions in the domains of authentication and semantics. Then, digital communication channels and the fantastic potential of digital technologies to enrich information can be included case-by-case in the existing trust frameworks (legal, ethical, cultural). This is our roadmap towards accurate information for decision-making.</p><p>Once reached, our ambition loops back to the origins of the foundation as captured by Robert Mitwicki as co-founder:</p><blockquote><p> "Data has value when it flows. It is costly when it stagnates"</p><p>Robert Mitwicki, Head of the Technology Council of the Human Colossus Foundation</p></blockquote><p>To receive updates about the Foundation and DDE v1.0, subscribe to the Foundation’s mailing list <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kRop_rIejjA22GecV--GTbKxwQLF5JVP/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

  <p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based independent non-profit organisation, announces the release of its eagerly-awaited Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) v1.0 architecture, describing the core concepts and technologies to enable a next-generation data-agile economy. Two years following its conception, the Foundation published today DDE v1.0, which includes the Principles and a Trust Infrastructure Stack as well as a rollout plan for a related suite of components: Overlays Capture Architecture, Trusted Digital Assistant, Data Governance Administration. In addition, a DDE Founding Donors’ Programme launch accompanies the release, offering exclusive opportunities for organisations to become the earliest DDE v1.0 contributors and experts by engaging in the next stage of development.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired by the three co-founders' aspiration for secured, authentic data management in an increasingly digitised world, the Foundation coined the term "Dynamic Data Economy", the "DDE". With an overarching vision to empower people and organisations, the DDE enables better-informed decisions based on insights from harmonised, accurate data framed by sound data governance. It has developed an ambient cryptographic infrastructure to underpin ecosystems dealing with harmonised data within distributed governance, a paradigm shift in human-centric digital interaction, free from existing, platform-centric economic models. Further development of the DDE continues to bridge existing data standards and legacy infrastructure whilst preserving nuanced jurisdictional and human distinctions and differences in the digital space. Since its formation in 2020, the Foundation has received multiple rounds of government and private funding to develop this groundbreaking next-generation infrastructure. The release of DDE v1.0 marks the Foundation's readiness for broader collaborative stakeholders and community engagement.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“The DDE v1.0 conceptual models, methodologies, and technological infrastructure provide a realistic solution for digital transformation across distributed data ecosystems. It is about returning to the roots of how humans interact online, arming individuals and businesses with the conceptual knowledge to understand the technical design limitations of the current Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last two years, our team has contributed to open standard and open source development of the new Internet at various community forums and summarised our learning and insights into critical blog posts and webinars. It has become clear to us that we developed wrong habits in the digital space, letting technology take over our agency for authentication and privacy. We would never allow this in our physical world; nor should we have done so for the digital one. It is time for real DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, one that can create a more sustainable, scalable, and human-friendly Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>We released DDE v1.0 today to help you start seeing what we see through the DDE vision and its short-term development roadmap. We also want to invite you to participate in our journey to develop DDE further and use it to solve our collective problems. Are you ready?”</p><p>Dr. Philippe Page, Chair of the Board of Trustees</p></blockquote><p><br>DDE Principles</p>

The DDE Principles describe the essential building blocks of any information system, leading to a trust infrastructure that preserves the structural, definitional, and contextual integrity (DDE Principle 1) of any object and their relationships in the Semantic domain, the factual authenticity (DDE Principle 2) of any recorded event in the Inputs domain, and the consensual veracity (DDE Principle 3) of any purpose-driven policy or notice in the Governance domain. As a result, actors in DDE ecosystems will ultimately have the transactional sovereignty (DDE Principle 4) to share accurate information bilaterally in the fourth domain, the Economic domain.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack&nbsp;</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>To better define and describe what contributes most notably to creating a cross-sectoral trust infrastructure for access and use of data according to the DDE principles, the Foundation developed the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack</a> that presents "Infrastructure" versus "Security" incrementally through the core data domains (see figure below). Deployed implementations that align with the Stack will positively affect the relationship between DDE actors and incentivise them to share horizontal data across sectors and jurisdictions. The cryptographic assurance of verifiable digital primitives and the human accountability facilitated by socio-economic data governance administrations and framework empowered by the Stack is pivotal for innovation in analytics, artificial intelligence, or other data-driven applications.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>DDE v1.0 Rollout Plan</p><p>As part of the DDE v1.0 release this year, the Foundation will launch three foundational DDE tools, which include:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a standardised global solution for data capture and exchange which protects sensitive data, providing a positive alternative to current architectures;</p>  <p>Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA), a key DDE software interface component that provides a way to look at and interact with information in distributed data ecosystems; and&nbsp;</p>  <p>Data Governance Administration (DGA), a suite of governance methodologies for distributed data ecosystems.</p>  <p>To build a community of DDE developers and advocates, the Foundation will organise community events to facilitate learning and dialogue, launching the Colossi Network later in 2022 as an open forum for more structured community collaboration and contribution.</p>

<p>The OriginTrail ecosystem is a two-layer system, driving its two symbiotic networks by their respective crypto tokens — the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (hosting the multichain OriginTrail DKG, as indicated<a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper?section=origintrail-technology-stack"> in the whitepaper</a>) driven by its utility token TRAC, and the underlying blockchains with their respective native tokens used for transactions.</p><p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Network utility enabled by the TRAC token therefore requires each of the respective blockchains to support the TRAC token according to the TRAC tokenomics design, and requires necessary bridge infrastructure between relevant chains. TRAC being an ERC20 token on Ethereum has been so far successfully bridged to two blockchains — Gnosis chain (formerly xDAI) and Polygon with their respective bridge infrastructure.</p><p>With the launch of the dedicated OriginTrail blockchain on Polkadot — the OriginTrail Parachain — the required bridge infrastructure needs to be created to facilitate the OriginTrail DKG operation on this new chain. Moreover, the same infrastructure will enable further network effects for TRAC on all of Polkadot emerging parachain infrastructure and solutions, such as Acala and its DeFi stack (DEX, aUSD stablecoin, etc).</p><p>The purpose of this document is to outline the technical approach to bridging the TRAC token to Polkadot via the OriginTrail Parachain and collect relevant feedback from the OriginTrail community.</p> Bridging TRAC to OriginTrail Parachain and&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Polkadot is a network designed to enable high interoperability between blockchains and inter-blockchain trustless operations, such as bridging Polkadot based tokens on connected blockchains. As a multi blockchain network of parachains connected via the common Layer 0 Polkadot Relay Chain, bridging tokens is enabled by the powerful <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain">cross chain messaging format XCM</a>. Using these inherent functionalities of Polkadot therefore solves the “bridging problem” within the entire Polkadot ecosystem — once the TRAC token is available on the OriginTrail Parachain, making it available to other parachains is a non-issue.</p><p>When it comes to external blockchains such as Ethereum however, there are a multitude of bridging approaches evolving in parallel. Two of the most promising approaches at the moment of writing this RFC&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://snowbridge.snowfork.com/">Snowbridge</a>, a general purpose trustless bridge in development by the Snowfork team, yet to be launched,  <a href="https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io/">Chainbridge</a>, an EVM to Substrate bridge already available and in utilization by parachains such as Moonbeam and Centrifuge.  <p>As development progresses, we can naturally expect new and improved bridging solutions in the years to come. Therefore, bridging of TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain will, over time, most likely involve a multitude of different bridges and related infrastructure as the Polkadot ecosystem evolves. It is therefore essential to plan for this eventuality from the start and thus enable the bridge infrastructure evolution to be “inherited” by the TRAC bridges on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>It is important to note that TRAC token will stay an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and will be implemented as a bridgeable asset on the OriginTrail Parachain, which operates with its native token&nbsp;OTP.</p> Near term bridging approach — Chainbridge <p>Out of the two approaches outlined above, the core developers of OriginTrail propose the implementation of the Chainbridge bridge system for the first TRAC bridge between Ethereum and OriginTrail Parachain. Chainbridge is a battle tested, two way bridge, used by several teams within the Polkadot ecosystem to move assets to parachains.</p><p>Chainbridge implements a bridge smart contract on the Ethereum side (similar to Gnosis and Polygon bridges), with a respective pallet enabled on the OriginTrail Parachain. Tokens are transferred between the Ethereum bridge contract and the parachain via a set of relayers which listen for bridging events on both blockchains and executing the necessary transfers on the blockchain on the “other side” of the bridge, as illustrated below.</p><p>The bridged TRAC token will be implemented as a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-assets">parachain asset </a>on the OriginTrail Parachain and further bridged to the EVM&nbsp;pallet.</p><p>The Chainbridge implementation has been significantly researched by the OriginTrail core developers and progressed in implementation together with assistance from the Parity development team. To our knowledge and experience it is the most mature and tested system within the ecosystem and is the proposed solution for the near&nbsp;term.</p><p>However, as most existing bridges (such as Gnosis and Polygon bridges) its trust model can be improved, as explained in the <a href="https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io/">Chainbridge docs</a>:</p><p>“In its current state ChainBridge operates under a trusted federation model. Deposit events on one chain are detected by a trusted set of off-chain relayers who await finality, submit events to the other chain and vote on submissions to reach acceptance triggering the appropriate handler. Research is currently underway to reduce the levels of trust required and move toward a fully trust-less bridge.”</p><p>Therefore a key component of this proposal is to avoid “bridge lock-in” and enable further development of the OriginTrail bridging infrastructure to involve more trust-minimized solutions (such as Snowfork when&nbsp;ready).</p><p>The initial set of bridge relayers will be run by OriginTrail core developers, with an ambition to include additional relayers from the ecosystem in the near&nbsp;future.</p> Long term approach — multiple&nbsp;bridges <p>We expect a multitude of improvements as bridging infrastructure evolves to support more than one bridge on the OriginTrail Parachain. These will most likely include improvements in security models (trustless bridges), efficiency and user experience. It’s important to note however that having multiple bridge systems bridging the same asset effectively creates multiple “mirror versions” of the same asset on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>To enable a sustainable, long term evolution of the bridging infrastructure therefore 3 key considerations need to be applied from the&nbsp;start:</p>  Ensuring equivalence of bridged TRAC tokens as they might need to be implemented as “different” assets on the OriginTrail Parachain — for example, a TRAC token bridged via Chainbridge and a TRAC token bridged via Snowfork might be two “mirror version” assets on the parachain, with essentially the same value (1 TRAC). Equivalence would involve enabling OriginTrail DKG and other systems utilizing TRAC to register all TRAC mirror versions on the Parachain as the same (equivalent).  Appropriate mirror asset naming should be applied to avoid confusion, especially as these assets move across the Polkadot ecosystem.  “Phase out” capability for mirror assets in case of potential bridge issues (such as a major flaw being discovered), which would enable a safe decommission of potentially problematic bridges, ensuring TRAC tokenomics preservation.  <p>Having these points in place while implementing the first bridge is important and already taken into consideration by the core development team.</p> Conclusion <p>This document outlines the near and long term approach of enabling the utilization of TRAC token in the Polkadot ecosystem via the OriginTrail Parachain token.

<p>Part 2 of this 2-part series explains the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">did:pkh</a>/<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md#simple-summary">CACAO</a> variation for Verite data models and flows, which provides an entry path for wallets that may not support sufficient functionality for emerging decentralized identity patterns</p><p>Since some wallets may not themselves be willing to embed protocol-specific logic (interaction with verifiers) or more general verifiable-credential logic, we have to find a kind of "minimum viable" level of support for today’s non-DID-enabled crypto wallets. While handling DIDs and signing Verifiable Presentations brings a kind of secure indirection that enables portability and multi-chain wallets, these properties are not strictly essential to the core functionality of Verite. For this reason, we define a crypto wallet that can receive and pass to dApps a Verifiable Credential issued against its blockchain address adequate, with a few adjustments and supplements.</p> Phase 0: Issuance Directly to Crypto Wallet<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In a crypto-wallet centric end-to-end flow, the trust model is different and the interplay between credential wallet and crypto wallet can be greatly simplified. The credentials themselves must also be slightly different– instead of obtaining the credential subject DID directly from the wallet to which they are being issued, the issuer will use a credential subject identifier based on a specific blockchain address controlled by that wallet. Using DID terminology, rather than attest to the controller of a wallet, it attests only to a specific address controlled by that wallet.</p><p>This greatly simplifies the ownership question, by relying on native mechanisms for proving ownership of the address– at the time of issuance, as well as at time of verification of the credentials.</p> Two Options of Expressing a Blockchain address as a DID (and as a VC subject)<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Instead of defining the subject of the VC as a chain-agnostic DID provided by the wallet, the issuer will deterministically generate a DID from the blockchain address controlled by the connected wallet. Multiple DID methods allow this possibility; we’ll describe two of them, assuming a wallet with an Ethereum address (referred to as <code>ETH_ADDRESS</code>).</p>  did:key method - issue against a crypto wallet’s public key: If the issuer has the wallet address <code>ETH_ADDRESS</code> and any signature over a known message, the corresponding public key can be recovered using the <code>ecrecover</code> mechanism ported over from Bitcoin in the early days of Ethereum. In this way. the issuer can deterministically obtain a<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/"> did:key</a> DID that will be used as the value of <code>credentialSubject.id</code>. This is the method Circle will begin with, for ease of implementation by participants.  In this case, the mapping is:<code> did:key:&lt;ecrecover(ETH_ADDRESS, signature)&gt;</code>  For blockchains that do not use a Bitcoin-style pay2hash address system, like Solana and Polkadot, no recovery from a signature is necessary because the base form of the address is already a public key supported by <code><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase">multibase</a> </code>and thus by <code><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/#introduction">did:key</a></code>.    did:pkh method - issue against a crypto wallet’s public address: Other DID methods, like [did:pkh](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md), allow DIDs to be defined directly based on blockchain addresses in their commonly-used, public-facing forms. Long term, this is the preferred method. Among other advantages, the implementation across chains is more apparent. - In this case, the mapping is: <code>did:pkh:eip155:1:&lt;ETH_ADDRESS&gt;</code>. eip155 here refers to the EVM namespace (defined in EIP155), while 1 refers to the ethereum mainnet according to EIP155. - Just as the did:key URI scheme relies on the <code>[multibase](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase)</code> registry, so does the did:pkh URI scheme rely on the ChainAgnostic Standards Alliance’s [namespace registry](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/namespaces) to add non-EVM namespaces. - In cases where human-readability is important, end-users can introspect the VC and see their familiar address, as opposed to a public key that in pay2hash systems like BTC or ETH, they might never have seen or know they control   Sign-In With Ethereum and dApp-native Identity<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Wallets that have not incorporated decentralized identity capabilities rarely support JWT _signing _features, or other token mechanics that are common to the traditional web2 identity world. For this reason, many web3 sites and dApps have started using the wallet connection pattern to create a more feature-rich and auditable session mechanism via offchain message signing (i.e. <code>personal_sign</code> on EVM systems). Equivalents for other blockchain ecosystems, such as Solana, are forthcoming.</p><p>In the case of issuance, this signature is enough to extract the crypto wallet’s public key, as mentioned above. Importantly, though, it also enables delegated keys to sign offchain events without another onerous or fraught wallet-interaction, as we will see below.</p> Phase 1: Off-chain Verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a>  Variant: Crypto-Wallet only with only VC storage capabilities<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>At verification time, when a wallet "connects” to a dApp by providing an off-chain signature over a structured <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/5e9b0fe0728e160f56dd1e4cbf7dc0a0b1772f82/EIPS/eip-4361.md#informal-message-template">authentication message</a>, the dApp will have the wallet’s address (and live proof-of-control, if the authentication message included a secure nonce) so it can simply compare this address with the corresponding DID:PKH <code>credentialSubject.id</code> of the VC. This way, the verifier will not need to do an ownership check on the VC, and the dApp can trust the verifier to have received credentials from the right wallet because it, too, will require a wallet connection and prove ownership of the same wallet.</p><p>Without necessarily even having to parse, validity-check, or introspect the verifiable credentials, any wallet that can store them (whether as JWTs or even as raw text files) can submit them directly to verifiers, as shown below.</p><p></p><p>Note: while it is recommended that crypto wallets parse verifiable credentials and check their validity or safety, crypto wallets could in theory allow blind passthrough if the user can assume the responsibility for their contents. In the Verite case, there are little security concerns or abuses possible.</p><p>By itself, however, this bare VC is inferior to a VP from a full-featured decentralized-identity wallet, since it does not contain a non-repudiable off-chain wallet signature for auditing purposes. Or, to put it another way, it is only as trustworthy as the authentication of the wallet that sent it to you, and there is little standardization of the receipts you keep of crypto-wallet authentication to replay it for a future auditor or security review.</p><p>While the corner cases of impersonation or exfiltrated VCs might be vanishingly rare, the "audit trail” of a bare VC is weaker than a VC wrapped in a timestamped signature. For this reason, we encourage Verite dApps to create a functional equivalent to a verifiable presentation in the form of a signed presentation receipt (signed with a session-specific ephemeral key) for logging purposes. To accomplish this, we return to the Sign-In With Ethereum pattern to elaborate on its key delegation feature.</p> Sign-In With Ethereum Flow<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>As mentioned above, we support the emerging standard approach of the "Sign-In With Ethereum” mechanism which defines a sign-in message that includes a domain-binding anchor, an ephemeral session key, and other caveats. While the ephemeral session key property was not essential to the issuance wallet connection, it can be useful in the verification situation for more trustless (and auditable) logging.</p><p>By generating an ephemeral key and including it in the initial wallet-connection message for the crypto wallet to sign over upon authenticating itself to the dApp, the wallet effectively "delegates” that ephemeral key for the duration of the session. In UX terms, this saves the user from a distinct off-chain wallet signature at each confirmation or consent event. Carefully defining the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#message-field-descriptions">other properties</a> of the SIWE message, dApps can secure and constrain that delegation, link to an applicable terms-of-service agreement, enable DNS-based domain-checks analogous to the "lock symbol” in modern browsers, etc.</p><p>Once the user has "connected” their wallet by signing this SIWE message, a CACAO is generated as a receipt of that session (and of the delegation of signing rights to the key). This allows the dApp to use smoother UX than requiring a full off-chain wallet signature to confirm each consent event or internal transaction (such as the presentation of VCs in a signed VP). But it also provides a compact and tamperproof way of encapsulating each event or internal transaction as a time-stamped and signed object for logging purposes– this makes each event as verifiable as an off-chain (or on-chain) signature, via the indirection of the delegated key.</p> Ownership Verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>You could say that the crypto wallet delegates the encapsulation and signature of a VP to the dApp, which creates a short-lived key with which to sign the VP, which is a kind of standardized logging object for a presentation event. This allows the verifier to confirm that the dApp is interacting on behalf of the wallet. Since the Verifier has confirmed control of the wallet address with a SIWE message, and the VC is issued to the address directly, there is no ownership verification needed as with a decentralized wallet; thanks to the CACAO, future auditors can replay these interactions and re-check signatures and tamper-proof objects to confirm all of these transactions trustlessly.</p> Detailed Flow<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p></p>  Wallet initiates DeFi transaction with dApp.  dApp generates a session-specific ephemeral signing key and encoded it in the SIWE message for the wallet to sign. This generated session key will delegate the wallet for future signings, once after wallet vouches it (by signing the CACAO).  Once the wallet has signed it and returned it to the dApp, the signature and message are encoded into a compact <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md">CACAO</a> session receipt for logging and forensic purposes (if needed).  Next the dApp lets the verifier know about the session, by POSTing the receipt to an endpoint (eg. <a href="https://github.com/centrehq/verite-minter-allowlist/blob/main/backend/src/index.js#L136">signIn</a>). The signed receipt also includes <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md#test-cases">caveats</a>, a domain-binding, an expiration, and other constraints to secure the delegation and the transfer of the session parameters.  The verifier saves the CACAO. The verifier only uses this CACAO in the scope of this verification session (to prove the VP signed by the ephemeral key). Once the CACAO verification step is completed, the session object will be updated.  Instead of sending the wallet to verify directly with the verifier (as in the previous post), the wallet will submit the VC directly to the dapp (or an agent/service it trusts). The dApp presents the prompt to verify.  Wallet submits the bare VC.  Subsequent requests from the dApp will include a reference to the session which the verifier can use if they need to check signatures made by that key. The VC(s) submitted by the dApp in this case will not be signed in a VP with the wallet’s key; instead, it/they will be put into a VP and signed by the dApp using the ephemeral key (the signing key mentioned in the first step above) delegated to it by the SIWE message. Introspection into the CACAO is required to extract the public key that signed the VP, as well as a signature from the wallet key over the public key.  When all the information is submitted to the verifier, the verifier needs to examine the ownership of the credential:  Extract the public key of the session signing key from the resources section of the CACAO  Use the public key of the session signing key to validate the VP’s signature. This is to ensure that the dApp properly (which held the key and got user consent to delegate signing rights to it) signed the VP and that it has not been tampered with in transport.  Compare <code>iss</code> in CACAO with the wallet’s DID in VC (in this case a did:pkh representing the wallet address as a long URI). They should match, if the dApp’s SIWE message. conforms to the SIWE specification. This is to check the wallet which vouched the session key is the subject (and holder) of the VC, which is also connected to the dApp with a signature over a nonce, included in the CACAO to keep future auditors from having to trust the verifier.     Conclusion:<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Circle’s implementation of the Verite protocol allows us to serve our customers and the dApps they interact with equally, putting the rigor of our KYC processes at the service of a process that is auditable and verifiable end-to-end without duplicating KYC process or PII from those processes across the chain of asset custody. We are proud to be driving the Verite process, and welcome more implementations, whether end-to-end issuer+verifier solutions like ours or more focused implementations that bring more wallets and more users into the ecosystem.</p><p>As the Centre team updates its documentation and sample implementation to reflect the new patterns and flows, we will continue to work with them to share the insights we are gaining from our exploratory work with dApps and clients.</p>

  DIDComm v2 has now reached DIF Approved Status, joining SideTree as a complete and approved open-source specification.

<p>Following the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec-2/">approval of the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) Core Spec</a> by the W3C as an official open web standard, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation </a>(DIF) announced the approval of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm v2 specification</a>. Combined, this represents a major step forward in the acceptance of decentralized identity, one that opens the path to widespread adoption and further development especially with regard to the types of peer-to-peer communication now possible.</p>
<p>DIDComm, short for Decentralized Identifier Communication, is a communications methodology that works with the decentralized design of DIDs to provide private, secure interaction. "Methodology" is used rather than method because it describes more than just a mechanism for individual or sequential messages. DIDComm defines how messages are composed into application-level protocols and workflows. Just as DIDs are a foundational element of decentralized identity by providing non-revocable identifiers, DIDComm provides secure communication between parties based on the service endpoints and keys present in a DID Document.</p>
<p>DIDComm provides the next step in decentralized identity: direct, secure communication between the owners of DIDs. Currently, APIs are the norm for communicating with online services; however, APIs favor those with the ability to provide highly-available online services; they are ill-suited to peer-to-peer cases where the endpoints are not highly available and the infrastructure costs must be low. In contrast, DIDComm enables peer-to-peer interaction with computers, phones, and even IoT devices.</p>
<p>The protocol derives its security properties independently of the transport being used. The privacy and security guarantees are the same whether using HTTPS, or websockets, or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transport.</p>
<p>By removing architectural barriers, DIDComm-based protocols return individuals and small companies to first-class citizen status on the Internet, a state largely lost via the expansion of large social media platforms and the rise of APIs as a primary integration method.</p>
<p>Version 1 of DIDComm started in the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">HyperlLedger Aries project</a> and resulted in full community adoption. Version 2 of DIDComm (also called DIDComm Messaging) began at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) as parties outside the HL Aries community became interested in and started working collaboratively on the protocol. The [DIF DIDComm working group]((<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html</a>) is responsible for the numerous improvements and simplifications that now form DIDComm v2.</p>
<p>DIDComm v2 has now reached DIF Approved Status, joining <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1/">SideTree spec</a> as a complete and approved open-source specification. DIDComm v2 is now ready for development, with planned adoption by the HyperLedger Aries community. The DIDComm spec and "What's New in DIDComm v2" section links are below, along with some explainer videos to help those wishing to understand more.</p>
<p>While the initial spec work may be done, there are plenty of ways to get involved with the ongoing work of the DIDComm community. The <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Sdw8swxpDJ">DIDComm Users Group</a> is open to all, and a great place to get started with using DIDComm and asking questions: Join the conversation on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Sdw8swxpDJ">Discord</a>. This group is working on the creation of the "DIDComm Book," which is available in a live version here: <a href="https://didcomm.org/book/v2/">https://didcomm.org/book/v2/</a></p>

<p>There has been much hype about the Metaverse, a vision for our digital future that's increasingly merging with Web3's. For this article, let's sidestep attempts by Facebook, ahem Meta, or NFT tribes to stake their claim to the Metaverse. We think of the Metaverse as the entirety of all composable and interoperable resources, identities, applications, platforms, services, and protocols that exist in cyberspace.</p><p>Our vision of the Metaverse will run on the Dataverse: a composable, web-scale data ecosystem—owned by everyone and no one. Developers will build interchangeable interfaces and online experiences that directly interact with the Dataverse and the composable data that lives there. The Dataverse will play arguably the most important role within the Metaverse: a shared, high-performance, always-available graph of all data created and used by all applications</p><p>Most features on the web are just data rather than monetary value transactions. For example, the DeFiverse would refer to the universe of interoperable financial protocols, assets, and applications; but, just think about the applications you use on a daily basis. How many times do you click, ‘send’, or ‘like’ compared to ‘buy’ or ‘transfer’? In the Dataverse, your data follows you around from app to app, putting you at the center and in control of your own digital universe.</p><p>Over the next five years we will see a massive explosion in the developer market and a full integration of permissionless protocols into the mainstream development stack, giving rise to a billion networked applications that run and interoperate on shared, composable backend infrastructures. That’s an app for every 10 people on the planet.</p><p>We’d like to take you on a tour of the Dataverse—how we navigate from the data silos of today’s Web2 apps and the data desert of today’s Web3 apps—to a future where everyone in the world is building applications and they’re all doing it on the same networked, composable data layer.</p> The Golden Era for Application Development <p>The route to that interoperable Metaverse depends on enabling developers. The next five years will be the golden age of application development.</p> Everyone’s an App ‘Developer’ <p>Application development is going to become so accessible that five years from now it will be possible for anyone in the world, regardless of location, technical ability or education level, to build and launch an application on the internet. Basically everyone will be able to be a “developer.” For example, even a non-technical journalism student will be able to launch a fully-featured, crowd-sourced intelligence forum in a few hours.</p> Bye, bye, backend. <p>The trend of everything-as-a-service will have abstracted much or all of the backend application development logic away, allowing front-end developers to launch zero-infrastructure applications. These infrastructures could be provided by either decentralized networks or managed service providers.</p> Open, Shared Platforms <p>By this time, decentralized permissionless networks will be widely adopted by the mid- and long-tail of application developers, with some forward-leaning Web2 companies joining in on the fun as well. The primary benefit of building on these platforms is that, in addition to providing zero-infrastructure deployments, it makes cooperation and interoperability within the Metaverse feasible. This solves a lot of traditional application development challenges including centralized platform risk (read: Twitter shutters API, Facebook shuts game developers out of its platform), onboarding new users, bootstrapping content, building network effects, creating delightful user experiences, etc.</p> Copy/Paste Frontend <p>There are two primary trends driving the minimization of front-end development. First, low/no code solutions are doing a good job of making it easy for non-technical folk to create an app. Second, by nature of building on open platforms and users desiring increased transparency, more application code is getting open sourced than ever before at an accelerating rate. Combined with zero-infrastructure backends this means that basically every application is available to be inspected in its entirety, sampled, forked, cloned, remixed, modified, and redeployed. Creating applications becomes so easy that it looks more like copy/pasting others’ front-end code or dropping modular pieces that work together onto a canvas.</p> Global Access, Equal Opportunity <p>Connectivity will have improved around the world through the rollout of satellite-based over-the-top 3G+ internet delivery, causing a new generation of developers to come online for the first time. This connects more people over cyberspace, and gives the inclined more incentive to create something in a global market. The web will be filled with free educational material—all it will take is a little curiosity and initiative.</p> Powerful Incentives and Direct Rewards <p>Given two ways of building the same thing, all else equal, people would want to work on the one with the most upside. Web3 provides powerful native participation and builder incentives that are compelling and directly accessible to developers of all backgrounds. Large tech companies will struggle to compete for talent, as the upside potential of going from 0 to 1 on your own (or joining a Web3 rocketship) will far outweigh the draw for working at a company like Amazon. The Metaverse as a whole will outcompete for talent.</p> Power to the People <p>The organizing principle of the Metaverse will be the individual. When developers build on this shared application architecture, because it is better for their application (user-centric composability), it coincidentally unlocks a new world for end-users where they can reclaim control over their digital identity and begin to experience the web as if every application was built specifically for them and their data was magically everywhere they wanted it to be.</p> Self Agency and Determinism <p>In the Metaverse, individuals have a choice. Based on foundations of public key cryptography, users in the Metaverse begin their life—no permission needed—as a simple, self-sovereign, pseudonymous keypair. From there, they can decide who they want to be. They can allow someone else to control their identity for them. They can be their own bank and take self-custody. They can begin to attach as much or as little data as they want. They can set permissions for who can do what with their data under which conditions. This level of digital ownership and self-agency is how the Metaverse can stay independent and remain secure.</p><p>But self-sovereignty doesn’t stop at an account. Users will also have trusted independent infrastructure for keeping their data around for the long-term so they never have to rely on someone else.</p> The Magic of Interoperability <p>If one of the primary draws to building in the Metaverse is interoperability, then applications are naturally incentivized to adopt the minimum foundational standards needed to enable this interoperability. The easiest and most intuitive way for interoperability to be achieved is through adopting a user-centric architecture. In this model, the user acts as the nexus of data interoperability between different applications; wherever they go, so does their data.</p><p>For end users, the experience of interoperability feels magical—like how the internet should work. No more passwords, forms, verifications, reposting content, refollowing the same person across platforms.</p> An explosion of Knowledge, Science, and Human Progress <p>As a public resource, the Dataverse will enable an explosion of shared knowledge and accelerate science and human progress. The original use case for Internet 1.0 was sharing scientific databases between California and Massachusetts. Web 3.0 is going to take that idea and supercharge it.</p><p>Until now, semantic web and linked data implementations, which are good for information graphs, have really only been deployed in production within the internal systems of the largest companies and institutions in the world such as Google. They’re hard to build and require many of the brightest minds.</p><p>The Dataverse will provide simple, open access to a graph of semantically-defined, structured data that takes the most cutting edge research and allows everyone to build and collaborate on it. While the implications of the progress that can be made when we can connect the entire scientific community on one unified verifiable data platform cannot be overstated, we don’t need to go into unnecessary forward-looking predictions on what that might ultimately look like.</p> The Creativity of a Billion Networked Applications <p>What can be known is the diversity, creativity, ingenuity, and innovation that will be unleashed when everyone in the world is building applications and they’re all doing it on the same networked, composable data layer—let’s refer to this network that supports the Dataverse as a platform.</p><p>As more developers are joining the platform, and more data exists on the platform, it will become even easier for developers to create applications. The startup costs drop to near zero. This allows for a diversity of implementations and experiments that add resilience and allow Darwinism to chart the path forward. It allows developers to hack scalable microapplications together in a few minutes and focus on product-market fit instead of taking weeks to ship a hacky monolith. It provides a new vector to allow everyone-but-Facebook-or-Google to compete with Facebook and Google. The pace and ingenuity of the bazaar, in this case, will outpace the cathedrals.</p> Big Bets <p>A few trends that define the Dataverse and the future of the web.</p> Web3 Applications Explode With Data Functionality <p>The Web3 developer market, containing collaborative groups of value-aligned innovators/early adopters (some of which are already building in other parts of the Metaverse), will be first to adopt the Dataverse. To date, Web3 applications have been data deserts. This makes sense, as there’s only so much data functionality you can build with smart contracts.</p><p>This trend is changing and will continue at an accelerating rate as the market becomes more crowded/mature and applications look for new vistas for innovation. As the market demand picks up for building data features and applications begin cooperating over large data sets, the network effects of the Dataverse will quickly accelerate and the Web3 application market will be flush with data-powered features. Others beyond this market will notice the ecosystem and be compelled to join it.</p> Interoperable Ecosystems Will Outcompete Siloed Platforms <p>The perfect cocktail is brewing for the Metaverse to outcompete even the largest, most entrenched institutions. No one will want to build their own application on an island anymore or for big companies. The simplicity, creativity, pace of innovation, speed of development, open data, and rewards that are available in the Metaverse will be too strong. The incumbents who have already built their business on an entirely different incentive structure will find it tough to pivot or compete.</p> Identity Emerges From Needs of Communities and is the Organizing Principle of the Dataverse <p>Identity is inherently multiplayer. This is true not only in the physical world, where it began as a construct enabling human-to-human interactions, but also in the digital world where it’s more important to have a profile on a social media application than it is to have on your personal note-taking application. Identity is a tool for providing context, trust, and efficiency to transactions. By providing an inherently multi-player data ecosystem, Ceramic is a platform that we can expect to generate a widely-adopted identity system that can serve to provide greater interoperability to the Metaverse.</p> The Effectiveness and Sustainability of Digital Communities <p>Less technical and more sustainability related, we’re betting on the fact that strangers on the internet, unified by a community-owned protocol and its inherent incentives, can effectively organize and create high-impact work with high efficiency. Although this trend has positive indications, it still stands to be seen if these communities can sustain themselves over the long term or if they can stay innovative and keep speed high. The design and implementation of effective digital communities is something we’re keeping a close eye on, but we also believe that a lot of what will make communities successful over the long term has yet to be discovered.</p><p>Some people have gone full degen into “working for the internet” as a contributor to protocols and DAOs, picking up one-off tasks or engaging in longer contracts. We already have participants in DAOs lobbying in front of congress. DAOs are legally recognized meatspace entities in Wyoming. Digital communities have long been used for OSINT (open-source intelligence), where groups of highly-motivated strangers come together on topic-based platforms such as subreddits or Facebook groups to do things that any single person (or government agency) couldn’t—such as crowdsourcing villains or solving investigations. Wikipedia runs beautifully. These are all things that make me optimistic about how this fluid work and incentive system will evolve over time.</p><p>There are positive indications that these communities are beginning to cross the chasm into mainstream, which only deepens their tentacles into society making them more resilient. Bored Ape Yacht Club basically has every celebrity with an ape as their Twitter profile picture; Alexis Ohanian and Serena Williams wore pins of their CryptoPunks to the Met Gala. These digital-first communities will spill into every aspect of society with influencers and celebrities sporting their flair and representing their tribe.</p><p>To get a sense of where Web3 (as opposed to NFTs) will cross into mainstream culture, we should look at where there exist networks of highly-engaged, multiplayer user bases/communities, what it means to be a member of that community, and how people fly their flag.</p> Ceramic: Decentralized Infrastructure for Building on the Dataverse <p>Although the market may be primed for the Dataverse, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will emerge organically. The best developer platform for building applications in the Dataverse requires a few key design considerations.</p> General-Purpose Data Protocol <p>Data is highly varied, and developers need freedom and flexibility to build their applications and data use cases. Rigid standards won't work, or will lead to fragmentation. We need a highly-generalized protocol that is capable of supporting the diversity of use cases that will emerge from the Dataverse. It’s important that all these use cases seamlessly interact and the easiest way is to have them building on the same protocols. It shouldn’t matter which wallet users log in with or what feature you’re building on the front end or what type of data you want to store; it should all just work.</p> Fast, Decentralized, High-Volume Processing <p>This general purpose data protocol needs to support mutability with fast, decentralized, high-volume transaction processing simply for the fact that there are so many data events occurring all day, every day, in every application. Current blockchain protocols cannot scale to support this level of processing and this is a strong area of differentiation. Data consensus properties, like Ceramic’s, can be treated differently than value consensus properties, like Bitcoin’s.</p> Globally-Consistent, Always-Available State <p>Next, it’s important that the system has a way to provide participants with a highly available state that can be trustlessly verified and reconstructed from the underlying event streams. This is critical, because it’s actually what allows developers to build permissionless, composable applications on shared data. The availability of state can be ensured by anyone who plugs into the underlying event streams, as updates are published through this system all participants can immediately update their state database.</p><p>Related to global state availability is state representation. Ceramic currently supports state outputs in the form of simple JSON objects and a native indexing system, which is good for graph-based application use cases. The protocol should be able to adapt and support different state representations based on the optimizations required by the data structures better suited to these use cases. This can be achieved by plugging into the event streaming layer of Ceramic and building custom databases on top.</p> Object-Oriented Permissions <p>Every piece of data in the Dataverse should be verifiable, secure, and useful—not spam or bits of data that clog up the network. By using a protocol for decentralized, cryptographic, object-oriented permissions, we can give decentralized identities provable agency over their data while allowing the access permissions for each state (or even nested/recursive/chained permissions to groups of states) to be completely customizable.</p><p>For example, users can grant their therapist, their school counselor, and their best friend permanent access to their diary. Or someone can give an application the ability to update a state on their behalf for the duration of a session. It can also be natively integrated with the different cryptographic authentication systems used within developers’ applications (e.g. sign in with Ethereum). It’s important that we collaborate with other Dataverse protocols and services to adopt the same permissioning standard so that we can achieve maximal interoperability. In a lot of ways, the more robust, developed, and flexible the permissions protocol is, the less important it is to tie an identity to any single key.</p><p>We should also expect a lot of innovation from the developer ecosystem in the area of permissioning writes and reads within the network. We’re already seeing experimentation along these lines with programmatic permissions protocols. Examples include hosted custodial agents or “personal data managers” or something like “credit bureaus” for managing permissions for users’ data. We should encourage all kinds of diversity, especially early on.</p> Fast, Expressive, Network-Wide Queries <p>Whenever a user logs into an application with their wallet, that application needs to gather data about that user from the Dataverse. When an application wants to fetch a single state that they already somehow know the identifier of—that’s easy. But application developers need much more data retrieval capability than fetching content using its specific machine-readable identifier.</p><p>When this application is multi-player, such as a social network, developers need to gather data sets from across users to display in one interface. This type of data retrieval functionality is core to almost any application, and is especially core to the ones that are most valuable to the data ecosystem as a whole. When the identifiers of the users are known, this can be done by looking at each user’s index of their data that exists in the Dataverse and then pulling in that data. This supposes the existence of a protocol for such a user-centric index, whether physically stored as a single list somewhere in the Dataverse, or maintained using metadata and an indexing service.</p><p>Applications, however, don’t always have the full picture about a user—a wallet address alone doesn't tell the full story. Context can be gained by looking at the broader social graph of communities where the user participated in or rankings in games.</p><p>Developers who build on Ceramic will have the ability to use indexing and querying to pull in opt-in data from users in other apps in the Ceramic ecosystem.</p><p>Ceramic will soon offer a graph database that will enable developers to explore those ties from any of their user's accounts to a stream of data, e.g. all blog posts. But in further iterations, Ceramic will allow relationships between any account, model, and data stream related to model. This will allow infinitely complex queries across the Dataverse.</p> Open Marketplace of Data Models <p>The Dataverse demands interoperability. This is achieved with emergent consensus on data models. Data models on Ceramic are similar to ERC contract standards in Ethereum—e.g. ERC20 for tokens, ERC721 for NFTs—which are basically the equivalent of features for Ceramic. This makes it easy for any developer to just choose from a pre-existing set of feature templates, add a few lines of code to their frontend, and have an app that can access all data sets in the Dataverse that also conform to the same data model.</p><p>The community can build out and curate the biggest universe of data models in the world. The most powerful way to create enough good standards for this to become a vibrant marketplace is by giving the community ownership and upside.</p> Developer Community <p>The Dataverse is owned by no one, and everyone. It’s the output of a community all working toward building creative, networked applications that result in creating a valuable resource for the world. This big project can only be successful if there is a large, engaged community behind it.</p><p>Community members can help with building out the developer tooling and stack ecosystem, growth and influencing, creating educational content, network operations, etc. We have to deliberately consider the incentives of all ecosystem participants so we can maximally deploy this community for good.</p> Path Forward <p>We will start by focusing on delivering data-rich application capabilities to advanced Web3 developers building in highly-networked application ecosystems using data models—the market and use cases most primed for Ceramic. Each phase will look to the previous for a signal on what infrastructure to use and how to build, that’s why full focus on today’s innovators is so important.</p> Unmet Needs of Web3 Developers <p>The Metaverse is emerging from the foundation paved by blockchain; it possesses all the right conditions mentioned earlier to make it a flourishing, vibrant interoperable application ecosystem. Web3 developers are already building applications on blockchain, and a lot of them are looking to differentiate and mature their product by expanding into data.</p> Reputation Features <p>Reputation features are needed across many different Web3 multi-player applications, decentralized protocols, social communities, and span everything from a profile, to assets I can prove to own (NFTs, domain names, social handles), to experience (self-asserted and attested skills trees), to contribution tracking, to KYC VCs (verifiable credentials).</p><p>Some of these use cases include VCs, many do not. Within this set, Ceramic can serve public and ephemerally private data use cases. Fully private use cases should be stored encrypted on an access-controlled server that ideally uses IPLD and CACAO so it can natively interoperate with the data on Ceramic—something like Kepler from Spruce Systems.</p><p>Over the longer term, this collection of data sets will function like one’s identity and passport within the Metaverse. The stakes are high. For example, the future of DeFi is very much in flux until reputation and credentials are figured out.</p> Social Features <p>Social is very hot now in Web3 and a lot of momentum is building around the decentralized social graph and decentralized social media. We see an expansion of the traction and experiments from Orbis, Convo, and CyberConnect, into different iterations and experimentations. These may come in the form of full-blown decentralized social networks, or social features embedded within other applications. Expect social graphs, feeds and posts (blogs, microblogs, etc), reactions, private and public groups, DMs, forums, address books.</p> Account Features <p>Many applications and protocols are asking themselves how to identify a user when they have many different wallets or accounts. This is becoming more important for Web3 applications that are integrating more and more Metaverse protocols into a single application. Maintaining that user object with all the mappings becomes cumbersome and is extremely prone to implementation error. There are a certain set of data features that can be explored for different models of creating an aggregated identity for users in the multi-account, cross-chain (MACC) Metaverse.</p> The Best Has Yet to Come <p>The best has yet to come for the internet. The Metaverse will be the biggest breakthrough in application development over the last 25 years, and it will replace the cloud as the application environment of choice.</p><p>In order to unlock the full potential of the Dataverse, there needs to be interoperability. This type of composable, interoperable data network will be the catalyst for a new wave of innovation that not only reshapes the way we build applications but also how we share knowledge, invent science, and progress as a society. This is the world we are building toward with Ceramic.</p><p>To start building with Ceramic, check out our<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-ceramic/"> guide</a> or join the<a href="https://chat.ceramic.network/"> Discord</a>!</p>

<p>We have been blessed with quite simply an extraordinary array of speakers bringing their expertise and experience from their respective backgrounds and perspectives. We have been privileged to have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rikiconsultancy.co.nz/">Janelle Riki-Waaka</a>&nbsp;Chair the conference whose deep understanding of te ao Māori and its application to digital trust is unassailable. She is supported by a diverse cross section of experts from the public and private sectors. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/minister/biography/david-clark">Hon Dr David Clark</a>&nbsp;follows the Chair’s opening remarks, and we will be listening for any insights regarding the range of legislation proposed under his watch, the most important of those to us at&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity NZ</a>&nbsp;being the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/whole.html#LMS459679">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Bill</a>&nbsp;which has entered its Second Reading.&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/speaker/tamara-al-salim/">Tamara Al Salim</a>&nbsp;from NZDF (also Women in Identity’s New Zealand&nbsp;country ambassador) is next with the Opening Keynote – Trust in the Aotearoa context – followed by two panels playing forward the Trust theme inwards to developing more domestic capability and outwards to ask the question ‘Is Trust an exportable asset?’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussion over lunch however is bound to revolve around globally acclaimed UK speaker David Birch and his take on that amorphous concept, the Metaverse and whether Identity has anything to do with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dave is joined at the event by an Australian trio of speakers each with very different perspectives. Internationally acknowledged identerati aficionado&nbsp;<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/">Steve Wilson</a>, will beam in with his view into the future as to how all the ‘infostructural’ pieces might fit together, while Gold Sponsor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.okta.com/au/">Okta’s</a>&nbsp;April George will offer practical tips for implementing Zero Trust in organisations large and small. From the public sector across the Tasman, we are looking forward to an update from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity">DTA</a>&nbsp;on the operationally more advanced but legislatively further behind Australian equivalent to New Zealand’s DISTF – the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/tdif#:~:text=Trusted%20Digital%20Identity%20Framework%20The%20Trusted%20Digital%20Identity,templates%20to%20support%20providers%20to%20meet%20TDIF%20requirements.">TDIF</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Australian showings will be more than matched by the locals. Silver Sponsor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/">NEC NZ</a>&nbsp;co-presenters Steven Graham and Graham Prentice will focus on current best practice, specifically in the field of Biometrics, followed by Lightning Rounds from Kiwi startups<a href="https://frankly.ai/">&nbsp;FranklyAI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://jnctn.nz/">JNCTN</a>, while&nbsp;<a href="https://ahau.io/">Ahau’s</a>&nbsp;Kaye-Maree Dunn will provide perspectives on the user as the key stakeholder. The finale will feature representatives from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/For-people-and-businesses">DIA</a>&nbsp;leaving us with plenty to think about over drinks regarding the role of standards as the ultimate connector in this Hui’s range of topics alongside&nbsp;DIA’s overall reflections.</p>



<p>There’s audience participation planned too. To help the digestion of lunch, an hour’s Roundtable Discussion will begin the afternoon sessions, where delegates choose two topics from a range of options and meet with like-minded individuals, moderated by a Hui speaker or panellist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All up, the Hui Tumata is set to be insightful and thought-provoking, guaranteeing that delegates come away more informed and knowledgeable.&nbsp; See you there!</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi nui,</p>

<p>Since Verite’s original release, we’ve gotten feedback from development partners and the broader community about which patterns are useful and where guidance could be improved. Some themes include:</p>  Persistence of verification results to on-chain registries is over-emphasized.  Verite’s current <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/verification-flow">verification flow documentation</a> assumes that Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are stored in wallets that support decentralized identity protocols, which are currently somewhat scarce in the market.  <p>Upcoming Verite releases (including code and documentation) will address these concerns as follows:</p>  A forthcoming editorial revision of Verite documentation will explicitly describe a variant of the subject-submission patterns without any on-chain persistence.  A coming release will include code and documentation demonstrating how more of today’s wallets can participate in VC flows in a standardized way, until DIDs become more common.  <p>In this two-part blog series, we’ll preview these updates. This post (Part 1) includes an overview of options for the use of off-chain VCs to support on-chain decision-making, including subject-submission without on-chain persistence. This begins with a summary of core concepts and principles of Verite. Readers already familiar can skip ahead to the "Two Phases of Verification" section for an overview of the new flow being added to the Verite docs and pioneered by Circle’s implementation. After this new end-to-end pattern for Verite is outlined, a more analytical "Discussion" section follows.</p><p>The second post in the series will zoom in on how wallets that do not currently support sufficient functionality for emerging decentralized identity patterns can be "retrofitted” and supplemented to support Verite’s off-chain verifications like those described in this post.</p> Verification Concepts <p>If you’re new to Verite, or want a reminder, this section describes how Verite credential verification works off-chain to support smart contracts with maximum privacy around sensitive identifying information.</p> Roles<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The following entities are involved in the Verite credential verification process:</p>  Crypto wallet: aka "payment wallet”, controls a blockchain address; may be browser or mobile, hosted or self-hosted.  Credential wallet: aka "identity wallet”, stores and shares VCs, controls a "DID” (meta-wallet identifier). Some or all of these functional roles may be subsumed into a crypto wallet or a trusted dapp, or this entity may be completely distinct software, depending on flow and trust model.  Verifier: aka the "verifier service” or "verifier endpoint” that consumes a privacy-preserving, off-chain token (a verifiable credential) on behalf of a dApp. It can be operated by the dApp or a trusted partner but in either case it needs to be previously known to and trusted by the dApp at a static address.  dApp: decides which verifiers to trust; the dApp frontend is responsible for triggering the verification process; the dApp backend is responsible for on-chain validation  On-chain verification registry (optional): depending on the implementation choices, dApps may rely on on-chain storage of verification results. This may be part of the dApp or a separate registry accessible by other parties. For simplicity, we’ll assume the former case in this blog.   Verification Result<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>A Verification Result enables a "verified” crypto wallet – that is, a wallet whose controller has proven possession of a valid VC that has passed a dApp-trusted-verifier’s verification process – to interact on-chain.</p><p>You can think of a Verification Result as the result of slicing and dicing a VC, potentially obfuscated, with an attached proof from the Verifier. The Verification Result structure in Verite’s reference implementation includes the following fields, returned along with the Verifier’s cryptographic signature:</p>  subject: identifies the wallet address  schema: indicates the kind of credential (flexible according to the implementation)  expiration: a number that is less than or equal to the expiration value in the VC.  <p>The Verification Result may be extended to include additional fields, which could be carried over identically or fuzzed/obfuscated in some way (which is especially relevant if using on-chain storage).</p>   <code>export type VerificationResult = {<br>  schema: string<br>  subject: string  // address<br>  expiration: number<br>}<br></code>      Verifier vs Subject Submission<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Verite’s implementation demonstrates two possible methods of submitting Verification Results to smart contracts; or in other words:</p>  Verifier-submitted: the verifier submits the Verification Result and signature directly to the smart contract immediately after verification.  Subject-submitted: the verifier returns the Verification Result and signature to the subject (or an entity or code acting on the subject’s behalf) who then submits the signed Verification Result to the smart contract.   Verification Principles <p>While verifications can be carried out using a variety of methods, all are expected conform to the following principles:</p>  Trusted issuer principle: the credential was issued by one of a list of trusted issuers.  Credential ownership principle: The crypto wallet that owns (i.e. can prove themselves to be the subject of) the credential is the one making the DeFi transaction request, regardless of whether the credential itself is held and presented by a separate piece of hardware (i.e. whether the credential wallet and the crypto wallet are distinct)  Trusted verifier principle: The verifier that provides verification is on the allowlist of verifiers already trusted by the dApp.  <p>The fact that all Verified Credentials are signed by their self-identifying issuers makes the first criteria simple: issuers’ public keys can be obtained from the identifiers listed in a registry of trusted issuers, and their signatures can be checked against them at verification time. In this way, the verifier enforces the trusted issuer principle.</p><p>DApps, in turn, uphold the trusted verifier principle, deciding which verifiers they trust to verify VCs – including standard VCs checks (non-revocation, tamper-free) and any other fitness-for-purpose checks (such as subsetting valid Verite credentials according to additional constraints on issuers or <a href="https://verite.id/blog/crossfunctionationality">KYC processes</a>).</p><p>Enforcement of the credential ownership principle will vary depending on how the crypto wallet relates to the credential wallet. In this post, we’ll describe how this works with a distinct decentralized identity wallet controlled by the same actor as a crypto wallet; in the next, we’ll describe how crypto-wallets-only actors may be accommodated.</p> Two Phases of Verification <p>Verite’s <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/smart-contract-verite">Smart Contract Patterns</a> documentation describes the two-phase process of how smart contracts can require successful verification of VCs. To summarize:</p>  Phase 1: "Off-chain” verification by a verifier, based on traditional web or API stacks, resulting in a lightweight "Verification Result” object.  Phase 2: On-chain validation of the Verification Result, which is optionally persisted on-chain in private, obfuscated, or opaque form referred to as a "Verification Record”.  <p></p><p>The two-phase process enables the use of VCs with chain-based applications for which verification operations are not technically possible and/or economically practical. More importantly, this reduces (by construction) the amount of potentially sensitive data sent on-chain. All examples that follow will refer to main-net Ethereum, but all these patterns should be replicable on all major chains, availing themselves of further privacy or obfuscation techniques where supported.</p><p>The subsequent sections discuss these phases and variations. This first post in the two-part series assumes a decentralized identity wallet, and the next will cover other options.</p> Phase 1: Off-chain Verification <p>Assuming a Decentralized Identity+Crypto Wallet</p><p></p>  <p>The wallet initiates a DeFi transaction with a dApp.</p>  <p>The dApp (frontend) chooses a trusted verifier to start the verification process.</p>  <p>The verifier responds to the wallet, telling it how to start the process<a>1</a> through the dApp.</p>  <p>The wallet chooses one of the credentials stored locally and submits it to the verifier.</p>  <p>The verifier confirmed the credential’s signature and the validity of its contents. The dApp retrieves (via callback or polling) confirmation.</p>  <p>DApp unlocks the subsequent DeFi transaction flow.</p>   Ownership verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In step 4, when the wallet submits the credential, the wallet wraps the VC with a Verifiable Presentation (VP) and signs it. When the verifier receives the credential, it uses the Decentralized Identifier (DID) – for example, <code>did:key:&lt;public_key&gt;</code><a>2</a> – listed as <code>holder</code> in the VP to verify the JWT’s signature (made from the corresponding private key). It also compares this DID in the VP with the DID listed as <code>credentialSubject.id</code> in the VC, i.e. the public key that the credential was issued against. Those two checks guarantee the wallet, submitting the credentials, was the same wallet that the issuer intended, and thus rightly owns it.</p> Phase 2: Validation and use in smart contracts <p>The second phase of verification covers how a Verification Result gets used as a prerequisite to on-chain interaction.</p> Validating a Verification Result<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Along with a verification result, a smart contract will receive a signature on the result, allowing them to confirm that the result was provided by an authorized party, as described <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/smart-contract-verite#verification-results">here</a>.</p> On-chain storage of Verification Results (or not)<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>We’ll look at 3 cases below. With the verifier-submitted pattern, the verifier always stores the Verification Result on-chain. With subject-submission, the Verification Result may or may not be stored on-chain, depending on the implementation.</p> Case 1: Verifier-submitted verification result, stored on-chain<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>With the verifier-submitted approach, the verifier stores the Verification Result on-chain after verification.</p><p>We’ll cover step 1.5 later; this is relevant for subsequent interactions with a dApp when on-chain storage is used.</p><p></p> Case 2: Subject-submitted verification result, stored on-chain<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The subject-submitted approach also supports persistence, as determined by the implementor. Like the verifier-submitted case, in subsequent interactions, the dApp will be able to determine that the wallet is already registered.</p><p>We’ll cover step 1.5 later; this is relevant for subsequent interactions with a dApp when on-chain storage is used.</p><p></p> Case 3: Subject-submitted verification result, off-chain<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>If the Verification Result is not persisted on-chain, then every interaction of the wallet with the contract will be associated with a fresh, unique Verification Result.</p><p></p> Subsequent interactions <p>Assuming the implementation is using on-chain storage, after the phases 1 &amp; 2 (plus on-chain storage) are completed, then on subsequent interactions, a dApp could check the registry to confirm the wallet/address is already approved, avoiding the need to re-verify the VC. The dApp backend (or registry, if separate) can simply check that <code>msg.sender</code> is in the set of registered addresses.</p><p></p><p>Without on-chain storage, in general the VC would be re-verified<a>3</a> each time (as shown in the diagram in Case 3), and the verification result submitted along with the transaction. Since verification is off-chain (and generally fast/inexpensive, depending on the provider), and since this avoids on-chain storage of potentially correlatable data, this is often the preferred solution.</p> Discussion  On-chain Storage Considerations<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The on-chain storage patterns have implications that require careful consideration:</p>  On-chain persistence of any potentially identifiable (or re-identifiable) data should be avoided. If on-chain persistence is used, it is up to the design of a particular implementation to manage that smart contract’s access rights and obfuscation mechanisms to minimize privacy risks.  The verifier-submitted pattern, in its current form, assumes the verifier’s willingness to pay transaction fees (e.g. "gas fees”, in EVM systems).  The verifier-submitted pattern includes an obligation that the verifier update the on-chain state corresponding to revoked credentials.  In general, this may not be the most cost-effective option.  <p>There are optimizations – in the Verite open source, the Verification Registry may be used among multiple contracts, and <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0xFd283fBb301f332A94969f629E1832824DEA3684/IFYyHg6OUQVj4QurIOOpVvHHBWaC1cJzdI6B4OU15WM">proposed improvements enable further reuse through proxies</a>. These are all possible for implementations; Verite’s open source repositories are intended as example implementations, and not as normative guidance.</p><p>However, we think it’s important to draw attention to off-chain options, as it has a profile of privacy characteristics we find favorable in many use-cases. This is one of the reasons we’re increasingly demonstrating this option, as seen in the <a href="https://verite.id/blog/NFT-allowlists-with-verifiable-credentials-and-verite">off-chain NFT allowlist</a>.</p> Circle’s Implementation Choices<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>It was not necessary to write the verification results to on-chain storage in Circle’s implementation. The advantages of flushing to chains include the avoidance of repeated verification for the same wallets. However, the advantages do not always outweigh the drawbacks:</p>  Short TTL is required for verification because a user's KYC status could change.  Chain writers must pay a gas fee.  <p>As a result, Circle chose and suggests other implementers also choose this approach: do not write verification results into chains unless there is a substantial efficiency gain, i.e., if many transactions will be authorized by the average on-chain write operations.</p><p>Since Circle’s architecture is optimized for delivering verification reliably and simply to dApps, we choose to explain the design choices we’ve made from the perspective of the verification process, where valid Verifiable Credentials get communicated to smart-contracts powering dApps.</p> Up Next<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In the following post, we’ll describe options for wallets that don’t understand Decentralized Identity protocols to participate in VC exchanges, while conforming to the verification principles above.</p><p>The Verite core team is grateful to Circle’s Verite engineers Tao Tao, Daniel Lim, and Fei Niu for taking the lead on this exciting work!</p>    Crucially, this includes not just the usual redirections and tokens but also an artifact called a "Presentation Submission" object which describes the credentials that a given verifier will accept. This enables wallets to “pre-select” appropriate credentials to the end-user, in the case of a full wallet.<a>↩</a>  An "onchain DID" (decentralized identifier) scheme such as did:ion can be used here if the wallet controls such an identifier– this is basically a user-controlled indirection, which allows user-initiated rotations and even migration to a new wallet. In an end-to-end system, however, this indirection is optional, because the verifier has access to the issuance records, and can simply use a public key in both places since they are opaque to any other audience.<a>↩</a>  The verite reference implementation avoids resubmission of the same verification results / signature to avoid replays<a>↩</a>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of the University of Sherbrooke?</p>



<p>As a leading research university recognized for the originality of its programs, the University of Sherbrooke is committed to working with its communities to train responsible citizens that will change the world. That is why the University of Sherbrooke has created an Interdisciplinary Research group that brings together over 14 professors committed to developing Canadian expertise in digital identity.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Identity has been central to civilization since the dawn of time. It serves to establish the structure and functioning of society. A trusted digital identity is therefore critical for existing and emerging markets because the digitization of our societies must be supported by standardization of digital identity that favours the continuum of exchanges of goods, services and information while maintaining an adequate quality of service. Thus, it now seems trivial that the protection of privacy relies as much on a sound management of personal information, including cybersecurity, as on a strict control of any secondary use of data that could be associated with our identity.</p>
 



  
<a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/"></a> 


<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digitization is pervasive in our society. It is a fundamental part of every democratic action and business transaction. With digital transformation, the reality of the market forces businesses to outdo themselves in order to offer products and services at ever-improving prices. As a result, digital identity is becoming the cornerstone of the current and future development of our organizations. This pressure is sustainable if businesses manage their means of production in an agile and sustainable way. Universities are experiencing this transformation through the accelerated renewal of their course offerings, the need to implement a digital campus, the way they reach their clientele and the acceleration of certain research. Among the challenges is the research on the trust relationship necessary for the proper functioning of digital identification.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada has caught up and is now considered a world leader in digital identity. This is fundamental because every transaction or action in a system relies on the correct identification of the third parties involved – people, organizations and objects. In addition, efficient digital identity management enables economies of scale that benefit all Canadians.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>As an academic researcher interested in digital identity, this is a key interest group, connecting key players from business, government, academia and other key stakeholders. The DIACC has an established structure and drives a lean operation with international visibility. They help make research relevant by making digital identity issues visible, including through their design, governance, operationalization, standardization, etc.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>The University of Sherbrooke’s reputation for dynamism and innovation attracts students and professors from all over the world. Its international partnerships and human, intellectual and scientific potential allow it to be an actor of global change. In 2020-2021, the University will have 31,328 students in the three cycles of higher education in eight faculties supported by 7,398 people. Do not hesitate to contact us for more information.</p>

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Daniel Bluhm, Software Engineer at <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>. </p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on and how you got into blockchain</p>



<p>I am currently working on Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent – Python and other agent implementations. I spend most of my days working on agents and protocols. I first got into blockchain at the Sovrin Foundation where I got my start as an associate software engineer. I was actually around at the founding of the agent ecosystem, back when we all collaborated in the Hyperledger Indy Agent Working Group. I was one of the first implementers and continued working with it as the community grew. Eventually it snowballed into the Hyperledger Aries project.</p>



<p>What Hyperledger frameworks or tools are you using in your projects? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>I really like where things are going with the Aries Cloud Agent – Python repo, driving towards more pluggability and making it so we can extend functionality without changing the core project itself. I am also excited to get did:indy method support into Hyperledger Indy, as well as multi-ledger support in ACA-Py.We already have reads down, so now we’re just working on the writes.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>We have a really diverse and thriving community in the Hyperledger Aries space; what we really need going into 2022 is a push for greater adoption of the technology and getting it into the hands of people who aren’t engineers. I would also really like to see a focus on encouraging more interaction with the Hyperledger Indy project, especially after seeing how positively this affects our work with Hyperledger Aries.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest piece of advice I could give is to not be afraid to step in, contribute, and break stuff. It doesn’t matter if your pull request isn’t perfect.The maintainers of the project will work with you to get it right.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s projects continue to mature, what do you see as the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result?</p>



<p>The technologies that are most interesting to me are the ones that allow us to use multiple different technologies at the same time – which is exactly what we’re striving for in Hyperledger Aries. This enables us to take advantage of the strengths of one technology – be it blockchain, communication, protocol, crypto suite, or something else – and use those strengths to shore up the places where another technology might fall short. Beyond that, anything that makes it easier and more efficient for the end user will be a huge step in the right direction.</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>The biggest problem that I would like to see blockchain solve is power imbalances. This applies across the board, to finance, representation in government, data used and collected by big orgs, and other scenarios we just haven’t thought up yet. I’d like to see blockchain enable individuals to have a say in how they are treated and be more self-deterministic – they should have at least some level of control over what’s running their lives.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I would like to see Hyperledger and blockchain technology in general in the hands of real people. They don’t necessarily need to be aware that they are using a blockchain. In fact, I think there are some really good arguments to the contrary. But it should be a positive influence in their lives as it is used day to day. I would like to see the blockchain space settle down, drop some of the hype, and just be used for what it’s good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>No one gets it right on the first try. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, break tests, crash CI/CD pipelines, or push broken code. Don’t do it intentionally, of course, but the faster you can get at shortening the “experience a failure, find the problem, implement the fix” cycle, the faster you’ll learn and master your code. In short, don’t be afraid to break stuff. Just give it a shot and learn from the result.</p>



<p>When a problem or change needs to be made in the future, the developer then can see what your thought processes were for writing the code you did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>



<p>I could not live without Git. Without it it would be nearly impossible to get any code written and submitted. It’s part of my everyday workflow and even crucial in my hobby projects.</p>

<p>Co-Chairs – Wenjing Chu of Futurewei and Vikas Malhotra of WOPLLI Technologies</p>







<p>Trust over IP foundation (<a href="http://www.trustoverip.org">www.trustoverip.org</a>) is forming a new task force on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Metaverse (AIM for short), under its Technology Stack working group. The mission of this new task force is to complete a ToIP Recommendation for the ToIP community to address opportunities and challenges brought on by advances in AI, Metaverse and related technologies in relation to ToIP’s mission of creating interoperable trust over the Internet.</p>







<p>In one aspect, AI technologies may break the traditional assumptions of digital systems design, even most of the SSI systems or other decentralized systems. In another aspect, AR/VR/XR/Metaverse, combined with AI, may fundamentally alter/blur/erase the boundaries between digital and the real world. After all, our face is our identity, whether we choose it or not, and anyone can create that implied identity without our permission or even knowledge. Once it is in a system, it has a life of its own. How do we find what is real from fake and establish Trust? It is something missing today but critically important if we want our solutions to be useful in the next 5-10 years.</p>


 
 


<p>Metaverse and Web 3.0 are two intertwined drivers in pushing many Trust related issues and technologies to the forefront of defining what is the next internet or the next web. &nbsp;AI technology raises critical ethical issues with regard to how we think about trust over the internet, e.g. fairness, privacy and accountability. All these aspects, and more generally, AI ethics and harm prevention, point to the importance and relevance of the intersection between Trust and AI.</p>



<p>Many additional topics have to be explored, including Trustworthiness of data, how the AIs work with each other, how does a person determine trustworthiness of AI “on the fly’, potential of harms caused to a person with increased surveillance in Metaverse environments etc.</p>



<p>The task force plans to carry out its work in two phases below –</p>



  Phase 1: Survey and White Paper  Phase 2: Recommendation and/or White Paper

 What is the Verifier Universal Interface (VUI)? 
<p>Originally funded by <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/essif-lab/">eSSIF-Lab</a>, a project funded by the European Commission within the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu">Next Generation Internet (NGI) Program</a>, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/vui/">Verifier Universal Interface (VUI) initiative</a> aims to build a set of standard APIs to enable interoperability between ID Wallets and Verifier components. After months of hard work and collaboration, the VUI work has been successfully donated to DIF with the goal of furthering its evolution and reach to the international community.</p>
<p>As different technology providers build SSI solutions, it becomes critical to ensure interoperability between these solutions. Available standards for SSI still have important gaps, leading us to an ecosystem of full-stack providers whose approach to interoperability is building proprietary plug-ins for each one of the other available solutions. This approach to interoperability is not scalable, the underlying problem being that building standards takes time. For this reason a practical and focused approach was proposed to enable scalable interoperability in the SSI community: a role-centric approach to standardization at the API level.</p>
<p>The VUI working group, led by <a href="https://gataca.io/">GATACA</a> and composed of 12 SSI organizations, identified a minimum set of 6 APIs to offer an end-to-end credential verification flow.</p>
 
 DID resolution 
 Status resolution 
 Data agreements 
 Presentation exchange 
 Issuer resolution 
 Schema resolution 
 
<p>Since both DID Registry &amp; Status resolution APIs have advanced pre-defined work, VUI set out to build a team to work on the remaining interfaces.</p>
<p>In just one year, the working group has been able to define APIs for Data Agreements, Presentation Exchange, and Issuer Resolution.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the delivery for the Presentation Exchange API was an extension of the existing work based on WACI. As for the remaining API, Schema resolution, future work of VUI will involve its definition as it is only one without a definition proposal or an existing normative reference.</p>
 Results 
<p>The results of these efforts include <a href="https://identity.foundation/vui/">API specifications</a> built on ReSpec, API swaggers, and an open-source library that organizations can use to easily implement these APIs. Below are some details of each Working Package.</p>
 Data Agreements 
<p>In current SSI architectures, there is little to no support for data agreements, also known as consent management, on the usage of Verifiable Credentials. On one hand, there was some groundwork done by<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">  Kantara</a> on a generic<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-consent-receipts">  Consent Receipts</a> specification that could apply to any digital service, yet in the context of SSI frameworks, the only progress made were proprietary implementations of consent mechanisms, such as GATACA's Verifiable Consent; but no proposal had received major adherence. Due to the standardization gap, the<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-data-agreement">  Automated Data Agreement</a> (ADA) project was created under the EssifLab organization and led by<a href="http://igrant.io/">  iGrant.io</a> and builds upon Kantara<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-consent-receipts">  Consent Receipts</a> to allow data privacy mechanisms to be enforced in the framework of Hyperledger Aries. Given the strong alignment with the Consent Management API defined at VUI, both teams decided to join forces into one single initiative.</p>
<p>Now, the VUI Data Agreement sub-ReSpec proposes a specific Data Model to manage data agreements, built upon both<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-data-agreement">  Automated Data Agreements</a> and Kantara<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-consent-receipts">  Consent Receipts</a>. It also defines a basic protocol and the mechanisms to embed it inside a<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-dif-presentation-exchange">  Presentation Exchange</a>, which could be supported by multiple exchange standards.</p>
 Presentation Exchange 
<p>There are multiple known and adopted technology solutions or standards focused on the presentation exchange between a wallet and a verifier, the DIF Presentation Exchange (PE) data model being the most widely accepted. This is because DIF PE is compatible with multiple exchange protocols such as WACI, CHAPI, DID Comm, and DID Siop, making it scalable. To avoid further siloing the standards market by developing another PE data model from scratch, the VUI group believed supporting a successful, pre-existing data model was the best approach and decided to develop an extension of the groundwork done at DIF PE. Our core work consisted of proposing new extension features including:</p>
 
 
<p>Linkage to the data agreement (as mentioned before)</p>
 
 
<p>Mutual authentication (right now, it's performed at the exchange layer protocol), and</p>
 
 
<p>Mechanisms to improve the link between the credential subject and the person managing the wallet.</p>
 
 
 Issuer resolution 
<p>Who should be trusted as an issuer? This is a common, yet challenging question often asked in the online authentication space. In the past, many technology providers have attempted to provide generic solutions such as hardcoded lists in configuration files, API services, Domain name consultations, or Blockchain/DLT registries. In the SSI world, however, it's the Verifier who has the final decision on who he/she will trust to supply valid, verifiable data.</p>
<p>One of the most mature trust frameworks for Issuers has been defined at the<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI">  EBSI/ESSIF</a>  project by the European Commission, which includes a trusted issuer registry designed with a complex governance protocol to determine who can issue which credentials and who can vouch for those issuers.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the VUI team is taking it one step further by designing a generic, platform-agnostic issuer registry approach that is portable across any governance platform. The goal is to offer a generic adaptation compatible not only with EBSI/ESSIF trusted registries, but also with any other trust framework, where the Verifier will just have to build a generic query interface, similar to the Universal DID Resolver, to retrieve the issuers from any platform, and manage them at his preference.</p>

 Next steps 
<p>The VUI initiative has been steadily gaining international traction. In addition to having been donated to the DIF, it was recently mentioned in a<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/canada-eu-joint-workshop-series-enabling-interoperability-and-mutual-support-digital-credentials">  report published by the European Commission (DG Connect) and the Canadian Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, (ISED)</a>, as a key global interoperability approach to explore.</p>
<p>Moving forward VUI can help the SSI community successfully achieve interoperability between Verifiers and Wallets, a necessary step towards mass adoption. DIF's vast community and SSI expertise is precisely what VUI needs to make a tangible global impact.</p>
 Participating in VUI 
<p>The group is always looking for new organizations that can contribute and further these efforts.

<p>Orbis introduces a new social data model where everything is decentralized, composable, easy-to-use, and readily accessible to developers. Developers can use it to build features such as social timelines, comment systems or private messaging on top of their applications, with the underlying Ceramic data infrastructure facilitating performant social experiences for millions of users.</p><p>Orbis’ journey started on Ceramic’s Clay Testnet in December last year. In a few months, Orbis generated more than 70k Ceramic streams and over 20k unique posts. Today, Orbis is launching on Ceramic Mainnet with an improved user experience and opening its SDK to external developers to let anyone build fully decentralized social apps or social features on top of the Orbis architecture.</p><p>The SDK documentation is available <a href="https://orbis.club/developers">here</a> for developers interested in building decentralized social applications: <a href="https://orbis.club/developers">https://orbis.club/developers</a></p> Web3 Social With Web2 Performance <p>Social media’s current model is entering decline as users increasingly question data ownership and how they share value with those platforms. Users face the same trade-off: a great experience that meets their needs, but one that requires giving away their data and time in return. Web3 social promises all of the benefits of digital interaction while preserving a user's ownership of the data and value they create. Orbis offers a solution to this challenge—enabling a Web2 experience with Web3 benefits thanks to Ceramic.</p><blockquote>To reach hundreds of millions of people, Web3 social must be as easy to use as Web2 and shouldn’t introduce a new set of frictions—such a wait times, transaction fees or chain restrictions. This is why we decided to build Orbis on Ceramic, which is by far the best technology for data-intensive decentralized applications.</blockquote><p>Whether it’s DeFi, Gaming, or NFTs, Orbis makes adding social functionality a simple plug-in and lets developers focus on the unique features of their projects. As developers ourselves, we know that we must optimize your time and enable a better social experience for your users. Better still, the composability of Orbis and Ceramic means that the user's social experience can be enriched and extended across platforms. For example, an insightful commenter’s responses to articles can be aggregated into another news platform or a discussion group, rather than being siloed in the original platform or fragmented across many sites.</p><p>With the help of Ceramic’s infrastructure, Orbis:</p>  Creates social experiences with no fees or friction—connecting your wallet on Orbis creates your unique identity on Ceramic; after that, all social interactions automatically attach to this identity without the need for additional signatures  Builds network effects across its social graph to create a persistent user experience across apps—users bring their profile with them  Provides users with a similar performance to their favorite Web2 social experience  Equips developers with easy-to-add social modules to plug into their applications  (Coming soon) Users can join Orbis using different chains such as Cosmos or Solana    Hundreds of Possibilities With Orbis Protocol <p>Orbis protocol will be represented by several collections of modules that developers can use to supercharge their applications. Developers building on Orbis can pick and choose modules as social lego bricks to power many different use cases:</p>  Blockchain games could use the <code>Profile</code> and <code>Direct Message</code> modules to build a fully encrypted and decentralized chat application embedded on their own website  An NFT project developer using the <code>Profile</code> , <code>Context</code>, <code>Posts</code> and <code>Reactions</code> modules can build a simple social feed that aggregates content specific to their project and community  A content platform developer using the <code>Profile</code> , <code>Context</code>, <code>Posts</code> modules can add a fully decentralized commenting system for readers and viewers to discuss and engage with the creator  <p>All of these modules have already been built and are now being used on <a href="http://orbis.club">orbis.club</a>.</p> Unlocking the Power of Ceramic <p>Web3 social must offer the same frictionless user experience as Web2 applications to gain adoption. All while bringing Web3 benefits such as composability, portability and decentralization. This is what Ceramic offers.</p> Orbis Data Specified Using the Ceramic Schemas Feature <p>Imagine if your social interactions could follow composable standards similar to the successful ERC20 or ERC721 specifications. It would allow users to bring and view their data in many different types of applications, as they are doing with NFTs.</p><p>You could send a message to someone using a specific app and have the recipient read it in a completely different application—that's what Orbis does—and since it’s built on Ceramic, developers aren’t constrained to transactions fees or long write times.</p>On Orbis, each action taken by a user is a unique Ceramic stream, following a standardized schema, to allow composable experiences across applications building on top of Orbis. What’s next for Orbis? <p>Orbis will onboard additional providers, in the coming months, allowing users to create their Ceramic identity and Orbis profile using other ecosystems such as Solana or Cosmos.</p><p>The team will also be working very closely with external development teams to help them navigate the Orbis SDK.</p><p>If you're interested in adding a decentralized social layer to your application, or you want to build a fully decentralized and composable social network, we recommend exploring the developer documentation <a href="https://orbis.club/developers">here</a> and to <a href="https://orbis.club/group/kjzl6cwe1jw14ai2gg8e0qmx2j944ppe3s3dgfk003jlb8guuybyg4m77nsrg73/kjzl6cwe1jw145gun3sei0a4puw586yxa614le1tfh434y7quv2wsm0ivhbge7x">join our developer channel</a>.</p><p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Documentation</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

<p>Solution enables EV owners to charge from specific power plants and match their charging session with close to real-time production from renewables</p><p>Zug, Switzerland, and Wolfsburg, Germany, 19 July 2022 — Energy Web, a non-profit building operating systems for energy grids, in collaboration with Volkswagen Group Innovation and Elli, have developed a new smart charging solution enabling EV owners to charge their vehicles with renewable electricity that is matched directly with the vehicle’s real-time electricity consumption.</p><p>The solution relies on “24/7” matching algorithm which optimizes charging to maximize the use of clean, locally sourced electricity and provides users with an unprecedented level of control and granularity over EV charging. Through the solution, users can dictate the date and time of charging, the desired level of charge by the end of their session, what and the renewable energy facility the electricity is drawn&nbsp;from.</p><p>Several VW ID4s were successfully charged with local clean energy consumption, over the span of 3 months. A full array of charging sessions were tested, running from just a couple of hours through to sessions spanning several days. Each time, the platform optimized the charging schedule for maximum clean electricity usage while ensuring the target state of charge at the end of each session. The majority of tests took place near Wolfsburg, Germany, and took advantage of abundant clean energy from wind and solar farms in the surrounding area.</p><p>“This is the first time ever that an electric vehicle has been charged using a verified 24/7-matched clean energy strategy — coming at a time when EV adoption is gathering speed and charging is placing larger demands on electricity grids than ever before”, said Jesse Morris, CEO at Energy Web. “The purpose of this project has been to showcase that advanced EV charging solutions can empower EV owners to set their own preferences for when and where they get their energy. For instance, they can select to charge using wind and solar resources, from energy assets within a 10 km radius, and target 80% charge by 5 pm — all from within a user-friendly application, with an accurate breakdown of their session’s carbon footprint.”</p><p>Volkswagen Group Innovation is currently exploring how the solution can be further developed and rolled out at production scale, ensuring as many EV owners as possible can benefit from the Smart Charging application. With a traceable and secure audit trail for transactions provided on the Energy Web Chain, consumers will be able to show proof of renewable energy purchases, which will in future make it simple for corporate EV fleets to track granular energy usage for carbon accounting.</p><p>The Smart Charging App was developed by integrating Energy Web’s open-source 24/7 toolkit into Elli’s green charging app, which provides users with access to over 300,000 public charging points across Europe. Energy Web released its open-source 24/7 clean energy toolkit <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-shares-open-source-tech-toolkit-for-simplifying-24-7-clean-energy-procurement-41ac2e8225eb">earlier this&nbsp;year</a>.</p><p>You can read the full case study on the Smart Charging App&nbsp;<a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/greenevcharging/">here.</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>Congratulations to W3C on the ratification of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID v1.0</a> as a W3C standard!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Though Blockchain Commons has only lightly touched upon DIDs to date, they nonetheless are a crucial part of our history. In addition, their ratification today as an international standard demonstrates the ability of a cooperative commons to incubate ideas that will eventually be adopted as standards to be used widely by governments, corporations, and individuals.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen began experiments with decentralized identifiers in late 2014 when he built on his previous work as the co-author of the TLS spec by suggesting a <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherA/revocable-self-signed-tls-certificates-hack">hack to TLS</a> that associated X.509 certificates with Bitcoin addresses and then allowed revocation of those certs by spending the Bitcoin. It was a decentralized solution to the centralized problem of certificate authorities. Around the same time, Dave Longley and Manu Sporny were exploring similar ideas around identifiers and decentralization in the <a href="https://web-payments.org/minutes/2014-05-07/">W3C Web Payments Community Group</a>. Then, in 2015, Christopher began work with Drummond Reed and others from Respect Network as part of the XDI Registry Working Group, whose goal was to explore possibilities for a decentralized and rootless registry of identifiers; a strawman was presented at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/A_Registry_Directory_~_based_on_BLOCKCHAIN_that_is_ROOTless_%26_NOT_Centralized">IIW 21</a>.</p>

<p>That presentation led to interest from Anil John of the Science and Technical Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, who was looking for alternative identifiers to the US Social Security Number that also provided clear differentiation between identifier and authenticator functions. Christopher helped to coordinate a community effort that led to both Drummond Reed at Respect Network and Manu Sporny at Digital Bazaar submitting proposals to the Identity Management and Data Privacy R&amp;D Program. The goal was to show wide community interest in decentralized identity. Not only did both companies receive a grant, but they also both received additional funds through round two of the program.</p>

<p>Much of the community’s support for DIDs then occurred through the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop</a> that Christopher founded in November 2015 to mark the upcoming 25th anniversary of PGP. One of the five papers that were published following that first workshop was the massive <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure paper</a>, which included as one of its design principles that “each principal must be in complete control of their current identifier/public-key binding”, but had not yet settled on questions such as whether decentralized identifiers should be usernames or UUIDs.</p>

<p>DIDs themselves saw their first major workshopping at RWOT 2, which was run in conjunction with the <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-holds-inaugural-summit-at-the-united-nations-7112014add5e">ID2020 conference</a> at the United Nations in May 2016. Drummond Reed and Les Chasen of Respect Network produced the initial paper on the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/final-documents/requirements-for-dids.pdf">Requirements for DIDs</a>, supported by that US Department of Homeland Security grant. That was also the workshop that brought in Manu Sporny’s work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, which required an identifier to work with, and so was quickly dovetailed into the project.</p>

<p>Christopher has been constantly involved with the iterations of the DID specification that followed, beginning with the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf">DID Data Model and Generic Syntax Implementer’s Draft 01</a> that was written at RWOT 3 in San Francisco, where he worked with Drummond and Les as well as Ryan Grant. More designs followed across the subsequent Rebooting the Web of Trust events, including a massive DID breakout room at RWOT 5 in Boston, which spent the length of the conference refining the growing spec. Many, many more people contributed to the evolution of the design, among them: Daniel Buchner, who spearheaded Microsoft’s support of DIDs and with Microsoft’s backing created the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF); and Joe Andrieu, who led the work on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID Method Rubric</a>, a way to evaluate DID methods, as well as foundational use cases and engagement models for decentralized identity such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/joram-engagement-model.pdf">Joram</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers document</a>.</p>

<p>As part of his work on the preliminary DID spec, Christopher became one of the co-chairs of the W3C Credentials Community Group alongside Joe Andrieu and Kim Hamilton Duffy. There, he co-authored and co-architected the DID spec to be presented to the W3C. He has also been an invited expert at the DID Working Group since its advent in September 2019. Today, July 19, 2022, that Working Group’s work became a “W3C Recommendation” and thus an official international standard. Our congratulations to DID Working Group chairs Daniel Burnett and Brent Zundel, to DID editors Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, Markus Sabadello, and Drummond Reed, and to everyone who has spent the last seven years working on turning the ideas incubated in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and elsewhere into a real specification that can change the world by giving people control over their digital identifiers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Besides his work on the DID spec itself, Christopher is also one of the architects alongside Kim Hamilton Duffy, Ryan Grant, and Dan Pape, behind <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">the BTCR DID method</a>, which has been dubbed the <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/podcasts/23899/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids-didbtcr">“granddaddy of DIDs”</a>. This DID method anchors decentralized identifiers on the Bitcoin blockchain, very similar to the X.509 cert revocation that Christopher was advocating back in 2014.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons was founded in 2018 to support the ideas and community that came out of Rebooting the Web of Trust. Though Blockchain Commons proper has not published much on DIDs, except as an educational topic for our interns, it continues to be a future focus for us, with the idea of decentralized identifiers being a crucial assumption for our Gordian architecture. Christopher also continues to be an invited expert on Verifiable Credentials 2.0 and has advocated for the DID spec throughout its ratification process. Our expertise with DIDs and with BTCR leaves this all as an open opportunity for Blockchain Commons. If you’ve considered becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a> of Blockchain Commons and are interested in DID work, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a> to discuss the topic!</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that the OriginTrail DKG version 6 is officially feature-locked and about to move to “Stage 2” aimed to launch next week! The DKG ot-node v6 RC1 (Release Candidate 1) is now fully specified, verified and has reached the final stages of software implementation, bringing new features such as UALs, incentivization, advanced keyword search, Polkadot integration and more. Stage 2 further extends the scope of the v6 bounty program from technical validation to collective population of the Web3 Asset Graph incentivizing asset publishers to the DKG. Stage 2 kicks off with the RC1 release on the OriginTrail DKG v6 testnet. After months of iteration and telemetry analysis, the core development team behind OriginTrail has feature-locked and finalized the specification of the biggest update since its inception.</p> What’s new in OriginTrail version&nbsp;6? <p>The upcoming update to v6 introduces a major paradigm shift in the capabilities of the DKG, evolving the knowledge graph to extend from data to Web3 assets. Users of the DKG v6 will now be able to create their unique DKG graphs as Web3-native assets, representing, describing and linking to any physical or digital asset, collectively forming a massive, verifiable, global, decentralized knowledge graph.</p><p>In v6, each of the published assets receives a new type of identifier — the Uniform Asset Locator (UAL), a Web3 extension of the URI/URL scheme used in Web2. However, in contrast to URLs which point to Web2 resources (e.g. websites) and are effectively rented from centralized authorities, UALs are Web3 native identifiers in full control by their owners, linking to any asset in existence via their verifiable asset&nbsp;graphs.</p><p>A key application enabled by the introduction of UALs is Web3 search — a fully decentralized, verifiable protocol for the discovery of assets indexed in the Decentralized Knowledge Graph. The DKG v6 gives asset owners full control over the way their assets are shown in search results, as well as those searching to find any asset with fully verifiable search&nbsp;results.</p><p>Apart from many new features, version 6 of OriginTrail introduces an incredible performance boost, seeing multiple throughput KPIs at 500x improvement from&nbsp;v5.</p><p>These new capabilities and performance improvements are enabled by introduction of several key technologies into OriginTrail v6:</p>  OriginTrail dedicated Polkadot Parachain: a highly scalable, tailored blockchain for the OriginTrail DKG (<a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/google-for-web3-specific-blockchain-origintrail-parachain-launches-today-heres-what-s-next-9a0d92bb72ef">recently launched on Polkadot</a>) with native interoperability with all of Polkadot, opening way for integrations with Web3 ecosystems such <a href="https://medium.com/acalanetwork/origintrail-to-launch-on-acala-bringing-its-decentralized-knowledge-graph-to-acalas-developer-d92c4372deb9">the Acala DeFi </a>hub, Efinity by Enjin, KILT protocol, Moonbeam and others (OriginTrail DKG remains a multichain DKG integrated with Ethereum, Gnosis and Polygon blockchains).  Native NFT ownership representation: each DKG asset now consists of its own asset graph (as part of the DKG) and a corresponding non-fungible token representing ownership of the graph on a particular blockchain. All asset graphs are therefore natively compatible with all existing NFT tools and services(such as NFT marketplaces), as well as enabling existing NFTs to be extended with asset graphs and indexed in the&nbsp;DKG.  Native W3C RDF graph representation: asset graphs are natively represented according to the W3C standardized <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a>, enabling compatibility with existing KGs (e.g. Google) and standards based semantic technologies (JSON-LD, SPARQL, OWL, SHACL&nbsp;etc).  UALs as unique asset locators: binding together NFTs and asset graphs, UALs give Web3 assets a unique, verifiable, cross-chain asset ID and locator for asset graph&nbsp;data.  Decentralized Search index: enabling discovery of assets in Web3 with a fully decentralized search engine, built on open source standardized technologies, starting with keyword search and staking. These Web3 search results are fully controlled by users, built on top of UALs and provide verifiable ranking scores using well known algorithms e.g. Google PageRank.  Continued support for industry standards such as the new GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and Digital Link, W3C DIDs and Verifiable Credentials and many others, some of which have already been integrated into <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/healthcare/donated-medicines-and-vaccines/">latest pharmaceutical asset tracking solution AidTrust built on OriginTrail in collaboration with British Standards Institution</a>.  <p>All of the above mentioned features will be available through a plethora of new clients (including a light node client in the near future) in popular programming languages (Javascript, Rust, Python, etc) for Web3 developers across the Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems.</p> The road ahead of feature-lock &amp; stage 2&nbsp;testnet <p>The OriginTrail version 6 RC1 kickstarts stage two of v6 launch with the feature-locked DKG implementation next week, following the release of EVM support on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet (as indicated in <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/">the Parachain roadmap</a>).</p><p>Therefore Stage 2 introduces a new v6 testnet launched on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet, which will be the final environment for verification and testing before proceeding with OriginTrail v6 mainnet launch on the OriginTrail Parachain this&nbsp;August.</p><p>Following the initial release of v6 on mainnet, further updates will introduce:</p>  Keyword Staking and Node Delegation — enabling asset owners and token holders to contribute their dormant TRAC tokens to the network utility for a share of the network&nbsp;fees,  Launch DKG incentives on OriginTrail Parachain via the OTP token, incentivizing system participants for activities contributing to the growth of the OriginTrail DKG,  DKG Asset marketplace tools, which are under ongoing development,  Cross-Web3 integrations via Polkadot,  New interfaces and improvements in associated tooling.   Magnifying interaction with OriginTrail <p>In order for the new capabilities of OriginTrail to be easily available for users, we are introducing a new core interface aimed at growing the OriginTrail DKG.</p><p>As we are approaching the <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-v6-and-parachain-from-turing-to-metcalfe-phase-2276ab284de4">upcoming Metcalfe phase</a>, we will see continuous development of The Magnify project — an application interface that will leverage the v6 capabilities to enable an enhanced, Web3-native, asset ownership experience. It will allow asset publishers to quickly add assets and populate the DKG and at the same time allow asset consumers to easily discover&nbsp;assets.</p> OriginTrail on Twitter: "With the launch of @OT_Parachain on @Polkadot &amp; V6 @origin_trail Decentralized Knowledge Graph, it's time to magnify your capability to discover, verify, and supercharge assets!

<p>Why is digital trust so important? We asked Digital Identity NZ’s executive director Colin Wallis for his perspective on an equitable digital future.&nbsp; Plus, we preview the top trends in digital identity.</p>



<p>Q: What is digital trust and why is it so important?</p>



<p>A: Trust lies at the heart of human relationships.&nbsp; While the notion of trust has been with us since the beginning of humanity, it is rooted in the physical world, where people can be close to each other, understand their heritage from their village, iwi and hapū.&nbsp; In this context, sources of authority can vouch for their integrity.&nbsp; Back in those days just as today, this extends to commerce and entitlements and the privacy-respecting nature of those.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a digital world where this physical closeness doesn’t exist, other methods are required to gain confidence and assurance in someone’s identity and data.&nbsp; This includes overall security of the system and the personal data it processes to ensure the parties are acting in good faith.&nbsp; Without digital trust, the digital economy falters and ultimately cannot function.</p>



<p>Q: What underpins digital trust in New Zealand?</p>



<p>A: In essence there are two brand categories of underpinning – the public sector and the private sector.&nbsp; The Government for example, is generally trusted and seen as the authoritative source for much of our identity related information.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the private sector for example, banks, financial services and many other sectors operate digital services as well as physical services and in some cases solely through the digital channel.&nbsp; These are often extensions of our trust in brands in the physical world.&nbsp; Some brands, including big platforms like Apple, straddle both the physical and digital worlds while other brands like TradeMe, are online only, where people’s trust in the service has been built over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the medium term, the introduction of the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act has the potential to provide a game-changing regulatory foundation for the identification and authentication components of services delivered through the digital channel.&nbsp; Those services that choose to be independently audited for compliance against the Framework’s security and privacy oriented rules and standards to become accredited, would then be able to differentiate those digital service brands through displaying an accreditation mark.&nbsp; This would provide the public with greater confidence, assurance and level of trust in those services relative to other services that do not carry the mark.&nbsp; It was a key motivation in the establishment of Digital Identity New Zealand.</p>



<p>Q: What makes digital trust so complex?</p>



<p>A: The sheer range of actors and roles, technology options and technical approaches, plus the requisite legal compliance and information security, data protection and privacy standards means that there are a wide range of concerns to actively manage.&nbsp; All these factors need to be able to operate safely, respectfully and easily (ideally seamlessly) for people, and at scale nationally and internationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite significant advances during the past 10 years, the ecosystem is relatively immature and in keeping with modern day life generally, is continuously evolving in response to policy changes, technical advances and emerging new cybersecurity threats. New techniques and technology give rise to new ways of weaponising digital trust and in turn new techniques and technology are developed in defence of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q: What are barriers to digital identity adoption?</p>



<p>A: Digital literacy, confidence to use, knowledge of and equitable access to technology are all barriers to digital identity adoption.&nbsp; Trust and beliefs can also be an inhibitor to including everyone on this journey. Governments and large technical platforms are typically key actors in digital identity systems.&nbsp; People who distrust Government, big tech or anything digital for whatever reason present a challenge to ubiquitous inclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also barriers for digital services and service providers regarding legal compliance, lack of definitional alignment, interoperability and cross recognition among&nbsp; jurisdictions.&nbsp; Regardless, the business model for digital identity is typically opaque, given future uncertainty in policy, costs, technology options, market dynamics and adoption. As in all of modern life’s uncertainties, the risks and costs of investing can quickly outweigh the benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q: What does an equitable digital future look like?</p>



<p>A: Equitable and inclusive!&nbsp; In an ideal world, everyone would have equitable access to the digital economy and participate in it securely, safely and with confidence.</p>



<p>This is easy to say, but much harder to deliver at scale with constrained resources.&nbsp; An equitable digital future requires significant, sustained investment of resources across society in order to leave no-one behind in offering the opportunity to participate.&nbsp; This begins with literacy, education and technology.&nbsp; Improving digital literacy and equity requires a national programme of sustained investment with collaboration across Government, the private sector, the charity sector and non-profit industry associations such as Digital Identity New Zealand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q: What are the top trends in digital identity and identity management?</p>



<p>1.Decentralised identity architectural approach.&nbsp; This established but new-to-digital-identity approach promises a more streamlined, user-centric and privacy-centric digital experience where, after an initial set up process, personal identity-related data never leaves an individual’s device, thus reducing the amount of personal data transferred, stored and processed by other actors in the system and reducing the associated risks potentially exposed by those activities. While this would potentially remove some barriers to adoption for those distrustful of actors in systems based on centralised or federated architectures, and give people agency over which parties see their data, this approach is still early in its implementation lifecycle. Nonetheless with standardisation efforts underway, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a> was recently approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Tokenisation.&nbsp; Again, the concept of Tokenisation is not new, having been used in a rudimentary form in New Zealand’s digital identity systems for 15 years, but the term and its application to digital identity systems more broadly is new to the global community. This is when assets of almost any type can be trusted as being representative of the asset (physical or digital) itself but carrying ‘no exploitable value’. Given the nature of identity-related information, it’s no surprise that the concept has found its way into the realm of digital identity. Tokens are typically categorised into Fungible or Non-Fungible asset types. Tokens used in identity management are of the Non-Fungible variety and most commonly associated with decentralised identity implementations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.Passwordless.&nbsp; This is a technical approach to confirming or recognising a returning person that has previously registered at a digital service – the process known as authentication. It removes the need for people to type in a password after their username, instead using a high security option such as a cryptographic key pair and leveraging the person’s smartphone or similar device. More digital identity services are offering this option because by removing the password, a fraudster’s password guessing and brute force attacks against the person are minimised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4.Trust Frameworks.&nbsp; As with many other established concepts newly applied to digital identity, Trust Frameworks have been in use in the private and public sectors for decades in sectors such as financial services operating payment card systems underpinned by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). As one of Aotearoa’s foremost digital identity service providers explains, “Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between them”.&nbsp; The trust framework has the potential to significantly aid more frictionless e-commerce and velocity in the digital economy by giving people more confidence in the safety, security and privacy in their digital lives and control over their identity-related data.</p>



<p>Q: What can we learn from other countries?&nbsp;</p>



<p>A: Aotearoa can learn more from countries who have high levels of public and private sector collaboration in the development of digital identity ecosystems.&nbsp; Collaboration with industry associations like Digital Identity Identity New Zealand have advanced developments in the EU, the US, the UK and Canada and there is capacity to do more similar collaboration in New Zealand. &nbsp; It must be remembered that while of foundational and paramount importance, identification and identity&nbsp; – be it physical or digital – is a sub-system of a much larger set of business and governmental processes.&nbsp; Countries that have achieved high levels of cross party commitment to continued long term investment in process modernisation are in theory better placed to achieve better outcomes with better optics, delivered with more agility as a result. Oftentimes the most valuable interventions to demonstrably move the needle are things that don’t make headlines and in and of themselves don’t attract votes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, other countries have also learned from us!&nbsp; In 2007 Aotearoa was the first non-national ID card country to operate a national web-based login service and used early tokenisation techniques for privacy and security preservation referred to in the industry as ‘blinding’ well ahead of other jurisdictions.&nbsp; In 2023/24 it is expected New Zealand will be the first common law country of those typically compared, to pass Trust Framework legislation and operate a regulatory framework for digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q: What are the global opportunities for New Zealand as a trusted economy?</p>



<p>A: New Zealand’s growing capability and maturity in all things digital, needs to be consistently reflected in the development of digital services, be they online gaming or digital support in supply chain integrity for physical products that our association colleagues in AgriTechNZ promulgate. Digital identity underpins them all. Local companies can more easily expand to enter and operate in overseas markets with potentially less friction if internationally recognised digital identity standards and practice are consistently applied.&nbsp; Armed with these tools, we have the potential to develop a strong competitive advantage in the digital economy globally. &nbsp;</p>

 Growing the Community 

<p>The Blockchain Commons community continues to grow to the benefit of all of our members.</p>

<p>Welcome to Chia. A big welcome to our newest sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://www.chia.net/">Chia Network</a>, Bram Cohen’s blockchain company. Chia joined mainly because of what we’re already doing, including our work on advocacy and our history with DIDs. We’re thrilled to have them not just because of the interest in our current efforts, but also because of their cutting-edge blockchain work, including the innovative Chialisp smart-contract language, work with pairing-based cryptography, and their <a href="https://www.chia.net/greenpaper/">Proofs of Space and Time algorithm</a>. Blockchain Commons supports the heterogeneity of the blockchain space. We want to make wallets work with multiple blockchains that are built in multiple ways, and having someone like Chia onboard makes that possible.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon. Community growth allows us to hold events to bring that community to share their knowledge. Thus, our first quarter welcoming of <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> and <a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a> allowed us to hold our first Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, hardware-wallet makers, and other interested parties joined together to discuss the future of semiconductor design and how it can better support cryptographic functionality. The <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon website</a> contains complete information on the June 1st event, including <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/presentations/">videos, slides, and transcripts of all the presentations</a> as well as an <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/#discussions">overview of the discussions</a> with quotes.</p>

<p></p>

 Evolving our References 

<p>Our reference apps demonstrate how the Gordian principles can be used in functional applications; while our reference libraries make it easy to use our specifications. We continue to upgrade and expand both with the support of our community — and occasionally deprecate some when they’ve served their purpose.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool 1.5. We upgraded our premiere Gordian app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, to 1.5. This upgrade implemented new experimental functionality related to NFC Tags. You can now write to and read from NFCs by just tapping them with your phone. There are still a number of questions about NFC security, but we’re always interested in testing out the newest technology and considering how it could integrate into our secure architecture — and that type of experimentation is one of the major purposes of our references.</p>

<p>Gordian Server 1.0.2. One of the challenges of producing an application like <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a>, which makes it easy to install and use Bitcoin Core on your Mac, is that we’re vulnerable to any changes in Bitcoin Core itself. Some minor changes in the file names for Bitcoin Core 23.0 required us to do some updates to both Gordian Server and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup Scripts</a>, but everything is now up-to-date, allowing easy installation of a Bitcoin Server that will allow you to work with new Bitcoin technologies such as Taproot and Schnorr signatures.</p>

<p>Gordian QR Tool Deprecation. The maintenance load for apps results in us occasionally deprecating something, and that was the case this quarter for our QR Tool app. We originally released Gordian QR Tool to demonstrate the Gordian principles of resilience and independence in a simple, easy-to-use way. This included a way to store seeds and other vulnerable data as QR codes in a secure vault. However, Gordian Seed Tool has evolved so far since the debut of the two apps that we’ve decided QR Tool doesn’t hold many advantages any more. Thus, we’ve deprecated QR Tool so that we can instead focus our attention on Seed Tool.</p>

<p>Lifehash for Python. Thanks to the support of our sustaining sponsor <a href="https://cramiumsolutions.com/">Cramium Solutions</a> and the work of long-time Blockchain Common contributor &amp; supporter <a href="https://github.com/kanzure">Bryan Bishop</a>, Blockchain Commons is now able to offer a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash-python">Python implementation of our Lifehash library</a>. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#readme">Lifehash</a> is a Blockchain Commons specification that creates beautiful visual hashes that make it easy to identify data at a glance. Thanks to Cramium for making this methodology available to Python programmers!</p>

 Evolving Smart Custody 

<p>Smart Custody is one of Blockchain Commons’ oldest projects, and it continued to see new life in the last quarter.</p>

<p>Full Draft of Multisig. We have completed the first draft of our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">multisig scenario for self-sovereign #SmartCustody</a>. Since our rough draft last quarter, we’ve added dozens of illustrations and responded to reviews, creating a new draft that’s hopefully more usable and definitely more accurate. Though we’re thrilled to now be able to advocate for a multisig solution for self-custody, in the process we’ve learned both that its complexity can be intimidating and that the specificity of required devices can make it unapproachable. So expect both more expansions in the future (to support more variants), as well as some bigger Blockchain Commons projects that will start to demonstrate how we can make multisigs simple.</p>

<p>Outline for #SmartCustody 2.0. We’ve been thinking about a second edition of our 
<a href="https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101">Smart Custody book</a> for a few years and have recently created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md">a new outline for SmartCustody 2.0</a>. We’re not quite sure when we’ll be able to dedicate time for it, but these are our current thoughts on documenting SmartCustody for the future. In the meantime, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody#smartcustody-scenarios">Smart Custody Repo</a> for the scenarios, tools, and case studies that we’ve written in the last year and which will eventually appear as modules in the #SmartCustody 2.0 book.</p>

<p></p>

 Welcome to New Interns 

<p>For the third year in a row we’re running a Blockchain Commons virtual-intern program this summer.</p>

<p>The Third Cohort of Blockchain Commons Interns. Welcome to our latest cohort of Blockchain Commons interns, which this year includes 16 interns out of twice that many applications. We’ve always wanted to broaden our internships to go beyond just software engineers, and we’ve been pleased with the success of that this year, with a pre-law intern now leading a whole group in the support of our advocacy work in Wyoming. Projects our interns are working on include: the support for that legislative work in Wyoming and elsewhere; expanding Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line for new Taproot and Schnorr technology; exploring the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0322.mediawiki">BIP-322 proposal</a> to leverage Bitcoin Script to sign arbitrary messages; updating <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">Spotbit</a>; and writing use cases for human-rights workers such as emergency and medical personnel, monitors, press, and advocates. We look forward to reporting back on these projects at the end of summer.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Pre-Updates. To get the Learning Bitcoin course ready for our newest interns (and for their own work on it), we updated Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line for all recent PRs and to address all recent issues (most of which had to do with updates to Bitcoin Core over the last year). Thank you to everyone who has helped us to keep the Learning Bitcoin module up-to-date and correct over the years! We haven’t flagged an official release yet, as we’re hoping to at the end of summer, but the Learning Bitcoin course should now be more accurate and up-to-date with Bitcoin Core 23.0 commands.</p>

 Working with Wyoming 

<p>We’ve been thrilled to continue working with the Wyoming legislature, with support from our new interns. Christopher Allen and one of our interns gave new testimony on a variety of topics this June, with support from the legislative intern team.</p>

<p>E-Residency. We’ve spoken several times in Wyoming to advocate for e-residency, which will allow corporations to take advantage of the excellent digital business &amp; privacy laws that Wyoming has been advancing in the last several years. A local paper gave <a href="https://www.thesheridanpress.com/news/local/wyoming-considering-following-in-estonias-footsteps-with-new-program/article_fa2161e0-ed7f-11ec-b22a-db4cbe8144e0.html">good coverage</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>WRDAs. We also advanced new ideas on Wyoming Registered Digital Assets (WRDAs), which will improve Wyoming’s treatment of digital assets by allowing for perfection under the UCC. Here’s our <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061408-03WyomingWRDASlides.pdf">slides on the topic</a>.</p>

<p>Private Key Protections. Finally, our most important testimony for Wyoming may have been about protecting private keys from disclosure by courts. The problem is that courts are current endangering digital assets, information, and identity by demanding the turnover of private keys, often as part of pretrial motions. They’re not the proper tool, and they’re not being used in the proper way. Because this is such an important topic, we’re currently working on a position paper that will better explain why private keys are not appropriate for this usage.</p>

<p></p>

 Looking toward the Future 

<p>A lot of our work in Q2 was forward-looking, developing specs and architectures that we hope will be the next generation of responsible key management on the internet.</p>

<p>We expect to advance three major projects in the third quarter based on this work.</p>

<p>CSR. Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR) is the first step in the development of our next-generation Smart Custody architecture. The <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/149">CSR Project</a> is intended to automate the sharding and recovery of seeds and other essential metadata, with options to support shard-recovery services: interopable services will hold envelopes of data containing shards of the data required for wallet recovery and only return them to users following sufficient authentication. This work is currently being done in conjunction with Bitmark and Proxy.</p>

<p>Hardware API. The varied APIs of hardware devices can cause numerous integration problems for developers (the so-called “NASCAR Problem”. Thus our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/158">Hardware API Project</a> seeks to develop a  unified wallet architecture &amp; APIs that will work with a variety kinds of devices. We also plan to leverage URs and crypto-requests and to support device capability discovery. The first steps will be analyzing and assessing current hardware APIs, abstracting out functionality, and simultaneously leveraging new work such as that being done by CrossBar for silicon support. This work is currently being done in conjunction with CrossBar and Proxy while Blockchain Commons contributes specs and coordination.</p>

<p>Reference Upgrades. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/159">Automated multisig round-trips</a> are meant to expand the work Blockchain Commons has already done on Uniform Resources (URs) by using <code>crypto-requests</code> to automate the creation and usage of a classic (pre-Taproot) Bitcoin multisig. This will be done through the development of a new reference app, Gordian Coordinator, which will be a transaction coordinator that holds no private keys, and through the expansion of Gordian Seed Tool. Our ultimate goal is to demonstrate the ease of use possible with a fully integrated system of <code>crypto-requests</code>.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to the development of these exciting new architectures and designs for the future!</p>

<p>The Identity Week Europe conference and exhibit was conducted in London on June 28 and 29, 2022.&nbsp; The conference had three tracks, Security Documents, Biometrics, and Digital ID with the mission to “… to accelerate the move towards a world where trusted identity solutions enable governments and commercial organizations to provide citizens, employees, customers and consumers with a multitude of opportunities to transact in a seamless, yet secure manner. All the while preventing the efforts of those intent on doing harm.”</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation was invited to join a panel discussion on the topic of Smart Digital ID Wallets and the Future of Identity moderated by Steve Pannifer, Managing Director, Consult Hyperion.&nbsp; The panelists were:<a href="https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/identity-week/agenda.stm"> Nick Mothershaw, Chief Identity Strategist, Open Identity Exchange</a>,<a href="https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/identity-week/agenda.stm"> Daniel Bachenheimer, Contributing member to the Technical Architecture Task Force, Trust Over IP</a>; Arjan Geluk, Lead Principal Advisor, Identity Management &amp; Security, UL; and Kristel Teyras, Chair of the Digital Identity Workgroup, Secure Identity Alliance.</p>







<p>The 20 minute Smart Wallet panel discussion was preceded by a presentation on Smart Digital ID Wallets – Smart Digital Wallets: More than just a collection of Digitised Credentials by Nick Mothershaw and Lee Hughes who laid down the underlying functional elements of Smart Wallets along with use cases and operational considerations.</p>



<p>Our panel discussion began with what is digital identity? and my response was that we need to think about it in two domains: foundational identity, typically imparted by the public sector as a form of legal identity after establishing uniqueness within the target population, and functional identities where identity attributes are typically established by sector-specific relying parties such as: employers, financial institutions, educational institutions – as well as public sector entities for voting, taxes, driving licenses, etc.</p>



<p>The next discussion round was seeking clarity on what exactly are digital identity wallets and what specifically ToIP offers in this domainn. I shared that, beginning with the OIX Smart Wallet discussed in the last session, there are varying capabilities already in (or expected to be in) digital identity wallets – from the OIX rules engine, to the EU Digital Identity Wallet initiative that is to include strong, multi-factor authentication, auditing, and (like the ISO mDL wallet), both online and offline capabilities – among many others.</p>



<p>I explained that the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">ToIP model</a> was originally inspired by the Hyperledger Aries work on digital identity wallets and agents. The focus has been on secure key pair generation and storage along with secure verifiable credential exchange and storage. However that scope is steadily expanding to be inclusive of other decentralized identity stack architectures and protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also shared that the ToIP model outlined in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">Trust Over IP Introductory document</a>, available at <a href="http://trustoverip.org">TrustOverIP.org</a>, addresses the technology and governance related to each layer separately. I shared an example from the EU Digital Identity Wallet requirements which says that a “minimum set of person identification data…&nbsp; [must be shared] to identify the user upon … request in those cases where identification of the user is required by law.” How does one ensure that the entity requesting the person identification data, as required by law, is a legitimate relying party and how do we securely share the minimum amount of information that is legally allowed? ToIP governance and technology guidance exists today, in the form of <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Specification V1</a>, and is maturing to address these fundamental digital identity capabilities.</p>



<p>Ultimately the panel was very much aligned that decentralized digital identity will be an integral part of establishing one’s identity online, and off. Industry must work together to establish globally interoperable solutions where formats, protocols, and digital signatures defined by governance and trust frameworks are agreed within and between ecosystems.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago was the first full-scale Identiverse since the pandemic began, and host Ping Identity pulled out all the stops. It started off with a wonderful video splash with spotlighted drummers banging away, setting the stage for three days of wonderful entertainment, great keynotes, engaging sessions, and nonstop networking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ping CEO Andre Durand ‘s opening keynote set the tone by putting decentralized identity front and center. Stating that our current systems do not scale, Andre took us on a journey through the history of Identity solutions from passwords, to single sign-on, to OAuth, to centralized and federated identity.&nbsp;</p>







<p>He then ended with what we all know at the Trust Over IP Foundation: that the future is decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p>







<p>It was not just a wonderful start to the conference, but a great summary of exactly why ToIP was founded: we are collaborating to develop the recommendations, standards, guides, and templates needed to connect the gap shown on Andre’s slide above.</p>



<p>If there was a real surprise at this year’s Identiverse, it was the evidence presented throughout the conference that decentralized identity isn’t just the future, it is the NOW. For example, only an hour after Andre’s keynote, Kristina Yasuda, Senior Identity Standards Architecture at Microsoft, gave an entire talk extolling the virtues of verifiable credentials (VCs) without even mentioning Microsoft’s own VC products. (She also didn’t mention that she is the new co-chair of the new W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0 Working Group along with Brent Zundel of Avast).</p>



<p>Shortly after Kristina’s session, Brent and Drummond Reed gave a presentation on how the SSI model of digital wallets and VCs can and should be integrated with existing identity and access management (IAM) systems. Their goal was to dispel any notion that “rip and replace” was necessary to start using VCs and the ToIP stack.</p>



<p>But the most resounding endorsement of VCs came when Alex Simons, Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President of Identity and Network Access gave the opening keynote on the second day. He not only spent the entire first half of his talk explaining why VCs were the headline new feature of the Microsoft Entra product suite, but then invited Kristina to give a live demo of VC interop between Microsoft, Ping, Workday, IBM, and MATTR. For more on the specific interop profile they were using, see <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/new-capabilities-in-microsoft-entra-verified-id-now-available/ba-p/3295507">this blog post</a> from Microsoft decentralized identity product manager Ankur Patel.</p>



<p>On Thursday, ToIP Steering Committee member Mike Vesey, CEO of <a href="https://idramp.com/">IdRamp</a> presented several use cases in his session “Establishing Trust with Decentralized Identity Networks, Verifiable Credentials, and Zero Trust”. Mike shared several decentralized identity solutions operating in production today, including:</p>



  “Zoom Bouncer”, a new meeting security application now available in the Zoom public app store that allow meeting hosts to use verifiable credentials and biometrics to protect virtual meetings from zoom bombing.&nbsp;  The North Dakota Department of Education decentralized identity initiative shows how verifiable credentials are being used for decentralized verification of student learner records for graduating students.&nbsp;  



<p>Mike also gave a demo of the IdRamp zero code orchestration platform that allows issuance of verifiable credentials from any traditional IAM system and verification with any traditional relying party service—an entire journey that can be implemented in just a few minutes without any code. “IdRamp has been providing decentralization for a few years now.” states Mike Vesey, “The IdRamp platform provides a seamless bridge from centralized identity systems into decentralized credential based authentication and access control. It was inspiring to hear that same vision being shared by the largest IAM organizations in the world. The future of identity is decentralized and ToIP is playing a major role in guiding organizations on their journey into decentralized zero trust protection.”</p>



<p>Judith Fleenor, Director of Strategic Engagement at the Trust Over IP Foundation, agrees: “It’s exciting to see live use cases of verifiable credentials across various sectors of government and industry. It is equally exciting to see organizations such as our Steering Committee members <a href="https://idramp.com/">IdRamp</a> and <a href="https://monokee.com/">Monokee</a> making integration with traditional IAM a breeze through their innovative system integration platforms and consulting services.”</p>



<p>Another key theme throughout the conference was <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 passkeys</a>. At least a half-dozen sessions were focused on this topic—not surprising given <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/cnet-apple-google-microsoft-back-fido-tech-to-dump-passwords-on-websites-and-apps/">the announcements from Apple, Google, Mozilla, and the FIDO Alliance</a> earlier this spring—and that Identiverse focuses on an enterprise IAM-centric audience where solutions to multi-factor and passwordless authentication have been sought after for two decades.</p>



<p>Overall, the attendees from ToIP agreed that this Identiverse took a strong step in the direction of ToIP—and it made it even more important that we push forward with our work of completing the full definition of the ToIP stack.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that <a href="https://monokee.com/">Monokee</a> s.r.l., a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaleup_company">scaleup</a> from north Italy, has joined the ToIP Foundation as a Steering Member. A company rising from the centralized and federated IAM world to embrace the SSI paradigm, Monokee intends to be an&nbsp;active contributor to the community’s efforts in defining the interoperability standards that will lead to Web 3.0.</p>



<p>Launched in 2018, Monokee leverages the 20 years of experience of its two founders in IAM/IGA consulting. The company’s flagship product is an easy-to-integrate, point-and-click visual identity orchestration tool used by security architects from SMEs to larger enterprises.</p>



<p>Representing Monokee on the Steering Committee will be Ing. Roberto Griggio, Monokee’s CEO. Roberto graduated in Computer Science from the University of Venice, Italy and sports more than 20 years in identity and access management and related fields. On the technical working groups and task forces, Monokee will be represented by Dr. Mattia Zago, Monokee’s SSI Solutions Architect. Mattia holds a Ph.D. from the University of Murcia, Spain, specifically dedicated to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence subjects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Joining the ToIP Steering Committee represents a significant milestone for me as a researcher and us as an identity company,” said Dr. Zago. “Seeing that the community is aligned with our view of a hybrid integration between federated enterprises’ services and decentralized identities further increases our motivation to pursue it. Indeed, we will keep pushing forward our identity orchestrator to provide seamless (and codeless) integration experiences for security engineers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monokee believes a formal definition for the authentication and authorization processes is critical for integrating IAM/IGA solutions. Despite the importance of this aspect, most contemporary solutions require a non-negligible amount of engineering effort to connect identities, attributes, applications, flows, protocols, and many other elements.</p>



<p>Monokee simplifies this process with its Visual Identity Orchestrator (VIO), a drag-and-drop interface to build your authentication processes from scratch, starting from predefined blocks and connecting them in a flow-chart fashion as illustrated below.</p>







<p>Each block and connector in the resulting map represent parts of the process in a virtually codeless environment: Monokee’s visual builder turns that map into computer-generated code, with no room for human errors. The VIO is also a major improvement for process management. For example, adding an authentication factor in an existing process is just a matter of dragging a new block into the chart and inserting it into the flow.</p>



<p>The abstraction provided by Monokee’s VIO aligns perfectly with the vision of the ToIP foundation of an interoperable web of trust. Specifically, Monokee aims to bridge the gap that exists at layers 3 and 4 of the ToIP stack between classic centralized and federated ecosystems and new decentralized services and resources. While this obviously involves technical challenges, the real interoperability questions reside in the governance framework that coordinates the topmost ecosystem layer: how to embrace the new trust paradigm without tossing away the achievements of the last decade?</p>



<p>Monokee envisions a hybrid world capable of taking advantage of the structured, well-tested, and effective IAM solutions while incorporating decentralized and distributed elements to improve end-user privacy and usability. Monokee plans to provide resources and workforce to help ToIP working groups achieve their 2022 objectives, starting with the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification, anticipated for release in September 2022.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 7 July 2022 — Large amounts of valuable data are available in energy systems. However, they are often underused, and their full potential is not being extracted. The smart energy system of the future can be more efficiently operated and designed through a holistic approach that considers its multiple energy vectors (electricity, gas, heat…). This means dealing with diverse data inputs, which is feasible if the interoperability between their corresponding data platforms is ensured. OMEGA-X, a European-funded project, aims to tackle this challenge and to implement an Energy Data&nbsp;Space.</p><p>Many challenges exist in this sense, as even for each of these energy sectors, a single data platform does not exist. For instance, there is not a single data platform connecting data from generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption domains in the electrical power sector. The barriers also imply the lack of proper mechanisms and policies that ensure secure, sovereign, and fair data sharing. Thus, interoperability inside each sector and between other sectors needs to be promoted and also achieved transnationally, across European countries.</p><p>The Data Space that OMEGA-X aims for, is one based on European common standards, including federated infrastructure, data marketplace, and service marketplace, involving data sharing between different stakeholders and demonstrating its value for real and concrete Energy use cases and needs, while guaranteeing scalability and interoperability with other Data Space initiatives, not just for energy but also cross-sector.</p><blockquote>“There will be no Green Energy Transition without full digitalization. There will be no EU data strategy without data sharing. Data Spaces can answer to both challenges at once, being Energy one of the flagship use cases.” Javier Valiño — Atos</blockquote><p>The OMEGA-X project includes setting up 4 use cases families that will showcase the value of having a common data space for a particular problem identified by energy stakeholders:</p>  Renewables: Having renewable plant owners and service providers to optimize operation and maintenance to increase renewable energy sources (RES) availability and reducing CO² footprint.  Local Energy Communities: exploiting data from different energy vectors to optimize the overall performance of a local community, instead of optimizing each vector individually.  Collaboration among Electromobility actors: demonstrating how data sharing can ease and scale-up services such as booking and building innovative services such as cross-border self-consumption of renewable energy. It will involve the electricity system from charging points to transmission system operators (TSOs) in different EU countries.  Flexibility: Aiming to demonstrate the performance upgrade that can be achieved for the flexibility identification and provision at local/municipality level when service providers can have access to extended data sets from multiple&nbsp;origins.  <p>The OMEGA-X project runs from May 1st, 2022 till April 30 2025, and was officially kicked off on May 11–12 in Bilbao. This three-year project is led by Atos in collaboration with a European consortium of 30 partners from 11 different countries, including universities, cities, and key players from the energy sector: Atos Research &amp; Innovation (SP, coordinator), Atos Worldgrid (FR), Tecnalia (SP), EDF (FR), ENGIE (FR), EDP (PT), Estabanell (SP), Elia (BE), Polytechnic University of Catalunya (SP), IDSA (GE), Intracom (GR), Odit-e (FR), Open &amp; Agile Smart Cities (BE), RINA Consulting (IT), Revolt (IT), Municipality of Maia (PT), Aarhus University (DK), IMT Transfert (FR), Maieutica Cooperativa de Ensino Superior (PT), Institut Mihajlo Pupin (SRB), SENER (SP), Estabanell y Pahisa MERCATOR (SP), Astea (IT), Universidade Catolica Portuguesa (PT), GIREVE (FR), Energy Web (GE), LichtBlick (GE), Power &amp; Mobility (IRL), Meteo for Energy (SP), NORCE Norwegian Research Centre&nbsp;(NO).</p><p>The architecture and recommendations of the Data Space Business Alliance (<a href="https://internationaldataspaces.org/bdva-fiware-gaia-x-and-idsa-launch-alliance-to-accelerate-business-transformation-in-the-data-economy">DSBA</a>, an alliance of <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">Gaia-X</a>, the Big Data Value Association (<a href="https://www.bdva.eu/">BDVA</a>/DAIRO), <a href="https://www.fiware.org/">FIWARE Foundation</a>, and the International Data Spaces Association (<a href="https://internationaldataspaces.org/">IDSA</a>)) will be used as baseline for the design of the OMEGA-X framework.

<p>About half a year before we started Animo Solutions, my co-founders and I discovered Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript, an open source JavaScript/TypeScript framework designed to create interoperable self-sovereign identity solutions. At the time we were just getting acquainted with the concept of SSI. Just the idea that we could use TypeScript to build made our lives so much easier and the tech so much less daunting. It turned into one of the building blocks of our company, and I would end up becoming a maintainer and strong advocate of Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript. Now, after two years of hard work by the community, we’re excited to announce the 0.2.0 release of the framework. In this article, I’ll take you through what this newest release entails and why it will change the way self-sovereign solutions are built.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) is a framework written in TypeScript for creating interoperable self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions. The framework has two main focus points. It aims to be as accessible as possible for any developer whether new or experienced in the world of SSI. It is also designed specifically for multi-platform development, so both server-side and mobile solutions can be built with the framework.</p>



<p>The framework has gained a lot of momentum lately. The community has been growing quickly with various governments and organizations stepping in. Our current contributor count is 37, and the working group calls now have around 10 active participants (as opposed to the two we had two years ago). The potential of the framework has become clear to developers other than us (the fanatics). For example, at Animo we recently received funding from the EU NGI eSSIF-Lab initiative to lift the framework to the next level regarding mobile development options.</p>



<p>The new Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript release (0.2.0) contains some incredible steps forward. Especially in our goal to make the framework AIP 2.0 compliant. AIP 2.0 compliance will not only ensure the framework supports the latest standards and protocols, but it will also greatly increase interoperability and make it more useful outside of the Hyperledger Indy ecosystem. Specifically, this release contains:</p>



  Full support for the out of band and did-exchange protocols  Postgres wallet support  Previously the framework only supported SQLite. This addition ensures the framework is better suited for cloud infrastructure.    Wallet import/export support  This addition enables users to migrate their wallet data to and from other Hyperledger Indy-based wallets.    Pickup protocol v2 for better control over interactions with the mediator  Support for the issue-credential-v2 protocol  The issue credential and present proof v2 extend the framework with the ability to support multiple credential and proof formats. Instead of adding a separate API for the v2 protocols, we have put a lot of effort in designing a single, easy-to-use API that works with both versions and is extensible for later versions in the future. In the next release we’ll be adding support for the present proof v2 protocol.    Credential revocation and revocation notifications for holders and verifiers  This allows holders to prove that a credential hasn’t been revoked and verifiers to verify this. The revocation notifications allow the holders to be informed about the fact that one of their credentials has been revoked, rather than discovering this when trying to present proof.    Full did:peer support  A generic DID resolver that currently supports did:key, did:web, did:sov and did:peer.  An upgrade assistant to help users update their wallets to newer versions of the framework  As the framework evolves over time, some of the underlying data structures may change. With the upgrade assistant, we aim to make it as easy as possible for users to migrate.    



<p>We’re already working hard on version 0.3.0 that will, just like the 0.2.0 release, be packed with new features such as support for the W3C Verifiable Credential Format and BBS+ Signatures 2020, making the framework fully AIP 2.0 compliant.</p>



<p>Check out the 0.2.0 release <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/releases/tag/v0.2.0">here</a> and the update instructions <a href="https://aries.js.org/guides/updating">here</a>. For general documentation, please see<a href="https://aries.js.org/guides"> </a><a href="https://aries.js.org">aries.js.org</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript and its developments, we recommend you join the working group call (07:00 MT / 14:00 UTC on<a href="https://zoom.us/j/92215586249?pwd=Vm5ZTGV4T0cwVEl4blh3MjBzYjVYZz09"> zoom</a>) and check out the<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript"> GitHub repo</a>.

<p>OriginTrail’s Parachain bid for a parachain slot was successfully concluded on May 18th 2022, leading to the launch of the blockchain network at the beginning of June. As a part of the launch sequence, OTP will be distributed among all the parties mentioned in the <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper?section=genesis-distribution">Genesis distribution</a> part of <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper">the OriginTrail Whitepaper 2.0</a>. Below you can find the schedules and process steps for each of the groups participating in the OTP distribution.</p>Genesis distribution summary Initial auction distribution <p>The OriginTrail Parachain was secured by winning a Polkadot auction in which a community of 1.830 participants showed their support by locking up 754.654 DOT tokens (native Polkadot tokens) for a period of 96 weeks. As mentioned in <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper">the whitepaper</a>, there were up to 125.000.000 OTP tokens allocated to be distributed amongst the contributors to accommodate up to 5.000.000 DOT of support. Since the entire 5.000.000 DOT pool wasn’t used, any unspent OTP from the initial auction process will be added to the Future auctions&nbsp;pool.</p><p>The distribution schedule</p><p>All participants will receive their OTP rewards (together with any eligible bonuses) according to the following steps:</p>  25% of the total amount will be distributed on Friday — July 8th 2022 at 3pm&nbsp;UTC.  The remaining 75% of the total amount will be distributed with a vesting transaction with the expiry at the end of the lease period. You will be able to collect these vested tokens (in the amount proportional to elapsed time of the transaction) using the “vest” extrinsic (e.g. via Polkadot.js).  <p>The claiming&nbsp;process</p><p>All eligible participants will receive OTP rewards directly to the wallet with which they participated in the crowd loan. Note: Your wallet will have a different address on Polkadot and OriginTrail Parachain (starting with prefix “1” on Polkadot, and “5” on OriginTrail Parachain). This is by design, and Polkadot.js takes care of this conversion for you. More information can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-accounts">here.</a></p> OriginTrail community distribution <p>The OriginTrail DKG community is an important part of the OriginTrail Parachain success for which reason, a 25.000.000 OTP allocation is available for distribution among two key groups of the OriginTrail DKG community.</p> TRAC token&nbsp;holders <p>The first of the two groups has an allocation of 20.000.000 OTP allowing 1 OTP to be claimed for every 25 TRAC in all TRAC wallets snapshotted on the moment of successful completion of the OriginTrail Parachain auction — May 18th 2022 08:45:22 (Ethereum block 14800965).</p><p>The claiming&nbsp;process</p><p>TRAC token holders that wish to receive OTP allocation for their TRAC wallets have to apply using <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/claim-otp?type=trac-holders">this interface</a>. Following the steps in the interface they will need to provide two&nbsp;inputs:</p>  Connect and validate their TRAC wallet on Ethereum, Polygon or Gnosis&nbsp;chain.  Provide a correct address for receiving wallet on OriginTrail Parachain. Important! Please make sure you provide the correct account address and keep an <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000168651-what-is-the-existential-deposit-#:~:text=Print&amp;text=On%20the%20Polkadot%20network%2C%20an,the%20Existential%20Deposit%20(ED)">existential minimum deposit</a> there at all&nbsp;times.  Receive OTP tokens in your provided&nbsp;wallet.  <p>The distribution schedule</p><p>The participants in the TRAC token holders distribution will receive their OTP rewards according to the following steps:</p>  First distribution. The first distribution will occur on Friday, July the 8th 2022 and will involve 25% of the total eligible reward amount. This will be available for everyone that correctly finishes the claiming process by July 7th midnight&nbsp;UTC.  Daily distributions. Starting from July 9th 2022, there will be daily distributions for all participants that applied by midnight UTC the day prior. Daily distributions will take place until July 22nd 2022. Similar to the first distribution, it will involve 25% of the total eligible reward&nbsp;amount.  Weekly distributions. Starting from July 22nd 2022, OTP rewards will be distributed once a week, on Friday (July 29th, August 5th, August 12th…) for all participants that correctly finish the claiming process by Thursday (July 28th, August 4th, August 11th…) midnight UTC. The weekly distribution will finish on September 30th, meaning the final date to apply for TRAC rewards is September 29th&nbsp;2022.  The remaining 75% of the total amount will be distributed with a vesting transaction with the expiry at the end of the lease period. You will be able to collect these vested tokens (in the amount proportional to elapsed time of the transaction) using the “vest” extrinsic (e.g. via Polkadot.js).  <p>NOTE: Due to the Parachain implementation requiring 1 OTP as an existential deposit for all accounts, a minimum amount of 25 TRAC found in your wallet at the time of the snapshot is required to be eligible for OTP rewards. Additionally, for amounts snapshotted below 500 TRAC (with a reward of up to 20 OTP), no vesting will be applied due to a minimum requirement of 15 OTP necessary for a vesting transaction to&nbsp;occur.</p> OriginTrail DKG v5 node&nbsp;runners <p>This OriginTrail community group has an allocation of 5.000.000 OTP which will be possible to claim on the basis of how much time a particular DKG node was active in the network in the period of 1 year from the beginning of the multi-chain OriginTrail Starfleet phase (March 23rd 2021 — March 23rd&nbsp;2022).</p><p>The claiming&nbsp;process</p><p>DKG v5 node runners wishing to receive OTP allocation for their TRAC wallets have to apply using <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/claim-otp?type=node-runners">this interface</a>. Following the steps in the interface they will need to provide two&nbsp;inputs:</p>  Connect and validate their operational node wallet on Ethereum, Polygon or Gnosis&nbsp;chain.  Provide a correct address for receiving wallet on OriginTrail Parachain. Important! Please make sure you provide the correct account address and keep an existential minimum state there at all&nbsp;times.  Receive OTP tokens in your provided&nbsp;wallet.  <p>The <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/claim-otp?type=node-runners">claiming interface</a> will be open from July 4th 2022 until July 31st 2022. It will not be possible to apply for DKG v5 node runner rewards after that&nbsp;date.</p><p>The distribution schedule</p><p>The participants in the TRAC token holders distribution will receive their OTP rewards in following steps:</p>  25% of the total amount will be distributed on August 7th&nbsp;2022.  The remaining 75% of the total amount will be distributed with a vesting transaction with the expiry at the end of the lease period. You will be able to collect these vested tokens (in the amount proportional to elapsed time of the transaction) using the “vest” extrinsic (e.g. via Polkadot.js).  <p>Make sure to double-check the key dates and process steps for all rewards that you might be eligible for and join us as we launch the exciting new phase of the OriginTrail ecosystem!</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/otp-distribution-process-explained-2878a440d9d7">OTP distribution process explained</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 On&nbsp;4th of July 2022 at 4039470 &nbsp;block number&nbsp;the&nbsp;Commercio Network chain&nbsp;has been &nbsp;be upgraded to the new version of software&nbsp;4.0.0. This upgrade marks &nbsp;exactly two years of activity since our chain officially lunched the first &nbsp;2.1 main-net on July 4 2020. 
<p></p>
 The 4.0 version will allow the Commercio Network blockchain to implement &nbsp;IBC protocol &nbsp;&nbsp;as well as align with the latest versions of Cosmos SDK&nbsp;and CosmWasm. 
<p></p>
 The IBC protocol &nbsp;is an interoperability protocol for communicating arbitrary data between arbitrary state machines.<br>
The Transport Layer (TAO) provides the infrastructure necessary to establish secure connections between chains and authenticate data packets, while the Application Layer defines exactly how these data packets should be packaged and interpreted by the sending and receiving chains.&nbsp;The IBC application layer can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications, like &nbsp;token transfer, inter-chain accounts (delegate calls between two chains), NFT &nbsp;token transfer, and oracle data feeds. 
<p></p>
 Cosmos SDK allows developers to easily spin up application-specific blockchains without having to code each bit of functionality of their application from scratch. Cosmos SDK custom modules can be used by any developer as they build their own application. &nbsp;We have upgraded to the latest Cosmos SDK Version and we &nbsp;are now on par with all other chains. 
<p></p>
 Finally Cosmwasm is an alternative route to native Cosmos SDK custom modules. &nbsp;CosmWasm is a smart contract platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. Simply put, it’s the Cosmos (Cosm) way of using WebAssembly (Wasm) This means that we can easily add CosmWasm smart contracting support to our commercio.network &nbsp;chain, without without &nbsp;doing an hard fork chain stopping event. CosmWasm will be used to mint Fungibile tokens, Non fungible Tokens and the CommercioDEX &nbsp;our Automatic Market Making &nbsp;Local decentralized exchange.

<p>Research by Digital Identity NZ, a member of the NZTech Alliance, has found two thirds of Kiwis are more likely to go online to do things than face to face, NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller says.</p>



<p>As people’s lives and work become more reliant on the digital environment so does the need for our ability to trust the digital environment, he says.</p>



<p>“This increasing use of digital platforms and services can easily be shaken if people lose trust in the digital environment.</p>



<p>“At the same time, if there is a high level of trust, people are making increasing use of digital tools and services, which leads to better competition, higher productivity and better outcomes for all.</p>



<p>“Interestingly, the research finds that digital trust in businesses comes from a mix of non-digital things such as the company’s reputation, how big the company is and what information they ask for.</p>



<p>“Building and maintaining digital trust is critical for Aotearoa’s economic future and it is a complex area bringing together privacy, cyber-security and digital identity, all of which will be analysed and discussed at the upcoming <a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata / summit</a> in Wellington later this month.</p>



<p>One of the speakers at the July 27 event is Kaye-Maree Dunn, a previous NZTech Board member and co-founder of&nbsp;Māori digital identity firm,&nbsp;Āhau.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She is a&nbsp;technology entrepreneur with Te Rarawa, Ngā Puhi, Ngāi Te Rangikoianaake, Ngāti Mahanga and Ngāi Tāmanuhiri roots and will discuss the importance of the community and end user as the key stakeholders in digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Global digital identity and trust expert David Birch is coming from the UK to discuss the challenges of identity in the growing metaverse and the emergence of a reputation economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another&nbsp;speaker is chief executive of Potatoes NZ, Chris Claridge. He is passionate about horticulture and the potential for tech to add value to New Zealand’s primary produce.</p>



<p>Digital trust is becoming increasingly important even in the physical world as customers seek evidence of sustainable production and the providence of our agricultural products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Few topics are as critical to Aotearoa’s future prosperity and the wellbeing of its people as trust. The summit brings world leading speakers on the subject to New Zealand. Establishing and maintaining trust in the digital world is relevant to everyone.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, DIF for short, is delighted to learn of the <a href="https://bit.ly/3OUFttK">W3C Director's final decision</a> to approve the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) V1.0 specification as an official W3C Recommendation. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/07/pressrelease-did-rec.html.en">Read the full W3C press release on this decision here</a></p>
<p>Announcing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID) v1.0 specification</a> as an open web standard signals that it is technically sound, mature, and ready for widespread adoption. Having an established v1.0 specification allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus, not only at the many groups meeting at DIF, but across the digital identity community.</p>
<p>Three formal objections were registered and considered as part of the W3C approval process; these were ultimately overruled by the W3C director after careful analysis and consultation with all parties, leading to today's decision to approve the DID Core specification as a W3C Recommendation. <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/03/did-fo-report.html">Read the content of the objections as well as the counter-arguments here.</a></p>
<p>This specification is the result of half a decade of sustained, broad-based, dedicated work on the part of the DIDWG at W3C, which includes many DIF and ToIP members. We acknowledge also the work done by numerous, forward-thinking organizations who have already built working implementations, thereby laying the foundations of new infrastructures for"identity data''. Participants of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a> have contributed to such foundational DID infrastructure and tooling, for example the recently-updated <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a>. This community-maintained tool makes it possible to resolve many different DID methods, therefore supporting interoperability and data portability efforts. <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/uni-resolver/">Read more about the Universal Resolver on our blog here</a>, or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">check out some more of the exciting potential use-cases for DIDs in the W3C documentation here.</a></p>
<p>Looking forward, a newly-chartered <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/did">W3C DID Working Group</a> is expected to deliver a selection of standard DID methods and further demonstrate interoperation between implementations. The community and Member review of such proposed methods is the natural place to address the feedback and questions raised by the objectors and other Member reviewers regarding decentralization, fitness for purpose, and sustainable resource utilization.</p>
<p>We believe DIDs will change the course of digital identity by building-in better user controls, portability, and interoperability at the lowest possible level, while also offering increased security and simplicity for implementers and service providers. This advancement unlocks new opportunities for our digital lives, and we look forward to leveraging DIDs and other technologies developed in the community to champion a new class of user-first, self-owned digital identity systems.</p>
