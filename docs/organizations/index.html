<p>Developers building multi-chain applications have a powerful new combination to work with, as Ceramic now supports Moonbeam applications. &nbsp;Moonbeam offers developers an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot, providing an easy path to a multi-chain implementation. Ceramic adds support for advanced data management and cross-chain identity. Together, this enables developers and users to depend on the same accounts and wallets to manage transactions, identities, and data across Ethereum and Polkadot applications. </p> A full stack for cross-chain applications <p>Since Moonbeam uses the same keypairs and wallets as Ethereum, signing and<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains"> </a>authentication for Ceramic's data streams is also supported out of the box. Now that Moonbeam and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem  <p>"Moonbeam devs and users will now be able to easily implement Ceramic's streaming data and cross-chain identity protocols due to the same keys and wallets being utilized that developers and users are already familiar with," says Nate Hamilton, Director of Business Development at Moonbeam. </p><blockquote>The Ceramic and Moonbeam teams look towards the same goal: proving the best-in-class user experience</blockquote><p>Currently, Moonbase Alpha, the Moonbeam TestNet, has been added as a supported chain. Users can now perform transactions on Ceramic and Moonbase Alpha with their existing wallets. Currently, Moonbeam is compatible with MetaMask and MathWallet.</p> About Moonbeam:  <p>Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network that makes it easy to build natively interoperable applications. This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam will benefit from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. Currently, in active development by PureStake, Moonbeam is expected to reach MainNet by mid-2021. </p><p>Learn more: <a href="https://moonbeam.network/?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=announcement&amp;utm_content=subscan">https://moonbeam.network/</a>.</p> About Ceramic <p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/#streams">Ceramic's stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information. <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables. By making it easy to structure and associate data to a user's personal index, IDX lets applications save, discover and route to users' data.</p><p>The IDX SDK makes it simple to manage users and deliver great data-driven experiences using the same keys and wallets as developers and users are already relying on. Users can also link multiple keys, from any wallet and multiple blockchains, to the same identity. This is essential to developers who want to serve users over time, as it enables key rotation, data interoperability across accounts, and rich cross-chain profiles, reputations and experiences (including 50,000+ profiles on Ethereum today).</p> Getting started with Ceramic and Moonbeam   To get started on Moonbeam visit their <a href="https://docs.moonbeam.network/">documentation site</a>  To add IDX to your project, follow this<a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>.

 <a href="http://digitalgovernment.scot"></a>In the <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/files/ash/files/300871_hvd_ash_digital_trans_1.pdf">Harvard white paper</a> on Digital Government Transformation Richard Pope provides a working definition of ‘GaaP’ – Government as a Platform. 
 “GaaP should reorganize the work of government around a network of shared APIs and components, open-standards and canonical datasets, so that civil servants, businesses, and others can deliver radically better services to the public more safely, efficiently, and accountably.” 
<p>He explores the topic through a summary round up of how this approach has been pioneered and adopted in countries like India, Estonia and the UK.</p>
<p>Our white paper builds on this, providing detailed blueprint analysis of GaaP implementations across the world.</p>
 #LegoGovernment – Plug and Play Service Design 
<p>GaaP is such a powerful approach because it address the root issue that inhibits integrated Government services.</p>
<p>Like all large enterprise organizations Governments are structured via rigidly delineated departments and agencies, and typically deploy their own dedicated IT for only their business processes, creating isolated silos. The DWP develops their own standalone IT systems, Tax and Healthcare does the same, … and so on.</p>
<p>As the Harvard paper describes:</p>
<p>“There is a lot of duplication in government. Generally, departments and agencies are vertically integrated, with each running its own version of a system (a public website, a payment gateway, a printing service, an address lookup, etc.) that’s similar but not identical to all the others. Platforms have been cited as a way to remove that duplication and break down organizational silos.</p>
<p>Siloed approaches to transformation don’t work,” <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/29/government-as-a-platform-the-next-phase-of-digital-transformation/">Mike Bracken wrote in 2015</a>. “Reinventing the wheel every single time we build a service has led to far too much duplication and waste. That’s not good enough.”</p>
<p>This is a critical point for those working in public sector service design. When we consider how services are actually delivered we see that the workflow processes that enable them cut across these silos, as illustrated through this simple example:</p>
<p>This sets the scene for the concept of “Lego Government”. Rather than the traditional approach of building Government services via dedicated line of business applications, they are created via coupling together modular components.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/features/inside-dwp%E2%80%99s-digital-coronavirus-response-%E2%80%93-apis-reuse-and-micro-services">This PublicTechnology interview</a>&nbsp;explores in detail how the DWP are working with APIs. For example when the NHS undertakes a real-time check for prescription charge exemption they call the DWP passport benefit API which validates the enquiry. They also perform this check for the Department for Education for free school meals entitlement and for local authorities for the disabled Blue Badge award.</p>
<p>They make the critical point that they endevour to reuse existing APIs wherever possible, and where they don’t they develop them via ‘<a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-microservices-empowered-uks-dwp-to-pivot-during-covid-19/elsewhere-web/2020/08/04">microservices</a>‘ – Small snippets of code intended only for this purpose. This enables very rapid solutioning, only four weeks in some cases.</p>
<p>Underpinning the business logic and service design layer the core technology architecture is the API Gateway platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the DWP describes:</p>
<p>“Once we identified – or built – the API that met the requirement, we deployed it onto our current shared API Gateway which was already hosted in our internet-facing cloud. This meant that all the infrastructure was already in place so, once the API was tested and proven to be suitable, it could be deployed really easily through the existing shared infrastructure. Historically, the process of building the underlying infrastructure could take months; we deployed new APIs, or extended throughput on existing APIs within two days. This would not have been possible without the API Library or the shared API Gateway.”</p>
<p>Hosting their API gateway in a cloud environment allowed the team to scale up in near real-time, after completing assessment of forecasted API volumes. This microservices approach will build the pathway towards the future, with the hope that eventually they will be able to “join up services across government and one initiative is that we’re creating a central cross-government API Registry that will enable us to share what APIs we already have available, as well as being able to see what APIs other government departments have available.”</p>

<p>The Future of Decentralized Escrow: Smart Payments</p>
<p>Blockchain Development<br>
A Smart payment, which occurs via a Hashed-Timelock Contract (HTLC), is a transfer of Tokens where the payment condition is enforced by the Blockchain. It is a concept originated within the Bitcoin community that is applied on Lightning Network and can be used on Ethereum, and in Cosmos chains</p>
<p>Condition is a Hashlock.</p>
<p>A Hashlock or the digest of a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256, is a type of impediment that restricts the expenditure of an output until a specific piece of data is<br>
publicly disclosed. Hashlocks have the useful property that once a Hashlock is made public, any other Hashlock protected by the same key can also be opened. This allows for the creation of multiple outputs that are all encumbered by the same Hashlock and that all become executable at the same time.</p>
<p>The timelock is a time impediment, like a time safe, where the Smart Contract states that the recipient can claim the funds by presenting<br>
a valid pre-image of the hash digest before a specified deadline (timeout). After the timeout, the funds are automatically returned to the sender.</p>
<p>HTLCs are enforced by the Blockchain, so the transacting parties only need to trust that the Blockchain is executing the contract correctly, (not the counterparty.) It can also be expected that HTLCs can be executed on different Blockchains and even without the presence of a Blockchain, with Agreements (HTLAs).</p>
<p>Conditional Payments<br>
Two parties using an HTLA on a Blockchain that does not support Hashlock and Timeout could proceed as follows: the sender sends a message to the recipient<br>
telling it that it wants to “prepare” a transfer with a specified Hashlock and Timeout. The parties agree that if the recipient submits the pre-image hash before the<br>
Timeout, the transfer is executed and the sender owes the money to the recipient. Debts are settled through simple transfers on the Blockchain.</p>
<p>In the case of a post-funding agreement, the sender can settle its debt with the recipient for every payment if its Blockchain is fast and has low fees, or once the total amount owed reaches the parties’ credit limit. In this case, the recipient must rely on the sender to pay what they owe. The risk can be reduced by limiting the amount of money the sender can send before payment.</p>
<p>For pre-funded agreements, the sender transfers the amount of a single payment or a large amount to the recipient and benefits from the equivalent of a line of credit.<br>
The recipient then deducts the amount of any “conditional transfer” executed from the pre-funded amount. In this case, the sender must trust that the recipient will not steal the pre-funded amount, but this risk can obviously be reduced by limiting the pre-funded amount.</p>
<p>HTLAs thus work with Blockchains that support Hashlock and timelock (such as HTLC) and with Blockchains that do not support them.</p>
<p>In the future, this methodology could be used in the CommercePay module in the Commerce.network Blockchain.</p>

<p>By Rae Rivera, Ph.D., Director of Certification, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance today&nbsp; introduced a significant update to its Metadata Service (MDS). The service provides information about the certification status of authenticators, authenticator capabilities, and any known security issues. The FIDO MDS provides organizations deploying FIDO servers with a centralized and trusted source of information about FIDO authenticators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MDS is a web-based repository where vendors can publish metadata about their certified FIDO authenticators. Relying parties use this information&nbsp; to validate authenticator attestation and prove the authenticity of the device model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With over 100 authenticator products on the market today, and demand for strong authentication on the rise, the need for an easy-to-use repository to load and view FIDO Certified authenticators has grown in importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just last week, the Biden administration mandated multi-factor authentication for all government agencies to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover.&nbsp; Governments and other regulated industries such as banking and healthcare especially need to know that authenticators being used to access their systems are genuine and meet certain requirements, including FIDO Certification status, compliance and other organizational requirements. The new features in the FIDO MDS allow organizations to more quickly and easily verify the attributes of the FIDO Authenticators being used to log in to their web services and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s news is significant in several areas:</p>



  The new MDS has a more efficient and effective user interface that greatly simplifies the uploading and publishing of metadata.&nbsp;  There is a simplified API for relying parties to download metadata.  Metadata updates are now available daily instead of monthly, which ensures relying parties have access to the most up-to-date information.  The new MDS data format is now a single JSON structure, making it more compatible with standard web development tools. The new MDS format uses human-readable strings instead of numerical values, making it easier to read and understand.  The MDS data is now linked to the FIDO Certification program, which will ensure the reliability of the validity of metadata of FIDO Certified products.&nbsp;  The service now uses cloud caching to provide high availability and download performance.&nbsp;

 In the feature video Miles Briggs and David Stewart provide an introduction that emphasizes the opportunity for Scotland from Digital Health and Social Care. 
 Miles describes how our European neighbours have taken up the next generation of e-health technologies where Scotland hasn’t, but ultimately has the opportunity to lead the world in this field. 
<p>He identifies the key areas for improvement to achieve this, notably a <a href="https://digitalgovernment.scot/digital-healthcare-in-scotland-guddle/">lack of integration between systems</a>, and that&nbsp;Scotland seems to have a lot of pilots active across the country but that there’s a blockage in moving them through to nationwide deployment.</p>
<p>David also believes smarter systems can revolutionize healthcare and sees the potential for patient data to be better used to forecast healthcare trends for the individual and for the nation whole to plan healthcare services, while of course ensuring this is done with complete protection of their data privacy.</p>
 From Idea to Delivery 
<p>Dr. Margaret Whoriskey, Head of Technology Enabled Care and Digital Healthcare Innovation for the Scottish Government, describes how the sector is evolving from idea to being a method of delivering healthcare services.</p>
<p>She identifies the main challenges to adoption are culture, changing how people work, transforming services while they are being implemented, financing of these new ways of doing things and public engagement, meeting the expectations of citizen users.</p>
<p>To overcome them Margaret believes the key is for digital transformation to involve every one not just technology staff, making it part of every one’s role, and also cross-industry collaboration that brings together multiple different agencies.</p>
<p></p>
 Digital Healthcare in the Era of Covid-19 
<p>In this ALLIANCE Live interview, Andrew Strong (Director of Integrated Services) interviews Jonathan Cameron, Head of Digital Health and Care at the Scottish Government.</p>
<p>The interview kicks off by asking Jonathan what Covid-19 has taught us about the enablers and challenges of adopting digital services, and he responds by saying things have changed radically, driving an unprecedented speed and scale of delivery. This includes the public embracing uptake of digital tools.</p>
<p>From 5m:10s Andrew asks how Scotland is performing against the ambitions of the headline Digital Health and Social Care strategy published a couple of years ago, particularly in light of the impacts of Covid-19. Jonathan believes some areas have enjoyed great progress, citing examples like the NMAHP digital champions network, while others haven’t progressed as much as they’d like, such as citizen access to data.</p>
<p>At 8m:05s Andrew then asks what the next steps are for the strategy. Jonathan says they are going to refresh the strategy, Covid-19 has prioritized functions such as improving digital access to GP practices and appointments, collecting and enhancing data, and continuing the success of the <a href="https://digitalgovernment.scot/nes-digital-platform/">National Digital Platform</a>.</p>

	<p>On May 6, 2021, two days after the Me2B Alliance published our report on&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/school-mobile-apps-student-data-sharing-behavior/">data sharing in school utility apps,</a>&nbsp;Google issued a “<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">pre-announcement”</a>&nbsp;describing major improvements to app labeling in the Android app store:&nbsp;</p>
<p>We work closely with developers to keep Google Play a <a href="https://www.android.com/safety/">safe</a>, trusted space for billions of people to enjoy the latest Android apps. Today,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;pre-announcing an upcoming safety section in Google Play that will help people understand the data an app collects or shares, if that data is secured, and additional details that impact privacy and security.<br>
[Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html</a>&nbsp;]&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement signals a serious intention to not only catch up to Apple’s privacy label, but surpass it, by introducing independent validation of the Android app privacy information.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the official policy will be published in Q3 2021, and by Q2 2022,&nbsp;all&nbsp;apps in the Google Play store will need to provide the new “safety section” information.  Details on the new “safety section” are where the rubber meets the road, and as we noted in our report, there currently isn’t adequate privacy or safety labeling for apps. Nevertheless, we’re encouraged by the new policy, and hope that Google’s new safety section includes SDKs by name and owner.</p>
<p>[Source:&nbsp; <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html</a>&nbsp;]&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement also makes clear that the new “safety section” will be independently audited, though unclear if that will take effect in Q2 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance currently performs independent audits of apps and websites and looks forward to learning more about Google’s independent app auditing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But why wait until next year when you can get your app or website audited by us today? &nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/services/">Contact us</a>&nbsp;to get started.</p>

<p>What is a DAO?</p>
<p>The acronym stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The concept of DAO comes from Bitcoin, which could be seen as the first prototype of DAO, and Ethereum where there are several examples of DAOs.</p>
<p>The crypto world community has always been fascinated by this new form of life. Not because of what it could do, or had done, but precisely because it was a new life form. Anyone who wants to create their own new digital life form can do so using a project called <a href="https://aragon.org">https://aragon.org</a> which is based on Cosmos SDK like Commercio.network.</p>
<p>Aragon allows a group of people to organize and collaborate freely without boundaries or intermediaries. It is technically possible to create global organizations and communities without bureaucracy. It should be pointed out that from a legal point of view, there are still no case law references that can give a DAO the status of a legal entity.</p>
<p>Like a blockchain, your DAO will live on the network.</p>
 
 It will survive as long as it does something that people will pay for. 
 There will be no way to remove it. 
 It will be radically transparent. 
 It will not be able to be stopped in any way. 
 It will be able to pay people to do whatever people are willing to do in exchange for its tokens. 
 It will follow its own rules that were programmed when it was created. 
 
<p>You could create an NGO, a domain manager, or a prediction market, or a foundation, all of which are completely autonomous (and own themselves)</p>
<p>The concept of a Distributed Autonomous Organization/ Corporation (DAO/DAC) is the ideal outcome of the Crypto economic revolution .</p>
<p>Its roots lie in themes about organizational decentralization that were described by Ori Brafman in The Starfish and the Spider (2007) and those about “peer production”, aptly described by Yochai Benkler in The Wealth of Networks (2006).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

     <p>■ Be Considerate: The decisions made when creating standards will affect many user companies, all points of view are needed to make the right decisions. Please allow all participants to provide their points of view. Once a participant has explained their point of view, however, they should refrain from repeating it numerous times.</p> <p>■ Be Respectful: Members of GSMP are to treat one another with respect. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We cannot allow personal attacks or behaviours that make people feel uncomfortable or threatened. </p> <p>■ If disagreeing, constructively disagree: It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively and respectfully. </p> <p>■ Be Collaborative: Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work; we should always be open to collaboration. Our work should be done transparently and should involve as many interested parties from as many business and regional perspectives as early in the process as possible.</p> <p>■ Be Representative: a speaker should not make remarks which further a personal agenda and are not representative of that speaker’s constituency unless it is clearly stated that the comments are personal. A speaker should not give the impression that they speak for a company or region if they have not spent adequate time clearly explaining the business case to the user company/s they represent and documenting their response. Speaker’s votes should accurately reflect their constituent’s responses. This aligns GS1 with their mission to create user driven standards.</p> <p>The following subjects may cause offense and are not acceptable, however intended:</p> <p>■ Disruptive behaviour (e.g., shouting, cursing, derogatory comments, or intoxication)</p> <p>■ Filibuster (one person talking too loudly or too long to overcome other opinion)</p> <p>■ Remarks about people (race, religion, ethnicity, gender, age, national identity, national language, nation of origin, sexuality)</p> <p>■ Disparaging remarks about companies, types of companies or industries</p> <p>■ The promotion or attempt to sell a particular company, proprietary product or product type, implicitly or explicitly</p> <p>■ Remarks about another company’s business practices when they are not represented at the meeting</p> <p>If a discussion leads to any of the preceding behaviours, conflict management rules will be applied.</p>

Upon doing so, the organisation’s representatives may join all current and future GSMP groups (unless the organisation has opted out of a specific GSMP group). An organisation that has signed the Automatic Opt-in Agreement may opt out of an individual Work Group at any time. For a newly created group, the automatic Opt-In takes effect when the Work Group has its first meeting; therefore, an organisation that has signed the automatic Opt-In but does not wish to be opted-in to a newly announced Work Group may opt-out between the call-to-action and the first Work Group meeting, and thereby avoid any IP obligations for that Work Group.</p> <p>An organisation’s representative that has joined a GSMP Work Group is given access to that Group’s Community Room, which in turn gives access to all work-in-progress of that Group. An organisation that has not opted in to a Work Group does not have access to the Work Group’s Community Room, nor may it attend Work Group meetings. The organisation may still participate in community review and eBallot voting (if voting member) of deliverables produced by the Work Group.</p>

     <p>The GSMP provides for several activities designed to confirm that GS1 standards and guidelines, and implementations thereof, are of sufficiently high quality and meet business and technical goals. In summary, these activities include:</p> <p>■ Prototype Testing: An activity performed in GSMP Steps 3.8 (sections <a title="Go to 21.3.8">21.3.8</a>), whose goal is to identify and fix errors in the draft standard or guideline that would prevent interoperable implementations from being created using the standard or guideline document. The goal of prototype testing is to ensure the quality of the standard or guideline document itself.</p> <p>■ Conformance Testing: A test administered by a GS1-designated testing agency to confirm that a given implementation conforms to the standard or guideline. Conformance testing is performed on individual implementations after a GS1 standard or guideline is ratified. The content of the conformance test is developed during GSMP Steps 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.6, and 4.7 (sections <a title="Go to 21.3.5">21.3.5</a>, <a title="Go to 21.3.6">21.3.6</a>, <a title="Go to 21.3.7">21.3.7</a>, <a title="Go to 21.4.6">21.4.6</a>, and <a title="Go to 21.4.7">21.4.7</a>). </p> <p>■ Industry Pilots: A limited implementation of a GS1 standard or guideline carried out by user companies in the target business environment to demonstrate that the standard or guideline succeeds in meeting business requirements or addressing a business need, and to identify promising areas for future development. Industry pilots are discussed below.</p> <p>Prototype Testing and Conformance Testing have very specific goals related to the standards development process itself, and are defined in the sections of this manual cited above.</p> <p>The goal of Industry Pilots is much more varied, and depends on the interests of user companies and MOs. Industry Pilots are for the most part not conducted as part of GSMP, but rather as independent activities by Industry Engagement or MOs. An Industry Pilot can be carried out at one of two times relative to the GSMP 4-Step Process:</p> <p>■ An industry pilot may be carried out prior to the ratification of a GS1 standard or guideline, based on an early draft of the standard or guideline. In this case, the goal is to confirm that draft is headed in the right direction with regard to meeting business needs. The results of a pilot conducted at this stage are considered by the Work Group, and typically lead to revision of the draft in progress. End users participating in a pilot at this stage should understand that what is being piloted is a draft standard or guideline that is subject to further revision, and so the pilot implementation may not be in conformance to the standard or guideline when the latter is finally ratified.</p> <p>■ An industry pilot may be carried out subsequent to the ratification of a GS1 standard or guideline. In this case, the goal is to confirm that the GS1 standard or guideline fully meets expectations regarding the addressing of business needs, to gain experience and demonstrate how the standard or guideline is actually used in a production setting, and to identify areas where enhancements to the GS1 standard or guideline may be needed in the future. Any enhancements indicated by the results of the pilot must be submitted via a Work Request. </p>

<p>The great boom of social networks has created an entire economy based on the exploitation of personal data to identify and map users to “accounts”, stored in central databases that concentrate not only the information power, but also the risk, the responsibility related to Privacy compliance.</p>
<p>This privacy requirement forces us to consider a new technology, promoted by the EU, called Self Sovereign Identity (SSI). SSI has the great advantage of transferring control of data into the hands of the data owner, specifically the citizen, preventing the possibility of data being shared without authorization.</p>
<p>The world of identity based on the paradigm of self sovereign identity (SSI) has matured today, the first international standards have been established: W3C DID and VC.</p>
<p>The decetntalized blockchain technology of commercio.network is a perfect match for SSI as it allows for immutable, decentralized and distributed tracking and proof of all exchanges between counterparties in an unmediated manner. Compared to a centralized solution, the advantage of a blockchain-based network is to prevent the ownership of information (and therefore its integrity) by a single party. Blockchain and SSI are the technologies that, at the state of the art, not only allow citizens to regain control of their information, but also prevent misuse or build correlation mechanisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The philosophy of SSI</p>
<p>The concept of decentralized identity is based on some elements such as:</p>
 
 Decentralized identifiers (Decentralized identifier aka DID) 
 Attributes related to the entities represented by DID (people or things) expressed in the form of credentials that, if signed, are verifiable 
 Protocols, which allow communication between entities and/or things; in particular, of particular importance is the protocol for issuing verifiable credentials and presentation of evidence, obtained from such credentials (derived evidence called Proofs) 
 
<p>The categories of actors that interact in a decentralized identity system are the following:</p>
<p>Issuers, or&nbsp; Public Issuers &nbsp;or private entities that issue credentials in favor of a subject, following appropriate verifications (organizational, technical, etc.)<br>
Subjects or Holders of such information (technically representative in the form of verifiable credentials), who control it through an agent (e.g. an identity wallet)<br>
Verifiers or Verifiers, i.e., subjects that require holders to produce verifiable information (in the form of shared credentials or proofs).</p>
<p>Among the most important objectives of the paradigm of the SSI we emphasize the possibility of selective and independent dissemination of their data by a holder against a verifier, the minimum possibility of correlation of data (said, “linking”), the maximum barrier to collusion between verifiers, the maximum privacy achievable for all parties involved.</p>
<p>SSI adopts the principle of Privacy by Design: adopting privacy starting from the design of a process to its IT implementations.</p>
<p>This philosophy makes the marriage of SSI and the Blockchain a particularly suitable solution for the creation of an app to manage Vaccinal Passport data that is secure, verifiable, and geared toward preserving the privacy of citizens.</p>

 Energy Web and Energy Peace Partners Announce Peace Renewable Energy Credit (P-REC) Digital Marketplace Platform <p>Zug, Switzerland and Sausalito, Calif. — 19 May 2021 — Today, Energy Web and <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/mission">Energy Peace Partners</a> (EPP) announced a new partnership to develop a digital marketplace platform to accelerate the development of renewable energy projects in fragile, energy-poor countries. EPP leverages climate finance solutions to promote peace and development by extending the renewable energy revolution to some of the planet’s most vulnerable populations. EPP developed the <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/prec">Peace Renewable Energy Credit</a> (P-REC), which certifies the social co-benefits of renewable energy in addition to renewables’ traditional environmental benefits.</p><p>An energy attribute certificate (EAC) — including renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the United States and guarantees of origin (GOs) in the EU — is an internationally-traded virtual commodity that represents 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable energy generated. P-RECs are issued under the I-REC Standard, the EAC standard in 40+ developing countries, and are issued as I-RECs with additional social co-benefits from new projects in fragile, energy-poor regions. To date, EPP has been authorized as the country issuer of P-RECs and I-RECs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan. The first-ever P-REC transaction occurred in the DRC in 2020 through a <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/blog/announcing-the-first-sale-of-p-recs">groundbreaking collaboration</a> between Microsoft, Nuru, 3Degrees (an Energy Web member), and&nbsp;EPP.</p><p>The digital marketplace platform will leverage the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a> open-source software development toolkit, harmonize with <a href="https://www.irecstandard.org/">The IREC Standard</a>, and be prepared to integrate with <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, an application to find and digitally source verified, emissions-free renewable energy globally. Simply put, the platform will lead to the development of a digital P-REC purchase option for renewable energy buyers, including individuals, that want to support the development of high-impact renewable energy projects for communities where these projects are installed.</p><p>The platform will help EPP market P-REC projects, increase demand among a wider set of corporate and individual buyers, scale up the global P-REC market, and facilitate P-REC transactions in a streamlined way. For Energy Web, this partnership will generate new open-source functionality for EW Origin to support digitized EAC “forward agreements” that enable buyers to easily commit to supporting additional renewable energy facilities, which in turn helps reduce the upfront costs of new facilities and improve financing terms.</p><p>“This is an incredibly exciting partnership and project,” said Sherwin Das, Managing Director of EPP. “Together we’re bringing a cutting-edge, digital solution that will contribute to scaling up the market for P-RECs and, in doing so, unlock more renewable energy investment in high-impact projects around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>“We’re proud to partner with EPP on this renewables marketplace,” added Doug Miller, global markets lead for Energy Web. “This partnership represents Energy Web’s first engagement with projects in Africa and a breakthrough opportunity to introduce digital tools that make it easy for local communities to attract renewable energy buyers who can help expand clean energy access and related social co-benefits in a frictionless way. This partnership will also result in a new standardized digital approach to renewable energy forward agreements that we think will serve as an attractive product for renewable energy buyers that want to support additional products outside of Africa, yet are simpler to implement than power purchase agreements, especially in regulated markets like most I-REC markets.”</p><p>Both EPP and I-REC Standard are also advisors to EW Zero, which in December <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-awarded-good-energies-foundation-grant-for-new-global-renewables-marketplace-794eaa7e14e0">received a grant</a> from the Good Energies Foundation to commercialize the platform. For the EPP P-REC marketplace, the joint team expects to complete an initial proof of concept (POC) by the end of&nbsp;2021.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>About Energy Peace Partners<br>The mission of Energy Peace Partners (EPP) is peace and stability for all, powered by renewable energy. EPP brings together expertise in international peacebuilding and renewable energy in order to leverage climate finance solutions that support peace in places affected by violent conflict. We believe that a paradigm shift toward climate-sensitive development can deliver enduring benefits to the planet’s most vulnerable populations. Our efforts create an enabling environment for introducing renewable energy that can serve as the building blocks for&nbsp;peace.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-and-energy-peace-partners-announce-peace-renewable-energy-credit-p-rec-digital-6295ea233218">Energy Web and Energy Peace Partners Announce Peace Renewable Energy Credit (P-REC) Digital…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The year's second OASIS Standard from the Business Document Exchange (BDXR) Technical Committee is available.</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 25 April 2021:</p>



<p>Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) Version 1.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>25 April 2021</p>



<p>The Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) has been developed jointly by UN/CEFACT and OASIS as the successor to the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) version 1.3 and the OASIS Business Document Envelope (BDE) Version 1.1.</p>



<p>XHE defines a business-oriented artifact either referencing (as a header) or containing (as an envelope) a payload of one or more business documents or other artifacts with supplemental semantic information about the collection of payloads as a whole. An exchange header envelope describes contextual information important to the sender and receiver about the payloads, without having to modify the payloads in any fashion. This vocabulary is modeled using the UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification Version 2.01.</p>



<p>The TC received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ph-xhe open source project, Chasquis Consulting, and Efact.</p>

<p>May 7, 2021</p>



<p>Re: A little-known Trans-Canada digital identity regime in the works, in whose interest? by Ken Rubin, The Hill Times, May 3, 2021.</p>



<p>Dear Editor,&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his column, “A little-known Trans-Canada digital identity regime in the works, in whose interest?”, Ken Rubin inaccurately writes that “On the legislative front, business-backed groups like the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada are calling for revamping Canada’s outdated public-sector Privacy Act to allow for a more permissive legal regime that clears the way for digital IDs and one-stop digitized government services. … Canadian governments need to hit ‘pause’ and rethink their digital identity scheme and digital legislation which are pushing sufficient and secure privacy protection largely aside.”</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ID ecosystem that will enable Canada’s full and beneficial participation in the global digital economy.</p>



<p>The DIACC has more than 100 members spanning several sectors including public policy leaders and chief information officers from the federal and provincial governments, networks for payments and for identity verification, technology service providers, strategy and integration experts and financial institutions.</p>



<p>The DIACC fully shares the author’s concern for Canadian’s privacy. This concern is why, for 10 years, the DIACC has built up this important sector as the trusted voice for driving the development of a pan-Canadian trust framework, standards, and initiatives that support the establishment of a fully digital, and privacy-respecting country that Canadians want. DIACC prioritizes a federated approach to work in alignment with Canada’s federal, provincial, territorial, and Indigienous governments. This approach does not support linking of identities, rather, it leverages and extends Privacy by Design principles to enable Canadians to choose which identity credentials they wish to use respecting diversity and promoting inclusion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://diacc.ca/2021/02/16/covid-has-accelerated-canadians-demand-for-digital-id/">recent research</a>, the majority of Canadians believe it is important for federal and provincial governments to move quickly on enabling digital ID in a safe and secure manner. It also shows that collaboration between governments and the private sector continues to be considered the best approach to create a pan-Canadian digital ID framework.</p>



<p>In today’s digital economy, and as the pandemic has made clear, Canadians should be empowered to give informed consent for its use across multiple platforms and in economic areas where proving identity is crucial for secure transactions.</p>



<p>Establishing digital ID that works for Canadians is not about creating one identity to be used for surveillance or tracking. It’s about using the credentials that Canadians already have offline (eg: passports, driver’s licenses, health cards, citizenship cards, bank cards, student cards); having those credentials securely issued digitally; and being able to use them for digital transactions&nbsp; —&nbsp; from opening a bank account from the comfort of home, to accessing medical records, to receiving government benefits quickly and easily.</p>



<p>When it comes to legislation, there is no clear policy directive in C-11 that allows Canadians to understand what they can expect in terms of accessing the data the public services have about them. This is why it’s essential for the federal government to empower Canadians to be able to use the credentials associated with them in a modern digital economy, with security and privacy. If Canada is going to be a modern digital society and economy, Canadians must understand what they can expect about data that exists about them in both the public and private sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canadian governments should not ‘hit pause’ on digital ID, they should be investing in truly unlocking digital. Investing in digital ID not only makes economic sense but also establishes digital tools to support societal trust, provides security, strengthens privacy, and mitigates fraud. This is a win for all.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Joni Brennan<br>President, Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada</p>

<p>Owning and accessing an official proof of identity <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/10/12/11-billion-invisible-people-without-id-are-priority-for-new-high-level-advisory-council-on-identification-for-development">remains a challenge for over 1 billion people in the world.</a> This lack of documented identity disproportionately affects marginalized groups like women and ethnic minorities, especially in developing nations where barriers exist to the issuing of basic credentials like birth certificates or national identity documents. Without a functional identity, marginalized communities remain unable to take advantage of key financial, educational, and political resources the digital world can provide. This disparity is a primary focus for the global community. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals even enumerated <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">Goal 16.9</a> with a specific target: By 2030, providing legal identity for all, including birth registration. If even basic analog identifiers are out of the reach of people across the globe, then digital identity proves nearly impossible for them to obtain. Though Canada remains a leader in digital identity, challenges remain with complete integration of marginalized communities into their developed digital identity ecosystems. This post stands to outline the global problem, and provide insight into a global solution framework which could possibly be applied to the Canadian context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A gender divide in digital access has been prevalent for decades, and has widened over the past years between developed and developing countries. Roughly 330 million fewer women than men have access to a smartphone and the mobile internet. <a href="http://www.oecd.org/digital/bridging-the-digital-gender-divide.pdf">They are 26% less likely to own a mobile device, and in South Asia and Africa those proportions stand at 70% and 34% respectively.</a> Without access to the mobile internet and the ability to affirm their digital identity, people are left unable to utilize key resources that could help sustain them and their families. These resources could include access to financial accounts, employment opportunities, microfinance applications, digital platforms to create independent income, public health and healthcare initiatives, and the breadth of the Internet as a place to gain knowledge and skills. With ready access to these digital platforms, marginalized communities can find financial stability and health resources that will improve their quality of life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Economic development organizations such as the World Bank are developing strategies to introduce Digital ID frameworks to its member countries. The World Bank’s Identity for Development (<a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/370121518449921710/Guidelines-for-ID4D-Diagnostics.pdf">ID4D</a>) Diagnostics provides a possible methodology to identify ways to improve identity management systems around the world. Inclusion is a key priority for ID4D, with a focus on systems with high levels of coverage and access. The universality of coverage is defined in both longitudinal and latitudinal terms. Longitudinal coverage spans the lifetime of an individual, while latitudinal coverage refers to the breadth of society the system covers. Accessibility requires the removal of barriers to usage and disparities in the availability of information and technology. ID4D stresses the importance of “inclusion by design”, tasking system builders to communicate with marginalized communities to see where legal, social, and economic gaps may exist to avoid further exacerbating them. According to ID4D, these identity systems should also possess a high level of interoperability. Interoperable systems are more efficient, both in time and money, and allow for integration across multiple platforms. It also suggests using open standards, rather than proprietary technology, which foster innovation in the system and encourage technological advances to be made.</p>



<p>Does the way that ID4D is applied in developing nations provide any lessons for how a developed country can better serve its marginalized communities? Do other solution frameworks exist to map a developed digital identity ecosystem for gaps in coverage and access? By asking these questions, we begin a conversation that will result in improving identity access for all. When connected to a digital identity, marginalized communities are able to take advantage of a wealth of resources that can improve their financial, social, and political standing. In turn, this supports sustainable growth in their home country and contributes to a system where all can benefit.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/tag/blockchain/"></a>This video is about, why and how China decided to go digital. What is the Digital Yuan? How does the Digital Currency work? Is DCEP a cryptocurrency? Is the digital Yuan blockchain based? 
 Video Summary 
<p>The nature of money is something that the average person living a thousand or one hundred or maybe even ten years ago spent a very little time thinking about outside of a few major economic crashes.</p>
<p>Money was a relatively constant and predictable thing in our lives, but in the last decade or so, the very nature of it has started to change with digital payments, mobile wallets, cryptocurrency and most recently the first ever attempt at a real digital currency by a major economy. The Chinese government started rolling out its digital Yuan, officially called the DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) and small pilot projects last year.</p>
<p>China started talking about its own digital currency in 2013 for the first time the same year, WeChat, the country’s most popular messaging and social app, launched its mobile wallet, following in the footsteps of Alibaba Alipay. Alibaba’s Alipay was launched in February 2004.</p>
<p>Four years after that is in 2009 Bitcoin was launched. At first, the new digital currency seemed like little more than a side project of the government going through a couple of years of relatively slow research and development phase. But their focus started intensifying dramatically around 2017, leading to the first public trials in 2020 spending for Chinese cities and hundreds of merchants. And the timing of this increased interest is no coincidence.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit its first real peak in valuation, creating widespread awareness for cryptocurrency around the world. In 2018, Facebook announced Libra with bold ambitions to create a cross-border currency for its over two billion users during this year’s mobile wallet exploded in popularity and China online lending through Internet companies ballooned to huge proportions in the country.</p>
<p>And the United States government launched its trade war against China, which increased the risk of financial sanctions. Within the span of just a few years, the entire Chinese monetary system, including its currency and its traditional banking sector, started facing major threats from both inside and outside of the country. Domestically, Tencent and Alibaba, China’s two largest tech companies, started to gobble up the entire finance industry of the country.</p>
<p>Their respective mobile wallets came to dominate the category, and mobile payments skyrocketed in popularity to mind blowing 32 percent of all sales in the country, leading to many merchants simply stopping to accept other payment methods, including cash or credit cards completely. Given their incredible growth, the two are now on a path to swallow up almost all payment in the country within just a few years.</p>
<p>And these two giants were increasingly starting to strike exclusivity deals with more and more merchants, meaning that consumers even now often have no choice but to use their services. Not only that, most giants and group especially also got heavily involved in offering other financial services like loans or insurances on the backs of their wallets. The group has an incredibly detailed picture of its users, including how they make and spend money both online and offline.</p>
<p>Combining financial services with e-commerce and social media profiles in real time create such strong synergies that traditional institutions simply cannot compete with them. And to top things off, a few months back, Jack Ma from the Alibaba Group even expressed in his now infamous speech that he thought the law’s traditional financial institutions have to operate under strict rules on the amount of cash banks have to keep in reserves in order to avoid potential bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Chinese government was also becoming increasingly wary internationally. In 2019, vice president of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, explained why he thought the country needed an alternative to the SWIFT system. SWIFT is an organization that handles the communication for the majority of international bank transfers. Basically, most of the time somebody wants to make an international transaction. They send the message to SWIFT, who processes it and sends it to the right recipient.</p>
<p>The system is slow and ancient and the organization does most of its processing in Europe and the U.S. and the U.S. in particular has used Swift in the past to spy on transactions using the NSA. It has ceased transactions between citizens of third-party countries like Germany and Denmark that it had deemed unlawful. China, especially since the start of its trade war with the United States, sees its reliance on the swift system as a major source of danger for its sovereignty and thinks that the system could be used to essentially cut it out of the international financial world altogether.</p>
<p>And finally, China also started getting increasingly nervous about crypto currencies, as on the long term, those could potentially replace the Yuan altogether, leaving no control over its currency in the government’s hand at all. It has banned cryptocurrency exchanges and then the cryptocurrency themselves from being used as money to pay for things in the country. A couple of years down the line, cryptocurrency could become a real danger to their control over the economy.</p>
<p>China decided to turn to the digital yuan project, among other things, starting with its most urgent domestic priorities. It designed the DCEP to specifically combat mobile wallets by giving it not only the convenience of those wallets, but also many of the characteristics of a national currency like the regular Yuan. Digital Yuan is issued by the People’s Bank of China and can be withdrawn by them as well. The value of the two are designed to match. They are supposed to be freely exchangeable. Interestingly, the DCEP is also supposed to be usable even without an Internet connection, just like cash. So two users in a remote part of the country could transact on their phones and their transactions would sync back up once they got online again.</p>
<p>And importantly, the DCEP is also designed to be a legal tender again, just like a cash, meaning that, legally speaking, everybody taking digital payments into the country would have to accept it as a payment method. Once it rolls out a policy. There is no doubt specifically aimed at breaking up the quasi monopolies and which they have built over the years. And DCP intends to be just as convenient to the end user as existing mobile wallets as well. So users could get a mobile wallet from a number of approved financial institutions like banks.</p>
<p>They would sign up for an account with a phone number and then they would pay by scanning QR codes via NFC, etc.. The big difference, of course, is that it’s not Alibaba or WeChat processing the day to day transactions, but the banks, many of which are state owned and all of which are closely regulated.</p>
<p>Jack Ma disappeared from public life completely for over two months. Already, it seems clear that the government prefers to deal with the traditional finance players over the tech companies. Now, these banks will then all have to periodically report all DCEP transactions back to the government, which means the government will be able to see all transactions in the system. It could trace each one back to real human existence or phone numbers are legally required to be tied to real identities in China. It could create similarly detailed profiles of its citizens based on their shopping habits that currently WeChat and Alibaba can. It could simply directly give citizens with a DCEP wallet, money, safe or tax returns or unemployment benefits or whatever.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the first pilot programs for the currency have started in the country. Citizens don’t particularly seem to care about it, since it doesn’t seem to do functionally anything new over their existing mobile wallets already. The Chinese government theoretically has plenty of unfair advantages over commercial players. While the DCEP cuts out Swift as a middleman, which is indeed important for China, it simply adds the Chinese government as an even more powerful overlord there.</p>
<p>Instead, in its current form, the DCEB is a fully centralized system. For example, the Chinese government on its own can monitor all transactions and it can basically create and destroy money across users wallets as it pleases. While this might work domestically for its own citizens and companies, but any major country would accept doing serious business over it in its current form. International payments and decentralization for now are a big question mark.</p>
<p>The Bahamas and Cambodia technically both beat China by launching their respective digital currencies called the Sand Dollar &amp; Bakong. The Cambodian currency is even block chain based unlike China. Sand dollar might just be the coolest official currency name ever.</p>
<p>The most interesting and definitely most unfortunate example of a country trying and failing to launch a state issued cryptocurrency has to be Venezuela and it is called the Petro. It was announced in 2017 as an alternative currency backed by the country’s vast oil and mineral reserves. While the country’s regular currency was going through some of the world’s worst hyperinflation, it sadly didn’t work.</p>

An industry panel also shared how leading-edge companies are leveraging data science and explored the expanding role of data science in healthcare, telecommunications, and IT services.</p>
 Eastern Regional Network 
<p>Through collaboration and partnership with organizations such as the Eastern Regional Network, Edge strives to understand how to support resource and technology collaborations among smaller, mid-sized, and under-resourced campuses, and is considered a thought leader in broadening the reach for advanced cyberinfrastructure:</p>
<p>October 2020 – participated as a panelist in “Towards Equitable Access to HPC Resources” session of The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) workshop: Mathematical and Computational Approaches for the Einstein Field Equations with Matter Fields. This was a virtual workshop hosted by Brown University (https://t.co/UBBdMIXCJ3)&nbsp;</p>
<p>December 2020 – Edge was a co-lead for the Eastern Regional Network’s Broadening the Reach Workshop in December 2020 where more than 50 schools were represented. The virtual workshop brought together representatives from smaller, mid-sized, and under-resourced campuses, including MSIs, HSIs, HBCUs, and EPSCoR institutions, to identify, understand, and quantify science drivers, the cyberinfrastructure needed to support the applications, and the challenges and opportunities at participating institutions. The workshop also provided an opportunity to share information about available regional and national resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 2020 – Forough Ghahramani, Edge and John Hicks, Internet2, both co-leads for the ERN Broadening the Reach working group, shared results of the Eastern Regional Network “Broadening the Reach” workshop at the Internet2 webinar “Identifying Cyberinfrastructure Gaps for Under-resourced Institutions.” Recommendations were shared on how to support resource and technology collaborations among smaller, mid-sized, and under-resourced campuses.</p>
 The Global Connected Healthcare Cybersecurity Virtual 2021 Workshop Series&nbsp; 
<p>This workshop series was presented by the IEEE SA, IEEE/UL P2933 Standards Working Group and the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub headquartered at Columbia University.</p>
<p>(February 2021) Forough Ghahramani co-facilitated the inaugural Global Connected Healthcare Cybersecurity “Technology and Policy Considerations in Connected Healthcare” session. The workshop convened a community of leaders in healthcare, technology, and policy to develop mutual understanding and recommendations to address the risks in connected healthcare cybersecurity and envision a roadmap for standards and actions to improve connected healthcare cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The April 2021 Global Connected Health Cybersecurity Workshop’s second event in the series focused on “Privacy, Ethics, and Trust in Connected Healthcare.” Ghahramani co-facilitated the “Ethical Considerations for Connected Healthcare” session which addressed Privacy and Ethics requirements in connected healthcare and IoT systems and how design and development is vital to develop trust in using IoT based systems in the healthcare domain. IoT based connected healthcare systems require an appreciation of both the ethico-legal milieu and the sociopolitical landscape. It has been noticed that one of the issues in the low adoption of IoT applications among end-users is the lack of trust in connected healthcare and IoT devices concerning data protection, privacy, and safety. Workshop participants explored the latest technologies, challenges, and regulations regarding privacy, ethics, and trust for connected health IoT systems and shared recommendations for the future.</p>
 NJBigData Alliance 
<p>Forough Ghahramani organized and led the research track sessions at the 8th Annual New Jersey Big Data Alliance (NJBDA) Symposium hosted by Princeton University on April 30. This track showcased important research being conducted at New Jersey institutions in the areas of smart cities, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data. In addition, student poster presentations were made available during the two-day virtual event. The symposium captured information and research that will continue to be a value to institutions, the State, and the economy.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>With a mission of helping to advance the frontiers of research and innovation, EdgeDiscovery continues to look for new ways to provide access to leading-edge technology, advanced computing resources, and training for the research community. “One of the most important pillars of EdgeDiscovery is education and empowering the next generation of innovators who will propel science and technology into the future,” explains Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To aid in this mission, Edge is pleased to be part of the Verizon New Jersey Public, Educational or Government (PEG) Training and Equipment Program which provides resources and education for developing creative media literacy in the community. Dr. Ghahramaini explains futher, “Through this program, video production and editing equipment and training are available for the development of local programming content that can be shown on local PEG access channels.” As the program implementation coordinator, Edge helps to manage the program and act as an interface for participating County and Community colleges.</p>
<p>Through the PEG Program, any municipal-authorized representative or resident can take a free Basic Video Production training course at a participating County or Community College and then be eligible to borrow a complete location video production system to record a community event or program. Once the video shoot is complete, the authorized representative or resident can edit the footage at the participating County or Community College in order to produce a complete video program, ready for broadcast on the local PEG channels. An Advanced Video Production training course is also available, once the Basic Training has been successfully completed.</p>

		<p>Meeting the Community’s Changing Needs<br>
In addition to program management, the Verizon PEG Program provides equipment, technical support, application development, training resources, and maintenance. Edge has developed software for tracking course enrollment information, inventory, and equipment loans, as well as an inventory management program to track usage of the PEG equipment and its necessary maintenance. The inventory management service provides a secure web program interface with locally segregated data entry so institutions can provide periodic information on the website including dates when PEG equipment is borrowed and returned, a description of the PEG equipment that is borrowed, and the attendance of students in PEG training courses. The number of people who participate in PEG training and use the program to develop local programming content can be easily tracked through the use of a registration application.</p>
<p>Participating institutions also have access to customized editing software and licensing of off-the-shelf programming pieces to be used to enhance local programming and its content by individuals and municipalities. To bring the various colleges together and create a forum for information sharing and collaboration, Edge is leveraging the EdgeXchange platform’s to create a “Creative Media” community where institutions can share their experiences and best practices.</p>
<p>While the pandemic stalled many programs in the last year, schools involved in the PEG Program were able to leverage Verizon resources to quickly adapt to changing needs and social distancing requirements. One such school is Gloucester County Institute of Technology (GCIT), a four-year vocational-technical public high school in Gloucester County, New Jersey. “GCIT is a traditional vocational school, with students coming here to pursue disciplines like, allied health, finance, and engineering,” says John Mondelli, Educational Network Operations Manager, Gloucester County Educational Campus. “The Gloucester County Educational Network, based out of GCIT, went on the air in 1998. We work with all county school districts, in addition to providing students with an opportunity to produce and strengthen their technical skills. We create videos to promote what is going on at GCIT, as well as activities at the County College and other schools in the community. Our team creates promotional videos for three special service schools—one dedicated to autistic children and two institutions that are dedicated to helping elementary and high school students with special needs.”</p>
<p>Over the past year, events shifted from in person to virtual audiences, requiring videos to be created and livestreamed to surrounding areas. “We have several small towns in our area and have a countywide channel,” explains Mondelli. “The pandemic caused a huge change, where fans couldn’t attend sporting events and audiences were not allowed at other in-person activities. We have been helping to livestream sporting events, virtual graduations, theater performances, and press conferences; as well as creating short videos to promote small businesses, economic development, school information, and student athletes on social media. Plus, if an organization needs camera equipment to record town hall or school board meetings, for example, we are able to supply this equipment, thanks to the Verizon PEG Program.”</p>

		<p>Cultivating Real-Life Experiences<br>
Brookdale Community College has been involved in the PEG Program for several years and has seen the initiative evolve from its early beta stages into the program it is today. “Over the past few years, I’ve noticed that since the camera equipment we have is not the best quality, more and more community members are purchasing their own cameras and want to utilize the computer for editing purposes,” shares Lauren Concar, Video Production Specialist, Brookdale Television (BTV), located at Brookdale Community College. “One of our recent projects included Monika Henreid, the daughter of Paul Henreid from the film, Casablanca. She was working on a documentary about her father and had returned from Morocco with years and years of footage she needed to edit. One of our students worked with her and our producer; gaining invaluable ground level experience. This endeavor was a perfect match for Brookdale and the Verizon PEG Program and we were able to help her create an amazing historic documentary about a Hollywood legend.”</p>
<p>BTV is a non-profit Educational Access Channel that can be viewed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. “BTV is unique as a PEG access station because we create our own content,” explains Concar. “Even in the year 2000, we were light years ahead of any other PEG access cable channel. Everything was in high definition (HD), and we created content like documentaries and talk shows. Several non-profit external clients hire our production company to produce high quality content, including web videos, press conferences, and commercials. We also host different workshops on lighting and camera skills, where the Verizon PEG Program has been a great fit and has helped enhance those educational opportunities.”</p>
<p>BTV offers both internships and mentorships for high school and college students in the area to expose them to real-world experiences in television production. “We go into classrooms to showcase BTV and look for students interested in the industry,” says Concar. “At BTV, we take students under our wing and help them to gain knowledge and experience in pre-production, production, and post-production. Students are exposed to all different roles and while we’re run by a professional staff, we give students hands-on opportunities, like directing a live basketball game. Students also work with producers throughout the entire creative process and learn to understand how to bring someone’s vision to life.”</p>
<p>During the pandemic, students were not able to attend onsite classes and BTV stepped in to help create labs for students to watch from home. “We produced a large variety of individual labs for different academic departments, including radiology, culinary arts, chemistry, and health sciences, where teachers were able to explain lessons and demonstrate experiments. Luckily we have been mobile for years and have access to high-quality equipment, so we adapted quickly and avoided being thrown off course when COVID threw us a curveball.”</p>
<p>Concar is also the Executive Director of the Garden State Film Festival (GSFF) which celebrates New Jersey’s independent film genre and provides a forum where local and other independent filmmakers can showcase their work. “I became involved in the Festival through my affiliation with Brookdale Television 19 years ago. This event typically has over 30,000 attendees, with 300 films from over 25 countries. GSFF is certainly a labor of love and provides Brookdale students with real-world experience in the industry. Normally people travel to New Jersey from all over the world, but COVID forced this year’s event to quickly shift from in person to virtual. We only had eleven days to pivot and create our own livestream platform. Despite this challenge, this year’s GSFF was a huge success, not only because we were the first and only festival to present in 2020 without postponing or cancelling, but the event marked the first time we had a global reach and could show a larger group of people the incredible talent and creativity that is thriving here in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>Municipalities are encouraged to take advantage of this free program in order to increase the amount of locally produced programs on the PEG channels. For additional information, please contact <a href="mailto:PEG@NJEdge.net">PEG@NJEdge.net</a> or a participating County or Community College.</p>

		<p>New Jersey strives to create a community where creativity and innovation flourish and provides pathways for the State’s diverse talent to reach their full potential; strengthening New Jersey’s long-term economic competitiveness. With a mission of helping to grow the state’s economy, TechUnited New Jersey is a member consortium that offers business development, education, and networking opportunities to help nurture and strengthen organizations. “We help empower entrepreneurs, instigators, and innovators to build a better future for all,” says Aaron Price, President &amp; CEO, TechUnited. “Our programs, along with our mentorship, investment, and job opportunities, all focus on supporting the thought leaders of the region.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>TechUnited aims to establish New Jersey as a world-recognized model for creating a diverse and inclusive technology community. “We want to accelerate the growth of entrepreneurs’ businesses by helping them to raise capital, hire talent, and find corporate clients,” says Price. “Our fund, the Tech Council Ventures, invests in community members and helps companies grow inside the doors of corporate organizations, like our partners Verizon or the Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG). One of the main strengths of the region is the very strong talent pool, and we want to ensure that we’re connecting both sides of that marketplace.”</p>
<p>Joining in TechUnited’s commitment to creating a region of prosperity and opportunity, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) implements programs and initiatives that invest in local businesses and communities and builds a diverse workforce. Richard Kasmin, Chief Economist and Director of Policy and Data Analytics at NJEDA, helps the Authority deliver on their mission of making New Jersey a national model for sustainable and equitable economic growth.</p>
<p>Kasmin manages policy and data analytic efforts, including overseeing competitive grant programs and reviewing different state programs using economic program analysis. “As an economist, I try to think in terms of costs and benefits and making those elements calculable,” says Kasmin. “When determining how to allocate funds, we can make more informed decisions by adding the language of economics to the discussion.”</p>

		<p>Fostering Community Involvement<br>
TechUnited, NJEDA, Edge, and the New Jersey Big Data Alliance (NJBDA) recently joined together to distribute a State of the State of Innovation in New Jersey online survey to the broader New Jersey community to gather input from organizations on what they feel is working well in the State and where additional resources are needed. “Upon first look at the data gathered from this survey, the respondents agree that the availability of skilled human capital in New Jersey is exceptional,” shares Kasmin. “The access to talent and the ability to network with other organizations are very important factors to a healthy innovation ecosystem. The areas we need to improve include broadening access to localized financial capital and developing more of an investment ethos in the State. To help achieve this desired culture of innovation, the efforts within New Jersey need to become more cohesive. We already have many skilled people in the public and private sectors that are helping build an innovation ecosystem and culture. With more focus on this goal from a larger portion of the population, I believe we can begin to make significant strides.”</p>
<p>Price agrees that New Jersey must lean into the strengths of the region and showcase the State as a beneficial place to start and grow a business. “The community does recognize the strong talent pool in New Jersey and the impressive colleges and universities that help create career-ready graduates. One of the biggest challenges we hear from local start-ups is a lack of funding because there is not a large community of investors in New Jersey. We do see several corporations in the State that are eager to acquire and grow companies and be seen as innovators. My hope is that a greater number of entrepreneurs who are building businesses choose New Jersey because of the community of people who want to see them succeed and are committed to helping that happen. Then as the business community and relationships within the region continue to grow, we, in turn, attract more investors.”</p>
<p>Once the State of the State of Innovation in New Jersey results are published, industry, academia, and government communities, along with the entrepreneurship and innovation community, will be able to gather more in-depth insight into the opportunities that are available and the challenges the State has yet to overcome. “Information we gather from this survey will provide a narrative that’s backed by data and gives a starting point for leaders to begin discussing where the need for improvement exists,” says Price. “The survey provided insights into the needs and challenges, as well as opportunities, for New Jersey’s innovation ecosystem, “ says Forough Ghahramani, Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs at Edge, “The findings and recommendations will serve as important input to the State, academic institutions, the investment community, resulting in enhanced service offerings and educational programs for innovators and entrepreneurs. Results of the survey will inform policy decisions as well as curriculum decisions for institutions of higher education about the skill requirements for the necessary workforce and the resource and services that universities can provide for entrepreneurs and the innovation ecosystem. Organizations such as Edge, NJBDA, and TechUnited will leverage the results to develop necessary programming to strengthen the New Jersey Innovation ecosystem. In addition, TechUnited advocates from a state policy perspective and we’re able to leverage these data-driven results to shine a light on the region’s top challenges and hopefully work toward finding solutions.”</p>
<p>Kasmin adds, “With this gained knowledge, we will likely have greater advocacy for changes in certain public policies; helping promote diversity inclusion and creating a stronger and fairer economy in New Jersey.” Further notes Dr. David G Belanger, Senior Lecturer, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Vice President-Entrepreneurship at New Jersey Big Data Alliance, “This survey is a huge step in helping us understand, in detail, how innovative companies in New Jersey are using advanced technologies such as Big Data, AI, and Machine Learning; and what they view as their current and upcoming needs. For the academic member institutions of NJBDA, this valuable information will show us what we need to bring to New Jersey in terms of skilled employees and research capabilities.”</p>

		<p>Leading Digital Transformation<br>
Coming from the American University, Sandell led teams through multiple rounds of strategy and modernization, working to update infrastructure systems and implement software for student recruitment and advancement. “I like leading with a technology vision and infusing that approach into every dimension of the organization,” says Sandell. “I was drawn to the immersive tech aspect of NJIT and I was inspired by the trajectory that the University has taken over the last several years, especially in research; they have grown by leaps and bounds. Growth and purpose can work hand in hand, and as the principal architect of enterprise technology strategy, I can help take the larger academic enterprise through this digital transformation.”</p>
<p>Sandell joined NJIT amid the pandemic, requiring her immediate focus to be on ensuring that classroom support teams and technology were in place, including extensive back-up plans. “We needed a great deal of fallback orchestration, including an A team, B team, and C team,” explains Sandell. “When tackling the challenges of an event like the pandemic, you bond with people very quickly. My first priority was to identify what we were doing that semester and then create a strategy that leads to a three-year roadmap, including plans that support the research happening on campus. My top areas of focus include research computing and data science, high-performance computing (HPC) or grid computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, edge computing and 5G, and how we’re managing cloud infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Creating a Culture of Partnership<br>
To understand the needs of the research community, Sandell says involving researchers and faculty members is essential. “I need faculty at the table to identify what would truly make a difference in the research space and how they go about making that difference. NJIT is pushing to grow our impact in art sciences, data sciences, and environment and sustainability. With the involvement of deans and faculty, we can determine how to expand into translational research and support the larger community of researchers in achieving their missions.”</p>
<p>As one of three institutes in the state earning the highest research rating (R1), NJIT not only strives to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration, but recognizes the importance of cooperation and networking within the larger education and research community. “One of the first phone calls I made was to Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge, and in our discussion, she informed me of National Science Foundation (NSF) grant opportunities that could be beneficial to NJIT,” says Sandell. “EdgeDiscovery has an inspiring agenda and we will need a great deal of support from Edge going forward. We will look to partner with experienced transformation leaders like them to help guide us on this journey.”</p>
<p>Building a Collaborative Learning Community<br>
Through their partnership, NJIT and Edge exchange insights and information they hear from within the research and education community and share strategies that have worked for other organizations. “My work connects me to people like Dr. Ghahramani and others at Edge, and we build an ecosystem of like-minded people—a learning community—where we push each other to think differently,” says Sandell.</p>
<p>To match the rapid growth in research at NJIT, Sandell says they will be required to upscale the core cybersecurity infrastructure to continue to meet the unique needs of their researchers. “Our faculty’s input is vitally important in determining the most suitable infrastructure mechanisms and models for NJIT and helping create an institution-wide process to support all the research at the University. Through these transparent, collaborative discussions, we are also driving a cultural change and giving everyone a voice in how we navigate our digital transformation going forward.”</p>

		<p>Wireless network technology continues to rapidly evolve, making impressive strides since the 1880s when radio waves were first discovered. Today, we live in a world of high-speed data, broadband video, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT)—fueling an endless array of personal and business possibilities. To investigate and test these new technologies and the delivery of wireless, Rutgers University, Columbia University, and NYU have partnered with the National Science Foundation (NSF)— along with several organizations including New York City, City College New York (CCNY), University of Arizona, Silicon Harlem, and IBM—to design, develop, and deploy a city-scale advanced wireless testbed. The project, known as Cloud Enhanced Open Software Defined Mobile Wireless Testbed for City-Scale Deployment (COSMOS), aims to support real-world experimentation on next-generation wireless technologies and applications. The federated international testbed will enable experimental research on a wide range of optical, wireless, software-defined networking (SDN), inter-domain routing, and edge computing experiments at a global scale. Researchers will be able to run experiments remotely on the COSMOS testbed by logging into a web-based portal which will provide various facilities for experiment execution, measurements, and data collection.</p>
<p>Predecessor projects to COSMOS include the Open-Access Research Testbed for Next-Generation Wireless Networks (ORBIT) and Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI). “Due to the ever-changing nature and scale of both the Internet and wireless technology, experimental exploration was important to help address the issues that were arising,” says Ivan Seskar, WINLAB Chief Technology Officer, COSMOS Program Director, Rutgers University. “With this mission in mind, the NSF created a consortium, called the Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR), to build three to four city-scale advanced wireless research data beds with a goal of accelerating the innovation and commercialization of wireless technologies that are used by academic and industry researchers.”</p>
<p>Supporting Real-World Experimentation<br>
In addition to its participation in the PAWR program, COSMOS, through its sister program COSM-IC, aims at the development of an international networking and wireless testbed by federating US research testbeds including COSMOS, ORBIT, FABRIC, and PEERING with experimental facilities in Ireland, Greece, Brazil, and Japan. “Since the goal is to advance wireless research and support real-world experimentation, advanced components are a necessity,” explains Seskar. “We approached Columbia and NYU and decided the best location for deployment of these tests would be outside. Normally, all the processing is happening very close to the antennae on a street-level or rooftop base station. Now, we are looking at pushing computing to the edge, as close as possible to the user and next to where the wireless signal gets into the infrastructure. With this setup, the optical transport becomes an integral part of the whole complexity and enables remote experimentation.”</p>
<p>The COSMOS testbed will be deployed in upper Manhattan, covering one square mile in West Harlem, consisting of 40-50 advanced software-defined radio nodes, along with fiber-optic front-haul and back-haul networks and edge and core cloud computing infrastructure. With a focus of bringing together research addressing critical technological, social, and civic challenges facing the world’s megacities, the densely populated location is ideal for pushing the latency and bandwidth limits and enabling the consortium to gather valuable insight. “The pilot phase of the project began in 2018, with the pilot rooftop deployment of one large node and two medium nodes at Columbia and one large and one medium node at the WINLAB facility,” says Seskar. “This placement helped determine if the design is functional and sound. Later in 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established the Innovation Zone for the COSMOS deployment area. This beneficial milestone gave us access to several frequencies that are not typically allowed; enabling us to run experiments in frequency bands that are of national interest.” </p>
<p>Originally planned for March of last year, the deployment of the first phase of a testbed across Columbia and CCNY sites, along with a COSMOS control center at Rutgers, was delayed due to COVID-19. “Unfortunately, the pandemic was an immense challenge and pushed our timeline, but we are now officially in Phase 1 deployment. Thankfully, we have a vibrant research community that can use sandboxes to develop tools and proof of concept ‘software’ and conduct experiments with the indoor deployment of our equipment. We also have a Phase 2 planned, conditional on funding. This stage would be the deployment of a testbed across Columbia, CCNY, and NYC sites, which is essentially scaling up by adding more nodes and involving more city assets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commitment to Outreach and Education<br>
Silicon Harlem, a COSMOS partner, is an organization dedicated to transforming Harlem into a technology and innovation hub and has established a growing tech ecosystem in Upper Manhattan. The goal of Silicon Harlem is to develop an accessible broadband infrastructure, reproducible in urban markets that is affordable, fast, resilient, and smart and supports inclusive opportunities in STEM education. The organization operates as one of the interfaces between the COSMOS partners and the local community, aiming to integrate the testbed elements within the community and various smart city programs. “We’ve partnered with Silicon Harlem from day one,” shares Seskar. “We wanted to broaden our reach and make sure the larger community could benefit from this project. The focus was to develop educational materials and bring wireless research to the community lab.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the partnership with Silicon Harlem, the consortium created the COSMOS Education Toolkit, a curriculum that blends the three disciplines of mathematics, science, and computer science and helps prepare students to be competitive in the workforce. Made up of seventy-five math labs, thirty-five science labs, and fifteen computer science labs, the toolkit offers lesson plans and worksheets for grades K-12 in a variety of subjects within each discipline. “In developing this toolkit, we recruited teachers from local high schools and middle schools to use our advanced wireless testbeds,” explains Seskar. “We received fabulous ideas from these educators and they helped transform the testbed-generated research into an innovative learning platform for students.”</p>
<p>Students are able to learn basic, as well as advanced STEM concepts, through running experiments either locally or on the COSMOS testbed. Especially for schools lacking resources, the COSMOS toolkit enables remote access for a larger number of students and provides hands-on learning that can help prepare learners for a successful future in STEM. “We have also expanded the program to include college students, called the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), and the program for local teachers, called the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)” says Seskar. “REU allows students to participate in creative activities, including escape rooms and 5G EdTech challenges from Verizon. The summer program exposes students to research early in their academic careers and connects them with faculty—encouraging them to explore advanced degree options. Similarly, the RET program allows teachers to develop interesting experiments for their STEM curriculums.”</p>
<p>Improving Testbed Performance<br>
The COSMOS platform’s technical architecture is designed to meet both quantitative and qualitative requirements associated with a fully programmable city-scale shared multiuser advanced wireless testbed facility. Radio nodes in COSMOS provide a mix of fully programmable SDRs for flexible wireless experimentation, as well as commercial hardware capable of supporting networking and applications research with currently available end-user devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main goals of the COSMOS testbed is to take advantage of the educational and research experience of its academic and industry partners, like Edge, and transform the testbed-generated research into an innovative learning platform for students. “At the moment, we have campuses that are connecting over public internet, but we are trying to get dedicated secure connections between these institutions in order to improve testbed performance,” explains Seskar. “With a goal of getting a hundred gigabyte per second link to the 32 Avenue of the Americas (ALA) in New York City, we are currently deploying equipment at this point of presence. This connection will help open doors to mega research fiber points, international collaborations, and give us permanent connectivity to our COSMOS counterparts in Japan, Europe, and Brazil.

		<p>Approaching education with a cross-disciplinary approach, the School of Business at Stevens Institute of Technology offers a curriculum that integrates business and leadership development with technology and data. In today’s fast-paced world, every business is a tech business and acquiring a diverse set of skills, including technology, can help students seize more career opportunities. “After decades spent in technology and financial industries, I was looking for the next step in my career,” shares Dr. George Calhoun, Director of Undergraduate Quantitative Finance, Professor, and Executive Director of the Hanlon Financial Systems Center, Stevens Institute of Technology. “In 2003, I responded to an ad in The Economist about a new business school being formed at Stevens. They were looking for a candidate who had both a business and technology background to help further expand their business programs.”</p>
<p>Prior to joining Stevens, Calhoun spent thirty years in the high-tech segment of the wireless communications industry, involved in the early development and commercialization of digital wireless architectures. “The radio channel was not fully engineerable in the conventional sense and the challenge over the years has been to figure out how to design a robust and high capacity radio signal that can support what people want to do,” says Calhoun. “Reflecting back, I was involved with two companies that were both in the middle of high technology development and advancement—early on in the wireless communications sector; later in the financial services sector.” Flash forward in the last ten to fifteen years with the financial industry and Calhoun notes, “Technology has jumed out in front of the management capabilities of the financial industry, and they are trying to catch up. Now, coming into academia as a businessman was helpful, because I had a deeper understanding of the industry and how to think in terms of product development and customers.”</p>
<p>Creating Tech-Savvy Graduates<br>
Bringing his extensive experience and unique perspective to Stevens, Calhoun began by determining how to help expand the reach and recognition of the business school. “While Stevens is only fifteen minutes from Manhattan via train, there was little interaction with the financial world of New York and New Jersey at the time,” explains Calhoun. “Around the turn of the century, the financial industry started looking at Stevens as a source for recruiting students who had hard technology skills, including knowledge in quantitative methods and computer science. I spoke with over twenty-five companies in the financial services sector and beyond, like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Honeywell, to determine what they were looking for from a graduate who is entering the financial services industry. The answers were consistent—they are seeking tech-savvy students who understand computer science, as well as financial domains, including finance, accounting, economics, capital markets, investment banking, and securitization.”</p>
<p>After these discussions, Calhoun concluded that there was an important business opportunity to develop a more focused program curriculum that would meet the targeted skills of the financial industry. “We used this insight to create an undergraduate program in 2009 called the Bachelors of Science in Quantitative Finance, offering both majors and minors in Quantitative Finance,” shares Calhoun. “This program has been very successful, with the highest incoming SAT scores and the highest starting salaries after graduation. The curriculum is very challenging. Incoming freshman are trained on the Bloomberg Terminal in the first semester and go on to complete seven computer science courses, seven math courses, and extensive financial domain courses.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stevens is one of the few universities to offer Quantitative Finance programs at the undergraduate level. The program has grown to 340 students and to include several different Masters’ programs. When combined, the undergraduate and Masters’ programs together constitute approximately 15 percent of the University’s population. “Even as undergraduates, many students will have two or three paid summer internships in the industry during their four years,” shares Calhoun. “Out of all of Stevens’ Quantitative Finance programs, 100-percent of graduates either gain employment or go on to graduate school with knowledge of risk management, investment banking, and financial modeling.” The variety of job opportunities is impressive, from software engineer and finance analyst to global technology or IT risk program manager. Many students are recruited by firms on Wall Street, but also begin careers in other fields like asset management or with insurance companies.</p>

		<p>Providing Real-World Experience<br>
At the heart of the Hanlon Financial Systems Center in Stevens, is Hanlon Financial Systems Lab, a state-of-the-art laboratory that integrates the latest hardware and software technologies and provides research support, including data, training, and infrastructure. “From a generous gift by Stevens Trustee and Alumnus, Sean Hanlon, we created the Hanlon Financial Systems Lab, one of the first facilities of its kind in the United States, to facilitate research on pertinent topics in the financial sector,” says Calhoun, who is Executive Director of the Center. “Just like chemists need a chemical lab and biologists need a biology lab, we wanted to give students a place to gain experience with the tools of the trade.”</p>
<p>Calhoun says the innovative facility looks similar to a small trading floor on Wall Street with Bloomberg terminals. The setup of the Lab supports the teaching requirements in the curriculum and gives students exposure to tools, software, and data sets that they will use in the workforce. “With approximately seventy seats, the Center has become a key part of the educational component of the School of Business,” says Calhoun. “We support around eighty different undergraduate and graduate classes in the course of a week, with over a thousand students utilizing the facility in the course of a semester.”</p>
<p>Merging Finance and Technology<br>
Over forty years ago, the National Science Foundation (NSF) created the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) model to focus research attention and build institutional support related to critical fields of science and technology. The three core objectives of the model include conducting high-quality, high-impact research; enhancing U.S. global leadership in financial technologies, or FinTech; and developing a diverse, high-tech, skilled workforce.</p>
<p>With these initiatives in mind, Stevens and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute are hoping to create a new national research center, co-sponsored by the NSF, with the goal of advancing innovative FinTech. The first ever industry-university cooperative research center (IUCRC) to focus on financial technology, the Center for Research toward Advancing Financial Technologies (CRAFT) will join academic and industry participants with government representatives to find innovative solutions for complex challenges facing the FinTech industry.</p>
<p>CRAFT is actively recruiting members from academia, government, and industry and aims to close the gap between the world of traditional finance and the emerging fields of advanced technology. “We held a two-day virtual workshop this past October with representatives from over sixty financial firms, as well as regulators from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Reserve, and Treasury Department,” shares Calhoun. “The updated proposal was submitted to the NSF for review in January 2021. If approved, we hope to join forces with many different organizations and institutions to create powerful momentum in the field of FinTech research.”</p>
<p>To share his years of experience and insight and help further advance financial technology education, Calhoun added author to his resume early last year with the publishing of his book, Price and Value: A Guide to Equity Market Valuation Metrics (Quantitative Finance). His book seeks to assist not only students in finance-related programs, but all levels of financial professionals who are searching for the tools needed to assess business strategy and performance and wish to gain a more profound understanding of quantitative finance. Additionally, Calhoun is regularly featured as an Online columnist for Forbes magazine as a contributor in the Markets section of the publication.</p>
<p>Exploring the Rise of FinTech<br>
The rise of FinTech has largely been driven by consumers who expect financial institutions to provide the same online experiences that they are accustomed to in their personal and social media interactions. This form of digital finance has entered the mainstream globally, and has only increased over the past year following the onset of COVID. Recent studies have revealed that 35-percent of customers have increased their online banking usage during the pandemic, with seniors and boomers making up a significant share of these individuals.1 “All of the functions we do in the digital world, from paying credit cards, mortgages, car payments to transacting with our bank, all of this can be done electronically in a quick and secure way,” says Calhoun. “From the industry’s standpoint, they can collect more accurate data on their customers and gather analytics on all the different ways in which that individual interacts with the financial market.”</p>
<p>The financial component of FinTech includes the design and operation of financial market infrastructure systems, the creation and testing of innovative financial instruments and strategies, and the integration of cloud-based financial services. Drawing upon technology that has already been developed in science, mathematics, and computer engineering, the FinTech industry looks to incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence, quantum computing and communications, and advanced optimization modeling techniques. With advancements in the modern high-tech financial industry, the need arose for a center dedicated to exploring the challenges associated with rapid industry growth. Henceforth, CRAFT and the IUCRC for FinTech Research, was formed. CRAFT’s mission is to assist the industry in achieving coherence in FinTech research and policy to help bridge the gap between the world of traditional finance and the emerging fields of advanced technology.</p>
<p>Calhoun says the revolution that is underway in the financial industry will greatly benefit from having industry and university cooperation. “There are certain things that the university can bring to the table that the industry doesn’t necessarily have the time or the right people to invest in, and by the same token, the industry is where a lot of this evolution is happening. New Jersey is very committed to the financial services industry and acknowledges the importance of current FinTech trends. We must ensure that academic research is well engaged with the industry side, and this is the key focus of CRAFT.”</p>
<p>CRAFT also aims to serve as a common forum for organizations to collaborate on industry-wide topics and challenges and receive insight from financial regulators on public policy and regulation in the FinTech field. Research projects will largely be conducted by students at the participating Universities where they work alongside industry members at their corresponding facilities. This opportunity allows students to connect with potential employers and for organizations to preview future hires. The FinTech research at CRAFT will apply advanced techniques and technologies, including using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to discover subtle patterns in large data sets, exploring how quantum techniques can improve computation speed and security, and investigating how AI-based tools can be used for asset and wealth management.</p>

		<p>As a dedicated professor, mentor, researcher, and renowned expert in her field, Dr. Tabbetha A. Dobbins was an excellent fit for her new role as Interim VP for Research and Dean of the Graduate School in the Division of University Research at Rowan University. “An outstanding, nationally recognized scientist in materials science, Dr. Dobbins is a passionate educator whose research and teaching emphasizes the engagement of underrepresented populations in STEM,” says Rowan University President, Ali A. Houshmand. “She is a 2009 recipient of the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award, and has been awarded more than $2 million in research funding since 2003.”</p>
<p>Dobbins began her new role last summer, in the midst of a long list of pandemic-caused challenges. “From 2018 to 2020, I served as provost fellow for research, and part of my duties included leading the return to research initiative,” shares Dobbins. “Last March, we all left the research labs and campus buildings to go remote. Not wanting to wait until fall to bring researchers back to campus, we drafted a return plan for researchers targeted for May/June. While actual return dates were delayed, by the end of July, we had a good number of researchers back in their labs with new social distancing rules and schedules in place.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facilitating In-Person Research<br>
Along with her mission of facilitating and enhancing research activities across the institution and serving as Rowan’s representative on external research boards, Dobbins is also a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and guides students in both undergraduate and graduate research projects. Her research centers on applying synchrotron X-ray and neutron analysis to modern engineering problems in polymer self-assembly, gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and the hydrogen fuel economy. Dobbins recently won NSF support to study and mitigate the effects of university closures due to COVID-19 on African American undergraduate students of physics. The project builds on her earlier efforts as part of the American Institute of Physics National Task Force to Elevate African American Representation in Undergraduate Physics &amp; Astronomy, or TEAM-UP.</p>
<p>Knowing how invaluable working together can be for both students and faculty, Dobbins’ current focus includes determining the best methods for facilitating in-person research going forward for Rowan’s summer research programs. “The majority of student research programs last summer were remote,” says Dobbins. “For this summer, we are looking at plans that can bring undergraduate students back into the lab. The learning mode is completely different in person and while remote capabilities are extremely valuable, there is such an immense training and learning benefit when a student can work side by side with a faculty member.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gathering Input and Insight<br>
Upon learning about the funding opportunities through the NSF Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure (CICI) program, Dobbins began taking a closer look at collaborative science and ways to get a finger on the pulse of Rowan’s interdisciplinary research needs. “I began speaking with those in academic leadership to determine how to further evolve the University’s research initiatives,” shares Dobbins. “The Rowan University Research Counsel is comprised of deans and associate deans who represent the interests of faculty members in the research labs. In meeting with these individuals, I have learned there is a great need for staffing support to help students add high performance computing (HPC) accounts and software. This responsibility is often distributed among faculty members and can be very time consuming. I have also discovered that computation research changes very quickly, and while our HPC facility is only five years old, we must look at ways to keep progressing in an ever-changing computing age.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine how to best advance Rowan’s computation research, Dobbins is bringing together faculty members to hear firsthand the challenges they are facing and what solutions would be helpful. “After gathering initial information from faculty, I bring in guest speakers to broaden our understanding of what options are available,” shares Dobbins. “For example, Amazon Web Services came in January to speak to the researchers about a 100-percent cloud-based solution, helping to eliminate the need for personnel to manage accounts and software. Then using a post-presentation survey, I gather faculty feedback on whether they think the solution is something they would use and if they anticipate the solution being good for students.”</p>
<p>Dobbins has also met with the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) who provides state-of-the-art infrastructure for computationally intensive research. The MGHPCC operates as a joint venture between Harvard University, Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, and the University of Massachusetts and is open for use by any research organization. “MGHPCC offers an educational program that creates a career cyberteam that employs two students per institution to help solve HPC problems,” explains Dobbins. “The student serves as an interface between a research group who wants to access the HPC and those who are experts at loading and running the program.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Growing Research Cyberinfrastructure<br>
The insight gathered from Rowan researchers will continue to shape the University’s vision for advanced cyberinfrastructure and tailor solutions to meet their unique needs. “I’m excited to hear from some vendors that we can have cloud-based access to HPC on demand and they can also interface with the existing computers that we have on campus,” says Dobbins. “Many faculty members have also started purchasing smaller networks for their own individual labs, so the solutions we select must be innovative and agile. For instance, we must provide the ability for a researcher to use their in-house system when needed, but also can scale up when faster computing or more memory is needed; this flexibility is essential.”</p>
<p>Improving cyberinfrastructure also requires creating a solid business model and determining how to fund all the needed solutions for faculty and researchers. “I envision a mix-and-match solution based upon computing requirements and academic and classroom usage,” explains Dobbins. “An example business model may be the University provides a core set of services, but then individual grants provide specialty services or advanced features in the cloud. Once the grant has expired or the funding for that portion of a researcher’s work is used, then that cloud service is no longer available.”</p>
<p>Supporting Collaborative Research<br>
Included on the invitation list for Dobbin’s multidisciplinary group is Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Edge’s Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs. “Edge has been an incredible resource for us and Dr. Ghahramani and I are in constant communication about Rowan’s research goals and giving students exposure to career pathways in high performance computing,” says Dobbins. “So far, I’ve been pulling together faculty and holding meetings with outside entities that can help us to meet our research goals, but this is not ideal, since I have many areas where I need to focus my attention. We are hoping to win the NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) planning grant to help us conduct these fact-finding sessions on a much larger scale. Through this grant, we would appoint Dr. Ghahramani and her staff to manage these types of focus groups and surveys to gather the valuable information that we need.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Rowan began pursuing the CC* grant, the University realized they could become a collaborative regional resource, already having relationships with nearby county colleges, like Rowan College at South Jersey and Rowan College at Burlington County. “So much infrastructure already exists that can help connect industry and academia, such as Edge and the Commission on Science, Innovation and Technology (CSIT) through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA),” says Dobbins. “Our prior goals were predominantly inward-focused, looking at what solutions we can find for ourselves. Now, I’m looking to build more robust partnerships and find solutions that will impact not just Rowan researchers, but will also help advance research initiatives at our partner institutions and within the broader research community.”</p>

		<p>Federated Identity Access Management&nbsp;<br>
Connected by global research networks and federation, colleges and universities around the world often join together to share data and resources, provide access to specialized computing, and collaborate in their mission to support research and scholarship. “While individual institutions and research labs may compete for resources, faculty, and students, we find common ground in our commitment to drive research and innovation that benefits society and humankind,” says Tom Barton, Senior Consultant for Cybersecurity and Data Privacy, University of Chicago. “I refer to this shared mission as The Academy, where we can connect freely and trust one another to share information as we search for solutions to common, worldwide problems. Federated identity and access management (IAM) enables use of cyberinfrastructure by researchers to collaborate across campuses and countries.”</p>
<p>Access to Shared Services &amp; Data<br>
Providing secure and easy access to data, intellectual property, instruments, analytical tools, and computation can be accomplished with identity federation. To securely share information and resources, federated IAM allows research participants to collaborate with their colleagues, whether they’re in the same institution or in another part of the world. “An identity federation—also referred to as federated identity or federated access—provides a common platform or global infrastructure that allows an institution to extend their campus authentication to services operated by another organization,” explains Barton. “Identity federations occur in over seventy countries, enabling data and resource sharing and high performance computing (HPC)—providing a great value to research and scholarly collaboration.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling institutions to form an identity federation to allow users access to shared services and data for a particular project, a federation operator registers identity providers and service providers. Organizations can share resources without giving each individual a user name and password for every application. “Faculty, researchers, and students use their home credentials and that identity is federated using the platform,” says Barton. Federation technologies and platforms enable users to use the same credential to access systems, networks, or data across different organizations. Two main types of uses for federated access technology are enterprise and research. “Enterprise use is all about providing services to campus, while research use focuses on providing access to collaborators of various research projects,” says Barton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A System of Trust<br>
Providing researchers and educators with seamless access to academic collaboration and cloud services allows them to tap in to a worldwide source of information and insight. The InCommon® Federation provides higher education and their commercial and non-profit partners with a common trust framework for secure single sign-on access to online resources and cloud-based services. As a gateway to global research collaborations, InCommon helps over 1,000 educational institutions and organizations to interconnect in new and exciting ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shared services model created by federations can help remove barriers and open the door to unique collaborative opportunities, but like any endeavor, challenges can arise. “When discussing shared services, there are a couple things to keep in mind,” says Barton. “First, are they necessary? Creating a federation to unite organizations for research and scholarly use, for example, is a good reason for shared services. Second, you must establish trust among individuals and institutions, and this is not always easy. If organizations don’t trust the concept or each other, they will not use the federation. In addition, if outsourcing services to the Cloud, trying to put predictability around the cost can also be difficult. Plus, commercial providers are not part of The Academy, and do not typically share in the mission to forward research and scholarship. These are the biggest issues I find in operating these global infrastructures where the change management problem is across dozens of countries and thousands of organizations.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting the Access Management in Federated IAM<br>
Barton led a development project for several years that created Grouper, a solution that simplifies access management and allows users to set up groups, roles, and permissions for a variety of purposes. “We were inspired to develop Grouper because there wasn’t a solution available in the enterprise access management space that could match the environment and number of roles that research universities and other complex organizations require,” explains Barton. “Grouper is now used all over the world and integrates with almost any access management infrastructure. This tool can help manage group access to resources; displaying different features to users based on their group membership.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>An integrated identity and access management platform known as CILogon was designed to help address the federated access management needs of research projects by enabling researchers to log on to cyberinfrastructure. As a research and scholarship service provider in the InCommon federation, CILogon supports over 4,000 identity providers worldwide and combines federated identity management with collaborative organization management. “Led by Jim Basney, Principal Research Scientist, National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), CILogon is a Swiss army knife that helps address the diverse needs of research projects,” explains Barton. “Researchers often need access to specialized HPC centers, telescopes, or gravitational-wave observatories, for example. Embedding these resources in identity federations is rather complicated, but CILogon acts as an adapter or proxy. This solution brings federated access to these environments and identifies and solves the right problems.”</p>
<p>Extending the Reach of Research<br>
Organizations like the Eastern Regional Network (ERN) are helping to advance research and education by enabling resource sharing and creating a network for collaboration. Their mission is to provide layered and transparent access to shared data, computing, testbeds, and other core facilities for research projects at a wide variety of campuses, large and small. “Dr. Forough Ghahramani at Edge is quite a presence at the ERN, and has helped raise awareness about the importance of expanding the reach of research resources to more institutions,” shares Barton. “Getting the most mileage out of the resources we have across all of our organizations will help advance research and scholarship and broaden the depth of discovery. I think the ERN will take the idea of federation and add even more dimensions beyond identity and access; expanding the collaboration opportunities between a greater number of institutions, research facilities, and organizations.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>InCommon<br>
As a community-designed identity and access management platform for education and research, InCommon connects people with the services and tools they need to conduct collaborative research. “InCommon allows us, as a community, to come together and offer a flexible way of securely providing access to services,” says Ann West, Associate Vice President, Trust &amp; Identity, Internet2. “Sometimes anonymous access is appropriate, as with some library services. A research collaboration, however, needs to know some basic information about the individual. InCommon’s Identity and Access Management technologies provide a single sign-on gateway to local services, cloud services, and shared services around the world.”</p>
<p>InCommon grew out of Internet2’s work in trusted access to resources, which has been underway since 1998. “The Internet2 community initially came together to establish a network; then later, as a natural outgrowth of that network, found a way for small groups to share services,” explains West. “Our first use cases fell into three areas: library access, research access, and access to Software as a Service (SaaS). While the terms ‘SaaS’ and ‘cloud computing’ didn’t exist at the time, it was the same concept. We knew research collaborations had services they wanted to make available to others in many organizations. Internet2 designed a mechanism that enabled the researcher to access federation-approved services using a policy that was approved by the community and fell under our research and scholarship definition. This allows for approved access to services without the need for IT intervention.”</p>
<p>NIH contacted us about making access to their services easier for researchers. InCommon has a program to help with that.” West continues, “We reviewed their request per our policy and assigned a “Research and Scholarship” (R&amp;S) tag to their services in our registry. When a researcher from an R&amp;S participating institution clicks on the service, they now get instant federated single sign-on access to all R&amp;S approved services (including NIH’s services) without the need for IT to intervene.”</p>
<p>Seamless Access to Research<br>
The InCommon Federation is designed to seamlessly integrate federated policies with an institution’s local policies. “Our approach is to provide as much leeway to the local organization as possible, so an individual campus can decide on the technology to run for authentication,” explains West. “The federation provides the policy and standard communications mechanism for members. Let’s use multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an example. A researcher submitting a grant to the NIH uses the electronic research administration (eRA) portal, which soon will require MFA. Behind the scenes, NIH uses a federation standard, the REFEDS MFA Profile, to signal to the university the need for authentication with a second factor. After logging with MFA, the researcher is passed back to NIH to do their work; providing a pretty seamless process for the researcher.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Active Community Involvement<br>
InCommon is governed by the InCommon Steering Committee, consisting of members from participating institutions. Two key advisory groups, the InCommon Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and the Community Trust and Assurance Board (CTAB), provide technical and policy recommendations. CTAB, for example, has led the community to adopt Baseline Expectations for Trust in Federation, which call for adherence to policies that improve both security and interoperability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>InCommon advisory groups have the ability to charter working groups, which coalesce around a topic or unit of work that needs to be accomplished. This approach is unique in comparison to other solution providers, tapping the community to determine software and service specifications, recommended practices, and requirements.</p>
<p>“The working groups are our community engine that make this all go,” says West. “InCommon convenes more than 150 people every month. Our services are heavily informed by community requirements and needs, and we use working groups’ recommendations and insight to determine how to keep the InCommon platform evolving in a positive way.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>InCommon also plays a key role in convening the international community. Since collaboration services and tools are hosted around the world, federation now knows no borders. “Every year, we host a conference where people from our international community come together and build an agenda onsite,” shares West. “Attendees are predominantly technical architects who understand the business needs and research requirements and are interested in making InCommon work better for the community. This event is all about helping each other, because we all agree that driving progress within education and collaboration happens in an environment of trust. Our goal is to create an atmosphere of personal trust, levity, and fun, while delivering the most impact.”</p>
<p>A Community of Learning&nbsp;<br>
To introduce new organizations to InCommon and provide ongoing education and support, the InCommon Academy offers workshops, conferences, and training. An event called InCommon BaseCAMP is designed for those new to identity management and a group of open-source identity-software components called the InCommon Trusted Access Platform. “We will also be coming out with InCommon-specific federation training this year and launching a corporate program that will allow institutions, particularly smaller ones, to outsource all or part of their InCommon infrastructure to trusted partners,” shares West.</p>
<p>As a proponent for research and education regional networks like Edge, West says InCommon’s role in providing a community resource for identity and access management is a natural fit. “Having a suite of collaboration tools and the InCommon Federation in the middle is very beneficial to institutions and research organizations. We continue to look for ways that we can partner with regional networks to share services and provide their members with IAM resources and services.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				    
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
        
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>CILogon<br>
Born at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in 2010, CILogon enables researchers to securely log on to cyberinfrastructure (CI) using their home organization identities. As a member of the InCommon federation, the CILogon Service supports over 4,000 identity providers, including GitHub, Google, ORCID, and campus identity providers. “Federated identity and access management enables research collaboration that spans departments, campuses, and multiple countries,” says Jim Basney, Principal Research Scientist, Cybersecurity Division, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “The federated logon allows campus researchers to access supercomputers and other cyberinfrastructure that is needed for their research. The role of CILogon is to aid the success of these research projects by providing seamless federated IAM, meaning researchers can log on with their existing campus credentials, rather than creating multiple user names and passwords.”</p>
<p>A person’s role and membership in a research project are managed consistently across the different cyberinfrastructure systems and services, so whether the researchers need Jupyter Notebooks, Wikis, data archives, or Secure Shell (SSH) to log into supercomputers, for example, separate accounts for each system are not required. “CILogon provides federated IAM as a service by running open-source software from the InCommon Trusted Access Platform,” explains Basney. “The software can often be complicated to operate, especially for smaller research projects. Since this platform is based in the Cloud, researchers do not have to run the software themselves; they can just plug into our platform, connect all their services, and manage the IAM for their project. Researchers get a plug-and-play solution that allows them to collaborate within a vast ecosystem of universities, colleges, and research institutions.”</p>
<p>Ten-Year History<br>
CILogon grew out of an effort to support InCommon login to the National Science Foundation (NSF) TeraGrid project, an e-Science grid computing infrastructure combining resources at eleven partner sites. “Once creating the secure login capability was successful, we wanted to offer a service that could make federated login possible and easier for other cyberinfrastructures,” shares Basney. “From here, we first proposed the CILogon project and began our operations in 2010. Our focus in the beginning was supporting researchers logging in with their InCommon identity to get an X.509 certificate, which many cyberinfrastructures required for authentication at the time. Over the years, we’ve expanded the platform to support other types of cyberinfrastructure capabilities.”</p>
<p>In 2011, CILogon added OAuth support, a valuable benefit to researchers who wish to connect with science gateways. A year later, CILogon made the first connections with the Globus platform to enable researchers to connect their federated identities to the Globus service for data transfers between science DMZ nodes. “In 2013, we had our first connection with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which detects and studies cosmic gravitational waves. We then celebrated a couple of large milestones in 2016, including going international with the InCommon Federation to connect with international identity providers and service providers. This was the year we also began our collaboration with the Spherical Cow Group, who are the lead developers of the COmanage software, which provides the collaboration management capability of CILogon. Last year, we added support for Grouper, another component of the InCommon Trusted Access Platform, and also joined the InCommon Catalyst Program, to better connect with the needs of the InCommon community.”</p>
<p>Supporting Research Success<br>
CILogon combines federated identity management with collaborative organization management to provide an integrated open-source identity and access management platform for research collaborations. “Seamless IAM for researchers is the main goal of CILogon, so the minute someone in a research group joins a project, they can be productive right away,” explains Basney. “Collaboration organization management creates one simple enrollment process for a researcher to get access to all of the different applications and data services, rather than having to coordinate with various system administrators. We want to make it simple and straightforward for new members joining a project to bring fresh ideas and spark new research avenues right out of the gate.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>CILogon empowers researchers to self-organize and manage the roles for their collaboration, through custom enrollment forms for new members and group enrollment management forms for changing group memberships and roles in the collaboration. “Access to the applications, data, and other resources in the collaboration is often based on the researchers’ role in the collaboration, rather than their roles on campus,” says Basney. “For instance, access is based upon a person’s involvement with a NSF-funded grant, instead of the fact that he or she is in a specific department on a particular campus. In addition, CILogon gives the ability to distribute the responsibility for managing those attributes, groups, and policies across the collaboration, especially those spanning departments and campuses. Each professor can manage enrollment of his or her students and postdocs in their lab, rather than having one person responsible for enrolling everyone. The distributed control allows quick and seamless access to resources.”</p>
<p>Along with the benefits and convenience IAM brings to researchers, the service also helps the cyberinfrastructure engineers who are responsible for maintaining the security of the computing infrastructure that the research projects are using. “CI engineers do not need to worry about another password database or the strength of authentication,” says Basney. “Instead, they can rely on campus identity providers to follow good security practices, like multifactor authentication.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Collaboration Opportunities<br>
As the software at the center of CILogon, COmanage operates the entire lifecycle of collaboration, including enrollment workflows and interfaces for managing attributes, groups, and roles for members of the research collaboration. “Beginning with onboarding, COmanage provides flexible and customizable enrollment flows to bring people and their federated identities onto the platform and creates a collaborative organization (CO),” explains Basney. “We build all of the CILogon service components on open-source software, and since COmanage is part of the InCommon Trusted Access Platform, the software has the whole InCommon community behind it. Plus, the COmanage team has a long history of working with research projects and understands the unique identity and access management needs of the research community.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operating federated IAM and collaboration management services on campus can often be challenging, especially with the complexity of the technology and the requirement to support a variety of use cases due to varying research collaborations. “Research and education networks (REN), like Edge, can partner with InCommon and play a valuable role in offering training and helping campuses adopt the Trusted Access Platform,” says Basney. “Also, organizations like the Campus Champions, Open Science Grid, Trusted CI, and XSEDE can help researchers securely connect to cyberinfrastructure which introduces them to a whole new world of opportunity.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edge aims to lower the barrier for access to advanced cyberinfrastructure resources for research collaboration through participation in communities such as the ERN, in supporting federated shared services models, facilitating sharing computational and data resources across the region, especially for smaller, less-resourced schools.

	 Abstract 
<p>With our lives under lockdown as COVID-19 rages on, our reliance on digital technologies and communications tools has perhaps never been greater, leading many to speculate that the pandemic has brought the digital future forward. At the same time, the shortcomings of digital life are now more apparent than ever, giving many a newfound appreciation for the value of human connection and relational states of being. In this context, the Me2B Alliance’s efforts to recenter relationships in our digital lives takes on new meaning and urgency.</p>
<p>According to the Me2B Alliance, we have relationships with each of the product and service providers in our lives, in both the digital and physical spheres. In the digital sphere, our experience of these primary relationships is often through a digital product or service, such as a website, app, or connected device. Each of these digital relationships has at least three core dimensions—commercial, technical, and legal. They are primarily business and legal relationships mediated by a variety of hardware and software tools.</p>
<p>The technical dimension of digital relationships introduces a variety of intermediaries into our primary relationships and creates a parallel dimension of reality consisting of the data generated by transactions and interactions in the ordinary course of those relationships—a kind of “parallel dataverse.” A commercial logic of extraction further complicates matters by introducing myriad parasitic entities who feed on and extract value from this parallel dataverse, undermining and distorting our primary relationships in the process.</p>
<p>Our prevailing legal paradigm for digital interactions stems from an overly simplistic and antiquated view of the digital universe, accounting only for primary relationships, without considering the impact of an increasingly complex digital realm and growing parallel dataverse. By only accounting for one dimension of our digital lives, this legal paradigm and its associated legal ceremonies leaves us exposed and vulnerable with insufficient safeguards and protections.</p>
<p>An alternative path forward must recalibrate our relationships and interactions in light of this increasingly complex and multidimensional view of the digital ecosystem. While digital will always be different, requiring intermediaries who enable our primary relationships, the more we can translate norms and expectations from the physical world into the digital realm, the closer we get to establishing effective standards and rules for our digital interactions.</p>
<p>Our legal paradigms must also evolve to capture this new reality by introducing base-level protections through prohibitions on certain activities and practices, mandating a risk-based approach to digital products and services, reestablishing context for our digital interactions, limiting default data collection and processing to what is necessary for primary business purposes, and imposing higher standards and obligations on parties who seek to go beyond what is necessary in the context of a bonafide commercial relationship.</p>
<p>Through this new paradigm, we can more easily define rules and norms for digital interactions that map to our expectations, according to the nature of our relationship to a given product or service provider. At the same time, we can also leverage and harness technology itself in the service of, rather than for purposes of extracting value from, these primary relationships. With new legal and technological foundations in place, the hope is to rebuild our digital relationships based on an ethos of mutual respect, in line with the Alliance’s mission.</p>

	 Introduction 
<p>The Me2B Alliance (the “Alliance”) is an innovative standards development organization whose mission is to grow the availability of trustworthy technology choices in part through a certification mark (like the “Organic” food label) that helps people understand how a connected product or service is treating them and their personal information. The work of the Alliance is premised on the existence of a relationship between an individual (a “Me”) and a business providing that individual with a product or service (a “B”), known as the “Me2B Relationship.” Additionally, the Alliance has developed a series of principles (“Me2B Principles”) and ethical rules of engagement (“Me2B Rules of Engagement”) that apply in and out of Me2B Relationships (see Appendix A – Me2B Materials).</p>
<p>The Alliance is now exploring alternatives to the prevailing “notice and choice” or “notice and consent” model for Web-based user interactions, based on whether or not an individual is in a Me2B Relationship with a given service provider. This paper is the result of a series of interviews and conversations with key stakeholders in the Me2B community, including Me2B leadership, participation in a series of Policy and Legal Working Group meetings, an analysis of pre-existing Me2B materials, and relevant research and scholarship. The Alliance is encouraged to view this whitepaper as a starting point for a long-term conversation about overhauling the context for, and nature of, our Web-based interactions in a way that more closely aligns with the Me2B Principles and Me2B Rules of Engagement.</p>
<p>This paper proceeds in five parts. Part I begins by examining the Me2B Relationship in context, including in the macro-context of a phenomenon known as surveillance capitalism, which distorts and undermines the very ethos of the Me2B Relationship. Part II outlines the failures of the prevailing “notice and choice” paradigm for digital interactions, including its legal and practical defects, as well as how such defects result from a failure to account for the effects of surveillance capitalism. Part III seeks to provide an alternative path forward by mapping the expectations we have in the physical world onto the digital world, including through new legal foundations and innovative uses of technology to realign expectations and reality. Part IV examines what digital interactions might look like in this new paradigm, according to the relevant Me2B Relationship state. Finally, Part V draws some conclusions and recommends next steps for research and exploration by the Alliance.<a></a></p>
 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundations of the Me2B Relationship 
<p>This section examines the Me2B Relationship in context by first examining the nature of digital interactions and the role of intermediaries. It also explains how the prevailing logic of surveillance capitalism creates a kind of “parallel dataverse” that distorts the nature of Me2B Relationships and undermines the interests of the individual, i.e. the “Me.”</p>
 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Multidimensional Relationship 
<p>According to the Alliance, we have two-sided or 1:1 “relationships” with each of the product and service providers in our lives, in both the physical and digital spheres. In the physical realm, these relationships have at least two core dimensions: (1) a commercial dimension, typically in the form of exchanges of mutually agreed upon value, and (2) a legal dimension, typically in the form of a contract, such as a sales receipt, membership agreement, or loyalty subscription. Additionally, where a physical or in-person interaction has a digital component, such as a digital payment method, there is a third technical dimension.</p>
<p>In the digital realm, each of our interactions and relationships has all three dimensions—commercial, technical, and legal. Commercially, there are actual and potential transactions or exchanges of value in return for products and services. Technically, these commercial transactions or exchanges are achieved via an array of hardware and software products and services. And legally, there are formalities that establish certain legal relationships between the various parties to a given digital interaction or transaction. Due to a phenomenon known as surveillance capitalism (as further outlined below), there is also a fourth hidden dimension.</p>
 1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commercial 
<p>Commercially, our relationships are created through interactions and sharing over time. In general, these relationships tend to evolve according to a lifecycle consisting of five key stages: (1) acquaintance, (2) buildup, (3) continuation, (4) deterioration, and (5) termination, per Figure 1 below. A Me2B Relationship begins with a specific ceremony, such as signing up for an account, joining a loyalty program, agreeing to a website’s terms of service, or any other process by which individual credentials are created establishing a business relationship between a “Me” and a “B.”</p>

 
 
<p>Figure 1 – Me2B Relationship Model. Source: Me2B Alliance.</p>
 
 

<p>According to the Alliance, a Me2B Relationship is characterized by the individual having agency throughout the entire relationship lifecycle, including when to start and end the relationship, as well as what data to share or keep private, among other considerations. Before a Me2B Relationship is formed, and before a business relationship requires sharing personal information or exchanging value, the individual should have a reasonable expectation of anonymity. As she approaches the start of a Me2B Relationship and gets closer to establishing that business relationship, she gradually loses anonymity, becoming more pseudonymous or identifiable to a given service provider over time.</p>
<p>Once in a Me2B Relationship with a given service provider, the individual becomes personally identifiable. Nevertheless, she should still have the choice to remain unknown or anonymous in respect of specific transactions or interactions with that provider. Upon termination of the Me2B Relationship, she should be forgotten by and return to a state of anonymity in relation to that entity. In this way, a Me2B Relationship can also be described as a state of being “recognized, remembered, and responded to” by a given entity.</p>
<p>In order to exercise this kind of agency, individuals must be able to accurately identify the counterparties to a given interaction or transaction, which entities they are in relationship with, and where they are in the relationship lifecycle in relation to each entity, and be able to adjust their expectations accordingly. Undergirding the Me2B Relationship is a “Me2B ethos” or a core belief that a respectful relationship between an individual and the technology they are using, whether a website, connected device, app, or otherwise, benefits the individual and the service provider. Unfortunately, the complexity of the digital ecosystem as it exists today undermines both individual agency and the Me2B ethos.</p>
 1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical 
<p>While offline, in-person interactions require the physical presence or proximity of the parties, digital interactions do not. Rather, individuals (Me-s) and product or service providers (B-s) are connected by some combination of technical tools and architecture, typically provided by commercially owned and operated entities known as “technical intermediaries.” In the prevailing centralized, client-server model of the Web, these technical intermediaries include hardware and software providers that “serve” an end user or “client” with access to certain digital resources from a “B,” as requested by the end user. In this way, the digital version of a Me2B Relationship can be recharacterized as a kind of “Me—T—B” relationship.</p>

 
 
<p>Figure 2 – Technical intermediaries &amp; the “Me—T—B” relationship</p>
 
 

<p>These technical intermediaries may include Web browsers (such as Google Chrome or Apple’s Safari), app stores (such as Google Play and the App Store), identity services (such as “login with Facebook” or “login with Google”), cloud services providers (such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft’s Azure), and device manufacturers (such as Apple and Google), among others. From the perspective of a “Me” trying to do business with a “B,” we often overlook the importance of these technical intermediaries and their impact on our relationships. When interacting or transacting with a “B” through a device by digital means, we tend to view our commercial relationship with the “B” as primary and our relationships with T-s as secondary.</p>
 1.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal 
<p>Though they may feel secondary, we are in primary legal relationships with technical intermediaries who facilitate our digital Me2B Relationships. Thus, we can also classify these technical intermediaries in terms of their legal status in relation to the “Me” in a given interaction. Those in privity of contract, i.e. in a direct contractual relationship, with the “Me” are “first parties” who sit in between the primary parties to a commercial transaction or interaction, with obligations to both sides. In the current paradigm of Me2B Relationships, a “Me” has a direct contractual relationship with the “B” and a parallel contractual relationship with each first-party technical intermediary who facilitates it.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are a variety of intermediaries who are not in privity, i.e. not in a direct contractual relationship with, the “Me” in a given transaction or interaction but are in a direct contractual relationship with the “B” or a “T” involved. From the perspective of “Me,” these are “third parties” or “third-party intermediaries” and may include payment processors, data processors, and other vendors and participants in a supply chain who are acting on behalf of a “B” or a “T” in the course of their ordinary business operations. Such third parties are necessary to provide technical or commercial functionalities in support of the primary business relationships between a “B” and its customers.</p>

 
 
<p>Figure 3 – First- and third-party intermediaries</p>
 
 

<p>Oddly, there are also a number of entities who are not commercially or technically necessary for a transaction or interaction between a “Me” and a “B” but who are lurking in the ambient digital environment around their relationship. Because they exist to extract value from Me2B Relationships but lack a direct or indirect relationship to the “Me” in a given relationship, they are akin to “parasites.” That digital interactions require an array of technical and commercial intermediaries does not by itself explain the presence of these parasites. Rather, their pernicious nature is the product of a particular phenomenon known as surveillance capitalism and its resulting distortions of the digital ecosystem.</p>
 1.2 On Surveillance Capitalism 
<p>Through their devices, browsers, authentication protocols, communications tools, and other infrastructure, it is almost impossible to interact or transact by digital means without the involvement of companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, among others. The reality is that large corporate intermediaries who provide the connective tissues of our digital relationships penetrate even the most intimate aspects of digital life.Unfortunately, many of these entities also participate in a new economic order known as “surveillance capitalism,” which “claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction.” This extractive logic results from, and results in, vast asymmetries of power along at least four dimensions.</p>
 1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scale 
<p>With two and three billion users worldwide, Google and Facebook, respectively, have more users than the population of the largest countries on earth, reaching more people than governments, traditional media outlets, publishers, and any other platform in history. Scale is also concentrated in the market for mobile devices and applications. Together, Apple and Google control 99% of global market share and act as gatekeepers for all apps designed for iPhone and Android devices; in effect, all devices. Similarly, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control more than 60% of the market for cloud services. As a result, many service providers or B-s have little choice but to accept the terms set by the surveillance capitalists, often compromising their relationships with Me-s in the process by sharing their data.</p>
 1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information 
<p>Given their size and scale, and aided by exponentially increasing computational power, the surveillance capitalists have unmatched tools to collect and harness vast hordes of data and, in turn, to derive behavioral, psychological, and other insights about people, groups, and societies at large. They track and analyze our thoughts, preferences, and behaviors, leading many to conclude that privacy is dead. Meanwhile, the inverse is true of these intermediaries. Due to opaque algorithms (the so-called “black box” phenomenon), robust intellectual property rights and trade secrets, and limited technical competence on the part of law and policymakers trying to hold them to account, we know almost nothing about how their technology operates or how our data and any insights derived therefrom are used. As a result of the steep information asymmetries, we have fully transparent people and fully opaque platforms.</p>
 1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resources 
<p>Asymmetrical scale and knowledge are further fueled by vastly asymmetrical resources as between individuals, service providers, surveillance capitalists, and their parasites. Through legal and accounting loopholes and aggressive lobbying, surveillance capitalists largely evade regulation and taxation. Failing to account for their externalities, they undermine and rent-seek from traditional businesses, such as traditional news media and journalistic outlets, free ride on public infrastructure, and take advantage of taxpayer funded subsidies, despite being among the richest companies of all time. Worse yet, they divert limited resources that could support the development of alternative technologies to promote the interests of Me-s online, perpetuating toxic, extractive practices to maximize shareholder value instead.</p>
 1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capacity for control 
<p>With multidimensional asymmetrical power, the surveillance capitalists have an unprecedented capacity to exert equally unprecedented behavioral control and experimentation on people, without legal limits. Through recommendation engines, hyper-personalization, psychometric profiling, behavioral advertising, micro-targeting, and other tools, they have the ability to influence and alter our preferences, our expression, and ultimately our behavior. If mutual respect is a two-way street that recognizes both parties in a relationship as equally valuable in terms of their contributions and individual agency, a relationship built on the parasitic logic of extraction and control is a fundamentally one-sided relationship in which one party is more valuable to the other for purposes of extracting value.</p>
 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hidden Dimension 
<p>Taken together, these asymmetries distort the power dynamics between Me-s and B-s and undermine the foundation of the Me2B Relationship, an ethos of mutual respect, by introducing a fourth hidden dimension into the relationship.</p>
 1.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The “parallel dataverse” 
<p>While data is relevant to and exchanged in all interactions, non-digital information gleaned from an offline interaction tends to be ephemeral, difficult to store, transfer, and otherwise process, and of limited market or industrial value as a result. In contrast, digital data generated in online or digital interactions is often permanent, cheap and easy to store, transfer, and process, and, as a result of surveillance capitalism, fed into a highly lucrative data economy. The perverse power dynamics of surveillance capitalism distort Me2B Relationships, hosting an infinite number of parasites extracting value from them. Such parasites may include general and financial data brokers, commercial databases, fraud detection providers, ad networks and ad tech companies, credit reporting agencies, and myriad other entities motivated by their own commercial interests. Surveillance capitalism coopts digital intermediaries in service of these parasites, subverting and exploiting Me2B Relationships in the process.</p>

 
 
<p>Figure 4 – Parasites and the Me-T-n-B-n relationship</p>
 
 

<p>While the parties to an offline, in-person interaction typically share a similar perspective and ability to assess the mechanics of that interaction, as well as the information and value exchanged, the same is not true of digital interactions. If relationships form the perceptible matter in the material universe around us, data forms the imperceptible anti-matter consisting of black box algorithms, dark patterns, and other hidden processes that feed these parasites. As a result, our digital lives exist in two parallel dimensions: (1) the realm of digital relationships, including Me2B Relationships; and (2) ambient data swirling in a kind of “parallel dataverse.” We see, perceive, and participate in the former, while we tend not to see or perceive the latter, though it distorts our experience of digital relationships. Unwittingly and under the pretense and familiarity of relationships, the opaque parallel dataverse expands.</p>
 1.3.2 Time and space in the parallel dataverse 
<p>While time and space are highly correlated in physical interactions, the same is not true for digital ones. The relationship between digital time and space is distorted by the parallel dataverse. A short-lived physical interaction, such as a one-off purchase, requires showing up to a place once. A longer-lived series of physical interactions, as in the case of a regular customer, requires showing up repeatedly over time. In the digital realm, we can be in different places at the same time and persist in space over time through our data long after we stop showing up.</p>
<p>More concretely, take the example of a simple&nbsp;“Me2B Deal” or an exchange of mutually agreed upon value, such as going to a restaurant and paying $20 for a meal.&nbsp;The deal is a&nbsp;quid pro quo&nbsp;agreement that defines and bounds the scope of sharing, i.e. you give the restaurant $20 in cash and get a meal in return. The same in-person interaction with a form of digital payment may look and feel the same but significantly complicates things. For example, if you pay with a credit card instead of cash, your credit card provider now has the restaurant or merchant information, details of your order, and potentially your location data. Pay with something like Apple Pay and now your credit card provider, telecommunications operator, and smart phone vendor may all have this information too.</p>
<p>If you did this every week at the same restaurant, and became recognized, remembered, and responded to, you may expect to end up in a Me2B Relationship with the restaurant owner. However, you may not expect parasites in the parallel dataverse to compile and resell behavioral data about when you visit the restaurant, the details of your order, and where you were before and after each visit, among other insights about you. As a result of surveillance capitalism, even light-touch, short-lived interactions can form expansive and persistent data trails that extend through time and space across the parallel dataverse, the dimensions of which can be hard for individuals to grasp. This sharing is both and theoretically unbounded, violating the Me2B ethos.<a></a></p>
 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cracks in the Foundation: On “Notice and Choice” 
<p>The logic of extraction based on asymmetrical power is also antithetical to the notions of “choice” and “consent” that theoretically undergird the legal foundations of our digital relationships. The prevailing paradigm for digital interactions is “notice and choice,” also called “notice and consent.” Originating from the Fair Information Practices of the 1970s, it is predicated on the idea that users of an online service can make informed decisions about whether and how to transact or interact with a given entity or service provider on the basis of transparent disclosures about its information and privacy practices. It still forms the foundation of the Federal Trade Commission’s enforcement authority over “unfair and deceptive” trade practices, the primary enforcement tool over online activity in the U.S. This section outlines the failures of “notice and choice,” including its many legal and practical defects.</p>
 2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal Defects 
<p>As U.S. companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and others continue to dominate the global market for digital technologies, this framework has been exported to and imposed on individuals around the world, even influencing the application and interpretation of other legal frameworks. Due to the ubiquity of “notice and consent,” the two primary ceremonies we encounter in the digital realm are notices, typically in the form of a privacy policy or privacy notice, and contracts, in the form of terms and conditions or terms of service seeking our consent. We are also frequently presented with a variety of licenses. Our perception of these tools does not align with how they operate in practice.</p>
 2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices 
<p>A “notice” is a legal notification or warning delivered in a written format or as a formal announcement.Online, notices typically take the form of a website or app’s privacy notice, sometimes called a privacy policy. A notice is meant to be a transparency tool that provides clear but comprehensive disclosures on how a website or online service collects, uses, discloses, retains, and otherwise handles the information of its users. On the basis of this notice, individuals are presumed to make informed choices about whether and how to share data or otherwise engage with the service. This is the “notice” prong of the “notice and choice” model.</p>
<p>Although “notice and choice” is touted as promoting individual autonomy, and consumers tend to perceive notices as making binding promises, courts have typically regarded online privacy notices as general statements of information policy rather than as legally enforceable contracts. This is largely due to their passive presentment, often located on a separate webpage, without requiring a user to accept or even read them to proceed or use a website or service. It has also been industry practice to draft privacy policies in ways that do not constitute legally enforceable agreements.</p>
<p>It is also due to the unilateral nature of notices, which bind all users of a website or service regardless of their relationship to the site owner or service provider. In practice and at law, privacy policies or notices actually act more like property notices that proffer one-way terms and attach in rem to a service provider’s digital property, rather than in personam to an individual user. In other words, such notices act more like signage in a shopping mall.</p>
 2.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Contracts” 
<p>When we think of contracts online, we tend to think of terms and conditions or terms of service, and ceremonies like ticking a box or consenting to terms by clicking “I accept.” These actions form the “choice” prong of “notice and choice.” While property law is one-sided to favor the property owner, contract law seeks to equally protect both sides of a bargain. As such, a contractual basis for digital interactions should “facilitate certainty, predictability, and care in entering productive relationships,” providing a better foundation for Me2B Relationships built on mutual respect. But the digital ceremonies we perceive as contracts often do not hold up in theory or in practice.</p>
<p>A contract is an agreement between private parties creating mutual obligations or legally enforceable promises. The basic elements required for contract formation are mutual assent,&nbsp;expressed by a valid&nbsp;offer and acceptance, adequate&nbsp;consideration, capacity, and&nbsp;legality.&nbsp;Acceptance requires a “meeting of the minds” such that both parties to the contract understand what is being offered, i.e. that acceptance is identical to the offer. In determining whether an electronic contract has been validly formed, there must be “reasonable notice” of terms and a “manifestation of assent” by the consumer. In this way, valid contract formation in the digital realm follows the “notice and consent” approach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, courts also tend to interpret electronic contracts as acting more like property notices that need only be reasonably displayed and can be assented to by a user through mere use of a website or service, even where they are not seen or read by the user. In this way, digital “contracts” operate more like property instruments that protect digital property owners, undermining the rationale for relying on “notice and choice.” As one scholar puts it, “the inutility of contract law for enforcing privacy policy promises calls into question the effectiveness and legitimacy of the Notice and Choice model for privacy protection.”</p>
<p>Finally, the unilateral ability of a service provider to modify the terms of an electronic contract at will, in a way that is more typical of notices, also means “the bargain itself is a moving target,” making it hard to establish a meeting of the minds at a given point in time in the relationship lifecycle. The decoupling of time and space that allows us to persist in the parallel dataverse through our data long after a transaction, interaction, or relationship ends, means that what we agree to in the moment of contract presentment and execution does not capture future uses of that data or activities with consequences on our lives. Moreover, the asymmetries of power and information that characterize our digital interactions in the surveillance capitalist paradigm further undermine any “meeting of the minds.”</p>
 2.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licenses 
<p>Finally, we may encounter end-user license agreements (EULAs) and other licenses when we access a copy of software or download an app. A license is a grant of permission to do something otherwise prohibited by law. Its nature is ill-defined as a license can be contractual or non-contractual. Under intellectual property law, as in the case of a EULA, a license is a contract granting written permission to exploit an invention, creative work, or trademark, and must satisfy the rules for contract formation, including valid offer and acceptance. Under real property law, a license is a unilateral commitment to grant certain restricted rights to property even where a grantee is unaware of those restrictions. A contractual license requires an act by the licensee that constitutes assent to its terms, while the licensee of a non-contractual license accepts its terms through performance, such as by entering a physical place or continuing to use a website. Contractual licenses have the same legal defects as digital contracts, as outlined above.</p>
 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practical Defects 
<p>As a light-touch, self-regulatory mechanism, the “notice and choice” model is theorized to promote individual autonomy by centering the individual’s informed consent and decisionmaking. However sound the theoretical foundations of “notice and choice,” the model has not panned out in practice.</p>
 2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantitative Challenges 
<p>As more of the population comes online, the volume of digital interactions increases exponentially. We send more than one hundred and fifty million emails and sixteen million text messages each minute, while Google processes nearly four billion searches per day. The frequency with which we have to accept or consent to a variety of legal terms and conditions via our digital interactions is already unmanageable. According to one study, it would take an average of seventy-six days to read the privacy policies of every website an individual encounters in one year. The more people and devices that come online and connect as we approach a world with the “Internet in everything,”the more unmanageable this will become.</p>
<p>The ubiquity of “notice and choice” has resulted in rather unpleasant user experience and user interface (UX/UI) features, including a variety of cookie pop-ups, banners, and tick boxes, among other nuisances, compounding the cognitive overload challenges. Efforts to require meaningful informed consent in Web-based interactions have actually worsened the problem. For example, UX/UI has been a key challenge in implementing Europe’s ePrivacy Directive, which outlawed passive or implied consent to cookies via banners or pre-ticked boxes and required affirmative, opt-in consent to all cookies not strictly necessary for a website’s technical operation. Where complied with, it has resulted in a proliferation of popups and notifications.</p>
<p>“Notice and choice” also does not translate well to mobile devices with smaller interfaces or to emerging and future technologies. As we move beyond the graphical user interface (GUI) to new interfaces, including voice, gesture, and gait, as well as neural or brain-machine interfaces, implementing “notice and choice” will get even trickier. Add the proliferation of smart devices, the Internet of Things, and sensor technologies, and a corresponding growth in ambient data collection, and the idea of having written terms and conditions and privacy policies to accept on a regular basis in real-time through clicks and scrolls becomes wholly untenable. The lack of future proofing also demonstrates the unsustainability of the notice and choice paradigm.</p>
 2.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualitative challenges 
<p>These quantitative challenges also result in qualitative challenges in practice. While commercial entities continue to benefit from exponential improvements in computational capacity and power, the cognitive limits of the human mind have remained relatively static or fixed. As a result, the cognitive strain of the “notice and choice” paradigm further increases the asymmetry of knowledge and capacity as between individuals and the entities seeking consent. It is difficult, if not impossible, to establish meaningful, informed consent under these circumstances, as it simply exceeds our capacity for good decisionmaking.</p>
<p>“Notice and choice” is also applied uniformly to our relationships with product and service providers, whether B-s or T-s, despite our limited choice and the toxic business models of many T-s. These large commercial entities, so pervasive that they can be nearly impossible to avoid, intermediate most of our digital interactions. As a result, “consent” for entering into “contractual” relationships with them is not freely rendered but results from limited choice, anti-competitive tactics, and impediments to interoperability and data portability. Where we cannot interact with a B without accepting the terms of surveillance capitalist T-s, consent to B’s terms is also undermined. Without voluntariness, this is “defective consent” and cannot form the basis of meaningful “choice.”</p>
<p>Finally, there are mounting qualitative challenges to the nature of “notice” itself in respect of digital technologies. Consumer-facing notices are difficult to read and understand from the perspective of legal rights and obligations, and increasingly unable to communicate the true implications of data collection or technology use. New and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural or deep neural networks feature opaque processes and lack explainability. In such cases, technologists themselves may be unable to explain how certain decisions are made or outputs are derived, let alone communicate these ideas to the general public. Where explainability impedes notice, consent sought on the basis of that notice is also undermined.</p>
 2.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Context collapse 
<p>The law is filled with ceremonial activities that have traditionally involved physical acts, such as placing one’s hand on a Bible while taking an oath of office or affixing one’s signature in ink to enter into a contract. We tend to scale the level of effort required by a ceremony to the gravity of the obligation undertaken or status conferred. For example, signing a marriage license requires the physical presence of the parties, at least two witnesses, and a state-sanctioned officiant, while executing corporate documents may require simple notarization, and accepting a delivery only a simple signature. The more cumbersome the ceremony, the more likely we are to perceive a decision as having serious consequences. As one scholar puts it, “The heft of a document tends to correspond to the onerousness of the obligations agreed to by the consumer.”</p>
<p>The digital realm collapses all of our actions and behaviors into a series of one-dimensional clicks and scrolls. As a result, it can be difficult to assess the relative heft or gravity of a decision to interact or transact with a given service provider, share or consent to certain personal uses of data, or make any variety of other decisions. While legal ceremonies are meant to help us assess the heft of a decision, the ubiquity of “notice and choice” makes nearly all digital interactions feel the same. Just as digital activities are designed to remove as much friction as possible,companies “intentionally minimize the disruptiveness of contract presentment in order to facilitate transactions and to create a smooth website experience for the consumer,” thereby reducing the signaling effect of online contracts.</p>
 2.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hidden dimension 
<p>Even if the legal and practical defects with the “notice and choice” paradigm were corrected, it would still fail to provide an effective foundation for Me2B Relationships based on an ethos of mutual respect. We have seen how a Me2B Relationship in the digital realm is rarely a two-sided, or 1:1 relationship. Rather, it is situated in the context of a complex web of relationships between individuals (Me-s), service providers (B-s), technical intermediaries (T-s), and a potentially infinite array of parasites (n-s).</p>
<p>The “notice and choice” construct is based on an overly simplistic and acontextual view of relationships that fails to account for the complex and multidimensional nature of the modern digital sphere. By only capturing direct contractual relationships, such as Me2B Relationships, the “notice and choice” paradigm misses an entire dimension of the digital realm—the toxic, extractive practices of parasites and surveillance capitalists in the parallel dataverse. Any legal foundation or ceremony that ignores this context will always be deficient to protect and promote the rights and interests of individuals in Me2B Relationships.<a></a></p>
 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebuilding Respectful Relationships 
<p>One reason that the “notice and choice” model persists despite the mounting evidence of its deficiencies is the failure to put forward a workable alternative or to imagine an entirely new paradigm. This section seeks to provide an alternative path forward by attempting to map the expectations we have in the physical world onto the digital world through new legal foundations and innovative uses of technology to support respectful digital relationships.</p>
 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realigning Expectations vs. Reality 
<p>Any viable path forward must recalibrate our relationships and interactions in light of the increasingly complex and multidimensional nature of the digital ecosystem. While digital will always be different, requiring intermediaries who enable our primary relationships, the more we can realign our expectations in the physical world with our experiences in the digital realm, the closer we can get to establishing effective norms and rules for digital interactions. As a starting point, we can map our expectations in the physical realm to the digital realm, taking the analogy of a shopping mall.</p>
 3.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The physical shopping mall 
<p>When we walk through a physical shopping mall, we inhabit a space that constitutes a series of overlapping relationships and legal statuses with respect to different parties, both known and unknown to us. We can window shop and weave in and out of individual shops at will, without signing any contracts or affirmatively accepting any terms. In fact, there are few legal ceremonies in a trip to the mall, apart from the occasional receipt that needs signing. That is not to say the mall is a lawless place.</p>
<p>The mall’s entrances may display a host of written notices about a prohibition on smoking, penalties for unlawful trespassing, maximum occupancy limits, or the use of security or surveillance cameras, among other conditions of entry. By law, such notices must be clear and easily legible and they must be posted conspicuously, such as near the main entrance and exit or access doorways in a given room or space. The terms of these notices are not negotiable and we are not asked to sign a consent form; we likely do not even know the identity of the property owner who is providing such notice. Rather, by entering the mall, we are presumed to understand and accept the conditions notified.</p>
<p>While inside the mall, we are generally anonymous apart from individuals personally known to us or while in shops or spaces we regularly visit; even then, we might be recognized but not identified by name or personal credentials. Typically, we can travel through the mall as one of many faces in the crowd, in a 1:N relationship to the mall and shop owners. While we may be on notice of security staff or the use of surveillance cameras in the mall’s common areas or individual shops, we still have a reasonable expectation of privacy in fitting rooms, restrooms, medical clinics or consultation rooms, and other areas.</p>
<p>Finally, property owners have basic obligations to maintain the safety and security of their premises and are typically liable for any harm or injury suffered as a result of their negligence. Individual store owners are typically responsible for keeping their premises clean and safe for customers, while mall owners are responsible for common areas like parking lots, walkways, elevators and escalators, and ensuring the safety of visitors in these areas. Moreover, shopping malls are quasi-public spaces where individuals retain certain fundamental rights. Compare this to the experience of browsing the Web as it exists today.</p>
 3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The virtual shopping mall 
<p>Typically, we enter into the online or digital space through a browser such as Google Chrome or Apple’s Safari. If we download a new browser, we may be asked to click a box to accept a license agreement, terms of service, and/or privacy policy. Where a browser is preinstalled or the default browser on a device, consent may be bundled into an operating system’s blanket terms or license agreement. Even if we are unaware of a browser’s terms or privacy policy, its use is deemed to be implied “consent” or acceptance of them.</p>
<p>Once “online” via the browser, we can enter and exit various web properties such as individual websites and webpages owned and operated by different product and service providers. As in the physical realm, these property owners may stipulate conditions that apply to “being on their premises,” i.e. using their website or app, via written notices. But unlike in the physical realm, the terms are presented as contracts. In fact, we are “practically unable to engage in any online activity without being forced to accept the terms of an electronic contract,” notwithstanding their deficiencies. This includes the digital equivalents of window shopping, weaving in and out of shops without making a purchase, and an array of other activities that do not require contracts in the physical world.</p>
<p>Where we expect to be an anonymous face in the crowd to a mall or shop owner, we are typically identified, known, and tracked by digital equivalents, including the browser and website operator, with no reasonable expectation of privacy, even when we are not “logged in.” We are equally exposed whether in a perceived public forum like a social media newsfeed or a presumed private setting such as talking to a therapist through a mental health app. Even when using Google’s Chrome in Incognito mode, our activity may still be visible to third parties. Our activity is tracked across sites and properties, and shared with or sold to an infinite number of other entities for their unlimited purposes.</p>
<p>Unlike in the physical realm where we have some legal precedent to protect our fundamental rights, the digital realm is largely devoid of such protections, at least in the U.S., where we lack a comprehensive federal privacy law or equivalent legal safeguards. Moreover, unlike physical property owners, app developers, website operators, and other digital service providers have virtually no obligations to undertake routine maintenance or to ensure minimum safety and security protections for their users as visitors or invitees on their properties. The deep divergence between our physical and digital realities is not a feature of technology but results from the economic logic of surveillance capitalism and defective legal foundations for the digital realm.</p>
 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A New Legal Foundation 
<p>In order to realign our norms and expectations in the physical and digital realms, we need better legal frameworks that move away from the hyper-individualistic or atomistic approach of “notice and choice.” Each of the components listed below provides an alternative to notice and choice. Together, they could create a more robust foundation for protecting the rights and interests of individuals in the context of digital interactions, whether in a Me2B Relationship or not.</p>
 3.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prohibitions on processing 
<p>First, we must end digital exceptionalism, i.e. what is illegal offline should also be illegal online. Just as there are capacity limitations, building and fire codes, and other restrictions imposed on physical property owners, digital services providers should be subject to specific prohibitions on certain data processing activities or uses of technology, particularly where an individual cannot opt out of a generalized practice. For example, a number of cities have recently banned the use of general facial recognition technologies to collect and process the biometrics of constituents.Other proposals would impose bans or prohibitions on the use of personal data to discriminate in decisions related to housing, employment, credit, insurance, and public accommodations. In such instances, individual preferences are overridden by a collective interest in prohibiting these activities. Reestablishing meaningful Me2B Relationships in the face of pervasive surveillance capitalism may require similar prohibitions, such as outright bans on the business of data brokers, the commercial sale of personal data and behavioral insights, and cross-site tracking outside of a relationship.</p>
 3.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Risk-based frameworks 
<p>Second, just as physical shop owners owe a duty of care and must undertake regular maintenance to promote the safety and security of their customers, digital product and service providers should owe a similar duty and be subject to risk-based measures to ensure the safety and security of their customers. At present, technical intermediaries, including browsers and apps, have virtually no legal obligation to protect the rights and interests of their users. As a result, they tend to privilege the commercial interests of customers, advertisers, and other parties, over those of individuals. In some cases, their competitive interests may result in better protections. For example, Apple undertakes a minimal vetting process, and mandates certain base level privacy and security requirements, before making an app available to consumers in its App Store. While this helps shift the burden of assessing risk away from the individual and onto the app provider, who is better positioned to assess it, corporate goodwill is not a sufficient basis for a new legal paradigm.</p>
<p>This burden-shifting must be mandated by law through the imposition of risk-based frameworks. Rather than outright prohibitions, this may entail prohibiting the use of a technology or data processing activity by an entity before it has undertaken a variety of ex-ante impact assessments. In addition to traditional privacy and data protection impact assessments, these may include social, ethical, economic, civil rights, and human rights-based impact assessments. More radical proposals would require entities to demonstrate safety and efficacy, as well as freedom from bias, before going to market. The aim of such proposals is to shift the burden of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risk away from individuals and onto the asymmetrically more powerful entities creating the risk, thereby reducing the cognitive load on individuals when deciding how to interact and transact digitally.</p>
 3.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contextual integrity 
<p>In addition to prohibitions and risk-based frameworks, it is critical to reestablish context in the digital realm. One method of doing so may be by adapting the theory of privacy as contextual integrity to digital life. Contextual integrity “ties adequate protection for privacy to&nbsp;norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;to that context and obey the governing norms of&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;within it.” For example, a norm of&nbsp;appropriateness&nbsp;makes it acceptable for a doctor to inquire about a patient’s weight, but unacceptable for an employer to do so. Similarly, a norm of&nbsp;distribution makes it appropriate for a doctor to share a patient’s prescription with a pharmacist (under the condition it remains confidential), but inappropriate for the same doctor to share that information with the patient’s employer (at least not without the patient’s informed consent).</p>
<p>While we can easily identify context in the physical realm, we tend to treat the online or digital realm as a single monolithic context,&nbsp;tolerating behaviors and practices we would find objectionable offline. For example, we allow Google to read our email and Facebook to read our messages even though we would likely object to a neighbor reading our snail mail or a spouse reading our texts. Moreover, we use the same legal ceremonies and the same deficient “notice and choice” paradigm in wildly different contexts, whether a medical chat bot or Facebook’s newsfeed. With the reduced signaling effect of legal ceremonies in the digital realm, context is ever harder to establish. In the face of this context collapse, establishing norms of appropriateness and distribution requires reestablishing context in digital interactions, including by determining relationship states relative to specific entities.</p>
 3.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Necessity” and minimization 
<p>With contextual integrity restored in the digital realm, we could limit data collection and processing to what is necessary in a given context. Rather than requiring individuals to “consent” to each individual instance of data collection or use, limiting data collection and processing to what is necessary for a given transaction or interaction by default would help reduce cognitive strain and realign expectations with reality. It could also limit the distortions caused by an unbounded parallel dataverse and behavioral “surplus” that feeds parasitic actors in the surveillance capitalist paradigm. Much of this surplus results from the widespread reliance on “notice and choice” and consent-based frameworks that fail to account for data processing outside of primary commercial relationships.</p>
<p>Necessity is not new. European data protection law, which requires data minimization, allows for processing personal data where necessary for the “performance of a contract” or prior to entering into a contract and for “legitimate interests” pursued by a controller or third party. In the U.S., the draft Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020 would go further to prohibit an entity from collecting, using, sharing, or otherwise processing any personal data unless it can demonstrate it is “strictly necessary to carry out a permissible purpose.” Permissible purposes include providing a good, service, or specific feature requested by an individual in an intentional interaction, and non-targeted advertising. As with contextual integrity, limiting collection by default may require overhauling technical infrastructure and the difficult task of establishing norms about what is “permissible” or “necessary.”</p>
 3.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiduciary duties 
<p>Finally, where it may be desirable to share personal data beyond what is strictly necessary for a given transaction or interaction, such as to save payment information or remember personal preferences, or for any other purposes that would serve the individual’s interests while respecting her preferences, an obligation must attach to that sharing. The Alliance describes this principle as “no data about me without an obligation.” Such obligation may take the form of legally mandated fiduciary duties imposed on parties seeking to collect or use personal data. For example, a leading proposal would treat existing online providers as “information fiduciaries” legally bound by general fiduciary duties.</p>
<p>The most common fiduciary obligation is the duty of care, often expressed in data security terms, requiring enterprises to take reasonable or prudent care in securing personal data and to avoid deliberately causing harm. A higher duty of loyalty may require entities to avoid conflicting duties (the “thin” version) or to act in an individual user’s best interests (the “thick” version). For example, the duty of loyalty may require preventing uses of data that would harm or offend a reasonable user. Finally, a duty of confidentiality would require enterprises to bind data processors and sub-processors to the same duty of confidentiality as binds them in performing their obligations for that enterprise.</p>
<p>Fiduciary-style obligations and duties are typically grounded in asymmetrical personal relationships such as between doctors and patients or attorneys and clients. Applying them to the digital realm requires identifying appropriate relationships to which they might attach. Moreover, as such obligations only make sense in the context of primary relationships, they could not, standing alone, provide a sufficient legal foundation to remedy the nefarious effects of the parallel dataverse and logic of surveillance capitalism on Me2B Relationships. Rather, they must be layered on top of these other foundational building blocks as laid out above.</p>
 3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical Scaffolding 
<p>Without a new legal paradigm, technology can do little to restore respectful digital relationships in the face of powerful commercial incentives. Even with such a foundation in place, there will still be too many interactions and touchpoints to effectively scale our cognitive capacity and human agency in the digital realm. Without scaling, we cannot address the steep power asymmetries at play as between individuals and entities in the digital sphere. By helping scale the individual’s ability to express and promote her interests and preferences in the digital realm, technology can act as a kind of scaffolding to support and uphold the new rules in practice, thereby restoring mutuality to Me2B Relationships.</p>
 3.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The browser as “digital proxy” 
<p>Until we can physically inhabit a digital space, we will require some kind of technical infrastructure to act as our “digital proxy.” Right now, we show up through a combination of technical intermediaries who have competing interests, none of which uniquely represents our own. In other words, we lack an effective digital proxy. As such, many proposals for fixing the Web call for new intermediaries, such as digital avatars, personal artificial intelligence, and virtual assistants. The idea is that these tools could help individuals scale their knowledge, capacity, and resources to lessen the asymmetrical power dynamics that exist in the digital realm and approximate the dynamics of offline, in-person interactions. But why not begin by leveraging existing intermediaries in service of the new paradigm?</p>
<p>The browser is in a unique position to support this paradigm by helping to realign our experiences in the digital realm with our expectations in the physical one. In order to act as our digital proxy, we must be known to the browser by establishing credentials and setting out our preferences. This means, we must enter into a genuine Me2B Relationship with the browser by executing a valid legal contract and providing meaningful, informed consent to its terms of service and privacy policies. Under this validly formed contract, the browser could not make any material changes to the contract unilaterally and any violations would be enforceable at law, unlike under the current paradigm.</p>
<p>To act as our digital proxy, the browser must be bound by a thick duty of loyalty mandated by law, not commercial preference. This duty would require it to promote and privilege our individual interests above the interests of all other parties or stakeholders in a given interaction or transaction. The browser would also have heightened obligations to store, communicate, and manage our individual preferences vis-à-vis other web properties, including preferences such as “do-not-track” or “do-not-sell-my-data” requests under laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Finally, the browser must be held to a duty of confidentiality with respect to our browsing activity and search history.</p>
<p>The browser could also help streamline legal ceremonies in the digital realm. Acting as our digital proxy to enforce our preferences, the browser could scan and read the many property-style notices we encounter. Rather than forcing us into defective contracts with each product or service or digital property we explore, it could undertake an initial screening process to eliminate any providers whose terms do not align with our values or meet our preferences. After this initial gating, we could decide whether to enter into a Me2B Relationship with a relevant service provider for purposes of completing a transaction or interaction through a validly formed contract. Reducing the number of contracts should also reduce the cognitive strain and help restore the signaling effect of digital legal ceremonies.</p>
<p>Going back to the shopping mall analogy, the browser would enter digital space as we would physical space, carrying our own preferences and inclinations forward into the digital realm. Through the browser as our digital proxy, we could visit websites, webpages, and other digital properties anonymously. This would require a technical means by which to obscure our identity vis-à-vis our digital proxy. We could then explore or weave in and out of these properties, as we can in the physical world, without establishing a commercial relationship or entering into a defective contract. Finally, the browser could help further reestablish context by locating us in digital time and in space, to give us a fuller picture of the various stakeholders involved in a given interaction or transaction as well as its potential data footprint.<a></a></p>
 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me2B Relationships in the New Paradigm 
<p>Having outlined a vision for a new legal foundation, supplemented by new applications of technology, this section examines what digital interactions might look like in this new paradigm, according to relationship state.</p>
 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respectful Defaults 
<p>With general prohibitions in place to outlaw toxic and pernicious behaviors that are impossible to opt out of at an individual level and the imposition of mandatory risk-based frameworks to assess the safety and security of digital products and services before they hit the market, our digital interactions would be inherently more protective of our interests. As a matter of principle, ending digital exceptionalism by prohibiting online what is illegal offline offers a good starting point. Working to articulate the acceptable bounds of our digital interactions, achieving consensus on specific behaviors and practices that should be outlawed, and determining the necessary risk-based assessments that must be undertaken by a product or service provider, are also key steps. Once in place, all digital interactions would benefit from more respectful defaults and baseline protections, whether in the context of a Me2B Relationship or not.</p>
 4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relationship States 
 4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The no Me2B relationship state 
<p>The “No Me2B Relationship State” can exist: (1) before an individual has entered into a Me2B Relationship and established unique credentials with a given product or service provider; (2) after the individual’s credentials have been destroyed upon termination of a Me2B Relationship with a given product or service provider; or (3) when an individual has an existing Me2B Relationship and unique credentials with a given product or service provider but chooses to participate in a specific transaction or interaction anonymously without presenting those credentials, rather than through the relationship. For example, a retail customer of Target.com who has a customer account with Target may nevertheless decide to checkout in “guest mode.” In the new paradigm, the browser acting as our digital proxy could “know” our relationship state in relation to each digital product or service provider we encounter online.</p>
<p>In the No Me2B Relationship State, having no unique business relationship with an entity, an individual has no need to establish unique credentials with it. Rather, the individual will be able to interact with that entity’s digital properties as an anonymous face in the crowd, in a 1:N property-based relationship, just as she would in relation to shops in a physical mall. The browser would provide a technical means by which to obscure our identity vis-à-vis the service provider. Unlike in the current “notice and choice” paradigm, defective contractual instruments in the form of terms and conditions or terms of service would be unnecessary in the No Me2B Relationship State under the new paradigm. Instead, the default legal ceremony would be a property-style notice not requiring any affirmative act from the individual. In the new paradigm, contracts become the exception rather than the norm, helping restore their signaling effect.</p>
<p>Before entering into the Me2B Relationship State with a given entity, the browser as our digital proxy would have scanned and pre-screened that entity’s terms and conditions, privacy policies, and any other relevant notices for compliance with our indicated values, preferences, and requirements. We could then enter the service provider’s digital space with awareness and acceptance of these conditions. Should the browser detect any unreasonable notices that violate our values or preferences, it could provide a notification or alert recommending “exit” or “caution.”&nbsp; Even while in a digital space in a No Me2B Relationship State, the service provider would still owe us a duty of care, having to take reasonable or prudent steps to secure any data or insights gleaned, ensure minimum safety standards, and avoid deliberately causing us harm.</p>
 4.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Me2B relationship state 
<p>Should we want to establish a business relationship with an entity to be “recognized, remembered, and responded to,” we would enter into a Me2B Relationship by creating an account, signing up for a membership or loyalty scheme, or by otherwise establishing unique credentials with the entity, with the help of the browser as our digital proxy. This would be achieved through a validly formed electronic contract requiring an affirmative act on our part, and may also be supplemented by means of “whitelisting” or other technical mechanisms implemented by the browser. Once in this Me2B Relationship, the service provider could not unilaterally change the terms of such contract without jeopardizing the relationship or risking legal liability. We could now participate in specific transactions or interactions in a “Me2B Relationship State.”</p>
<p>While in a Me2B Relationship State, we would remain identified, share personal information, and participate in exchanges of mutually agreed upon value through our browser as our digital proxy. The website owner or operator would owe us more than a mere duty of care as in the No Me2B Relationship State. Rather, when transacting or interacting with an entity in this Me2B Relationship State, the entity would also be legally bound by duties of loyalty and confidentiality. Even with these heightened duties owed, the browser could help provide additional context for specific interactions or transactions by giving us a fuller picture of the various stakeholders involved and even its potential footprint in the parallel dataverse. We could then elect to participate in either relationship state.</p>
<p>The browser could provide this ability to transition between relationship states, affording us the same agency in digital spaces as we have in physical ones, carrying our own preferences and inclinations forward into the digital realm. In this way, the browser would no longer be a mere technical intermediary or T. Rather, it would be transformed into an approximation of the “Me” in a Me2B Relationship. With the browser acting as “Me’s” genuine digital proxy and obligated to promote Me’s interests in all digital interactions, what were previously Me—T—B style relationships become much more like direct Me2B Relationships again. In this way, the new paradigm helps to restore the mutuality of Me2B Relationships to approximate relationships in the physical realm.<a></a></p>
 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusions 
<p>Based on the above analysis, we can draw a number of preliminary conclusions. First, Me2B Relationships in the digital realm are multidimensional relationships with commercial, legal, and technical dimensions. Through this technical dimension, data generated in the ordinary course of our Me2B Relationships creates a fourth hidden dimension—a&nbsp; kind of “parallel dataverse” that is largely invisible to us as individuals. This hidden dimension has significant consequences for Me2B Relationships despite exceeding our cognitive capacity to appreciate them.</p>
<p>Second, as a result of surveillance capitalism, myriad parasitic entities feed off of this parallel dataverse in ways that exploit and undermine our primary Me2B Relationships. Thus, a given Me2B Relationship cannot be assessed in isolation from the complex and overlapping relationships between various parties directly and indirectly involved in a given digital interaction or transaction, including individuals (Me-s), product and service providers (B-s), technical intermediaries (T-s), and parasites (n-s).</p>
<p>Third, our prevailing legal paradigm for digital interactions, in the form of “notice and choice,” stems from an overly simplistic and antiquated view of the digital universe formed in the 1970s. It is comprised of defective legal ceremonies and also suffers from a growing number of practical defects. Moreover, it only accounts for primary relationships, failing to consider the impact of an increasingly complex digital realm running on the logic of surveillance capitalism. By only accounting for one dimension of our digital lives, this legal paradigm and its associated legal ceremonies leaves us exposed and vulnerable with insufficient safeguards and protections.</p>
<p>Fourth, any viable path forward must acknowledge this complexity and provide a strong underlying foundational framework to situate Me2B Relationships in this broader context and help realign our expectations in the digital world with our experiences in the physical realm. This realignment can help guide the development of effective norms and rules for our digital interactions regardless of relationship state.</p>
<p>Fifth, a robust new legal foundation must prohibit certain activities and practices, mandate a risk-based approach to commercializing digital products and services, reestablish context for digital interactions, limit default data collection and processing to what is necessary for primary business purposes, and impose higher standards and obligations on parties who seek to go beyond what is necessary in the context of a bonafide commercial relationship.</p>
<p>Finally, existing and emerging technologies could help play an important role to support and help enforce this new legal paradigm in practice, starting with the browser as our “digital proxy.” Through legal mandates requiring technological tools like the browser to act in service of, rather than for purposes of extracting value from, our Me2B Relationships, we can help rebuild respectful relationships in the digital realm based on an ethos of mutual respect.</p>

	<p>The concept of better privacy practices is not new – we’ve been talking about it since the birth of the internet. But what exactly does “better privacy” mean, and how do we get there?</p>
<p>Policymakers have been working on legislation oriented around privacy for some time. While there have been some steps in the right direction, significant change won’t happen until we broaden the lens. What most people want but don’t have the terms to describe is respectful digital relationships. In the same way there is an unspoken code for respectful behavior in physical-realm relationships, this same type of behavior is just as essential when engaging with an online service or website.</p>
<p>Today, MIT Computational Law Report published a framework for policymakers to understand and advocate for more respectful digital relationships based on the <a href="https://me2ba.org/about/principles/">Me2B Alliance vision</a>.</p>
<p>The article, “<a href="https://law.mit.edu/pub/rebuildingrespectfulrelationships/release/4">Rebuilding Respectful Relationships in the Digital Realm</a>,” penned by Elizabeth Renieris, an internationally recognized expert in law, policy and digital privacy, describes the Me2B Alliance’s approach to digital engagement with a focus on the legal and technological foundations necessary to rebuild digital relationships based on an ethos of mutual respect.</p>
<p>Renieris’ paper proceeds in five parts:</p>
<p>1. Digital relationships today and surveillance capitalism. Examines the Me2B Relationship in context, including in the macro-context of a phenomenon known as surveillance capitalism, which distorts and undermines the very ethos of the Me2B Relationship.</p>
<p>2. Today’s failed opt-out paradigm. Outlines the failures of the prevailing “notice and choice” paradigm for digital interactions, including its legal and practical defects, as well as how such defects result from a failure to account for the effects of surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>3. An alternative path forward. Maps the expectations we have in the physical world onto the digital world, including through new legal foundations and innovative uses of technology to realign expectations and reality.</p>
<p>4. Digital interactions in this new paradigm. Defines interactions according to the relevant Me2B Relationship state.</p>
<p>5. Conclusions and recommends. Identifies next steps for research and exploration by the Alliance.</p>
<p>Policymakers take note: this is where privacy legislation needs to go in order to turn these small steps into leaps in the right direction. The vocabulary and concepts defined in this paper will help to define what is much more complex than “privacy” alone. We urge policymakers to internalize these concepts and start infusing respect into privacy-related legislation.</p>

				 <p>Over the past years, the question of how we can protect our identity in the world of online has been getting more heated. The Self-Sovereign Identity paradigm stepped in with the idea itself, that everyone should be in charge of their own digital personal information, and that it is the data owner who should decide on how this data is being used and by whom.</p>
<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) promises to empower European citizens with new means to manage privacy, to eliminate logins, and to enjoy much faster and safer electronic transactions via the internet as well as in real life.</p>
<p>Strengthening internet trustworthiness with electronic identities is also the aim of eSSIF-Lab, which has just launched its Second Business-oriented Open Call on 7 May 2021.</p>
<p></p> 
			   
				
				
				  2nd Business-oriented Open Call 
<p>This call is open&nbsp;for proposals to develop and demonstrate SSI working solutions for a real-world, domain-oriented problem or opportunity, in prioritized eSSIF-Lab areas (Health Tech, e-Government and Education), or in the Open Disruptive Innovation track (which is covering innovative bottom-up projects out of these verticals).</p>
<p>Proposed solutions must be commercial, competitive and sector-specific SSI applications for products and services. They are expected to leverage on the added value that previously developed functionalities within the eSSIF-Lab, to include the issuing, exchange and consumption of SSI credentials as a core element and to have high technology and investment readiness levels.</p>
<p>The proposals selected in the Second Business-oriented Call will be invited to join an 8-month acceleration programme, including business and technical support to integrate eSSIF-Lab and other SSI technology with market propositions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Who can apply? 
					  
 
 
<p>This call targets SMEs (including startups), not-for-profit entities (such as foundations or associations), or collaborative initiatives (as micro-consortia of these entities), registered in a Member State of the EU or in a H2020 associated country.</p>
<p>Deadline: 7th of July 2021, at 17:00 (Brussels Local Time).</p>
<p>Funding: up to 106,000 € per project (for those best in class).</p>

				  Infrastructure-oriented Open Call 
<p>Remember that also the Infrastructure-oriented Open Call of eSSIF-Lab is still ongoing and that the deadline to submit applications has been extended. This call looks for&nbsp;open source technical enhancements and extensions for eSSIF-Lab Framework which fall within the SSI concept (i.e. technologies which allow individuals to control their electronic identities and guard their privacy).</p>
<p>Open source SSI components developed as a result of this open call will be applied by other participants in eSSIF-Lab and, hence, applicants shall be willing and able to work in an agile way with lots of communication and interaction with other participants in the eSSIF-Lab ecosystem.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Who can apply? 
					  
 
 
<p>Innovators in the SSI domain (such as outstanding academic research groups, hi-tech startups, SMEs, etc.), legally established/resident in a Member State of the EU or in a H2020 associated country.</p>

<p>Companies, customers and suppliers need a shared view of the real supply chain situation on the blockchain, enabling them to solve communication problems while avoiding costly bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Blockchain with its crypto-economic incentives can become the exchange network to make commerce. network companies interact with each other easily, cheaply and securely.</p>
<p>The key to successful global collaboration between companies is based on trust. Trust on the blockchain is achieved by the transparent processes that enable the certified exchange of a document to be facilitated, controlled, or enforced, making any further verification unnecessary. The exchange of a document based on the blockchain is performed through an electronic signature system that can be verified by all users (shareDoc).<br>
Blockchain creates a decentralized system of trust bringing the following benefits:</p>
<p>Transparency and collaboration: on Commercio.network, documentation is tamper-proof. Our blockchain certifies the product’s journey throughout the supply chain and shares it with stakeholders. The system works without a central data repository or a single administrator as it is decentralized.</p>
<p>Scalability and Availability: Commercio.network solves scalability issues for write transactions. All people in the world can access the distributed and redundant datasets stored via the Internet as they are distributed.</p>
<p>Security and Privacy: a Commercio.network node does not reveal the identity of the person or organization and the commercial document is signed by an electronic signature with private and public cryptographic keys that cannot be altered as they are immutable.</p>
<p><a href="http://commercio.network">Commercio.network</a>, has created a “trusted” network where businesses can exchange business documents securely through the blockchain. The sum of each individual document pass creates greater value, because through a transparent process of co-certification it validates the certifiable processes of all parties involved</p>

<p><a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, the decentralized network for data stream processing, and <a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a>, Web3's first cross-chain identity model, are now integrated with Avalanche. Starting today, developers and users have a new, powerful way to manage identities and dynamic off-chain data in their applications.<a href="https://ceramic.network"></a></p><p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more. </p><p>Developers building applications on Avalanche can easily add support for Ceramic and IDX in their application with a seamless user experience. Avalanche key pairs have been added as a supported signing and<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains"> authentication method</a> for Ceramic's data streams, so users can now perform transactions on Ceramic with their existing Avalanche wallets.</p> Blockchain, Data &amp; Identity: a full stack for Web3 developers <p>Avalanche offers developers the most scalable infrastructure for building decentralized apps and services. It is the first decentralized smart contracts platform built for the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction finality. Ethereum developers can quickly build on Avalanche as Solidity works out-of-the-box.</p><p>Great Web3 and DeFi apps require more than a smart contract platform, however. They also need sophisticated, scalable and dependable data management infrastructure.</p><p>Ceramic provides advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. Now that Avalanche and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem  <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">Ceramic's unique stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data model. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information.<a href="http://idx.xyz"> IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables.

<p>So, what do Blockchain Commons’ technologies do? We’ve just released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">a Technology Overview video</a> that discuses the concepts and foundations underlying our work and also highlights many of our most important technological releases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY"></a></p>

<p>As the video notes, our work is built on a considerable volume of existing literature. We work with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m56s">entropy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m39s">seeds</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m45s">keys</a> and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=6m34s">airgaps</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=5m12s">multisigs</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m6s">secure storage</a> to ensure robust key creation, safe key usage, and responsible key management. We also build on crucial technological foundations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m13s">CBOR</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m37s">CRC-32</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=14m53s">Fountain Codes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=8m15s">QRs</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=12m55s">SHA-256</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=13m36s">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a>.</p>

<p>This results in a number of core Blockchain Commons technologies:
</p>
 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=16m21s">Bytewords</a> are a text-encoding method for binary data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=19m58s">Uniform Resources</a> support self-describing data that can be used interoperably. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=24m55s">LifeHash</a> allows for graphical recognition of seeds, keys, and other data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=26m52s">SSKR</a> provides new libraries and methodologies for sharding secrets. 
   The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=28m46s">Torgap</a> architecture creates security by partitioning blockchain services. 
 

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">Technology Overview video</a> discusses all of this and more.</p>

<p>We are also continuing to produce documents of use for the entire blockchain community, with our newest tutorials offering more depth on how to use the technologies highlighted in this video. That begins with some just-published developer-focused documents that expand on the overview of Uniform Resources (URs) found in the video. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources: An Overview</a> explains how URs are put together, and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-2-keys.md">A Guide to Using URs for Key Material</a> looks at <code>ur:crypto-seed</code>, <code>ur:crypto-bip39</code>, and <code>ur:crypto-hdkey</code> as three different ways to transmit key material in a standardized, typed format. (We have more UR docs planned on SSKRs, PSBTs, and our new request and response system.)</p>

<p>The specifications, architectures, references, and documents that we’re creating at Blockchain Commons are all meant to improve interoperability among many different vendors, to support the creation of wallets (and future cryptography applications) that enable independence, security, and resilience for their users. We’ve been working with an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> to create these various technologies. If you’re designing blockchain applications of your own, we hope you’ll view the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">video</a> to see how some of our technologies can help you.</p>

<p>You can also support the continued development of technologies like these, meant to support the entire community by becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor at GitHub</a> or by making a one-time donation <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">at our BTCPay</a>.</p>

<p>Federal agencies should choose FIDO as they seek to comply with the new Executive Order that requires the implementation of multi-factor authentication within the next 180 days.</p>



<p>By: Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and Chief Marketing Officer, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>In the face of recent attacks that have exposed areas of weakness in critical U.S. infrastructure assets, President Biden signed a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order Wednesday to help bolster the nation’s cybersecurity</a>.</p>



<p>There have been a number of high profile attacks against critical American infrastructure in recent months, including the Solarwinds supply chain attack that exposed much of the government to potential risk. Top of mind in recent days is the ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline, which significantly impacted the flow of refined oil across America. These attacks expose the vulnerability of critical infrastructure in the United States, and the Biden Administration is issuing federal directives that will minimize or eliminate risk.</p>



<p>A key part of the Executive Order is a requirement that agencies adopt multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent possible. Federal Civilian Branch Agencies will have 180 days to comply with the Executive Order and will need to report on progress every 60 days until adoption is complete. If for some reason agencies cannot fully adopt MFA and encryption within 180 days, they must report to Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director of CISA, the Director of OMB, and the APNSA with a rationale for not meeting the deadline.</p>



<p>At the FIDO Alliance, we welcome today’s directive from the Biden Administration and applaud its focus on the importance of multi-factor authentication. What’s notable about this Executive Order is that the White House is prioritizing MFA everywhere, rather than limiting MFA to the PIV/PKI platform that agencies have depended on for more than 15 years. Today’s Executive Order marks an important step forward, in that it makes clear the priority is protecting every account with MFA — without mandating any specific technology. This is a notable shift, because we know that the weakest forms of MFA can still stop some attacks where passwords are the attack vector. We also know that FIDO Authentication is the only standards-based alternative to PIV for those applications that need protection against phishing attacks. This Executive Order opens the door for agencies to deploy FIDO Authentication — something we’ve heard they’ve wanted to do but have held back as use of any non-PIV authentication has not been permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time the U.S Government has advocated for the use of MFA and strong encryption. In an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights_Actions_to_Counter_Email-Based_Attacks_on_Election-Related_S508C.pdf">advisory</a> issued by CISA in September 2020 on election security, the government agency noted that the majority of cyber-espionage incidents are enabled by phishing, and FIDO security keys are the only form of MFA that offer protection from phishing attacks 100% of the time.</p>



<p>In fact, the U.S. Government hasn’t just been advocating for the use of strong authentication with FIDO, it has actually already been implementing it since at least 2018 on the <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> portal. With <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> the U.S. Government is already offering a secure approach to help citizens and agencies to securely access Federal resources. In June 2019, the FIDO Alliance hosted a <a href="http://www.apple.com">webinar</a> detailing the deployment case study for login.gov, which is now even more timely with the need for agencies to adopt strong authentication in the next 180 days.</p>



<p>Since its inception, the FIDO Alliance has been bringing industry partners together, including every major operating system vendor as well as technology and consumer service providers across all industry verticals including financial services, ecommerce and government. All those diverse groups have been working together in common purpose to standardize strong authentication. Billions of devices around the world today can support FIDO Authentication and are ready to play their part in ensuring a strong authentication future. The fact that most major cloud providers, device manufacturers and browser vendors all ship with support for FIDO means that agencies can easily leverage MFA that is built in, rather than other products that need to be “bolted on.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there is one thing that the recent spate of attacks has served to once again remind us, it’s that the private sector and public sector need strong security measures to protect critical infrastructure — and the FIDO Alliance believes this begins with authentication.</p>



<p>We urge government agencies to adopt only the strongest forms of MFA when complying with this directive. The FIDO Alliance and its members stand ready to serve and help agencies with the education, resources and tools to implement strong authentication to help reduce risk and improve the cybersecurity posture of the U.S. Government.</p>

 Information about the candidate OASIS Standard and the OSLC Open Project 



<p>This is the first work of an OASIS Open Project to be submitted as a candidate for OASIS Standard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The OSLC initiative applies Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP), to create a cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other distributed network resources to interoperate successfully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Change Management v3.0 defines a RESTful web services interface for managing product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships as well as related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Me2B Alliance (Me2BA) <a href="https://me2ba.org/me2ba-product-testing-spotlight-report-published-data-sharing-in-primary-secondary-school-mobile-apps-2/">research</a>&nbsp;recently found that 60% of the school apps we reviewed were sending student data to potentially high-risk third parties without knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance is a nonprofit fostering the respectful treatment of people by technology.&nbsp; We’re a new type of standards development organization – defining the standard for respectful technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re working to&nbsp;raise awareness around the unacceptable amount of student data shared with third parties – particularly advertisers and analytics platforms – in school apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that people have too little information about which third parties they’re sharing data with when they use an app. We encourage Apple and Google to make this information more clear in their App stores.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenarios like the ones described in&nbsp;our&nbsp;report – where user data is being abused, even inadvertently – highlight the types of issues we are driven to prevent through independent testing, as well as education, research, policy work, and advocacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One aspect of European privacy law (GDPR) that has received a great deal of attention is the “right to be forgotten,” outlined in Article 17 entitled “right to erasure” (“right to be forgotten”). Simply put, “oblivion” means that organizations must completely erase records containing an individual’s data from all files on each of the following occasions</p>
 
 When the person revokes their consent. 
 When the purpose for which the data was collected is complete. 
 When it is required by law. 4 EU Regulation 2016 679) 
 
<p>It is worth noting that this is not an absolute requirement and that individuals do not have an unconditional right to be “forgotten.” If the organization has legitimate and legal purposes – as stated in the regulation – for storing and processing data, subjects do not have the right to be forgotten. However, the exceptions are few compared to the multitude of uses of common data in our daily lives.</p>
<p>So, in the spirit of GDPR, how could <a href="http://Commercio.network">Commercio. network</a> ensure that data is deleted from all places where it is stored or processed?</p>
<p>The first and only fundamental rule is to NEVER put personal data on a Blockchain.</p>
<p>When we share a document on our blockchain via the shareDocument function we NEVER put the document itself, but rather the fingerprint (called a hash) of the document itself.</p>

 Announcing preview availability of <a href="https://validator.schema.org">validator.schema.org</a> for review and feedback.<br>  <br>  As <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg/2020Dec/0002.html">agreed</a> <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/12/structured-data-testing-tool-update">last year</a>, Schema.org is the new home for the structured data validator previously known as the Structured Data Testing Tool (SDTT). It is now simpler to use, and available for testing. Schema.org will integrate feedback into its <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/blob/main/docs/validator.md">draft</a> documentation and add it more explicitly to the Schema.org website for the next official release.  <br>  SDTT is a tool from Google which began life as the&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2010/09/rich-snippets-testing-tool-improvements">Rich Snippets Testing Tool </a>back in 2010. Last year Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/07/rich-results-test-out-of-beta">announced plans</a> to migrate from SDTT to successor tooling, the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results">Rich Results Test</a>, alongside plans to "deprecate the Structured Data Testing Tool". The newer Google tooling is focused on helping publishers who are targeting specific schema.org-powered <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery">searc</a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">h features</a> offered by Google, and for these purposes is a huge improvement as it contextualizes many warnings and errors to a specific target application. <br>  However, many publishers had also appreciated SDTT as a powerful and general purpose structured data validator. Headlines such as "<a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-deprecate-the-structured-data-testing-tool-29737.html">Google Structured Data Testing Tool Going Away; SEOs Are Not Happy</a>" captured something of the mood.  <br>  Schema.org started out written only in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">Microdata</a>, before embracing&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/11/using-rdfa-11-lite-with-schemaorg.html">RDFa 1.1 Lite</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2013/06/schemaorg-and-json-ld.html">JSON-LD 1.0</a>. There are now huge amounts of Schema.org data in all of these formats and more (see&nbsp;<a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/#results-2020-1">webdatacommons</a>&nbsp;report). Schema.org endorsed these multiple encodings, because they can each meet different needs and constraints experienced by publishers. The new validator will check all of these formats.  <br>   Amongst all this complexity, it is important to remind ourselves of the importance of simplicity and usability of Schema.org markup for its founding purpose: machine-readable summaries of ordinary web page content. Markup that - when well-formed - helps real people find jobs, educational opportunities, images they can <a href="https://iptc.org/news/schema-org-update-for-better-mapping-to-iptc-photo-metadata/">re-use</a>, learn from fact checkers or find a recipe to cook for dinner.  <br>  This is the focus of the new Schema Markup Validator (SMV). It is simpler than its predecessor SDTT because it is dedicated to checking that you're using JSON-LD, RDFa and Microdata in widely understood ways, and to warning you if you are using Schema.org types and properties in unusual combinations. It does not try to check your content against the information needs of specific services, tools or products (a topic deserving its own blog post). But it will help you understand whether or not your data expresses what you hope it expresses, and to reflect the essence of your structured data back in an intuitive way that reflects its underlying meaning.   <br>  The <a href="http://validator.schema.org">validator.schema.org</a>&nbsp;service&nbsp;is powered by Google's general infrastructure for working with structured data, and is provided to the Schema.org project as a Google-hosted tool. We are also happy to note that many other schema.org-oriented validators are available, both commercial (e.g. <a href="https://yandex.com/support/webmaster/yandex-indexing/validator.html">Yandex's</a>) and opensource. For example, the <a href="http://linter.structured-data.org/">Structured Data Linter,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/playground/">JSON-LD Playground</a>, <a href="https://github.com/semantifyit/sdo-check/">SDO-Check</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/schemarama/">Schemarama</a>&nbsp;tools. We hope that the new Schema Markup Validator will stimulate collaboration among tool makers to improve consistency and developer experience for all those working on systems that consume Schema.org data.&nbsp;  <br>  Please share any feedback with the Schema.org community via <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2790">Github</a>, Twitter (#schemasmv), or the Schema.org W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">community group</a>.

<p>The Sovrin Foundation (“Sovrin”) Board of Trustees and Trust over IP Foundation (“ToIP”) Steering Committee are pleased to announce that they have signed a Letter Agreement (dated March 18, 2021). This agreement signifies the commitment of both organizations to mutual cooperation and recognition for each other’s mandates. Sovrin and ToIP intend to work together toward advancing the infrastructure and governance required for digital trust and digital identity ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By signing this Letter Agreement, Sovrin and ToIP are excited to take a step further to support the need and importance of our separate but interrelated mandates to benefit people and organizations across all social and economic sectors through secure digital identity ecosystems based on verifiable credentials and SSI,” said Chris Raczkowski, Chairman of Board of Trustees, Sovrin Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the agreement, each organization will assign one member to act as a liaison to coordinate and maintain lines of communication, attend plenary sessions, and provide periodic updates to the Sovrin Board of Trustees and ToIP Steering Committee. They will also seek opportunities proactively to exchange information, participate in discussions of shared interest, promote the value of each other’s work through joint announcements and media products, as well as collaborate to achieve their respective mandates.</p>



<p>Sovrin and ToIP both operate in a manner that respects open licensing, open source code and open standards. The organizations agree that their open, public materials will be available for reference (with attribution) by the other.</p>



<p>“ToIP and Sovrin each offer something unique to the market. Our members already collaborate together informally on many topics. Signing this agreement makes our work together more visible and open. It will create new opportunities to collaborate on challenges that affect every layer of our trust model,”&nbsp; said John Jordan, Executive Director of Trust over IP Foundation. “By working together, we want to help solve interoperability problems more quickly and support the adoption of digital trust ecosystems more widely.””&nbsp;</p>

<p>International trade is really “old school”, there is very little technology. There are still pieces of paper sent around the world to accompany trade exchanges and shipments, and the same system that has been in place since the mercantilist era of the 16th century is basically active.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, there have been systems called EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) that are used to exchange documents, but these systems are geared and tailored to their proponents, i.e., large companies in specific economic sectors (Retail, Automotive, Aerospace). Although these document exchange systems represent a big step towards the digitization of commerce, they are but a first step on a longer path.<br>
We can hope that in a few years, thanks to Blockchain, we will see the emergence of services that offer “end-to-end” supply chain solutions.<br>
This new type of entry point of end-to-end Supply Chain documentary business exchanges will offer a substantial new level of quality of management of commercial business processes, in order to:<br>
– Reduce errors: the entire order process is error-prone and thousands of paper and pencilled documents are often misinterpreted.<br>
– Reduce lead times: when executing a digital order the company can deliver faster, also reducing the related Order to Cash time.<br>
– Eliminate data entry costs: when everything is exchanged digitally, manual entry is no longer necessary and time and costs are reduced.<br>
– Improve traceability: when everything is done digitally, transactions are accounted for and any errors can be traced back to the point of origin.</p>
<p>Standardization of digital documents on commerce.network<br>
A huge challenge of the commerce.network blockchain is using a common data format to exchange information between players in a Supply Chain. For many years, the Supply Chain industry has struggled with insufficient EDI standardization resulting in its inadequate operation on a global basis. Our solution to this problem is not to create a new standard, but to be open to different standards, although we think that the emerging standard will be UBL 2.1.</p>

<p>Project Specification 02 is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that OSLC Core Version 3.0 from the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project [1] has been approved as an OASIS Project Specification.</p>



<p>Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle is very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across a product’s entire application and product lifecycle.</p>



<p>OSLC Core defines the overall approach to Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration based specifications and capabilities that extend and complement the W3C Linked Data Platform.</p>



<p>This Project Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the OP’s Project Governing Board and fully ready for testing and implementation. The applicable open source licenses can be found in the project’s administrative repository at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md">https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md</a>.</p>

  What is the mission and vision of BlueShore Financial?  



<p>BlueShore Financial’s mission: “Passionately improving our clients’ financial well-being in an interconnected, digital world.”</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Trustworthy digital identity is&nbsp;critical to enable the continued&nbsp;development of a robust digital economy in Canada, and the potential direct and indirect benefits that come with it for all Canadians. Furthermore, lack of&nbsp; a common trusted digital identity approach could result in a patchwork of various digital ID schemes, which would not only cause confusion for Canadians (and thus much slower adoption), but also create easy targets for cyber criminals.</p>



<p>From a financial industry perspective, a trustworthy digital ID is a critical component to successfully implement Open Banking, one of the globally accepted key trends in banking.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Two of the&nbsp;most populous&nbsp;countries in the world have established digital IDs: India with its government issued Unique ID (UID) number—or Aadhaar—identity program, and China with its digital identify provided by Ant Financial. These two countries are most populous with emerging economies. To remain a global player, Canada has to be able to compete with the likes of India and China when it comes to technology-savviness</p>



 <a href="https://www.blueshorefinancial.com/"></a> 



<p>Several other countries now have national digital identify programs and while these programs may not be perfect, they are evolving – Canada needs to do the same. Canada needs to start with a digital identity program, and then use an agile and iterative approach to evolve and keep up with new technologies as well as consumer needs and demands. Since Canada is somewhat late to the game, Canada can learn from the experience of other countries in both technology implementations and consumer rollout, which I know DIACC and its members from across the spectrum of government, finance, healthcare, telco, retail, auditors, etc., are discussing and working through DIACC Pan-Canadian Trusted Framework approach.</p>



<p>BlueShore addresses the challenges in two ways:</p>



<p>I.&nbsp;Internally we see digital identity as a core component of our digital transformation journey.</p>



<p>II. Broadly, digital identity is part of our conversations from Open Banking, to Payments Modernization to Data Privacy.&nbsp;We also work closely and in a “spirit of partnership” with our core technology partners.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada has a role to play as a G7 member to show digital leadership with respect to developing and launching a national digital identity program. Not only would this provide opportunities for Canadian businesses, but it would also demonstrate a model of how government and industries are able to work together to provide a key digital tool for Canadian consumers.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>BlueShore saw the work DIACC and&nbsp;its members were doing defining, creating and building a national digital identity framework. It was this framework approach that attracted our attention to bolster our digital transformation&nbsp;work.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>

  What is the mission and vision of Yubico?  



<p>Yubico was founded in Sweden with the mission to protect all internet citizens, making secure login easy and available to everyone.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Stolen credentials are a top online security risk for individuals and companies. Breaches cause severe financial, brand, and personal impact. It’s critical that people, and organizations, have access to solutions for all their different requirements.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity is critical for citizens, governments, and the private sector. As our lives move more and more online, our ability to identify ourselves in a secure, easy way will be key in order to access government systems, banking, and interact with goods and services providers.</p>



 <a href="https://www.yubico.com/"></a> 



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada has the opportunity to be a world leader in the digital identity space. Our emergence as a highly desirable destination for up-and-coming tech companies, along with the coinciding tech talent, places Canada in a unique position.&nbsp;In order to capitalize on&nbsp;Canada’s emergence, it will require a strong partnership between the private and public sectors to help enable citizens, clients, and employees to have a safe online experience. Organizations like the DIACC are paramount in bringing together the key stakeholders to help achieve this shared goal that will truly benefit every Canadian.</p>



<p>5. Why did Yubico join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Yubico has been a leader and innovator in the authentication space for over a decade. In 2020 Yubico decided to put its first sales and technical resources in Canada due to the growing demand for our products. DIACC has a reputation for bringing together like-minded organizations and people that share a vision of improved digital identity.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Yubico pioneered the design of the first one-time password authenticator to work with a simple touch and with no client software, and we made it compatible with the open authentication standard OATH. We then further secured and simplified the PIV smart card standard by adding touch-to-sign and built-in attestation. Yubico collaborated with Google and Microsoft to co-create the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) and FIDO2 open authentication standards. Our work has contributed to open identity standards organizations W3C, IETF, FIDO Alliance and OpenID.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> Alliance could not be happier to welcome <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> to our rapidly growing community of public and private sector organizations that share our commitment to realizing the benefits – and mitigating the risks – of digital ID at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Okta provides a secure, trusted platform for managing the identity of customers and employees. Founded in 2009, Okta currently provides technology to more than 9,400 organizations. Their commitment to the “good ID” agenda and prominent position in the identity and access management sector will make them an invaluable partner for the ID2020 Alliance.</p><p>At Okta’s core is the belief that social impact is foundational to its business and long-term success. <a href="https://www.okta.com/okta-for-good/">Okta for Good</a>, the company’s social impact arm, works to strengthen the links between people, technology, and community. By providing technical solutions for nonprofits, expanding economic opportunities and access to the tech sector, and empowering employees as changemakers, Okta for Good works to ensure that the company lives up to its long-term commitment to maximize benefits to society, the environment, and all of its stakeholders.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to welcome Okta to the ID2020 Alliance,” said executive director, Dakota Gruener. “If properly designed and ethically implemented, digital ID can be the key that unlocks previously inaccessible rights and opportunities for hundreds of millions of people globally. ID2020 and Okta share a common vision; to ensure that those keys are available to everyone.”</blockquote><blockquote>“According to USAID, ‘There may be no single factor that affects a person’s ability to share in the gains of global development as much as having an official identity. That’s why Okta is proud to have recently joined the ID2020 Alliance, a cross-sector effort of global organizations committed to an ethical approach to digital ID,” said Adam Rosenzweig, Senior Manager, Product Impact, “ID2020 plays a critical role in the evolving digital ID ecosystem by convening a diverse set of stakeholders to develop standards for the design and evaluation of digital identity implementations.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Alliance continues to grow, welcoming organizations from the public and private sectors that share our commitment to user-managed privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID. As an Alliance, we are only as strong as our members and we are excited to add Okta to the partnership as we move — together — towards providing good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally.

 A Deep Dive into Five&nbsp;Laws <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/44595d5b-5150-4b26-9c39-be4361d73c7a">Photo</a> by: Mike Licht. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>In March 2021 Russia used the latest in a series of newly passed Internet laws for the <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news73464.htm">first time</a>. The ‘sovereign’ 2019 law was used to throttle Twitter’s speed by 50% on desktops and by 100% on mobile phones. This move was triggered by Twitter’s <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/10/russia-slows-twitter-over-failure-to-remove-content-they-say-is-illegal">non-action</a> in deleting content considered illegal by the Roskomnadzor (RKN), Russia’s federal authority overseeing online and media content. This illegal content included the Twitter accounts of several government critics, such as Mihkail Khodorkovsky. This government action was legitimized through the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50259597">Sovereign Internet law of 2019</a>, which empowers the RKN to respond through appropriate measures to “security threats to the Internet’s functioning inside Russia” such as “changing the configuration/routes of communications/telecommunications.”</p><p>Over the past few years, the Russian Parliament has passed <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/11/01/russias-sovereign-internet-law-comes-into-force-a68002">over fifty pieces of legislation</a> in an attempt to further control and hegemonize the Russian Internet infrastructure, both internally and externally. While the official justification for these laws is to create a more ‘reliable’ internet, in actuality, some of these laws have provided nearly unfettered freedom to the government to preemptively block and filter content and independently — without relying on Internet intermediaries, or on securing prior judicial sanctions.</p><p>This article hopes to shed light on the top five most important of these laws or combination of laws and their consequential effect in crippling Russian democracy, freedom of speech, and privacy&nbsp;rights.</p> Number 1: Laws mandating identification and de-anonymization <p>A <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/addwork/scans.nsf/ID/B6DD5C7F">2017 law</a> and the following <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201811060001?index=2&amp;rangeSize=1?index=2&amp;rangeSize=1">government regulation in 2018</a>, have effectively eliminated any means for Russian citizens to raise their concerns with the government anonymously without the fear of facing backlash. The law has mandated that every user of an online application which can be used for “receiving, transferring, delivering or processing users’ electronic messages on the internet” has to link their account with a registered mobile number so that they can be identified and tracked if need be. Non-compliance by platforms leads to an imposition of a fine amounting to USD 82 for individuals, USD 800 for officials, and USD 16,500 for companies. Per the law, non-compliance may also lead to the blocking of the platform in Russian territory. It is a small respite that at the moment, these laws are only applicable to online messaging platforms, relieving other OSPs from the compulsory linking of accounts for the time&nbsp;being.</p><p>Further, the 2018 regulation, which is yet to be implemented, requires such online messaging applications have to partner with mobile operators to ensure that the latter are willing to confirm the identity of any of its users within twenty minutes of such information being sought. As with most other laws discussed in this article, the penalty for non-compliance is the blocking of the online&nbsp;service.</p><p>This law hits at the heart of an important way in which online communication can foster open dialogue — the ability to stay anonymous, especially when showing dissent. It would also have a major impact on citizens’ ability to express their <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_148270/3d0cac60971a511280cbba229d9b6329c07731f7/">religion</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/09/russia-escalating-persecution-jehovahs-witnesses">faith</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/russian-constitution-change-ends-hopes-gay-marriage-n1233639">sexuality</a>, which have long been penalized by the Russian government.</p> Number 2: The double-edged sword of content moderation laws <p>In 2013, the <a href="https://wilmap.law.stanford.edu/entries/federal-law-no-398-fz-amending-federal-law-information-information-technologies-and">Logovoy Law</a> was passed, which empowered government officials to block content ‘calling for unsanctioned public events that disturb public order’ within 24 hours and without a court order. In 2019, another <a href="https://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/1058572-7">draft law</a>, yet to be passed, would give Russian authorities the ability to block websites that censor Russian state media content. Ironically, the reason that the bill provides for this is that such websites violate Russian citizens’ right to access information.</p><p>In 2019, <a href="https://wilmap.law.stanford.edu/entries/federal-law-no-31-fz-amending-article-153-federal-law-information-information-technologies">four sets of laws</a> were passed that have had the cumulative effect of prohibiting the dissemination of “fake news” and news that is deemed “disrespectful” to the state and government officials. The RKN has the authority to delete such information with immediate effect. The stipulated fine for non-removal amounts to USD 6,400 for individuals and up to USD 24,000 for companies. Repeat offenders “disrespecting” the state could also be imprisoned for up to fifteen days. As a brief aside, the term “disrespectful” being used as a measure for potential jail time brings to mind a 2014 <a href="https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/">judgment</a> of the Indian Supreme Court that held the word “annoyance”, in the same context and for similar penalties, as vague and overbroad.</p><p>In 2020, the <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_372647/">Federal law N482-FZ</a> was passed, which was a sophisticated version of the 2019 draft law discussed above. It essentially penalized OSPs such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter for censoring Russian state media content. For context, there has been substantial research to show that Russian state media spreads disinformation among its citizens and globally. For instance, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/70/5/623/5912109">this</a> paper highlights how RT (formerly, Russia Today) is an “opportunistic channel that is used as an instrument of state defense policy to meddle in the politics of other states”. However, if any of the tech giants censor content like RT’s, they can now be fined or potentially blocked.</p><p>Finally, in January 2021, the Russian parliament has started <a href="https://ria.ru/20210125/blokirovka-1594461448.html">working on a draft law</a> to fine social media for “illegally blocking users”. This move seems to be a consequence of the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">ban</a> on USA former President Donald Trump’s Twitter&nbsp;account.</p> Number 3: Surveillance through laws on forced Data Retention and Data Localisation <p>The 2016 “Yarovaya amendments”, which have been named after their primary author and member of the State Duma (Russian Parliament’s legislative wing), Irina Yarovaya, provides for compulsory retention of all communications for six months. This includes text messages, voice messages, images, and videos. In addition, it also provides that the metadata that marks the location, timestamp, sender, and receiver of the messages, be retained for three years. The amendments also mandate that this data be stored on Russian territory and that the government be given unfettered access to this data without any prior judicial sanction. Since 2016, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook have been penalized for non-compliance. While Twitter and Facebook were <a href="https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/02/13/russian-court-fines-twitter-62-840-dollars-for-refusing-to-localize-user-data">fined</a> approximately USD 50,000 each, the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/17/russia-blocks-access-to-linkedin-over-foreign-held-data">blocked</a> LinkedIn from the Russian territory entirely. Further, in 2019, the fines for non-compliance with data storage requirements have been <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/09/02/fsb-prikaz432-site-dok.html">increased to USD&nbsp;78,000</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the amendments <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/09/02/fsb-prikaz432-site-dok.html">make way</a> for ‘back door’ access to all such data by requiring companies to provide the government with ‘any information necessary’ to decode electronic messages. This drastically weakens the security of such information and weakens encryption measures.</p><p>The Yarovaya amendments requirement to provide a direct and unrestricted back door to access data, coupled with the compulsion to not only localize data but also to retain it for long periods of time effectively means that every conversation/post/discussion can potentially be served on a platter to the Russian government. This is a sticky situation for all involved, but especially for human rights activists, political rights activists, and journalists, such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/30/kremlin-may-be-slowly-killing-alexei-navalny-prison-world-must-not-let-it-happen/">Alexei Navalny</a>, who will be acutely aware that their conversations and metadata, oftentimes confidential, are exposed to the domestic intelligence agencies. This hampers their ability to work and engage in very important and democratic dialogue&nbsp;freely.</p><p>The full implications of such a law were on display in April last year, when the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/13/telegram-loses-free-expression-battle-russian-authorities">RKN blocked Telegram</a>, a messaging app with over 10 million Russian users, for refusing to provide encryption keys to the government. RKN also ordered the <a href="https://usher2.club/en/">blocking of over 18 million IP addresses</a>, used by Telegram to operate in Russia. This led to chaos and affected many legitimate online services including maps, airline booking, and online shopping, among&nbsp;others.</p> Number 4: Laws Banning IP addresses and regulating VPNs and&nbsp;Proxys <p>The various pieces of legislation discussed in this article have been further bolstered by a <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2018/06/05/gosduma-vvela-shtrafy-za-narushenie-zakona-ob-anonimayzerah">2017 law</a> that imposes fines on Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for allowing users access to content banned by Russian authorities or for providing guidance to access such content. In a<a href="https://rg.ru/2017/07/30/fz276-site-dok.html"> bill introduced in 2018</a>, a fine of USD 9,000 was stipulated for non-compliance. This 2018 bill was a result of the above-mentioned ‘Telegram blocking’ incident, after which many <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/39035/">Russians turned to VPNs</a> to be able to continue&nbsp;business</p><p>Further, a <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2019/03/28/roskomnadzor-vpervye-potreboval-ot-vpn-servisov-podklyuchitsya-k-reestru-zapreschennyh-saytov">2019 regulation</a> now requires that VPNs and search engine platforms stay updated with a list of blocked websites maintained by the federal government and on the basis of this list, block access to those websites on their platform.</p> Number 5: Law creating an independent Russian Internet Infrastructure <p>The crown for the most restrictive law proposed by the Russian parliament arguably goes to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50259597">Sovereign Internet Law of 2019</a>. It seems that the Russian government fully understands and fears the extent to which online foreign threats are able to impact domestic outcomes (wonder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/russian-election-hacking">why</a>!). Under the garb of ensuring cybersecurity and preventing the Russian territory from such threats, the Sovereign Internet Law has the effect of putting the entire Russian internet infrastructure in a bubble of sorts. The law legitimizes the ‘<a href="https://medium.com/enrique-dans/understanding-the-splinternet-can-the-world-ever-be-truly-global-97262a60678c">splinternet</a>’ within Russian territory — it provides that at any time that the Russian government sees the need to cut off Russia from the rest of the world, it can take control of this bubble and isolate it from the rest of the world wide web and the global Internet infrastructure.</p><p>While on paper, such a national Internet infrastructure is a reasonable backup plan for “emergencies” to combat any foreign threats, it is left entirely up to the officials to decide what would qualify as such a threat. Hence, the effect of this law will be a complete transfer of control to the Russian government over all aspects of the internet, both content and infrastructure, including, of course, the power to trigger internet shutdowns and removing any content that is deemed undesirable, without any prior judicial authorization.</p><p>This is the first global attempt of its kind. Even China has a firewall that filters parts of the Internet but does not create a separate infrastructure of a ‘national’ Internet. Moreover, China’s introduction to the Internet from the very beginning had been controlled, unlike Russia, which has freely provided Internet access to its citizens over the past few decades. This is an additional reason why the ‘internet bubble’ that the Russian government seeks to create may be a problematic endeavor.</p><p>Even though the law imposes compulsory installation of certain technical equipment and procedures for all OSPs, including deep packet inspections, to enable the “Russian Bubble” infrastructure, technologists also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775366588/russian-law-takes-effect-that-gives-government-sweeping-power-over-internet">argue that this may be technically impossible</a>, somewhat like a situation where one expects the first floor of a building to be filled up with water without the ground floor receiving any water influx at&nbsp;all.</p> Taking stock of this cautionary tale <p>Russia has some of the most disproportionate laws for Internet regulation in the world and maybe that helps explain why it continues to remain ‘<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores">not free</a>’ as per Freedom House’s World Freedom Index 2021. In the same vein, in June 2020, the European Court of Human Rights <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B">found</a> in four separate cases brought against Russia by local media outlets and OSPs that blocking entire websites violates the owners’ right to impart information and the public’s right to receive it. Despite this, Russia has, yet again, threatened to ban Twitter in March&nbsp;2021.</p><p>For Russian citizens, Russia’s web of Internet laws is broken and continues to be one of the most disproportionately restrictive in the world. Moving forward, it is imperative that laws restricting a citizens’ right to freedom of speech and/or their right to privacy be weighed against the important and age-old principles carved under human rights instruments such as the <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights </a>and the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>. It is not hard to guess what would become of the five-set of laws discussed above if this measure was truly upheld in each of them — they would, without a doubt, either cease to exist or become a lot less restrictive.</p><p>Finally, a fact and a thought — Of the three national broadcasting channels in Russia, the government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17840134">holds over 51% share</a> in one and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17840134">directly runs </a>the parent companies of the other two. It has also recently introduced <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_169740/3d0cac60971a511280cbba229d9b6329c07731f7/#dst100009">a law</a> reducing the permissible percentage of foreign ownership in print media from 50% to 20%. This makes the state’s objective very clear — complete control over public narrative along with unfettered surveillance abilities.</p><p>It is worth thinking if this could be a cautionary tale that is potentially paving a misguided path for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21273191/trump-twitter-social-media-censorship-executive-order-analysis-bias">other countries</a> and for other world leaders, whose objective is abject control over the narrative in their country, both online and&nbsp;offline.</p><p>_____________________________</p><p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

 Until AI has completely eliminated human biases, can its results be considered any more trustworthy than a&nbsp;human’s? <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59202267@N08/39225139155">Photo</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59202267@N08">Electronic_Frontier_Foundation</a>: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>Facial recognition technology is becoming more powerful and more ubiquitous seemingly every day. In January 2021, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79310-1">study</a> found that a facial recognition algorithm could be better at deducing a person’s political orientation than a human judgment or a personality test. Similarly, earlier this week, the Dubai airport rolled out technology through which an <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/middle-east/the-future-is-coming-at-dubai-airport-passengers-identity-confirmed-by-iris-scans-20210308-p578mx.html">iris-scanner would verify one’s identity</a> and eliminate the need for any human interaction when entering or exiting the&nbsp;country.</p><p>The use of facial recognition by law enforcement agencies has become common practice, despite increasing reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html">false arrests</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html">jail time</a>. While there are various downsides to facial recognition technology being used at all, including fears of mass surveillance and invasion of privacy, there are flaws within facial recognition technologies themselves that lead to inaccurate results. One such major challenge for this still-burgeoning technology is gender-based inaccuracies.</p><p>Research has indicated that women are 18% more likely to be misidentified through facial recognition than men. One line of <a href="https://medium.com/@Joy.Buolamwini/response-racial-and-gender-bias-in-amazon-rekognition-commercial-ai-system-for-analyzing-faces-a289222eeced">research found that</a> while Amazon’s Rekognition software’s ability to recognize white women’s faces was down to 92.9%, a darker-skinned woman’s recognition would only be 68.9% accurate. Similarly, a study conducted at the University of Washington revealed that a facial recognition tool was <a href="http://markyatskar.com//publications/bias.pdf">68% more likely to predict that an image of a person cooking in the kitchen is that of a woman</a>. These are clear patterns exhibiting sexism in AI and the use of such technologies for law enforcement is likely to disproportionately affect marginalized groups of people, including genders other than male and&nbsp;female.</p><p>It is true that once a leap in technology has been made, hoping to be able to wipe it off the face of the earth may be a little like trying to put a genie back in a bottle. A more probable step in the right direction could be to first, feed representative and better data sets to AIs, and second, deploy the technology only with substantial democratic oversight.</p><p>Data scientists at the MIT Media Lab have <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212">noted</a> that in the instances where they have trained AI with more diverse data, the accuracy of the results has been less discriminatory and accurate. Hence, presenting AI with a diverse representation of datasets for it to learn from would be a great start in reversing the prevalent biases. Additionally, these technologies would also benefit if the providers of the facial recognition software are transparent about its underlying workings.</p><p>This transparency, if accompanied with democratic oversight regarding the application, could potentially aim at striking a better balance as to when, where, how and to what end facial recognition may be used. For example, such oversight could be in the form of regulations that set an industry standard that an AI must meet before its commercial application. However, regardless of how many leaps facial recognition takes in the coming years, a serious, deliberate discussion is necessary for determining whether facial recognition should be used by law enforcement at all. This is because the consequences of error are so grave. The European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/artificial-intelligence">will release </a>its first legislative proposal later this year and it will be interesting to see how the proposal will attempt to regulate AI application.</p><p>Former UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye’s <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/un-special-rapporteur-report-artificial-intelligence-impact-human-rights/">warning</a> that AI will enforce bias is more pertinent now than ever before. However, until the day that AI has completely eliminated human biases, can its results be considered any more trustworthy than a&nbsp;human’s?</p><p>About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

 Killer Whale Jello Bowl Death Match Redux: The Reckoning 
<p>At #IIW32, a mammoth and consequential conversation spanned 4 intense, jam-packed sessions and set new highs for IIW session-name silliness culminating in a massive interoperability watershed and widespread buy-in from many communities! The details of what gets built are being worked out in a <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">new work item</a> of the Claims &amp; Credentials WG, building on the recent donation to DIF of the Bloom WACI extension to Presentation Exchange. The goal is both a minimum viable implementable spec for cross-stack credential exchange ("v0.1 scope"), and a longer-term commitment to a more fully-featured iteration of the same spec ("v1 scope").

 Discussion around changing JSON-LD contexts, caching, versioning, hashlinks 
 UR could implement a "fixing layer" for a transitional period, and simultaneously try to motivate implementers to fix their drivers. 
 
 
 Universal Resolver policy questions about <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/issues/186">driver submission and maintenance</a>
 
 UR currently supports several DID methods that are not in the DID spec registries. 
 Probably DIF should have stricter policies going forward (e.g. only accept drivers for DID methods in the W3C method registry) 
 group will generate a proposal

<p>Commercio.network is a Blockchain, open to 250 million companies , which helps to create electronic identities with the Self sovereign Identity paradigm and exchange data and documents using this Electronic Identity.&nbsp; In the long run, the network will be composed only of “trusted” companies and this can help to form the basis for creating a system of trust between companies, such as to allow the development of new applications never thought before.</p>
<p>Commercio.network has been designed to allow companies to:</p>
 
 Exchange data and documents through a system that certifies both the identity (DID) of the parties involved and the transaction (SHAREDOC) 
 Guarantee the integrity of the document and therefore its immutability thanks to the fingerprint that each document possesses (HASH) 
 Create a secure, non-traceable connection between two companies. (PAIRWISE)<br>
Sign documents via Blockchain to certify the origin. (SIGN) 
 Time stamp the transaction of documents on the Blockchain for possible future verification by a third party. (SHAREDOC) 
 
<p>The use cases that these functions enable are countless, here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Digital Identity Management</p>
<p>Use digital identity services to meet regulatory requirements, prevent fraud and improve the overall customer experience</p>
<p>Loyalty card management</p>
<p>Enable customers to earn and redeem loyalty points both internal and external to the organization’s Loyalty ecosystem</p>
<p>Employee Documentation</p>
<p>Bypass delays associated with employee document transfers</p>
<p>Reporting and Regulatory Compliance</p>
<p>Store financial information to eliminate errors associated with manual review activities, reduce reporting costs, and support broader regulatory activities</p>
<p>Trade Finance Management</p>
<p>Simplify and shorten the trade finance process, drive efficiency gains and open up new financing product opportunities</p>
<p>Insurance Underwriting Management</p>
<p>Verify identities, ensure applications are complete, assess risk, and complete quotation and binding</p>
<p>Customer Onboarding</p>
<p>Improve the customer Onboarding experience by leveraging digital identities on Blockchain</p>
<p>Transaction Clearing</p>
<p>Decentralized settlement of transactions through a multi-signature escrow entity enabling faster settlement</p>

	 60% of School Apps are Sending Student Data to Potentially High-risk Third Parties Without Knowledge or Consent According to New Research from Me2B Alliance 
 <br>
Research uncovers disturbing findings around privacy concerns with the use of school applications 
<p>What you need to know:</p>
 
 60% of school apps were sending student data to a variety of third parties, including advertising platforms like Google and Facebook 
 On average,&nbsp;there were more than 10 third-party data channels per app 
 Public-school apps are more likely to send student data to&nbsp;third parties than&nbsp;private-school apps (67% public vs. 57% of&nbsp;private&nbsp;school apps) 
 18% of public-school apps included very high-risk&nbsp;third parties&nbsp;–&nbsp;i.e.,&nbsp;third parties&nbsp;that further share data with possibly hundreds or thousands of networked entities 
 Android apps are much more likely than iOS apps to be sending data to&nbsp;third parties, and&nbsp;are much more likely to be sending to&nbsp;high&nbsp;or&nbsp;very&nbsp;high-risk&nbsp;third parties 
 
<p><a href="https://me2ba.org/">Me2B Alliance</a>, a non-profit industry group focused on respectful technology, today published a research report to drive awareness to the data sharing practices of education apps associated with schools and school districts. According to the research findings, 60% of school apps were sending student data to a variety of third parties, including advertising platforms like Google and Facebook.</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance Product Testing team audited a random sample of 73 apps from 38 schools in 14 states across the U.S., covering over half a million people (students, their families, educators, etc.). The audit methodology mainly consisted of examining data flow from the apps to external third-party vendors. The report, “<a href="https://me2ba.org/school-mobile-apps-student-data-sharing-behavior/">School Mobile Apps Student Data Sharing Behavior</a>,” is available for download at no charge.</p>
<p>Most mobile apps are built with software development kits (SDKs), which provide developers with pre-packaged functional modules of code and the potential of creating persistent data channels directly back to the third-party developer of the SDK. As part of the analysis, the magnitude of third-party data sharing in educational apps, as evidenced by the number of SDKs included in apps, was examined.</p>
<p>Key takeaways from the report:</p>
 
 There is an unacceptable amount of student data shared with third parties – particularly advertisers and analytics platforms – in school apps. 
 School apps – whether iOS or Android, public or private schools – should not include third-party data channels. 
 iOS apps were found to be safer than Android apps, and with ongoing improvements, the “privacy gap” will widen unless Google makes some changes. 
 People still have too little information about which third parties they’re sharing data with, and the app stores (Apple and Google Play) must make this information more clear. 
 
<p>“The findings from our research show the pervasiveness of data sharing with high-risk entities and the amount of people whose data could be compromised due to schools’ lack of resources,” said Lisa LeVasseur, executive director of Me2B Alliance. “The study aims to bring these concerns to light to ensure the right funding support and protections are in place to safeguard our most vulnerable citizens – our children.”</p>

<p>About the Me2B Alliance<br>
The Me2B Alliance is a nonprofit fostering the respectful treatment of people by technology.&nbsp; We’re a new type of standards development organization – defining the standard for respectful technology. Scenarios like the ones described in this report – where user data is being abused, even inadvertently – highlight the types of issues we are driven to prevent through independent testing, as well as education, research, policy work, and advocacy.</p>

<p>Friday, May 7.</p>
<p>It was 7:30 Tuesday morning when the Me2B Alliance published its new Spotlight Report on School Mobile Apps Data Sharing Behavior. By lunchtime the nonprofit’s research was reported on the national news. The Washington Post, Gizmodo, Apple Insider, American Online News, AdExchanger, and MSN picked up the story, as did a growing list of other carriers (links below), resulting in a boost to the visibility of the Me2B Alliance’s <a>findings about the widespread and risky sharing of students’ personal information by school’s utility apps</a>.</p>

<p>Token and Cryptocurrency Exchanges</p>
<p>There are two types of token exchanges : centralized CEX exchanges and decentralized DEX exchanges.</p>
<p>Centralized Exchange (CEX) works like a classic brokerage exchange: you deposit funds into an account and the exchange does the buying and selling for you. The advantage is that the Exchange does all the work, and is often insured and regulated by the authorities. Most Exchanges, such as COINBASE and BINANCE, are centralized. One advantage to these Exchanges is that they accept credit or debit card payments and bank transfers. They can also pay in fiat currencies, such as dollars or euros, which many users prefer.</p>
<p>Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a marketplace for Cryptocurrencies and Tokens that is open to everyone. No one is in control of a DEX; people buy and sell on an individual basis through Peer-to-Peer trading applications. One way to think of a DEX is as a “do-it-yourself” trading solution: you make the trades, the funds move out of your account. The biggest advantage of this system is that your funds never have to be entrusted to a trading firm or other third party and will always remain in the wallet of the person making the transaction. These exchanges operate exclusively with digital currency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Advantages of a DEX over a CEX&nbsp;</p>
 
 A DEX can be more resistant to hacking than a CEX because account information is not shared with the exchange operator: funds may be held in your account and you will be the only person with access. 
 &nbsp;Theoretically, governments or regulators cannot shut down a DEX because it is decentralized, operating across a wide variety of nodes. 
 A DEX operates across the cloud through a variety of nodes and there is no single server that can be blocked or hacked. 
 There is a higher degree of privacy on a DEX because you are not sharing data with the operator. 
 On a DEX you maintain control of your funds in your personal account. 
 A DEX can be faster because you do the transactions yourself. 
 
<p>Disadvantages of a DEX over a CEX&nbsp;</p>
 
 Funds are not regulated or insured. Regulated exchanges may be required to return your money at any time, so keep your funds in escrow for quick withdrawals. 
 &nbsp;Most DEXs do not accept credit card, debit card or wire transfer payments 
 Trading volume is limited, which can keep prices low and fees high 
 Services available from DEXs are limited: Margin Trading, Stop Loss and trades involving fiat currencies are not offered. 
 There may be no customer service to contact when there is a problem 
 A DEX can be much more expensive than a CEX because you may need to buy Ethereum Gas (ETH) every time you make a transaction. 
 
<p>Commercio.network is planning to implement its own DEX solution that will allow to trade Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), through a self-managed wallet, using a protocol on Cosmos called IBC through which you can access a worldwide pool of liquidity and users interested in trading Tokens.</p>

<p>This post expands on the second key pillar for building a new economic paradigm as outlined in <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Our Call to Reimagine Capitalism</a>. Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>The current&nbsp;context</p><p>Last summer, the protests and demonstrations that erupted across the country in response to the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and too many others prompted many funders, including Omidyar Network, to think more critically about our role within a system that perpetuates racial injustice. We wanted to determine ways in which we could use our power and privilege to contribute to dismantling white supremacy (you can read more about our commitments <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/an-investment-in-justice-bad462284f27">here</a>).</p><p>While criminal justice and policing reform is not one of our focus areas at Omidyar Network, there is a close link between economic injustice and racial violence, which is why we called out the need to build an explicitly anti-racist and inclusive economy as the second pillar upholding our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">reimagined vision for capitalism.</a> It is impossible to build a more just and equitable economy without directly addressing the ways in which our existing economy was intentionally designed to uphold white supremacy by excluding people from opportunities to participate fully in markets based on their race — not to mention gender, class, nationality, disability, and other forms of human diversity.</p><p>Our conviction in the necessity of this pillar has only been compounded by the evidence of the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>In the six weeks that it has taken to write and edit this piece, there have been two mass shootings in Atlanta and Indianapolis that targeted Asian Americans. Police officers killed 20-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/daunte-wright-death-minnesota.html">Daunte Wright</a> in Minnesota, 13-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/us/adam-toledo-chicago-police-shooting.html">Adam Toledo</a> in Chicago, and 16-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/us/makhia-bryant.html">Ma’Khia Bryant</a> in Ohio. A ceaseless drumbeat of violence and trauma continue unabated, with only a glimmer of accountability in the trial and <a href="https://omidyar.com/statement-from-omidyar-network-on-derek-chauvin-verdict-the-first-step-to-justice/">conviction of Derek Chauvin</a> for the murder of George&nbsp;Floyd.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pandemic has exposed the extent to which the prejudices of the past remain embedded in the institutions and systems that we rely on today — to disastrous effect.</p><p>During the initial wave of the pandemic, many spoke of COVID as a great equalizer — a universal threat indifferent to our race, nationality, or class. Yet it quickly became clear that, although the virus itself cannot discriminate, our healthcare and economic structures certainly can and do. Every aspect of the pandemic and our healthcare response was impacted by race. The virus itself spread more quickly in communities of color, and took a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/racial-ethnic-disparities/disparities-illness.html">greater toll</a> on welfare and lives. Meanwhile, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-neighborhoods-access-covid-19-testing-sites-analysis/story?id=71884719">COVID tests</a> and <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200716.620294/full/">lifesaving PPE</a> were more readily available in white neighborhoods at the beginning of the pandemic — and many of these inequities persist.</p><p>The effects of the economic recession are similarly shaped by race. As new data from our recent <a href="https://www.gallup.com/education/267590/great-jobs-report.aspx">Great Jobs survey with Gallup confirms</a>, Black, Latinx, and Asian-American and Pacific Islander workers are <a href="https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-Frontline-Workers.pdf">over-represented in essential, frontline industries</a> such as health care, transportation, and retail, causing them to face greater risk of COVID exposure. Even as our economy has inched toward recovery, Black and Latinx workers, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/black-and-hispanic-women-arent-sharing-in-the-job-market-recovery.html">and especially women</a>, are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-unemployment-race/gap-in-u-s-black-and-white-unemployment-rates-is-widest-in-five-years-idUSKBN2431X7">regaining their jobs much more slowly than their white counterparts</a>. Meanwhile, women, <a href="https://nwlc.org/resources/all-of-the-jobs-lost-in-december-were-womens-jobs/">and especially women of color</a>, were both more likely to lose their job or find it necessary to dedicate their time exclusively to unpaid care work, <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/covid-19-widens-gender-gap-labor-force-participation">erasing decades of gains in women’s labor force participation</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/10/30/492582/covid-19-sent-womens-workforce-progress-backward/">wages</a>.</p><p>These inequalities were not inevitable. Rather, this uneven toll stands as a physical manifestation of our history, etched into our society with every job, home, and life lost. An enduring lesson from this pandemic must be that, even when we face a threat like a virus that cannot intentionally discriminate between us, the institutional and cultural legacies that we have inherited from past efforts to purposefully divide us will ensure that our experiences are unequal and&nbsp;unjust.</p><p>A long legacy of exclusion</p><p>This persistence of social disparities should surprise no one, since intentional exclusion has long been the norm in the United States. For centuries, the power to shape our laws, government, markets, culture, and biases has been restricted by race, gender, and class. Varied forms of exclusion — from slavery and disenfranchisement to imprisonment, institutionalization, and deportation — have been justified by those in power (predominantly white men) in order to concentrate the benefits of American prosperity into their own hands. Acts — and threats — of physical violence against people of color have played a central role in upholding this dynamic, echoes of which we have seen play out in the violent snapshots of police brutality across the country&nbsp;today.</p><p>America’s history of racial exclusion has been integral to shaping our economy, denying people of color the opportunity to profit and accumulate wealth from their own contributions to our economy. The earliest form of American capitalism was one that enriched white Americans who stole land from Native Americans and labor from enslaved Black people. Later iterations of our economy not only permitted racial discrimination, but also exempted employers in sectors with a majority Black or Latinx labor force (namely agriculture, hospitality, and domestic services) from legal requirements to provide a minimum wage, workplace protections, and benefits. Meanwhile, developers, city planners, and the real estate industry redlined Black families into homes and communities with limited job opportunities, few financial service providers, and failing infrastructure. All of these systems were created with the intent of perpetuating white economic supremacy, and, in many cases, remain the foundation of the economy we experience today.</p><p>These patterns of economic marginalization and exploitation are crucial to maintaining power imbalances. Robbing people of the ability to accumulate wealth is tantamount to robbing them of the ability to accumulate power. After all, people without savings find it more difficult to change jobs, to choose where or with whom to live, or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/01/08/the-politics-of-financial-insecurity-a-democratic-tilt-undercut-by-low-participation/">to contribute time and money to politics.</a> And those robbed of their wealth have less to pass on to their children, thereby perpetuating this theft of opportunity across generations.</p><p>In recent decades, efforts to intentionally exclude people of color, and especially Black Americans, from participating in the markets and accumulating wealth and power may have been less overt, but not less effective. For the past fifty years, we have relied on markets to solve our social problems, even though markets are mechanisms in which people with existing wealth and assets use investments to gain even more wealth and assets. Superimposed over an unequal society, free markets can only exacerbate those inequalities. Meanwhile, many of those in power have worked to weaken the very institutions — government, labor unions, our social safety net — that could mitigate these market imbalances.</p><p>Supporting organizations working to build an anti-racist economy</p><p>Omidyar Network is committed to building an economy that is explicitly anti-racist and inclusive. An economy which simultaneously rejects the justifications for racism and consciously works to remove the structures of our society that perpetuate racial injustice. We are working toward a society where everyone has the power and ability to live the life of their choosing — free to choose their job, choose where they will live, choose how to invest their time and resources, and choose who represents them in government.</p><p>A first step toward achieving this vision is to correct the power imbalances that prevent people of color from have a voice in how the economy impacts them. That’s why we support <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/">Action Center on Race and the Economy (ACRE)</a>, an organization that provides support to groups on the ground campaigning for structural change of, and increased accountability from, the financial sector. ACRE helps grassroots organizations identify the ways in which the financial sector contributes to such challenges as <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/issues/health-care/">healthcare</a>, housing, the <a href="https://fuelingthefire.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PWF_fossilfuelreport_WEB.pdf">environment</a>, and <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/issues/policing-and-incarceration/">policing and incarceration</a>. During the pandemic, ACRE was part of a coalition that supported the <a href="https://westriketogether.org/">We Strike Together campaign</a>, using rent and mortgage strikes to secure relief for renters during the&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://communitychange.org/">Community Change</a>, represents networks of local organizations building power with people of color so they have a say in policies that impact their lives. Its <a href="https://communitychange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CC_Path-to-Power-2019-doc.pdf">strategy</a> includes efforts to strengthen organizing infrastructure in communities of color, and to increase their influence and develop new models of sustainable, volunteer-led community organizations.</p><p>A second task is to address the ways that existing economic rules perpetuate exclusion, either by changing policies or finding innovative ways to work around an unjust system. One of our partners, <a href="https://www.domesticworkers.org/">National Domestic Workers Alliance</a>(NDWA), advocates on behalf of the 2.5 million nannies, house cleaners, and care workers across the country, most of whom are women, especially Black, Latinx, Native, and Asian American Pacific Island women. During the pandemic, NDWA <a href="https://domesticworkers.org/coronavirus-care-fund">distributed $400 in emergency support</a> to more than 40,000 domestic workers who had lost their jobs during the lockdowns, and helped successfully advocate for the American Jobs Plan to include a $400 billion dollar investment in care&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>Finally, we must weed out and uproot all remaining vestiges of the ideas used to justify exclusion and division, and help new ideas take root. That’s why we support the work of academics, researchers, and other movement and thought leaders who study the stratifications of our economy and propose pathways forward. Most notably, we have worked closely with Professor <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/milano/faculty/darrick-hamilton/">Darrick Hamilton</a> of The New School, a leading economist whose work explores the ways that existing systems perpetuate racial inequality and offers proposals — such as baby bonds or a federal job guarantee — to make the future economy more equitable. We also support the work of <a href="https://www.demos.org/">Demos</a>, a think tank for race-forward progressive policy ideas and an advocacy network that aims to increase the power that communities of color have over economic decisions. It has, for example, designed a platform of policies for <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/economic-justice/climate-equity">equitably addressing the climate crisis</a> and expanding the availability of <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/economic-justice/debt-free-college">debt-free college</a>. Demos is also releasing a number of <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/covid-19-racial-justice">policy proposals to ensure that our pandemic recovery brings us closer to a more democratic and inclusive economy</a>. We believe it is imperative that these ideas are not cordoned off in think tanks or academic institutions, but rather shaped in partnership with those communities that are most impacted — building a ladder from the grassroots all the way up the ivory&nbsp;tower.</p><p>Far from being a time of solidarity and common endurance, this past year exposed a whole host of enduring racial injustices. Our institutions, built on foundations of intentional exclusion, deepened and perpetuated divisions built on old biases and hatreds, that have been nourished for centuries. However, even as the country witnessed the devastation of the pandemic — layered over the continued translation of hate into outright violence against people of color — many responded by joining the movement for racial&nbsp;justice.</p><p>The incredible work of our Reimagining Capitalism grantees is setting a course to build power with communities of color, rewrite the rules that have privileged white and wealthy people for so long, and reshape our ideas of racial justice and&nbsp;equity.</p><p>As America rebuilds, it is the mutual responsibility of funders to be anti-racist in rectifying the consequences of centuries of systemic racism that have robbed communities of color of their wealth, power, and rights, and to ensure that the economic system that is rebuilt supports an inclusive society in which everyone can live with dignity and&nbsp;thrive.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-an-anti-racist-and-inclusive-economy-36fc79ab5cbc">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Building an Anti-Racist and Inclusive Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Part 1: Conformance Testing for Measurable Goals</p><p>[Written in consultation with the Interoperability Working Group chairs]<br></p><p>A recurring topic in the Interoperability Working Group is that of defining short-, medium- and long-term goals or “targets” for interoperability. The topic comes up again every few months, and each time it does, the chairs try to tackle it head-on for a full meeting or two, some emails, and various off-line discussions, but doing so never seems to arrive at a satisfactory or definitive answer. Each time, what feels a Herculean outlay of effort only gets us a tentative resolution, as if we’d deflected a debt collector with a minimum payment. Dear reader, we would like to refinance, or at least restructure, this debt to our community!</p><p>In this two-part overview of our goals for 2021, we would like to survey the landscape of “provable,” testable interoperability targets and give some guidance on what we would like to see happen next in the testable interop world. Then, in a companion article, we will lay out clear proposal for parallel, distributed work on multiple fronts, such that progress can be distributed across various subcommunities and hubs of open cooperation, each reasonably confident that they are helping the big picture by “zooming in” on one set of problems. &nbsp;</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christopherphigh">Christopher Paul High</a> A seemingly uncontroversial target state <p>Interoperation is a deceptively transparent etymology: any two things that perform a function are inter-operating if they can perform their operation together and mutually. Two fax machines interoperate if one sends a fax and the other receives it, which is a far more impressive feat if the two machines in question were designed and built by different companies on different continents, fifteen years apart. This is the kind of target state people usually have in mind when they imagine interoperability for an emerging technology.</p><p>This everyday example glosses over a lot of complexity and history, however. Standards bodies had already specified exact definitions of how the “handshake” is established between two unfamiliar fax machines before either model of fax machine was a twinkle in a design team’s eye. In addition to all the plodding, iterative standardization, there has also been a lot of economic trial and error and dead-ends we never heard about. &nbsp;Even acceptable margins of error and variance from the standards have been prototyped, refined, socialized, and normalized, such that generations of fax machines have taken them to heart, while entire factories have been set up to produce standard components like white-label fax chips and fax boards that can be used by many competing brands. On a software level, both design teams probably recycled some of the same libraries and low-level code, whether open-source or licensed.</p><p>Decomposing this example into its requirements at various levels shows how many interdependent and complex subsystems have to achieve internal maturity and sustainable relationships. A time-honored strategy is to treat each of these subsystems in a distinct, parallel maturation process and combine them gradually over time. The goal, after all, is not a working whole, but a working ecosystem. &nbsp;Architectural alternatives, for example, have to be debated carefully, particularly for disruptive and emerging technologies that redistribute power within business processes or ecosystems. Sharing (or better yet, responsibly open-sourcing and governing) common software libraries and low-level hardware specifications is often a “stitch in time” that saves nine later stitches, since it gives coordinators a stable baseline to work from, sooner.</p><p>Naturally, from even fifty or a hundred organizations committed to this target state, a thousand different (mostly sensible) strategies can arise. “How to proceed?” becomes a far-from-trivial question, even when all parties share many common goals and incentives. For instance, almost everyone:</p>  Wants to grow the pie of adoption and market interest  Holds privacy and decentralization as paramount commitments  Strives to avoid repeating the mistakes and assumptions of previous generations of internet technology  <p>And yet, all the same… both strategic and tactical differences arise, threatening to entrench themselves into camps or even schools of thought. How to achieve the same functional consensus on strategy as we have on principles? Our thesis here is that our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.</p> Today’s test suites and interoperability profiles <p>Perhaps the biggest differences turn out not to be about target state or principles, but about what exactly “conformance” means relative to what has already been specified and standardized. Namely, the core specifications for DIDs and VCs are both data models written in the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), which put protocols out of scope. This stems partly from the decisions of the groups convened in the W3C, and partly from a classic division of labor in the internet standards world between W3C, which traditionally governs the data models of web browser and servers, &nbsp;and a distinct group, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p><p>VCs were specified first, with a preference (but not a requirement) for DIDs, with exact parameters for DIDs and DID systems deferred to a separate data model. &nbsp;Then, to accommodate entrenched and seemingly irreconcilable ideas about how DIDs could best be expressed, the DID data model was made less representationally-explicit and turned into an abstract data model. This shift to a representation-agnostic definition of DIDs, combined with the still-tentative and somewhat representation-specific communication and signing protocols defined to date, makes truly agnostic and cross-community data model conformance somewhat difficult to test. This holds back interoperability (and objective claims to conformance)!</p> W3C: Testing the core specifications <p>The only test suite associated with the core W3C specifications is the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/tree/main/packages/vc-http-api-test-server">VC-HTTP-API test suite </a>for VC data model conformance and the fledgling <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">DID-core test suite</a>, both worked on in the W3C-CCG. The former tests implementations of VC-handling systems against some pre-established sample data and test scripts through a deliberately generalized API interface that strives to be minimally opinionated with respect to context- and implementation-specific questions like API authentication. The latter is still taking shape, given that the DID spec has been very unstable in the home stretch of its editorial process arriving at CR this last week.</p><p>The VC-HTTP-API interface, specified collectively by the first <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">SVIP</a> funding cycle cohort for use in real-world VC systems, has been used in some contexts as a de facto general-purpose architecture profile, even if it is very open-ended on many architectural details traditionally specified in government or compliance profiles. &nbsp;Its authors and editors did not intend it to be the general-purpose profile for the VC data model generally, but in the absence of comparable alternatives, it is sometimes taken as one; it has perhaps taken on more of a definitive role than originally intended. </p><p>Following the second iteration of the SVIP program and the expansion of the cohort, the API and its test suite are poised to accrue features and coverage to make it more useful outside of its original context. Core participants have established a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/">weekly public call</a> at the CCG and a lively re-scoping/documentation process is currently underway to match the documentation and rationale documents to the diversity of contexts deploying the API.</p> Aries: End-to-end conformance testing <p>Other profiles, like the Aries interoperability profile, serve an important role, but it would be misleading to call it a VC data model test suite-- it is more like an end-to-end test harness for showing successful implementation of the Aries protocols and architecture. Here “interoperability” means interoperability with other Aries systems, and conformance with the shared Aries interpretation of the standard VC data model and the protocols this community has defined on the basis of that interpretation. </p><p>Many matters specified by the W3C data model are abstracted out or addressed by shared libraries in Ursa, so its scope is not exactly coterminous with the W3C data model. Instead, the Aries interoperability profile has its own infrastructural focus, which focuses on scaling the privacy guarantees of blockchain-based ZKP systems. In many ways, this focus complements rather than supplants that of the W3C test suites. </p><p>Many of the trickiest questions on which SSI systems differ are rooted in what the Aries and Trust-over-IP communities conceptualize as “<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack">layer 2</a>,” the connective infrastructural building-blocks connecting end-users to VCs and DIDs. As more and more features get added to be testable across language implementations, and as feature-parity is achieved with other systems (such as <a href="https://youtu.be/LC0OXAir3Qw">support for LD VCs</a>), the case for productive complementarity and deep interoperability gets easier and easier to make.</p> The first wave of local profiles and guidelines <p>Other specifications for decentralized-identity APIs and wallets, modelled on that W3C CCG and/or extending the work of Aries-based infrastructures, are starting to crop up around the world. &nbsp;So far these have all arisen out of ambitious government-funded programs to build infrastructure, often with an eye to local governance or healthy competition. Canada and the European Commission are the most high-profile ones to date, building on earlier work in Spain, the UK, and elsewhere; Germany and other countries funding next-generation trust frameworks may soon follow suit. </p><p>It is important, however, to avoid framing these tentative, sometimes cautious attempts at bridging status quo and new models as universal standards. If anything, these frameworks tend to come with major caveats and maturity disclaimers, on top of having carefully narrowed scopes. &nbsp;After all, they are generally the work of experienced regulators, inheriting decades of work exploring identity and infrastructural technologies through a patchwork of requirements and local profiles that tend to align over time. If they are designed with enough circumspection and dialogue, conformance with one should never make conformance with another impossible. (The authors would here like to extend heartfelt sympathy to all DIF members currently trying to conform to multiple of these at once!) </p><p>These profiles test concrete and specific interpretations of a shared data model that provide a testing benchmark for regulatory “green lighting” of specific implementations and perhaps even whole frameworks. Particularly when they specify best practices or requirements for security and API design, they create testable standardization by making explicit their opinions and assumptions about:</p>  approved cryptography,  auditing capabilities,  privacy requirements, and  API access/authentication   <p>These will probably always differ and make a universal abstraction impossible; and that’s not a bad thing! These requirements are always going to be specific to each regulatory context, and without them, innovation (and large-scale investment) are endangered by regulatory uncertainty. Navigating these multiple profiles is going to be a challenge in the coming years, as more of them come online and their differences come into relief as a stumbling block for widely-interoperable protocols with potentially global reach. </p><p>The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details. </p>

 A progress update on implementing decentralized SLAs and the EWT Escrow&nbsp;Model <p>At the end of February our CEO Walter Kok laid out the concept of a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">decentralized SLA </a>and how it will form the basis of a new type of service-level agreement (SLA) for enterprises and vendors alike. Unlike a traditional, bilateral SLA, a DSLA approach is inherently distributed and establishes multilateral trust that the services will be delivered according to the agreement. This new type of business and technical architecture will enable very transparent reporting on the actual, real-world service&nbsp;quality.</p><p>We see the DSLA as an important aspect of the Utility Layer of the Energy Web tech stack. The Utility Layer comprises a variety of ‘digital machinery’ (i.e., services) that power the dApps running on the Energy Web Chain. That’s why we unveiled the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/the-energy-transition-is-at-stake-ec9f4ececd85">EWT Escrow Model</a>, as a way to unlock the full potential of the Energy Web tech stack to achieve the delivery of a decentralized service operation and its objectives. The EWT Escrow Model allows for both Providers (i.e., vendors providing Utility Layer services) and Patrons (e.g., community members who may stake some amount of EWT in support).</p><p>The entire process leverages <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">EW Switchboard</a> to manage DIDs and roles for Customers, Providers, and&nbsp;Patrons.</p><p>Our goal is to launch the first Utility Layer services, complete with escrow and subscriptions, in production by Q3 2021. Between then and now, we’re aiming for a several key milestones, including: a) an alpha release on our testnet, Volta (this is when Patrons will be able to test an early version of the Escrow Model); b) a beta release on the Energy Web Chain; and c) scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.</p><p>If you’ve watched our pipeline of major announcements and initiatives in recent weeks and months, you know that the Energy Web team and the broader ecosystem have been incredibly busy. But we’ve also been making progress on the EWT Escrow Model, and are excited to share this update with&nbsp;you.</p><p>SPOILER ALERT: DEAR PATRONS AND PROVIDERS, STAKING IS STILL COMING AND Q3 IS STILL A REALISTIC TARGET.</p> We finalized the architecture, designed the UI, and got the resources (almost) in&nbsp;place… <p>The picture below lays out the architecture of the decentralized service operations. It breaks down into four important blocks: 1) Customer Tasks (consuming the service, in green), 2) Provider Tasks (delivering the service, in yellow), 3) The Watchtower (monitoring and reporting on the service operations, in red), and 4) Governance Tasks (smart contracts executing the DSLAs, in&nbsp;blue).</p><p>And yes, there at the top are the Patrons, who can stake together with their service provider of choice. Let’s get into a little bit more&nbsp;detail.</p> THE SERVICE PROVIDER AND THE&nbsp;PATRON <p>Service Providers (“Providers”) are organizations that operate Utility Layer service nodes. In order to become a qualified Provider, an organization must pass a basic KYC check and deposit a minimum balance of EWT into an escrow smart contract for a multi-year period. Once qualified, Providers can launch service nodes by depositing an incremental amount of EWT in escrow and claim they are ready to deliver the service. The Watchtower will validate the claim (more on the Watchtower below). The following animation shows the User Interface we have developed so far to onboard Service Providers and&nbsp;Patrons:</p><p>To meet the minimum escrow balance requirement, Providers can either acquire the necessary EWT themselves or accept EWT from external Patrons in the wider community. As long as Providers deliver services in accordance with the prescribed rules, they will earn a stable income on their deposited EWT.</p> THE CUSTOMER <p>Customers follow an onboarding process similar to that of Providers. We want the system to be trustless, so the Providers (and Patrons) need to be assured that the Customer will pay for the service once it has been delivered. So basically, they put their pre-payments into escrow, too. Once the Customer claims that they are ready to consume services, the Watchtower will also validate this claim. The following animation shows the user interface we have developed so far to onboard customers and how they can choose the services and SLAs they want to&nbsp;consume:</p> THE WATCHTOWER AND GOVERNANCE TASKS <p>The Watchtower will be a similar decentralized architecture as the one we deploy for the validators of the Energy Web Chain. Watchtower nodes will also follow the Proof-of-Authority consensus algorithm. They are trusted entities, similar to our validators (we expect a subset of our validators to also run a Watchtower node).</p><p>Each Watchtower will validate the claim of readiness from both Provider and Customer and individually report on it. The smart contract (part of the governance tasks) will move both to the operational status when there is consensus amongst the Watchtowers. The services are now ready to be delivered and consumed and all the Watchtowers will start to monitor the actual performance. When it is their turn, they will measure and publish their results individually. Again, the consensus algorithm will ensure a decision of the actual performance for the interval, taking all scores into&nbsp;account.</p><p>We expect that these intervals will aggregate to a daily / weekly Service Level Score. Then depending on the Service Level Agreement, the payment / slashing logic will kick in. The necessary evidence will be stored on the Energy Web Chain so that at any time it can be accessed (taking into account privacy preserving requirements, etc.).</p> So what can you expect&nbsp;next.. <p>Looking ahead at the coming months, we’re forging ahead with the schedule we laid out in the original EWT Escrow Model&nbsp;article:</p>  In May 2021, we will conduct an alpha release of escrow and subscription tools on our testnet Volta. This is when our Patrons will be able to early test the staking&nbsp;feature.  In June and July 2021, we will conduct a beta release of escrow and service components on the Energy Web Chain (EWC), with an initial cohort of Service Providers from the EWC validator community.  Throughout the remainder of the year, we will focus on scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.  <p>Expect to continue to hear from Energy Web over the coming months. If you have questions or ideas, drop us a note in the comments below! To stay up to date with the latest information, follow us on Twitter or join our Telegram community.</p><p>The EWT Escrow Model is closer than ever to becoming a reality — including the 10–20% return on deposited EWT we mentioned when we first announced the Escrow Model. We are now seeing a convergence of positive developments: major projects deploying on the Energy Web tech stack in partnership with our members, a robust community around EWT, and a stronger-than-ever appetite for digital solutions that address the urgent climate challenge. We continue to act our way into new thinking&nbsp;indeed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/acting-our-way-into-new-thinking-85fb79b1970a">Acting our way into new thinking…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland—29 April 2021 — Today Energy Web announced that the <a href="https://shareandcharge.com/">Share&amp;Charge Foundation</a> has become a part of the global nonprofit. In March 2020, Share&amp;Charge <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/share-charge-foundation-launches-open-charging-network-on-energy-web-chain-84af7f6f5b3c">launched its Open Charging Network</a> (OCN) on the Energy Web Chain. Share&amp;Charge’s OCN is a decentralized e-roaming solution for seamless electric vehicle (EV) charging across different charge point networks. Today’s announcement makes the Share&amp;Charge team an extension of Energy Web’s core team, while the OCN becomes more tightly integrated with the EW tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>“In the global energy transition, EVs are one of the fastest-growing segments, with customers investing trillions in all-electric cars and trucks, while automakers, charge point operators, and utilities are investing heavily in charging infrastructure,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “EVs sit at the intersection of several major use cases for open-source digital technology like the Energy Web tech stack. Giving EVs self-sovereign identities enables them to easily and efficiently register in energy markets to provide services to grid operators. They’re a major new source of demand for renewable energy. And it will become increasingly important to track their batteries throughout their lifecycle, in alignment with regulations around the world. Bringing Share&amp;Charge into the Energy Web family better prepares us to support the coming e-mobility future.”</p><p>Share&amp;Charge will continue to operate as an independent brand, although it will now do so in closer alignment with the Energy Web team and strategy. “This is an exciting transition for Share&amp;Charge and we are happy to be joining forces with EW,” said Dietrich Sümmermann, chair of the Share&amp;Charge Foundation board. “As more and more companies join Energy Web and its global ecosystem, we stand ready to support seamless e-roaming as EVs become the dominant form of mobility in the decades&nbsp;ahead.”</p><p>Energy Web is working together with the OCN community through already-established channels — both supporting the current OCN and the development of a DID-based OCN 2.0. Stay tuned for more on this&nbsp;front.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/share-charge-becomes-a-part-of-energy-web-33fbffc5f3a4">Share&amp;Charge Becomes a Part of Energy Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Lightweight micro-grants to further the DIF mission <br></p><p>DIF is kicking off a program to administer narrowly-scoped financial support for community initiatives, ranging in format from grants to more competitive implementation bounties, hackathon-style open collaborations, and security reviews. Although the complexity and number of stakeholders involved will naturally vary, all of these bounties will all be structured around public “challenges” that directly reward efforts helpful to the community as a whole. </p><p>Each of these challenges will culminate in a library-, repository-, or narrow specification-sized donation that closes interoperability gaps, generates usable documentation, or solving other tooling and data problems that move the decentralized identity needle. These could be signature suites, libraries, toolkits, or even detailed tutorials and implementation guides. </p><p>Prompts for whitepapers or non-normative implementation guides are harder to define in testable terms, but still welcome; one way of defining them is by listing a significant, finite set of input documents (such as specifications and regulatory profiles) and defining success as simple, useful documentation incorporates all their prescriptions and limitations.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jchatelain">Julien Chatelain</a><p>To make the awarding of these grants as objective and non-controversial as possible, we will be administering them in the form of technically-specified “challenges” that break down into specific, testable criteria. Submissions will be defined as donations to DIF that meet some or all of the criteria of a given challenge; the Technical Steering Committee will administer the adjudication of testing submissions against challenges.</p><p>Grant money can be offered directly from DIF’s budget by decision of the DIF’s governing board (the Steering Committee) and/or offered by a member company and approved by the SC. The donator of the grant funds can choose a specific WG or combination of WGs to specify and fine-tune the challenge. These WGs work with the Technical Steering Committee to ratify successful completion and authorize release of funds once a conforming donation has been received.</p> FAQ for DIF Grants:  Who can offer a Grant?<br>
Any DIF member and/or the DIF Steering Committee can offer a grant (or matching funds) as long as the scope of the challenge benefits the entire DIF community. DIF SC will review grant requests before the challenge is prepared and published. 
Who writes the challenge?<br>
Grants challenges are written by the chairs and/or the members of the WG chosen by the donors to administer the grant. The WG is responsible for writing a challenge acceptable to the SC and the grantor. WG chairs should submit the challenge at least one week before the deadline for Grantor approval (aka “go/no go decision”), to allow for fine-tuning or negotiation of terms.
What makes a good challenge?<br>
A good challenge is testable to make the decision about its success objective rather than subjective, and it should include its own testable definition of success and, where appropriate, usable test fixtures.<br><br>
<p>A good challenge also serves the broader community equally (for instance, not just JWT-, LD-, or Aries-based systems). A challenge should not favor any given commercial product (or infrastructure such as specific blockchains) substantially over others, and care should be taken to think through what the “equivalences” or counterparties are if a challenge comes from a specific community, credential format, etc.</p>
 Who can submit and who reviews it?<br>
Participation is open for the broad community (no prior DIF membership is required), but submissions will only be considered upon donation to the challenge-owning DIF WG. The donation should be “clean IP,” i.e. comprised entirely of IP generated by the donator(s), and the challenge owner may also impose some limitations on external dependencies. 
Is there a minimum and maximum donation size that DIF will administer as a grant?<br>
For now, DIF has decided not to use this structure for grants under 1000U$. DIF cannot manage grants of over 50,000K U$ at this time.
How is/are winner(s) selected?<br>
Each challenge can specify the relationship between testable criteria and winner(s).  The template for challenge authors specifies a few common patterns, i.e., pre-approved grantee(s), bounty-style competition, and sponsored lead/editor for an open work item.<br><br>
Payment is handled through a contract signed with JDF. 
 Checklist for defining a good challenge:  
 Define the solution to the challenge as simply as possible, ideally in one noun phrase, i.e.
 
 “A lossless, general-purpose translator between DID Document representations”, 
 “A sample implementation that reimplements DIDComm access via Bluetooth in a second major language,” or 
 “A specification for how EDVs could be accessed over NFT written by someone with broad NFT and security experience” 
 
 
 Consider redundancy of effort - Do people apply with an idea and get approved to execute (i.e., “grant”), working in reasonable confidence of post-success payment if they meet the deadline? Or do they compete with unknown number of other teams, only applying to get paid after completion? It is recommended that challenge owners decide early between these three modes of operation:
 
 “mini-grant” mode: applicants get pre-approved before beginning work and work privately until donating 
 “Work item” mode: applicants get pre-approved to lead a public work item at DIF, which may accept volunteer contributions from other DIF members. Work should be donated even if the challenge is not completed or is completed sooner by another party. 
 “Open participation” mode, aka implementation bounty: anyone can work privately and successful donation(s) get(s) the award. 
 
 
 A good challenge should not be met merely by addressing known bugs, repackaging prior art, superficial/minor bugs, etc. 
 Where in the interoperability WG’s map of implementer decisions does the challenge “live” and which sections does it directly affect? Answering this question may help argue for direct or indirect benefits to the whole community. 
 How familiar are the authors of the challenge with that specific problem space, in and outside of decentralized identity? Have experts been consulted from outside the WG, or better yet, outside of the decentralized identity community?
 
 How evenly distributed would the benefits be? Please consider (and write out) how various subcommunities (i.e., Aries-based solutions, JWT-/JSON-based solutions, and LD-based solutions) would benefit from this solution. If the benefits would be unevenly distributed, consider adding an additional challenge criterion (perhaps even awardable separately) for extending extra benefits to the least-served community, such as an implementation guide, @Context file, vocabulary to aid translation, etc. 
 
 
 Define criteria for success, ideally testable ones to minimize the subjective judgments to be made by the TSC.
 
 If possible, include dummy data and other test vectors. 
 Securing formal review by an outsider with specified qualities or experience can be written in as a success criteria or payment trigger. 
 Vaguely-worded requirements of “originality” are hard to assess, but negative requirements like “MUST/SHOULD not re-implement existing solutions linked from the reference section of this spec” can help make sure requirements clear to all involved.

  <p>In 2020, GLEIF launched a transformative new role into the Global LEI System: the Validation Agent. </p>
<p>Having listened to the challenges that financial institutions (FIs) were facing when it came to onboarding new clients, we introduced this new operational model to help FIs overcome delays and save time by removing duplicative processes across onboarding and LEI issuance. </p>
<p>The Validation Agent Framework empowers FIs to leverage their know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulated business as usual onboarding processes, to obtain an LEI for their customers when verifying a client’s identity during initial onboarding or during a standard client refresh update. As a result, FIs acting as Validation Agents save time and cost while enhancing their client onboarding experience by removing the duplication of data validation processes. </p>
<p>By becoming Validation Agents financial institutions can also streamline, accelerate and diversify their use of the LEI, and ensure their autonomy as they look to digitize their business processes. </p>
<p>GLEIF signed JP Morgan as its first Validation Agent at the end of 2020 and is continuing to invite FIs to participate in the Framework’s trial phase and establish first-mover status in the market. </p>
<p>GLEIF is working to standardize the trial engagement process, but also acknowledges that every FI employs its own processes and departmental functions differently. This is why GLEIF is committed to working with each triallist individually to explore and define the Validation Agent role ‘in context’, and to ensure the Global LEI System continues to meet the sector’s needs. </p>
<p>The trial process is comprised of seven steps, as illustrated in the graphic below. </p>

<p>To provide more detail around what this process entails, our latest eBook details what FIs can expect at each stage of this trial, the benefits they can look to enjoy working as part of the Framework and answers some frequently asked questions. </p>

 On a Digital Scotland webinar Chris Torres of the <a href="https://tourismmarketing.agency/">Tourism Marketing Agency</a> shared insights on how to leverage Facebook ads to&nbsp;stand out from the crowd. 
 What are the Facebook Ads? 
<p>Facebook ads are paid messages from businesses that are written in their voice and help reach the people who matter most to them. Advertisers create campaigns that have specific goals, which we call advertising objectives and they create ads within those campaigns to help them reach those objectives.</p>
<p>Facebook Advertising is now one of the most effective tools out there to grow your business, create loyal customers, and generate leads and sales. It helps marketers increase visibility for their ads, build brand awareness.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>In this video Chris will give insights into how a person can make his/her brand stand out from the crowd why a person should change their perspective away from running a tourism business.</p>
<p>Firstly, he starts with customer journey. The three main parts of the journey is usually the dreaming the planning and the booking. The dreaming phase helps with the planning and the purchase and booking. The funnel works through different stages such as –</p>
 
 Brand Awareness Ad 
 Free Value Ad 
 Trust Ad 
 Sales Ad 
 
<p>The purpose of brand awareness ad is to drive targeted traffic to the website and raise brand awareness. The purpose of free value ad is to target people who landed on that landing page and in this instance, they want them to download a free cookbook that this company has created. Another purpose is to offer value in exchange for their email address.</p>
<p>It targets visitors to the website. The purpose of trust ad is to continue value to the customer and build trust in the brand with small videos. It mainly targets the visitors who have downloaded the guide from the website.</p>
<p>The purpose of sale ad is to continue value to the customer and build trust in your brand with a 30 sec video from a guide or carousel image. It targets the visitors who downloaded the guide and past visitors. The overall daily budget for per day is 20-25 pounds.</p>
<p>One of the quick tips to attract audience is to use square images or videos. This helps the ads stand out more. An Irish Tourism company used various technics to attract the American audience to visit a particular spot in Ireland, where a portion of the shooting of Star Wars occurred.</p>
<p>Cool Travel Iceland a tour agency used a video which cost almost $60 to attract the audience. They were pretty successful in this. In the whole campaign it was over a month or two the whole campaigns have produced over 300 leads close to 400 and all from our 30 pounds ads and that’s how an effective video can be made. For Facebook campaign a video can be made without breaking a bank.</p>
<p>The videos are important because it builds the brand reputation, lasting relationships and users actually love to watch them. The 79% of the travellers search for Youtube videos before planning the tour. Consumers process information with videos 60,000 times faster than written form. The videos can be made within budget by using Iphone or GoPro with Karma Grip.</p>
<p>There are many free tools to edit or improve the videos. Creating professional videos for promotion or for attracting audience is very easy in a modern day. To have a successful campaign all the above-mentioned requirements should be fulfilled.</p>

   The history of the ultimate digital disruptor - Napster.

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/category/digital-disruptors/"></a>In the ’90s, it was a great time to be in the music business. Things were booming. And as a result, there were expensive parties, big launches. That was part of the culture. 
<p>This was the era of NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. This was the era where a single hit could sell 10 million albums plus. Artists were just printing money. Artists had the great sales of CDs over that period dwarfing whatever had happened in the industry before. The profits coming in were massive. It was a hell of a lot of fun.</p>
 Birth of the MP3 
<p>We really didn’t foresee the change in the technology. We’ll be telling you tonight about a method of compressing audio data called MP3. And that was the end of everything we know. The birth of the MP3 was a seminal moment for all of media and entertainment. It would completely change the music industry. It opened up people’s minds to what the future would be.</p>
<p>The music industry is not viable. Movies, books, television, nothing creative had any value then. The music industry simply did not embrace the magnitude of the change and it failed. You can’t fight progress. You can’t fight technology. The MP3 totally changed people’s relationship to the internet, to culture, to how society works. It’s a fact that was so much bigger than just the music industry.</p>
<p>The story of the MP3 really begins in West Germany back then in the early ’80s and even late ’70s. People started trying to compress music. Dieter Seitzer was a visionary who came up with the MP3. He was seeing the original digitization of music with a compact disc and thinking, instead of manufacturing millions upon millions of plastic discs, why don’t we store all the data in one centralized computer and then stream it to people in their homes. So, he applied for a patent to use the phone system to transmit music. In 1982, that’s when they had this idea. But they had a huge problem.</p>
<p>The compact disc took about a million bytes of information to store one second of audio. And the pipe they were trying to send it through, the telephone, could only do about 128,000 bytes. For this to work, they somehow had to magically shrink the size of the compact disc by 90% or more. The patent examiner looked at it and said, “No, it’s not possible.” Essentially, almost everyone thought this was impossible.</p>
<p>There’s no way to do this. But around 1987 or 1988, Dieter Seitzer’s brilliant graduate student, Brandenburg, made a breakthrough by taking advantage of this sort of obscure academic discipline – Psychoacoustics (the study of how the ear perceives sound).</p>
 The Era of Peer to Peer 
<p>By 1998, the pirates found out that music can be listened free of cost in computer. Dan Tsurif was the early mp3 pirate. He was the founder of mp3 piracy group known as ‘Audiopunks’. This group specialized in everything from punk rock, to ska, to hardcore and heavy metal. They had downloaders from Indonesia, Japan, or Russia and many more countries. People were downloading from his group. This wasn’t called piracy in that time but rather it was file sharing</p>
<p>The latest advance, called MP3, comes via the internet. It was the future of music and audio. There were millions of people out there who not only understand what digital downloading technology is about, but who use it daily to great personal advantage. There wasn’t any panic in the industry in the early days.</p>
<p>Some people took this thread as an opportunity. People used to call it the celestial jukebox. Celestial jukebox was a theoretical construct at the time. Every song ever made was going to be in the cloud ,and would be instantaneously available to anyone on the planet simply by pressing a button on your gizmo. But the industry really did not embrace that opportunity.</p>
<p>But there was an awareness that the digital revolution was coming and anybody who was in a senior position had to say how do we make this work for us? They began trying to find a way to legitimately sell music on the internet. ‘What systems do we develop? How do we deal with how we sell it? How do you price it?’ these questions were in the mind of music company owner. Sony Music said they will the first major recording company to sell new releases through the internet. These virtual singles will be released at the same time as CDs go into the stores.</p>
<p>When the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) came, it changed everything. In 1999, observing the file sharing system as good, Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker created Napster.</p>
<p>Now at the time, there were all these MP3 files being created, but there was no sort of central index where people could go download them easily. Shawn Fanning thought of creating a technology that could connect peer to peer server and could download music. Parker’s role was essentially the face of the organization. Fanning wrote the code. Fanning kind of did all the technical and computer side stuff. He wrote all the codes.</p>
<p>If you typed any artist’s song in the Napster, you will get the song instantly. It was by far the fastest way to download music from the internet. It allows anyone to copy thousands of musical selections for free. And it’s spread so quickly that it’s clogging computer networks on hundreds of campuses. So, this became hugely popular overnight basically. It was really one of the first viral apps.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/category/technology-futures/"></a>One of the most profound visions for our technology future is ‘the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a>‘. 
<p>This is explained by Marko Balabanovic in his article <a href="https://medium.com/digital-catapult/who-will-own-the-metaverse-48c2912d7aae">Who Will Own the Metaverse</a>:</p>
<p>“a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet”.</p>
<p>Marko explores the background, industry applications and technology stack that makes up this exciting evolution.</p>
<p>It’s also called the ‘<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/18/the-ar-cloud-will-infuse-meaning-into-every-object-in-the-real-world/">AR Cloud</a>‘, “a persistent 3D digital copy of the real world to enable sharing of AR experiences across multiple users and devices” that will ‘infuse meaning into every object in the real world’. VentureBeat offers <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/09/a-primer-on-the-metaverse-the-next-iteration-of-the-internet/">this primer</a>, describing it as the next version of the Internet, with massive implications for every industry such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjwjomAPMlw">movies</a>.</p>
 Human Co-Experience – Building the Metaverse 
<p>Another vision of the Metaverse is shared by David Baszucki, Founder and CEO and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/28/roblox-guide-children-gaming-platform-developer-minecraft-fortnite">Roblox</a>, a popular game creation site where users design and upload their own games as well as play other games in a multiplayer environment.</p>
<p>Speaking at the 2020 <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/">Roblox Developers Conference</a> David gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G00GlCJc0mU">this presentation</a>. From 16m:20s David shares the ultimate vision of Roblox, to realize the concept of the Metaverse fantasized about for years by the sci-fi community and more recently by the tech industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Roblox team envisage very fun, large-scale participation scenarios, like a medieval battle with 50,000 players attacking a destructible castle. They’re starting to pioneer the first building blocks of this through hosting their town hall meetings virtually on Roblox.</p>
<p>Key technology innovations to simulate the real world include great avatars and the ability to simulate how the real world sounds. For example being able to whisper to the person next to you while you can still hear the loud speaker announcements, what they call ‘spatial audio’.</p>
<p>Another example demonstrating the concept is their&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/04/one-world-together-home-virtual-concert/">One World virtual concert</a>, and given the global pandemic it’s likely to prove a hugely popular trend, another great opportunity for their developers.</p>
 Somnium Space 
<p>Another venture pioneering the concept is <a href="https://somniumspace.com/">Somnium Space</a>, an open-source social VR world powered by blockchain and shaped entirely by its users, allowing them to buy digital land where they can build VR homes and buildings.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://vrscout.com/news/somnium-space-social-vr-ethereum-blockchain/">VR Scout reported</a> in Feb 2020 the platform announced the launch of&nbsp;Somnium 2.0, a new update that promises to move us closer to a true&nbsp;Ready Player One&nbsp;virtual experience.</p>
<p>“Imagine standing on the top of the highest mountain inside of a virtual mountain looking down to see thousands of users exploring the world beneath in real-time; unlike a majority of multiplayer VR games where players are divided into sub servers and mirrored instanced rooms, Somnium 2.0 actually hosts all its players in a single massive world.”</p>

 Futuristic technologies like Augmented Reality can be applied in a practical way to boost success for Scottish businesses. Tourism is a great example. 
  Enhancing the experience with these types of exciting innovations will draw in even greater visitor numbers and continue the massive economic success of this industry. 
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/tourist-attractions-are-being-transformed-by-immersive-experiences-some-lessons-from-scotland-110860">This Conversation article</a> comments on the details of this economic success and the critical role immersive experiences can play in facilitating this boost.</p>
<p>Simple examples include&nbsp;AR tourism guides, such as this one for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_RppvB4rDo">Inverness Castle</a>, and for <a href="https://thelochsidepress.com/2019/04/19/augmented-reality-is-a-world-first-for-tourist-guide/">Loch Lomond</a> they inserted ‘Zapcodes’ into the local guide magazine, to trigger AR links that enhance the printed word with a virtual experience.&nbsp;You can <a href="https://www.scotsmagazine.com/articles/discover-fife-augmented-reality/">discover Fife</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FOSIT_cMCk">discover the Highlands via AR</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Smartify 
<p>Another great example is described in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19241367.castle-first-scottish-landmark-sign-app-tours/">this recent news</a>, about Blair Castle adopting the <a href="https://about.smartify.org/">Smartify</a> app. Via easy-to-use interfaces and well designed technology available as a native and web app, the Smartify guide allows visitors to follow their own interests and curated tours, with additional features such as e-commerce, targeted push notifications and donations.</p>
<p>Other Scottish venues adopting Smartify include the National Galleries of Scotland. The Smartify <a href="https://about.smartify.org/case-studies/national-galleries-of-scotland-ray-harryhausen-exhibition">case study</a> explains how the venue employed the app for their <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/ray-harryhausen-titan-cinema-virtual-exhibition-experience">Ray Harryhausen exhibition</a>, to offer visitors a fun (and COVID-safe) experience on site, as well as access from home.</p>
<p>With Smartify already used by the museum across the permanent collection, staff were keen to use the platform to deliver an audio tour safely to visitors’ own smartphones without the need for rented devices or touch screens. They also wanted to provide teaser content and came up with the idea of re-animating one of Harryhausen’s famous skeletons from Clash of the Titans in Augmented Reality.</p>
<p>They worked with Scottish animation agency <a href="https://www.playdead.tv/">Playdead</a> to develop an AR animation of the famous skeletons from Clash of the Titans. Visitors on site could scan the original skeleton model and watch it come to life again, while audiences at home could also play with the AR animation.</p>
<p></p>
 Virtual Treasure Hunts 
<p>For more advanced and engaging experience the technology can be combined with features like ‘Gamification’, to enable super fun activities like Virtual Treasure Hunts. As the Conversation article highlights:</p>
<p>“It’s the sort of immersive experience that many tourist attractions want to have these days. At the <a href="http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk/">Burns Birthplace Museum</a>&nbsp;in Ayrshire, dedicated to Robert Burns, visitors can download an app aimed at children called the&nbsp;<a href="https://digit.fyi/augmented-reality-scottish-attractions/">Mighty Mission Trail</a>. It sends them on a virtual treasure hunt throughout the site and surroundings.”</p>
<p>This highlights the other types of technologies that can be called into play. For example <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/14/google-maps-gaming-platform-expands-after-a-year-of-success-stories/">Google Maps Gaming</a> provides a capability for making more use of location data in mobile games, the Pokemon Go type, that can ‘can unlock augmented reality and social gameplay, can increase engagement and retention, and can help bring new life to games that were originally designed without a location component.’</p>
<p>This is complimented by their general capabilities for improving navigation, such as <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/02/11/google-maps-ar-navigation/">AR Navigation</a> and harnessing AI for <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/using-global-localization-to-improve.html">Global Navigation</a>, helping you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWbY5jdJnHg">better navigate cities</a>.</p>
<p>These various innovations provide the building blocks for creating any type of highly immersive, highly engaging experience, that better enables visitors to explore and enjoy attractions, with the ability to ‘gamify’ the experience of particular value for those looking to attract children and young families.</p>
<p>In general this barely scratches the surface of the staggering scale of opportunity this technology trend offers Scotland. From Oil &amp; Gas through Telemedicine and Digital Tourism, Augmented Reality can enable a myriad of transformative industry solutions, each with valuable local application and also huge global export potential.</p>

<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>I’ve had an incredible journey working and meeting individuals who are passionate about transformation, digital experiences and pushing the boundaries of what has been possible.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>I don’t think I ever wanted to confine myself to one dream job. It was about what I could learn and the people I would interact with that mattered most.</p>



<p><br></p>
 
 
 


<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>Overworking. I worked hard, very long hours, and many late nights. It caused me to burn out and not focus on the things that mattered. I now make a continuous effort to keep a balance.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Taking time out for my health and stress relief on a regular basis is key to how I manage and balance my life and work now.</p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>I think meeting other women in the industry is a good start. A mentorship program would be even better. I wish I had that when I was starting out my career.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Internal sponsorship of women by other leaders is very important. We need to learn to humbly ask for that sponsorship and genuinely put in the time and effort to achieve the goals we set for ourselves.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>There’s many. But I believe the greatest challenge will continue to be managing family and work for some time until this issue is systematically addressed by our public &amp; private sector. Childcare is not considered a right in Ontario. Stop the stigma of motherhood. Companies need to offer men and women both a fair and balanced chance. Being a parent is not a disability.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Don’t set limits for yourself. Don’t be shy to ask why. Make friends everywhere.</p>

<p>By Joni Brennan, DIACC and Antoine Normand, In-Sec-M<br>Originally published by <a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/2021/04/21/digital-id?i=e2a651476f984d378ed43975666ffcc9">The Hill Times</a></p>



 There is no clear policy directive in Bill C-11 that allows Canadians to understand what they can expect in terms of accessing the data the federal public service has regarding them. 



<p>If the global pandemic has shown us anything, it’s that the need for reliable and secure data is paramount as businesses, governments, and Canadians from Vancouver to Quebec City to Charlottetown and everywhere in between move online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From receiving emergency pandemic benefits to ensuring health records are correct and helping children and youth with online education, the pandemic has put a renewed spotlight on the need for governments to move with urgency to invest in digital infrastructure. In fact, it’s critical to ensuring Canadians receive the services they need and that businesses can participate fully and securely in the global digital economy.</p>



<p>At the core of this infrastructure is a secure digital identity, which is essential to the function of daily life during a pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The majority of Canadians believe it is important for federal and provincial governments to move quickly on enabling digital ID in a safe and secure manner, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canadian-Digital-Identity-Research-2020_Report_ENG_VF.pdf">a recent survey</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada. Investing in digital ID makes economic sense, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises. For SMEs, the impact of digital identity can be used to improve processes that are difficult today, resulting in a potential&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Economic-Impact-of-Digital-Identity-DIACC-v2.pdf">$4.5-billion of added value</a>&nbsp;to SMEs and reinvestments in the Canadian economy.</p>



<p>In Canada, the DIACC and its participating banks have identified potential net savings per institution at or above $100-million per year, through operational efficiencies created by reducing manual processing costs and curbing fraud.</p>



<blockquote><p>While retail sales fell by almost 18 per cent from February to May 2020, the Canadian&nbsp;<a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-28-0001/2020001/article/00064-eng.htm">e-commerce market doubled</a>. Data from J.P. Morgan also shows that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/merchant-services/insights/reports/canada-2020">e-commerce sales are growing</a>&nbsp;faster in Canada than in many other Western countries. From e-commerce to the sharing economy a robust, digital ID establishes trust, provides security, mitigates fraud and enables continued growth for the sector. This is a win for citizens/consumers and businesses.</p></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, an estimated $482-million is lost each year on the manual setup of user accounts within federal and provincial government services because of the need to prove identity with paper credentials. Issuing digital ID credentials is essential to a modern government operating in the digital age.</p>



<p>These are just a few of the myriad ways in which digital ID can help contribute to our post-pandemic economic recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to several misconceptions, digital ID is not about surveillance or tracking Canadians’ online activity. It’s about using the identification Canadians already have offline (e.g.: passports, driver’s licences, health cards, citizenship cards); having those credentials securely issued digitally; and being able to use them for digital transactions—from opening a bank account from the comfort of home to accessing medical records to receiving government benefits quickly and easily.</p>



<p>There are technology solutions and services that already exist today to easily adopt a digital ID ecosystem. In fact, in Quebec, the government has&nbsp;<a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/dont-waste-a-good-crisis-experts-push-governments-to-create-digital-id-programs-as-covid-19-pushes-digital-transformation">committed to issuing a strong digital I</a>D to residents in the province in 2021. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel—changes can be made through regulations and policy setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, in order for a safe and secure digital ID ecosystem to be successful, a trust framework that instills confidence for Canadians is paramount. The DIACC spearheaded the&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>, an international collaborative approach to modernizing digital service delivery that’s recognized by the World Economic Forum and others.. This made-for-Canada framework enables the development of an adaptable infrastructure that will make the Canadian digital ID ecosystem more resilient to future crises.</p>



<p>But there is so much more work to be done. Our digital future rests on getting the digital ID right. This means ensuring the federal government’s Digital Charter Implementation Act, Bill C-11, enacts a 360-degree rights regime and includes public-sector data subject to the legislation. There is no clear policy directive in C-11 that allows Canadians to understand what they can expect in terms of accessing the data the federal public service has regarding them. The federal government must empower Canadians to access their own data and be able to use the credentials associated with it in a modern digital economy.</p>



<p>In the province of Quebec, the proposed Bill 64 to protect personal data introduces new concepts of consent, disclosure obligations in case of a breach, the transfer of personal information to other jurisdictions and very strong penalties for contravening the act (up to four per cent of the worldwide sales).</p>



<p>Digital ID means decreased costs for governments, consumers, and businesses while improving service delivery and driving GDP growth. Not adopting digital ID in a meaningful way or not getting it right means more privacy and security breaches, loss of revenue for Canadian businesses and inefficiencies in government service delivery. There’s never been a better time to invest in digital ID. Our economic recovery depends on it.</p>



<p>Joni Brennan is president of the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada. Antoine Normand is president of IN-SEC-M, a Canadian cybersecurity cluster.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>There are so many things about my job that gets me out of bed in th morning. First, I love that I have the opportunity to solve for a trustworthy, informed and transparent way to control our personal information. We need a simple digital identity in so many facets of our digital lives and it’s sorely lacking. Second, I love knowing that I’m contributing to a safer digital future for my children and the next generation. Finally, and most importantly, I love the people I get to share the experience with – the team at IDENTOS, our customers and the identity community continues to humble me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Hmm. Hard to say. Where am I today? I am a daughter, a sister, a mom, a tech professional and very grateful for it all. I don’t know how I got here since most of this was likely already planned before my time… but for the moments I had the opportunity to make a choice, I would say that I’ve arrived here thanks to having trust in myself and others who wanted the best for me.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson is to really take stock of the people we interact with, especially the people who share in the same vision and are doing their best to create a better future. The more human and connected we are, the better our solutions will be.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>Keeping this focused on identity, I’d say:</p>
 
 START joining other innovators in your community and offer to work on complementary identity projects 
 STOP asking for input from the same groups or people. Surround yourself with different voices and perspectives. 
 CONTINUE bringing your best in identity solutions to build a privacy-respecting, sustainable digital future for citizens, patients, students, parents, children, et al. 
 
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<blockquote><p>Solutions will fall flat unless we can recognize our blind spots.</p></blockquote>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>In a field that is dreaming up the future, it probably comes as no surprise that I like to spend a lot of time with movies that have done the same. Aside from diversity, Sci-fi movies also have the power to offer different perspectives. Flicks like Gattaca, Ai, Hunger Games, Battlestar Galactica, West World all have an identity component in the plot that’s interesting to observe. I love the impact it has on the characters’ quality of life, not to mention the freedoms and liberties of some.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>As a teenager, I was full of big dreams and wanted to fulfill them all. Personally, this caused a lot of stress, and after a while it also didn’t leave a lot of room for connecting with the people and things I cared most for. If I had the opportunity, I’d tell my teenage self:&nbsp; “Continue to dream big and have a compass, but don’t be so hard on yourself. Instead, do your best with what you have while giving yourself space to do the things you find most fulfilling.”</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/category/technology-futures/"></a>This video explores the possibility of ‘mind uploading’, suggesting it may come to be the evolution of humanity, a concept explored in <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. 
<p>Mind uploading, also known as whole brain emulation (WBE), is the hypothetical futuristic process of scanning a physical structure of the brain accurately enough to create an emulation of the mental state (including long-term memory and “self”) and copying it to a computer in a digital form.</p>
<p>The Wall St Journal explored the concept, asking <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-your-uploaded-mind-still-be-you-11568386410">Will Your Uploaded Mind Still Be You</a>?</p>
<p>While theoretical there are visible early steps happening today. In 2018 <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/13/144721/a-startup-is-pitching-a-mind-uploading-service-that-is-100-percent-fatal/">Nectome won a federal grant</a> to pioneer a startup doing exactly this although with a catch, you have to be dead.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRvzrg02gmc">this presentation</a> Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPRIZE Foundation and co-founder of Singularity University and Human Longevity Inc., talks through the core mechanics, such as the Brain-Machine Interface.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>To explore whether this concept is possible the video first asks the fundamental question: What is the human mind?</p>
<p>To answer this question it defines the&nbsp;mind as the collective ability of consciousness and intelligence, and mind uploading is the hypothetical concept of making a copy of this inner world and transferring it into a computer to run a simulation of human consciousness.</p>
<p>It suggests a simple process but it quickly becomes tricky when you consider it is based on three main assumptions:</p>
 
 Physicalism – The human mind is in brain, achieved through it’s arrangement and brain chemistry. 
 Scanability – All of this can be scanned. 
 Computability – The mind can be translated into computable algorithms. 
 
<p>These are very significant challenges when you consider the complexity of the brain. It&nbsp;is the most complex biological structure known, with over 100 billion neurons communicating via one million billion connections and that are sending signals up to one thousand times each second, which is one quadrillion events.</p>
<p>For a sense of the scale of complexity required to digitize such an entity, in 2019 scientists successfully mapped a cubic millimetre of mouse brain. It was cut into 25,000 slices and five electron microscopes ran continuously for five months, collecting more than 100 million images, assembled into a 3D model over three months.</p>
<p>The completed data set for this takes up 2 million Gigabytes of Cloud storage. To scan a whole human brain this would need to be repeated a million times and require 2 million Petabytes of storage.</p>
<p>This is even before factoring in other complications, such as potentially the need to map out the underlying proteins and individual molecules that cause all the behaviours seen at the cellular level, producing more data than there is currently available storage on earth.</p>
 The Transhuman Future 
  
<p>Most fundamentally the difficulty with the concept is that the human self, it’s entire consciousness, stretches far beyond only what the mechanics of the brain enables, into dimensions that science does not yet reach.</p>
<p>From 8m:50s the video works from the assumption uploading will become possible, and explores how humanity and society would be transformed. It’s a domain with an extensive following and set of ideas, described as ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">transhumanism</a>‘.</p>
<p>The video asks would you feel differently about your physical life if you knew that it is not a finite event but rather you’ll become functionally immortal?</p>
<p>Your digital self could co-exist with you, and experience a myriad of activities not possible for your real self, from walking on the surface of the sun to visiting the past, and you could work on projects that require more than a lifetime to complete. You could be uploaded to spacecraft and go on journeys that take thousands of years.</p>
<p>Also how will the negative aspects of human personality translate into this digital world and what will this mean for how digital personalities interact as part of this system? Will some attempt to subvert and dominate it?</p>
<p>Ultimately it may simply be the case that like the body the human mind is only intended to have a short and finite experience, and after upload may choose to retire itself. Either way, it is a fascinating concept that encourages us to explore not only the awe inspiring potential of future technologies but also the very essence of ourselves.</p>

 Sovrin releases two new Guardianship Credentials papers at Internet Identity Workshop&nbsp;#32 <p>In December 2019 the Sovrin Guardianship Task Force released a whitepaper titled “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Guardianship-Whitepaper2.pdf">On Guardianship in Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.” This groundbreaking paper explored guardianship in the context of SSI, and provided two use cases: one for a refugee, Mya, and one for an elderly living with dementia, Jamie. (Watch the video illustration of these two use cases at the end of this article.)</p><p>Recognising the need to develop the work beyond the whitepaper, the Sovrin Foundation chartered a <a href="https://guardianshipwg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GWG/overview?homepageId=229378">Sovrin Guardianship Working Group</a> (SGWG) in December 2019. Two key documents were identified as outputs for the working group: a Technical Requirements for Guardianship and Implementation Guidelines. After more than a year of hard work, the two papers were completed and will be publicly presented and released at the Sovrin’s breakout session at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) #32 during April 20–22,&nbsp;2021.</p><blockquote>“When we started the work on defining technical requirements for guardianship in early 2020, we viewed the task as relatively simple. ‘All’ we had to do was extract the guardianship requirements from the use cases in the previous whitepaper… It turned out that this view was optimistic,” said John Phillips, one of the authors and Chairs of SGWG in Asia Pacific. “We found that the gap between the two use cases in the whitepaper and technical requirements was too broad. So we realised we needed to revisit our thinking. We needed a conceptual bridge, a ‘mental model’ to understand Guardianship broadly so we could write appropriately narrow technical requirements. The lesson we have (re)learnt in our journey is that, before you can describe something in simple terms, you need to make sure you have a broad and deep enough understanding of the&nbsp;topic.”</blockquote><p>The first paper is called the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBePVx8n3MRDWcePkwVDya9ab4BHEyU_/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines</a> and its purpose is to provide readers with the background they need to implement IT systems that support various kinds of guardianship. In particular, it focuses on what they need to know when using Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised Identifiers, the building blocks of a SSI framework within the frameworks of <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a>&nbsp;(ToIP).</p><p>This paper is intended for all people interested in the design, build and operation of a Guardianship implementation using an SSI framework. It outlines the conceptual framework for Guardianship and provides implementation guidelines. The document introduces and uses a mental model to help understand the interplay and relationships of the key entities and actors involved in the establishment, running and ending of a Guardianship Arrangement.</p><p>While this document provides background explanations of the thinking that led to the technical requirements guidelines, it does not mandate or warrant specific rules for the implementation of Guardianship as these should be Jurisdiction specific, which is defined by the mental model in the document.</p><p>The second paper is called <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M21PznPAd0H6z1t4ODl-jiEoXZjEhwcb/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Technical Requirements</a> which was developed by the technical requirements working group within the SGWG. The purpose of this document is twofold: i) provide principles under which guardianship scenario designs and requirements are considered and defined; and ii) provide technical requirements for SSI solutions that offer the capability of guardianship.</p><p>The intended audience for this document includes: i) individuals looking to understand how guardianship should be implemented for their use case; ii) SSI solution designers that require guardianship to support the use of VCs in their specific use case; iii) readers who want to understand how Guardianship can work in an SSI&nbsp;context.</p><p>The requirements described in this paper, together with other SSI standardization, describe when an SSI solution offers the capability of guardianship. In this case, the requirements are mainly for the technical building blocks that live in the bottom three layers of the Technical “Stack” of the Sovrin/ToIP framework. The mental model, however, is also relevant for the top layer (ecosystem), as guardianship is intricately linked to what we will be defining as Jurisdictions, and this enables human governance to be applied to the first three&nbsp;layers.</p><p>This document should be read in conjunction with the Sovrin Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines mentioned above. In particular, readers who are looking to understand the thinking behind these requirements are encouraged to refer to the Implementation Guidelines.</p><p>These two papers are the first public release of implementation guidelines and technical requirements for guardianship in the context of SSI. There are sections at the end of the documents that propose areas of future work, and it is expected that these two documents will be updated as technology evolves and open discussion and decision areas are resolved.</p><p>Download the two papers&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QivpMOIYu0ry-LMfyh5b2pU7eG_SjimJ?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #1— Mya (a refugee&nbsp;girl)</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #2 — Jamie (an elderly living with dementia)</p><p>Video credit: John&nbsp;Phillips</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/a-deeper-understanding-of-implementing-guardianship/">https://sovrin.org</a> on April 22,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>This all-volunteer Sovrin Guardianship Working Group is open to anyone with a genuine interest in and willingness to contribute to digital guardianship.

<p>The first Earth Day — held April 22, 1970 — is considered the birth of the modern environmental movement. More than half a century later, it has taken on renewed focus amidst the climate crisis. Here at Energy Web, we are developing open-source digital infrastructure to accelerate the low-carbon energy transition and expand access to clean energy markets for all. Here are five specific ways we — the Energy Web team, Energy Web members, and the broader Energy Web ecosystem — are working together to speed global decarbonization.</p> 1. Supporting flexibility markets, making it possible for DERs to help balance renewable grids <p>Distributed energy resources (DERs) — from batteries and electric vehicles to “behind the meter’ devices like smart thermostats — are fast becoming crucial components of increasingly decentralized and dynamic power grids that are running on growing amounts of renewable energy. Such DERs can play a valuable role providing grid services, such as helping to balance supply and demand in flexibility markets. Thus we believe it is essential to make it easy for DERs to enroll, participate, and get compensation for delivered grid services. This is why we built and keep advancing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-flex/">Energy Web Flex</a> as a software development toolkit that grid operators <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">like Austrian Power Grid</a> can use to tap into the full potential of DERs at the lowest administrative cost possible.</p> 2. Digitizing renewable energy markets, making it faster and easier to source renewables <p>We are building open-source tools to help buyers more easily achieve their proof-of-impact needs and companies around the globe launch user-friendly, digitized renewable energy market platforms. For example, <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a> is a software development toolkit we built and continue advancing that digitizes the entire energy attribute certificate lifecycle — from certificate issuance to trading and cancellations/claims — for any clean energy market. We are also working directly with various companies around the world to help them use EW Origin to launch their own digitized renewable energy marketplace platforms across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In addition, Energy Web is developing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, a renewable energy search-and-match engine that helps buyers discover all available renewable energy products and make direct purchases from platforms (like those built with EW Origin). Think Skyscanner or Kayak.com meets renewable energy&nbsp;markets.</p> 3. Enabling lifecycle asset tracking, such as batteries, as part of a circular green&nbsp;economy <p>We know that it is important to understand and track the environmental impacts of all energy devices — from batteries to solar panels and wind turbines — from cradle to grave. This lifecycle tracking is also part of major legislation such as the European Green Deal, not to mention major movements such as the circular economy. Energy Web is leveraging our tech stack and developing tools that companies are using to bring solutions to the market, such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/bebat-launches-easybat-an-open-source-decentralized-solution-for-battery-lifecycle-management-281f2ace61e9">our work with BeBat and Fluvius in Belgium to support EasyBat</a>. EasyBat makes it possible to holistically manage customer-owned batteries (both private &amp; professional use) participating in Belgian electricity markets, including legal takeback obligations and/or extended producers responsibility (EPR) of battery manufacturers.</p> 4. Advancing the Crypto Climate Accord to decarbonize an entire&nbsp;sector <p>We spearheaded the Crypto Climate Accord (CCA) earlier this month in partnership with RMI and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) to decarbonize the global crypto and blockchain industry. We are excited to drive it forward with a fast-growing community of <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc/crypto-climate-accord-adds-over-a-dozen-new-supporters-in-two-weeks-since-launch-52dccc7c10a2">now 40 CCA Supporters</a>. More importantly, we have already started identifying, defining, and developing a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/making-crypto-green-with-energy-web-zero-301cf4a979e5">fast-emerging suite of open-source solutions</a> to help decarbonize crypto. If your company can help us advance solutions in this area, we encourage you to become a CCA Supporter. For more frequent updates on progress related to the CCA, check out the new <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc">CCA&nbsp;Medium</a>.</p> 5. Fostering interoperability of digital twins across tech and&nbsp;markets <p>Historically, power grids and electricity markets — and the technologies used to run them — were heavily fragmented and siloed. Important was locked away in proprietary systems. Customer enrollment in various utility programs, such as selling surplus solar energy to a grid operator or participating in a demand response program, was cumbersome and duplicative. Even worse, customer devices in some cases were prohibited from providing services in certain electricity markets, even if they technologically were able to do so. But those metaphorical walls are coming down, with new regulations such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">FERC Order 2222 in the United States</a> and a focus on customer-centric market design in the EU. The key to unlocking this new potential is with digital twins and ‘passports’ anchored to the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>This is just a snapshot of all the leading-edge work happening at Energy Web and among our global member community. Stay tuned for more updates and news in the weeks and months&nbsp;ahead!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/top-5-ways-energy-web-is-accelerating-the-clean-energy-transition-de2eeee5a88d">Top 5 Ways Energy Web is Accelerating the Clean Energy Transition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Significant advances are taking place right now in China relative to LEI adoption. Regulatory authorities within the region are proactively driving LEI usage and have set ambitious plans for substantial near-term increases in LEI volume. </p>
<p>For those who missed it, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) published an LEI implementation roadmap at the end of 2020, which looks ahead to 2022. This roadmap is part of the ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative, which is described in the following way on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative">Wikipedia</a>: ‘[…] incorporated into the Constitution of China in 2017. The Chinese government calls the initiative "a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future."’ The roadmap unveils national plans to increase LEI issuance by a minimum of 170% between the end of 2020 (there were 37,000 active LEIs) and the end of 2022 (the target is a minimum LEI volume of 100,000). </p>
<p>In a separate but complementary development, just this month GLEIF has welcomed the news that the Chinese Financial Certification Authority (CFCA) has launched the first commercial demo of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. CFCA has simultaneously become the first Certification Authority to assume a Validation Agent role within the Global LEI System. This innovation from CFCA shows a further commitment from the Chinese market, this time to facilitating and promoting LEI issuance in digital certificates. It is hoped that CFCA’s early mover status on this front will act as a catalyst for other similar demos to emerge. </p>
<p>The combined sum of these two initiatives is significant. It shows an advanced level of proactivity from regulatory authorities within the region, which is driving LEI issuance to support financial services and banking ecosystems, simplify international trade and enhance digital identity across the region. </p>
<p>Understandably, GLEIF advocates these steps being taken to advance LEI adoption across China and applauds the foresight and proactivity of regulators. A commitment to boosting LEI issuance across such a vast region, will not only deliver benefits to Chinese market participants, but has the potential to motivate regulators across other countries and regions to follow suit. GLEIF certainly hopes that this is the case. </p>
<p>A more detailed summary of each initiative is given below.</p>
<p>China’s LEI Implementation Roadmap: 2020-2022</p>
<p>In Q4 2020, four financial regulators in China released a report detailing a roadmap for LEI implementation. The four organizations involved were: PBOC, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). </p>
<p>The report, which is published in Chinese on the PBOC <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4142052/index.html">website</a>, outlines the general objective of the roadmap and details key LEI implementation milestones over the next two years. </p>
<p>As stated in a Regulation Asia <a href="https://www.regulationasia.com/pboc-publishes-roadmap-for-full-lei-adoption-in-china/">article</a>,  the intention of wide LEI implementation in China is to help the country connect with the international market, support China’s bid to open up its financial sector, and facilitate cross-border trade and financial transactions.</p>
<p>In line with a translation from the report on the PBOC website, GLEIF understands that the general objective of the roadmap is to establish a comprehensive LEI usage policy system across China’s financial system in line with international standards by the end of 2022. It envisions that the LEI will become an assisting tool for financial management authorities to maintain financial stability and implement financial supervision. It will become an important means for financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions to carry out customer identification of legal persons involved in cross-border transactions. It will also become a corporate passport.  </p>
<p>This is in line with the PBOC’s role as a member of the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC). The ROC aims to promote the broad public interests to improve the quality of data used in financial data reporting, improving the ability to monitor financial risk, and lowering regulatory reporting costs through the harmonization of these standards across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A number of phase objectives are then outlined for Chinese authorities: </p>
 
 By end of 2020: total LEI volume in China mainland to reach 30,000, covering all financial institutions, member institutions of financial infrastructure and industry associations, and listed companies in China. Proposed LEI application rules in scenarios such as RMB cross-border payments, digital RMB cross-border business, qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) and RMB qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII) access, derivatives trading, securities trading, and listed company supervision. Establish a mechanism for mapping and updating LEI with the codes of financial institutions, unified social credit codes, and codes of information systems related to major financial infrastructure. 
 By end of 2021: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 50,000, with a focus on improving coverage among importers and exporters, trading enterprises, and non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Proposed LEI application rules in areas such as the financial market transaction reporting system, credit rating, and application of special institutional codes by overseas institutions. Launch and operate the cross-border legal person information service and digital authentication platform to provide value-added LEI-based data services to financial management departments, financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions. 
 By end of 2022: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 100,000. Continued improvements in coverage among non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Use LEI in scenarios such as digital identification of cross-border legal persons. Establish a mechanism for commercially sustainable operation of LEI.   
 
<p><br>
CFCA Paves the Way for Increased LEI Usage in Mass Market Digital Identity Products </p>
<p>CFCA has launched the first commercial demonstration of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. It has also become the first Certification Authority to act as a Validation Agent in the Global LEI System, streamlining LEI issuance with digital ID product and service provision.</p>
<p>These developments by CFCA follow the recent launch of the GLEIF CA Stakeholder Group, created as a platform for GLEIF to collaborate with CAs and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) on the coordination and promotion of a global approach to LEI usage across digital identity products. CFCA’s advances are significant because they are the earliest reported successes aligned to the direction of this industry initiative, which is aimed at achieving a critical mass of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. </p>
<p>Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF comments: “This progress by CFCA on both fronts is very welcome as it moves us one step closer to broad LEI usage in digital certificates globally. Realizing the goal of universal LEI usage in digital identity products will be an important step in enhancing trust and creating innovation opportunities across private sector digital identity management applications. Digital certificates linked by an LEI to verified, regularly updated and freely available entity reference data held within the Global LEI System are easier to manage, aggregate and maintain. The result will be significant efficiencies and far less complexity for certificate owners and the provision of greater transparency for all users of the internet and participants within digital exchanges.” </p>
<p>For more details, please read the corresponding press release <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">here</a>.<br>
<br></p>
<p>The ‘LEI Lightbulb Blog Series’ from GLEIF aims to shine a light on the breadth of acceptance and advocacy for the LEI across the public and private sectors, geographies and use cases by highlighting which industry leaders, authorities and organizations are supportive of the LEI and for what purpose. By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a ground swell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide.</p>

<p>Eleven months after Derek Chauvin stole George Floyd’s final breaths, jurors took less than 11 hours to find Chauvin guilty on all three counts. The jury’s verdict shows that sometimes — but too rarely — justice can prevail, and it is very welcome, given the long history of acquittals that come before&nbsp;it.</p><p>It does not, however, bring George Floyd back to life, nor the dozens of other unarmed Black and Brown people who have been killed by the police since May 25, 2020. Since the trial began, police have killed at least 64 people, more than half of whom were Black or Latinx. Just 10 miles from the courthouse, Daunte Wright was shot dead, and across the Great Lakes in Chicago, police took the life of 13-year-old Adam Toledo in&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p>So, while we can briefly exhale today, we know there is so much work that remains to be done to build toward a more just system overall, so that outcomes like today’s are less exceptional.</p><p>Listening to the testimony during the trial reopened painful wounds that have been inflicted relentlessly since our country was founded and reflects the continued need for deep systemic change in our society. We know it won’t happen overnight, nor clearly in just one year, but it must happen. As George Floyd’s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, said, “Floyd was one man. George Floyd is a movement.”</p><p>And at Omidyar Network, while criminal justice reform is not one of our focus areas, there is a close link between economic injustice and racial violence. And between those two areas and true democracy. We know we will not bring about the kind of world we aspire to unless and until Black people are no longer trapped by systems that were intentionally created to lock them into poverty and strip them of voice and opportunity.</p><p>Last summer, we once again began a national racial justice reckoning, we looked deeply at our own systems and policies. We committed to become an anti-racist organization, and while we know we still have quite a long journey, we have taken the first of many steps. We gave more than $1 million to organizations fighting to protect and advance Black lives and another $4 million to organizations looking to reimagine our economy through a racial justice lens. Again, these are the first of many steps we are taking to live up to our commitment and we know there is so much more we can and must do until Black Lives&nbsp;Matter.</p><p>As Ibram X. Kendi wrote in How to Be Anti-Racist, “After taking this grueling journey to the dirt road of anti-racism, humanity can come upon the clearing of a potential future: an antiracist world in all its imperfect beauty. It can become real if we focus on power instead of people, if we focus on changing policy instead of groups of people. It’s possible if we overcome our cynicism about the permanence of&nbsp;racism.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/statement-from-omidyar-network-on-derek-chauvin-verdict-the-first-step-to-justice-f28ec7673805">Statement from Omidyar Network on Derek Chauvin Verdict: The First Step to Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As we continue our pandemic journey that is 2021, more and more people are getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Once vaccinated, people are (finally!) able to do more “in the real world.” However, in some cases such as international travel, there is a need to prove that you have been vaccinated before you can participate. In the past, that proof has been accomplished in the form of the paper World Health Organization Carte Jaune/Yellow Card. But in our 21st century pandemic, a handwritten paper document is not particularly trusted. It’s just too easy to buy or make your own. The sudden, urgent need to be able to prove health information in a safe, privacy-preserving and secure way has brought the spotlight on the concept of verifiable credentials and, for Hyperledger, on the three identity-focused projects in the community, Indy (a distributed ledger for identity), Aries (data exchange protocols and implementations of agents for people, organizations and things), and Ursa (a cryptographic library underlying Indy and Aries).</p>



<p>While people understand that paper credentials are insufficient and that a trusted digital solution is needed, they don’t understand why verifiable credentials, or more generally, identity, works extremely well with distributed ledger technology (DLT)—a distributed database spread across multiple nodes, of which blockchain is an example. To be clear from the start, it is not to put the credentials on a public ledger so everyone can see them! We’ll reiterate that a lot in this post. No private data ever goes on the blockchain!!!</p>



<p>To understand why DLT is useful for identity, we need to go back to the basics—paper credentials, how that model has worked for 1000s of years, and how the use of DLTs with verifiable credentials allows us to transition the great parts—security and privacy—of that model to the digital age.</p>
<p><br>Since as far back as 450BC, people have used paper credentials to enable trusted identity. Legend has it that King Artixerxes of the Persian Empire signed and gave Nehemiah a paper “safe transit” authorization that he used in travels across the empire. People have been using such documents ever since. In technical terms, a credential is an attestation of qualification, competence, or authority issued to an entity (e.g., an individual or organization) by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so. Examples of credentials issued to people include a driver’s license, a passport, an academic degree, proof-of-vaccination and so on. Credentials are also issued to companies, such as business registrations, building permits, and even health inspection certifications.</p>
<p>



</p>


<p>Examples of Paper Credentials<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a></p>

A typical paper credential, say a driver’s license, is issued by a government authority (an issuer) after you prove to them who you are (usually in person using your passport or birth certificate) and that you are qualified to drive. You then hold this credential (usually in your wallet) and can use it elsewhere whenever you want—for example, to rent a car, to open a bank account or in a bar to show that you are old enough to drink. When you do that, you’re proving (or presenting) the credential to the verifier. The verifier inspects the physical document to decide if it is valid for the business purpose at hand. Note that in verifying the paper credential, the verifier does not call the issuer of the document. The transaction is only between the holder and the verifier. Further, it is the holder’s choice whether they want to share the piece of paper. If they want, they can keep it to themselves.

<p>The Paper Credential Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a></p>
<p>Verification in the paper credential model (ideally) proves:</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 Who issued the credential.&nbsp; 
 That the credential was issued to the entity presenting it. 
 That the claims have not been altered. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>The caveat “ideally” is included because of the real possibility of forgery in the use of paper credentials. Back to our “proof-of-vaccination” problem.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the good parts of the paper credential model are retained in the verifiable credentials model. With verifiable credentials:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 An authority decides you are eligible to receive a credential and issues you one. 
 You hold your credential in your (digital) wallet—it does not go on the distributed ledger! 
 At some point, a verifier asks you to prove the claims from one or more credentials. 
 If you decide to share your data with the verifier, you provide a verifiable presentation to the verifier, proving the same three things as with the paper credentials. 
 Plus: You may be able to prove one more thing—that the issued credentials have not been revoked. 
 
<p>As we’ll see, verifiable credentials and presentations are not simple documents that anyone can create. They are cryptographically constructed so that a presentation of the claims within a credential proves four attributes:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Who issued the credential–their identifier is part of the credential and they signed the credential.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Who holds the credential–there is a cryptographic binding to the prover. 
 The claims have not been altered–they were signed at the time of issuance. 
 The credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>Unlike a paper credential, those four attributes are evaluated not based on the judgment and expertise of the person looking at the credential, but rather by machine using cryptographic algorithms that are extremely difficult to forge. Like the paper credential, the verifier does not go back to the issuer to ask about the credential being presented. Only the prover and verifier, the participants in the interaction, need to know about the presentation. So where do the prover and verifier get the information they need for their transaction? We’re just getting to that…</p>
<p>



</p>
<p><br>The Verifiable Credentials Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Compared to the paper credentials model, verifiable credentials are far more secure. When the cryptographic verification succeeds, the verifier can be certain of the validity of the data—those four attributes stemming from verifying the presentation. They are left only with the same question that paper credentials have—do I trust the issuer enough</p>
<p>So where does the DLT fit in?</p>
<p>Three of the four things that the verifier has to prove (listed above) involves published data from the issuer that has to be available in some trusted, public distributed place, a place that is not controlled by a central authority (hmm…sounds like a DLT!). In Indy and Aries, data published to a DLT is used to verify the credential without having to check with the issuer. In particular:</p>
 
 The verifier has to know who issued the credential based on an identifier and cryptographic signature. From the presentation, it gets an identifier for the issuer, looks it up on a DLT to get a public key associated with the issuer to verify the signature in the presentation. Thus, the identity of the issuer is known. 
 The verifier has to verify that the claims data has not been altered by verifying a cryptographic signature across the data. Based on an identifier for the type of credential, the verifier gets from a DLT a set of public keys and verifies the signatures. Thus, the verifier knows no one has tampered with the claims data. 
 The issuer periodically updates a revocation registry on a DLT indicating the credentials that have been revoked. If the holder’s credential is revoked, they are unable to create a proof of non-revocation (yes, that’s a double negative…). If the holder can generate that proof, the verifier can check it. Thus, the verifier knows the credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>The fourth attribute (the binding of the credential to the holder) in Indy is done using some privacy-preserving cryptographic magic (called a Zero Knowledge Proof) that prevents having a unique identifier for the holder or credential being given to the verifier. Thus, no PII is needed for sharing trusted data.</p>
<p>So why DLT? First, we can get the good parts of paper credentials—private transactions between holders and verifiers and no callback to the issuer. Second, the issuer gets a trusted, open and transparent way to publish the cryptographic material needed for those private holder-verifier transactions. Third, there is no need to have a “Trusted Third Party” participating in the interactions.</p>
<p>And did I mention, no private data goes on the DLT!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa are enabling this approach to “self-sovereign identity” in a big way,&nbsp; bringing about a new layer of trust on the Internet that will let us preserve our privacy and give us control over our identity and data—where it belongs. There is a lot to learn. If you’re curious, a great place to start is this <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-hyperledger-sovereign-identity-blockchain-solutions-indy-aries-and-ursa">Linux Foundation edX course</a>.</p>

 In this TechWorld video, Nana will talk about how to become a DevOps engineer. 
<p>Before summarizing the video, Let’s talk about what is a DevOps engineer?</p>
 What is a DevOps engineer? 
<p>DevOps Engineer works with developers and the IT staff to oversee the code releases. DevOps Engineers are responsible for supporting the users of the infrastructure they develop, and the first line of defense is protecting the cloud against hackers and viruses. They do this with code, of course, building secure software from the start.</p>
<p>Skill Set required to become a DevOps engineer</p>
 
 Programming knowledge. 
 Know what a system administrator knows. 
 Network and storage. 
 Infrastructure management and compliance. 
 Automation tools. 
 Virtualization and cloud. 
 Security. 
 Testing. 
 
 Video Summary 
<p>In this video of TechWorld with Nana, Nana will talk about how to become a DevOps engineer. She will also talk about what are the tasks and responsibilities of a DevOps engineer in 2021.</p>
<p>There are two main departments of DevOps namely development and operations. In development department applications are developed and tested and in operation department applications are deployed and servers are maintained.</p>
<p>At first the developer team will program an application with any technology stack different programming languages build tools etc and they will of course have a code repository to work on the code in a team.</p>
<p>They use infrastructure in premise servers or cloud servers to develop the application so that the user can have access to it. The main responsibility of DevOps engineer is to make a infrastructure to run the application. They need knowledge of linux and they have to be comfortable with interface commands.</p>
<p>Basics of networking and security configure is also important. To understand the difference between DevOps and IT Operations the engineer must understand and know the basics such as network, security and Sys Admins. A DevOps engineer must have knowledge about virtualizations and containers.</p>
<p>One of the most important container- technology is docker now-a-days. So, they must learn it. To release the new application version is the main task of DevOps engineers.</p>
<p>First of all, when the feature or bug fix is done, they need to run the tests and package the application. Then they will build docker image, after that they will deploy it to server. The next step is to packaging of apps then push to artifact repository.</p>
<p>The container has a pipe line which even resemble its logo. Now-a-days many companies are using virtual infrastructure rather than physical infrastructure to save cost. If a person has a lot more containers like in case of big microservices he or she need a more powerful container orchestration tool to do the job most popular of which is Kubernetes.</p>
<p>To automate the process of infrastructure as a code the engineer must be creating the infrastructure as well as configuring it to run your application and then deploying your application on that configured infrastructure can be done using a combination of two types of infrastructure as code tools infrastructure provisioning tool like terraform. To manage the code, the engineer must use version control just like application code.</p>
<p>To become a DevOps engineer a person needs to learn one tool in each category and that’s the most popular technique.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>Through technologies like the Blockchain and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), all aspects of how our currently paper-based economy works will be digitized, forming Scotland’s Digital Economy. 
<p>For example consider key documents like your passport, birth certificate and drivers licence. Most likely you have these in paper form, and for processes like opening a bank account, you must physically present these documents.</p>
<p>Digitizing these documents and the processes that call upon them are the building blocks for creating a digital economy.</p>
 Digital Recognition Networks 
<p>The idea of a ‘<a href="https://digitalscot.net/building-the-scottish-common-blockchain/">Common Blockchain</a>‘ is a single platform that enables multiple applications for multiple industries and use cases.</p>
<p>Similarly the core dynamic of SSI is one of multiple organizations sharing identity data, known as credentials, hence why a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/scottish-credential-ecosystem/">Scottish credential sharing network</a> is a key objective.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/10/25/building-shared-digital-identity/">his blog</a> Amit Jasuja explains the core mechanics of this and how multiple organizations can share digital identity services, an ecosystem of ‘relying’ and ‘issuing’ parties.</p>
<p>Another great way of describing this ecosystem is “Digital Recognition Networks” – The ecosystem will be formed through organizations establishing agreements to share data and recognize the digital credentials of partners they work with to fulfill these processes, like opening a bank account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cphrab.ca/how-use-recognition-networks-your-talent-strategy">Writing for the CPHR</a> Terrahub explains the principle through exploring an excellent use case of how this will take shape and the economic benefits it will bring: Education and Employment.</p>
<p>“In a recognition network, skills and credentials are represented by digital badges that organizations use for achievement and an employee can us for permanent external branding during or post-employment.</p>
<p>As brands move global and geographical boundaries dissolve, these recognition networks enable talent to shift and move without having to re-qualify their competency, eliminating frustration for the employee, and inefficiency for the employer by getting the right people to work fast.”</p>
<p>Education and Employment is a great scenario as the core components are easily understood: The credential – Your academic qualification in certificate form, and the recognition – How employers seek that qualification as a requirement for employment.</p>
 Transforming Education on the Blockchain 
<p>This also highlights the value of the Blockchain in this scenario. Via their Medium article UniversaBlockchain explore <a href="https://medium.com/universablockchain/blockchain-in-education-49ad413b9e12">Blockchain in Education</a>, highlighting key problems like the high rates of medical school diploma falsification.</p>
<p>So technology innovations like ‘<a href="https://www.blockcerts.org/">Blockcerts</a>‘ will address this, an open source blockchain project for enabling a Universal Verifier that will verify any Blockcert issued by any institution, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Countries like <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/good-clean-use-case-bahamian-students-graduate-on-the-blockchain">the Bahamas</a> are now issuing Blockchain-based academic certificates.</p>
<p>Digitary is one vendor specializing in this sector, offering a <a href="https://www.digitary.net/products/">suite of features</a>&nbsp;for managing academic credentials and digital badges, and has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitary.net/digitary-evernym-webinar/">teamed up with Evernym</a>&nbsp;to integrate these with Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aruccnationalnetwork.ca/news">this news</a> highlights one of the first customers to harness this capability is the Association of the Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC),&nbsp; choosing Digitary as the solution provider for the Made for Canada National Network.</p>
<p>This initiative means the Canadian higher education community is creating the very first online platform and national credential wallet for post-secondary learners. Once fully operational, the Network will enable 3 million learners across the country to access and share their official digitized post-secondary transcripts and credentials online – anytime, anywhere.</p>
 APPII 
<p>To examine the employment aspect we can highlight a Scottish startup: <a href="https://appii.io/">APPII</a>.</p>
<p>APPII harnesses the Blockchain to enable users to build a ‘<a href="https://appii.io/build-verified-cv-blockchain/">Verified CV</a>‘, a digital resume where your credentials have been validated with the issuing organization. A powerful example of a Digital Recognition Network.</p>
<p>Highlighting the potential of a common platform approach to enable multiple use case solutions, they’ve also applied their technology to offer Covid-19 verified ‘Digital Health Passports’.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>APPII, in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/Coforge_Tech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Coforge_Tech</a>, have developed a "Digitial Health Passport" that verifies Covid-19 testing and vaccinations. A very exciting initiative to be part of that will hopefully open up travel and business in the UK and overseas.<a href="https://t.co/diYLaBSvoE">https://t.co/diYLaBSvoE</a></p>
<p>— APPII (@appii_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/appii_io/status/1331280253348700163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This is my first newsletter as the new Executive Director for DINZ and the very first thing I’d like to do is thank Andrew Weaver, our outgoing ED, for his tremendous leadership throughout our establishment phase and to wish him all the very, very best on the next stage of his journey. Andrew has worked tirelessly over the last two and a half years to ensure we are working towards a world where people can safely express their identity to fully participate in the digital economy and society overall.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Good luck Andrew and all the best.

<p>The DIF Steering Committee has approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. Here is a snapshot of the four companies and four implementations that stretched and built the specification.</p> Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity <p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p> What exactly is a “Sidetree”? <p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains — but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF&nbsp;members.</p> The team that delivered the specification <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA,&nbsp;USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in&nbsp;DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON,&nbsp;Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX,&nbsp;USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New&nbsp;Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p> The first generation of Sidetree&nbsp;Systems <p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION&nbsp;nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION&nbsp;node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION&nbsp;network.   What’s next for&nbsp;Sidetree <p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given&nbsp;type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">Sidetree Protocol reaches V1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Canada’s trusted digital ID leader, the DIACC, welcomes Budget 2021 investments for digital transformation and Canadian innovation 



<p>TORONTO, APRIL 19, 2021 — Joni Brennan, President of the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) released a statement following <a href="https://www.budget.gc.ca/2021/report-rapport/toc-tdm-en.html">the tabling of the federal budget today</a>:</p>



<p>If the global pandemic has shown us anything, it’s that the need for reliable and secure data is paramount as businesses, governments and Canadians from Vancouver to Quebec City to Charlottetown and everywhere in between move online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From receiving emergency pandemic benefits to ensuring health records are correct and helping children and youth with online education, the pandemic has put a renewed spotlight on the need for governments to move with urgency to invest in digital infrastructure. In fact, it’s critical to ensuring Canadians receive the services they need and that businesses can participate fully and securely in the global digital economy.</p>



<p>At the core of this infrastructure is a secure digital identity which is essential to the function of daily life during a pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DIACC, Canada’s digital ID leader, is pleased to see the federal government’s recognition that our economic future depends on digital investments. Initiatives like the investment in the Known Traveller Digital Identity pilot project and the Canada Digital Adoption Program will help Canadians, businesses and governments on this path.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, at the core of a safe and secure digital environment is a safe and secure digital ID. Given the federal government’s priorities around a Digital Charter, the government lost an opportunity to highlight the important need for investments in digital ID. Investing in digital ID makes economic sense, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For SMEs, the impact of digital identity could be used to improve processes that are difficult today, resulting in a potential $4.5 billion of added value to SMEs and reinvestments in the Canadian economy.</p>



<p>Our digital future rests on getting digital ID right. We look forward to working with governments to meaningfully adopt a digital ID ecosystem, especially as we look toward post-pandemic economic recovery.</p>



<p>-30-</p>



<p>About Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ID ecosystem. The DIACC has 100 high profile members spanning several sectors from financial institutions, networks for payments and for identity verification, technology service providers, strategy and integration experts and federal and provincial governments. For 10 years the DIACC has built up this important sector as the trusted voice for driving the development of standards and a trust framework that will secure a fully digital Canada. With established global partnerships that will help Canada lead efforts in international digital interoperability and accreditation, the DIACC provides a world-leading forum to foster collaboration for developing and recommending harmonizing policies, standards, and regulatory changes with international benchmarks — innovative solutions to navigate the digital future.</p>

      <p>The structural properties of object capability systems favor modularity in code design and ensure reliable encapsulation in code implementation.</p>

      <p>These structural properties facilitate the analysis of some security properties of an object-capability program or operating system. Some of these – in particular, information flow properties – can be analyzed at the level of object references and connectivity, independent of any knowledge or analysis of the code that determines the behavior of the objects. As a consequence, these security properties can be established and maintained in the presence of new objects that contain unknown and possibly malicious code.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The capability model is, in a sense, the object model taken to its logical extreme. Where object programmers seek modularity – a decrease in the dependencies between separately thought-out units – capability programmers seek security, recognizing that required trust is a form of dependency. Object programmers wish to guard against bugs: a bug in module A should not propagate to module B. Capability programmers wish to guard against malice. However, if B is designed to be invulnerable to A’s malice, it is likely also invulnerable to A’s bugs.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data (ZCAP-LD for short) provides a secure way for linked data systems to grant and express authority utilizing the object capability model. Capabilities are represented as linked data objects which are signed with Linked Data Proofs. ZCAP-LD supports delegating authority to other entities on the network by chaining together capability documents. “Caveats” may be attached to capability documents which may be used to restrict the scope of their use, for example to restrict the actions which may be used or providing a mechanism by which the capability may be later revoked.</p>

      <p>Object capabilities (ocaps) are increasingly recognized as an important tool for achieving the goals of self-sovereign identity.

    <blockquote>
      <p>Considering different models for handling identity information allows reconciliation, and creates opportunities to address primary use cases across paradigms, increasing overall strength and security of a solution.<br>
[…]<br>
In the Object Capabilities model, authorization is managed by creating, sharing, attenuating, and using “capabilities” instead of, for example, access control lists. If you have a valid “capability”, you have the authorization. Like a car key, Object Capabilities may be used no matter who you are. This model shifts the burden of identification from error-prone correlations to directly work with individuals’ actual capabilities.</p>

      <p>Identity Hubs as currently proposed in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) are a subset of a general Decentralized Identifier (DID) based user-controlled agent, based on ACLs rather than an object-capabilities (ocap) architecture.  The current approach has both security and scalability issues. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint. This avoids creating confused-deputy security issues and expands scale by enabling the hub to delegate access to resources not stored in the hub itself.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Immunity credentials can allow those who are not COVID-positive to return to daily in-person routines, travel or going back to work, providing evidence that they are low-risk of transmitting the COVID-19 virus. This could be accomplished through a national digital identification system that monitors and tracks the health status of its citizens. The details of how digital immunity credentials would be implemented are still up in the air, but may include important features such as the ability to share results remotely, interoperability across systems, proof of authenticity and the potential for individuals to have full ownership over their health data.</p>

      <p>We are all painfully aware of the economic and social restrictions imparted on us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to reopen offices, restaurants, local private and public facilities — and most importantly, international borders — will likely require a flexible, interoperable, and ubiquitous system that preserves individual agency and privacy. The COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) focuses its efforts on supporting technology projects that work to meet these requirements through the utilization of W3C compliant ‘Verifiable Credentials (VCs)’, a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.</p>

      <p>When the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) was formed in April 2020, we were a self-organizing group of companies and individuals, held together by a few mailing lists and working groups, to explore how Verifiable Credentials (VCs), an open standard and an emerging technology, could be used for the public health crisis unfolding with COVID-19. Recognizing our limits early on as an informal group, we quickly pivoted from developing a solution together to supporting each other to build for their local contexts. Over the course of nine months, we have seen over 20 projects present their work to the CCI community and developed an MVP governance framework that can be adapted to specific COVID-19 use cases.</p>

      <p>Drummond Reed, Steering Committee Member, Trust-over-IP-Foundation, comments: “The vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world because it is the hallmark of authenticity for a legal entity of any kind. The family of digital credentials in the GLEIF vLEI Governance Framework can serve as a chain of trust for anyone needing to verify the legal identity of an organization or of a person legally acting on that organization’s behalf. The demand this will create for LEIs — and the impact it will have on adoption of self-sovereign identity — cannot be overestimated. It will be a sea change for digital trust infrastructure that will benefit every country, company, and citizen in the world.”</p>

<blockquote>“Before we start, I’d like to acknowledge that the decisions we make in this room today may have implications into the future and far beyond the lifetime of this project, team or organisation. We make those decisions with that in mind.”- The Long Time&nbsp;Project</blockquote>Image by Carol Gaessler — shared under Creative Commons-Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a>).<p>This is the first public ‘writing out loud’ of my dual fellowship with the<a href="https://medium.com/u/188295c21f1c"> Berkman Klein Center</a> and the Carr Centre for Human Rights, both at<a href="https://medium.com/u/cb35da43ade5"> Harvard University</a>. In the spirit of a true exploration, rather than starting from a point of ‘expertise’ and homogeneity, I offer this as an emergent thought process, and to invite in participation. I must also point out that though this blog is written through the lens of my journey, my learning isn’t mine alone — it is greatly informed by so many people, disciplines and research and I am grateful to the countless people that have gracefully shared their knowledge and wisdom so that we might collectively grow together.</p><blockquote>“Who and what gets fixed in place to enable progress? What social groups are classified, corralled, coerced and capitalized upon so others are free to tinker, experiment and engineer the future?” Ruha&nbsp;Benjamin</blockquote><p>I started off my exploration with this hypothesis: Can humanitarian digital policy be decolonized?</p><p>I started with this, as I’ve often argued that the humanitarian aid system perpetuates hierarchical, patriarchal, hegemonic views of what ‘development’ and ‘progress’ looks like, ignoring other world-views, and underlying systemic and structural pillars of inequality and bias. As the humanitarian aid system increasingly intersects with technology systems developed in the context of Western capitalism and in small pockets of privileged power, I have not been alone in raising concerns on the implications of collision of two systems that are fundamentally patriarchal and hegemonic on those that are minoritized in the Global&nbsp;South.</p><p>To put in context, the range of digital or technology systems that humanitarian actors engage with is incredibly wide. This can range from (as a snapshot):</p>  Systems used to support the coordination of aid efforts — for example, biometric digital identities with refugee assistance programs or earth observing technology in disaster&nbsp;relief  Digital platforms or digital transformation with partners — for example, e-government services that link social protection and citizen&nbsp;welfare  Technology innovations to support affected populations access to aid — for example, ICTs, apps, digital ledgers, hardware and many&nbsp;others  <p>Even what we constitute as ‘humanitarian’ has shades of grey — whether it’s at the pointy end of a crisis, to support during peacetime. The wide array of aid provision does not easily exist within the carefully designed terminology found in textbooks and political resolutions.</p><p>Additionally, who works on technology or digital innovations within humanitarian institutions is wildly divergent — mostly within institutions innovation labs, or within digital or thematic teams — then deployed to the global south for implementation or testing (the notion of testing on vulnerable groups is already contentious and has its own set of critiques).</p><p>The diversity of use cases, contexts, stakeholders and owners does have one common thread however. As humanitarian organisations do not tend to traditionally have the requisite digital or technology expertise in-house, they partner externally to achieve their aims. And this is the sticking point — it easily falls into expertise and partnerships that predominantly come from small communities of public-private, technology partners, and academic institutions from the global north. What this does (whether implicitly or unconsciously) is to reinforce a dominant, hegemonic narrative that&nbsp;assumes:</p>  The experiences of global civil society and its actors, is homogeneous  The singular ‘Silicon Valley’ values that underpin such digital policies are the ones that all people aspire to, regardless of where they live or their cultural, societal, economic, geographic bearings  Power dynamics will continue to be affirmed in the hands of those that currently hold it without considering the cascading impacts of those policy decisions on those that are most going to be affected by&nbsp;it  <p>The appropriateness and impacts of digital technologies and AI within aid systems is still being discovered and understood. An incredible amount of work has gone into establishing data governance guidance and data protection protocols but not as much into broader policy governing the deployment and use of these technologies sector wide. Often they are siloed into communities or thematic areas of work, or perhaps resulting in codes of conduct — but not systematically looking at a sector wide approach that interrogates whether the use of these technologies paradoxically expose, mitigate or expand harm on often marginalised, minoritised constituents AND whether the digital futures we are chasing merely replicate or reinforce existing or past inequalities?.</p><blockquote>“..the relationship between tech industries and those populations who are outside their ambit of power — women, populations in the Global South, including black, Indigenous and Latinx communities in North America, immigrants in Europe — is a colonial one” Sareetyta Amrute, Data and&nbsp;Society</blockquote><p>So, could humanitarian actors play a more intentional role in designing just and equitable digital futures? Could we in fact, unshackle ourselves from our neo-colonial humanitarian mental models, and push back against the hierarchies of techno-chauvinism and meritocracy? Could we use this moment in time to design worlds that don’t imagine some figures, especially populations in the Global South — to merely be passive beneficiaries and outside of the borders of expertise we seek? Could we invert the pathways of tech colonialism in the aid&nbsp;sector?</p><p>As I started my exploration, I realised that my original hypothesis needed more rigour. There were tensions inherent in my original starting point. Firstly, what in fact constitutes digital policy? For whom? For what purpose? What influence does policy have in fact over systems? Different actors have their own policy making instruments — that are incumbent on different leverage points that service multiple agendas. Considering the multiplicity of use cases, actors, and contexts — what I was softly heading to was the governance of the deployment and use of digital systems and technologies within the aid sector. Notwithstanding the work in data governance and data protection in aid, there are still gaps in governance in terms of how and when we deploy tech innovation, the digital systems we are creating and supporting to create, supply chains that we are a part of, due diligence processes, accountability and risk ownership, and many other elements. In addition to this, are questions of immunity (traditionally, humanitarian organisations do not go beyond the individual institutional governance mechanisms, that often are bordered by the institution’s immunity); and appropriateness of the technology innovations we&nbsp;deploy.</p><p>How then do we design digital governance systems that speak to these complex, intertwined issues? Instead of merely looking at digital governance in terms of control, could weaving in feminist and decolonial approaches help us liberate our digital futures so that it is a space of safety, of humanity — for those whom we are meant to support? Are these approaches ways in which we can design new forms of digital humanism?</p><blockquote>“We could build systems for durability, but instead some dipshits told you we needed to move fast and break things” Audrey&nbsp;Watters</blockquote><p>Could a digital governance approach consider questions like the following:</p>  How then do we go beyond what we are merely legally required to do versus what is right to do? And importantly, are humanitarian actors willing to go beyond their immunity?  How do we extend digital governance to go beyond the fortresses of individual institutions to a multi-actor, sector wide approach that is emergent and iterative?  Can and should governance systems help users realize and/or amplify their rights and in fact use it as a way to hold humanitarian actors to&nbsp;account?  How might governance systems actually flatten power in decision&nbsp;making  Can governance systems help us monitor our accountability to our promises to affected populations?  Who has the power to draw the conclusions from assessments done?  Just because we *can* deploy a specific asset or tech, *should*&nbsp;we?  How do we increase percentage of risk/harm that gets absolved by humanitarian institutions rather than that risk/harm being pushed further down the chain to affected populations?  How might we incentivise governance systems to do the right&nbsp;thing?  <p>Digital technologies and AI mask ideologies of power, and are wed to a market ideology of dominance. To intentionally carve a different type of ideology would require governance systems that are informed by different knowledge sources into decision making. That prioritise those that are most impacted by or are on the receiving end of that initiative, rather than cantering donor or aid institutions privileges. Good digital governance in the vein that this research is pursuing then, must disrupt the idea of ‘solutionism’, must also critique the systems in which that technology is being deployed and the impacts of that deployment — now and into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>And this is when my hypothesis started to fork out. Where I originally thought to use elements of futures methodologies to analyse future states and imaginaries of what we might collectively desire, I realised this was not enough for the rigour of what is needed to be achieved. What I have learned in my practice of strategic foresight within systems and institutional transformation is that the facilitation of the method does not automatically result in a change in policy and/or strategic decision making. And that is because the application of insights isn’t weaved into and within how change actually occurs. Often in humanitarian/development work, we are fire-fighting the now — the problem right in front of us. We design solutions and interventions aimed to problem solving what is immediately in front of us without necessarily assessing three&nbsp;things:</p>  The complexity of the system in which that issue&nbsp;lives  Just as rights are not static, neither is harm. What is the current and future theory of harm that might arise out of that solution/intervention  What might be the impact of the solution/intervention on future generations and on our&nbsp;planet  Who holds the fiduciary duty to future digital selves of affected populations?  <p>I now radically pursue the idea of foresight within ethics systems to inform governance. Can we consider the ethics of intervention through the lens of constraining future good and mitigating future bad? Might this in fact be where it can add rigour and&nbsp;value?</p><blockquote>“Our radical imagination is a tool for decolonization, for reclaiming our right to shape our lived reality.” ― Adrienne Maree&nbsp;Brown</blockquote><p>Lastly, I realised that my focus on decolonisation was somewhat, and honestly — skewed.</p><p>Decolonisation is the process of undoing and giving up social and economic power, and restoring what has been taken away in the past, which arguably includes reparations. As Eve Tuck and Wayne Yang argue — decolonisation is also not a metaphor for diversity and inclusion nor is it a replacement for social justice efforts. Would the efforts of humanitarian aid ever include reparations? Could we ethically profess to even do so? We often argue that for the humanitarian system to change, it would involve giving up the status quo that we have a strangle-hold on. However, could this ever be achieved through the result of this one approach/framework? Am I being authentic, am I being honest if I were to declare it so? The answer was&nbsp;no.</p><p>What I was unpacking in actuality, was the notion of decoloniality — an aspiration to restore, renew, elevate, rediscover, acknowledge and validate the multiplicity of lives, lived-experiences, culture and knowledge of indigenous people, people of colour, and colonised people as well as to decenter hetere/cis-normativity, gender hierarchies and racial privilege. I think of this as how do we exist in plurality — in a multiverse so to speak. And to include this in governance, not as a tokenistic or virtue-signalling flag, but rather to help us consider different lenses, perspectives, sources of truth in even how we think about what is right, what is fair and what is just. How might decolonial and feminist approaches help us reframe our starting points and in fact influence governance design? This isn’t about just getting different under-represented groups around the table, but rather how might we shift the knowledge and experiences we draw from in the very design and decision making of policy and governance frames. It is to ensure that we are considering the multiplicity of ways in which issues of rights, privacy and agency are understood and experienced the world over, and not imposing just one or a narrow valued judgement on these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Through applying a decolonial lens to governance, might we in fact be able to intentionally design for equity rather than for privilege?</p><blockquote>“Decolonisation, expressed by your lips, differs from the decolonisation that comes from within, as a revolutionary concept that speaks about rehumanization — a fundamental planetary project” — Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni</blockquote><p>Thus, I am gently landing on Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance. An emergent process that is grounded in the following hypothesis: How do we not lock people into future harm, indebtedness or future inequity? It seeks to help start answering the questions unearthed through the journey thus far. Importantly, its primacy is to shift the focus of current humanitarian digital efforts that prioritise the problem solving of now, to one that aims to mitigate future harm and inequity. It aims at not binding nor narrowing the governance actions of humanitarian actors to merely their institutional legal liabilities and privileges but rather allows self-regulation for a shared responsibility for our collective futures across all actors and constituents in the aid&nbsp;sector.</p><p>The Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance is a framework that&nbsp;is:</p>  Multi-Dimensional (intentionally includes plurality of perspectives affected populations, minoritized groups, humanitarian and tech governance actors, activists, and ethicists)  Rigorously analyses future harms and impacts on future generations  Interrogates who absorbs future&nbsp;harm  Grounded in the rights and equity of impacted minoritized people  Is emergent and acts as a compass (not a checkbox)  <p>I see it visualised in three&nbsp;weaves:</p><p>And how we might judge this? Though not complete, perhaps some questions we might weave into that could&nbsp;include:</p><p>1. For the improvements it makes relative to what is&nbsp;replaced</p><p>2. For its understanding and active management of unintended consequences</p><p>3. For its mitigation and absorption of current and future&nbsp;harm</p><p>4. For its ability to cultivate an evolved awareness of rights, accountability and collective humanity</p><p>And that is where I am up to. This is a journey that isn’t complete by any measure. In fact, this framework must never be complete. It must never be static. The complexities we are dealing with are continuously evolving, and our commons have irrevocably shifted. We must unpack decades of mental models and behaviours as the range of choices about the type of futures we want to inhabit — has expanded exponentially, and the choices we make now will decide our collective fates.</p><p>To design more flourishing and liberated futures for all, we must uncover the plurality that is available to all of us, to frame how we see the&nbsp;world.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/decolonial-humanitarian-digital-governance-48b35b05b110">Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Between Games and Apocalyptic Robots: Considering Near-Term Social Risks of Reinforcement Learning  An increasingly popular branch of Machine Learning challenges current approaches to algorithmic governance. <p>With many of us stuck at home this past year, we’ve seen a surge in the popularity of video games. That trend hasn’t been limited to humans. DeepMind and Google AI both released results from their Atari playing AIs, which have taught themselves to play over fifty Atari games from scratch, with no provided rules or guidelines. The unique thing about these new results is how general the AI agent is. While previous efforts have achieved human performance on the games they were trained to play, DeepMind’s new AI Agent, MuZero could teach itself to beat humans at Atari games it had never encountered in under a day. If this reminds you of AlphaZero which taught itself to play Go then Chess well enough to outperform world champions, that’s because it demonstrates an advance in the same suite of algorithms, a class of machine learning called Reinforcement Learning&nbsp;(RL).</p><p>While traditional machine learning parses out its model of the world (typically a small world pertaining only to the problem it’s designed to solve) from swathes of data, RL is real-time observation based. This means RL learns its model primarily through trial and error interactions with its environment, not by pulling out correlations from data representing a historical snapshot of it. In the RL framework, each interaction with the environment is an opportunity to build towards an overarching goal, referred to as a reward. An RL agent is trained to make a sequence of decisions on how to interact with its environment that will ultimately maximize its reward (i.e. help it win the&nbsp;game).</p><p>This unique iterative learning paradigm allows the AI model to change and adapt to its environment, making RL an attractive solution for open-ended, real-world problem-solving. It also makes it a leading candidate for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and has some researchers concerned about the rise of truly autonomous AI that does not align with human values. Nick Bostrom first posed what is now the canonical example of this risk among AI Safety researchers — a paperclip robot with one goal: optimize the production efficiency of paperclips. With no other specifications, the agent quickly drifts from optimizing its own paperclip factory to commandeering food production supply chains for the paperclip making cause. It proceeds to place paperclips above all other human needs until all that’s left of the world is a barren wasteland covered end to end with unused paper clips. The takeaway? Extremely literal problem solving combined with inaccurate problem definition can lead to bad outcomes.</p><p>This rogue AGI (albeit in more high-stakes incarnations like weapons management) is the type of harm usually thought of when trying to make RL safe in the context of society. However, between an autonomous agent teaching itself games in the virtual world and an intelligent but misguided AI putting humanity in existential risk lay a multitude of sociotechnical concerns. As RL is being rolled out in domains ranging from social media to medicine and education, it’s time we seriously think about these near-term risks.</p><p>How the paperclip problem will play out in the near term is likely to be rather subtle. For example, medical treatment protocols are currently popular candidates for RL modeling; they involve a series of decisions (which treatment options to try) with uncertain outcomes (different options work better for different people) that all connect to the eventual outcome (patient health). One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lIr8rgo5zE&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks">such study</a> tried to identify the best treatment decisions to avoid sepsis in ICU patients based off of multitudes of data, including medical histories, clinical charts and doctor’s notes. Their first iteration was an astounding success. With very high accuracy, it identified treatment paths that resulted in patient death. However, upon further examination and consultation with clinicians it turned out that though the agent had been allowed to learn from a plethora of potentially relevant treatment considerations, it had latched onto only one main indicator for death — whether or not a chaplain was called. The goal of the system was to flag treatment paths that led to deaths, and in a very literal sense that’s what it did. Clinicians only called a chaplain when a patient presented as close to&nbsp;death.</p><p>You’ll notice that in this example, the incredibly literal yet unhelpful solution the RL agent was taking was discovered by the researchers. This is no accident. The field of modern medicine is built around the reality that connections between treatment and outcomes typically have no known causal explanations. Aspirin, for example, was used as an anti-inflammatory for over seventy years before we had any insight into why it worked. This lack of causal understanding is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">intellectual debt</a>; if we can’t describe why something works, we may not be able to predict when or how it will fail. Medicine has grown around this fundamental uncertainty. Through strict codes of ethics, industry standards, and regulatory infrastructure (i.e. clinical trials), the field has developed the scaffolding to minimize the accompanying harms. RL systems aiming to help with diagnosis and treatment have to develop within this infrastructure. Compliance with the machinery medicine has around intellectual debt is more likely to result in slow and steady progress, without colossal misalignment. This same level of oversight does not apply to fields like social media, the potential harms of which are hard to pin down and which have virtually no regulatory scaffolding in&nbsp;place.</p><p>We may have already experienced some of the early harms of RL based algorithms in complex domains. In 2018 YouTube engineers released a paper describing an RL addition to their recommendation algorithm that increased daily watch time by 6 million hours in the beta testing phase. Meanwhile, anecdotal accounts of radicalization through YouTube rabbit holes of increasingly conspiratorial content (e.g., NYTimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html">reporting</a> on YouTube’s role in empowering Brazil’s far right) were on the rise. While it is impossible to know exactly which algorithms powered the platform’s recommendations at the time, this rabbit hole effect would be a natural result of an RL algorithm trying to maximize view time by nudging users towards increasingly addictive content.</p><p>In the near future, dynamic manipulation of this sort may end up at odds with established protections under the law. For example, Facebook has recently been put under scrutiny by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18286660/facebook-hud-housing-discrimination-case-section-230-legal-defense">discriminatory housing advertisements</a>. The HUD suit alleges that even without explicit targeting filters that amount to the exclusion of protected groups, its algorithms are likely to hide ads from ‘users whom the system determines are unlikely to engage with the ad, even if the advertiser explicitly wants to reach those users.’ Given the types of (non-RL) ML algorithms FB currently uses in advertising, proving this disparate impact would be a matter of examining the data and features used to train the algorithm. While the current lack of transparency makes this challenging, it is fundamentally possible to roll out benchmarks capable of flagging such discrimination.</p><p>If advertising were instead powered by RL, benchmarks would not be enough. An RL advertising algorithm tasked with ensuring it does not discriminate against protected classes, could easily end up making it look as though it were not discriminating instead. If the RL agent were optimized for profit and the practice of discrimination was profitable, the RL agent would be incentivized to find loopholes under which it could circumvent protections. Just like in the sepsis treatment case, the system is likely to find a shortcut towards reaching its objective, only in this case the lack of regulatory scaffolding makes it unlikely this failure will be picked up. The propensity of RL to adapt to meet metrics, while skirting over intent, will make it challenging to tag such undesirable behavior. This situation is further complicated by our heavy reliance on ‘data’ as a means to flag potential bias in ML&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Unlike RL, traditional machine learning is innately static; it takes in loads of data, parses it for correlations, and outputs a model. Once a system has been trained, updating it to accommodate a new environment or changes to the status quo requires repeating most or all of that initial training with updated data. Even for firms that have the computing power to make such retraining seamless, the reliance on data has allowed an ‘in’ for transparency. The saying goes, machine learning is like money laundering for bias. If an ML system is trained using biased or unrepresentative data, its model of the world will reflect that. In traditional machine learning, we can at least follow the marked bills and point out when an ML system is going to be prone to discrimination by examining its training data. We may even be able to preprocess the data before training the system in an attempt to preemptively correct for&nbsp;bias.</p><p>Since RL is generally real-time observation-based rather than training data-based, this ‘follow-the-data’ approach to algorithmic oversight does not apply. There is no controlled input data to help us anticipate or correct for where an RL system can go wrong before we set it loose in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In certain domains, this lack of data-born insight may not be too problematic. The more we can specify what the moving parts of a given application are and the ways in which they may fail–be it through an understanding of the domain or regulatory scaffolding–the safer it is for us to use RL. DeepMind’s use of RL to lower the energy costs of its computing centers, a process ultimately governed by the laws of physics, deserves less scrutiny than the RL based K-12 curriculum generator Google’s Ed Chi views as a near-term goal of the field. The harder it is to describe what success looks like within a given domain, the more prone to bad outcomes it is. This is true of all ML systems, but even more crucial for RL systems that cannot be meaningfully validated ahead of use. As regulators, we need to think about which domains need more regulatory scaffolding to minimize the fallout from our intellectual debt, while allowing for the immense promise of algorithms that can learn from their mistakes.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/between-games-and-apocalyptic-robots-considering-near-term-societal-risks-of-reinforcement-35ec5af8f04a">Between Games and Apocalyptic Robots: Considering Near-Term Societal Risks of Reinforcement…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Hyperledger Ursa is a shared cryptographic library, it enables implementations to avoid duplicating other cryptographic work and hopefully increase security in the process. The library is an opt-in repository (for Hyperledger and non Hyperledger projects) to place and use crypto. Hyperledger Ursa consists of sub-projects, which are cohesive implementations of cryptographic code or interfaces to cry

 Manifesto 
<p><a href="https://id2020.org/manifesto">The Alliance Manifesto</a></p>
 
   The ability to prove one’s identity is a fundamental and universal human right. 
   We live in a digital era. Individuals need a trusted, verifiable way to prove who they are, both in the physical world and online. 
   Over 1 billion people worldwide are unable to prove their identity through any recognized means. As such, they are without the protection of law, and are unable to access basic services, participate as a citizen or voter, or transact in the modern economy. Most of those affected are children and adolescents, and many are refugees, forcibly displaced, or stateless persons. 
   For some, including refugees, the stateless, and other marginalized groups, reliance on national identification systems isn’t possible. This may be due to exclusion, inaccessibility, or risk, or because the credentials they do hold are not broadly recognized. While we support efforts to expand access to national identity programs, we believe it is imperative to complement such efforts by providing an alternative to individuals lacking safe and reliable access to state-based systems. 
   We believe that individuals must have control over their own digital identities, including how personal data is collected, used, and shared. Everyone should be able to assert their identity across institutional and national borders, and across time. Privacy, portability, and persistence are necessary for digital identity to meaningfully empower and protect individuals. 
   Digital identity carries significant risk if not thoughtfully designed and carefully implemented. We do not underestimate the risks of data misuse and abuse, particularly when digital identity systems are designed as large, centralized databases. 
   Technical design can mitigate some of the risks of digital identity. Emerging technology — for example, cryptographically secure, decentralized systems — could provide greater privacy protection for users, while also allowing for portability and verifiability. But widespread agreement on principles, technical design patterns, and interoperability standards is needed for decentralized digital identities to be trusted and recognized. 
   This “better” model of digital identity will not emerge spontaneously. In order for digital identities to be broadly trusted and recognized, we need sustained and transparent collaboration aligned around these shared principles, along with supporting regulatory and policy frameworks. 
   ID2020 Alliance partners jointly define functional requirements, influencing the course of technical innovation and providing a route to technical interoperability, and therefore trust and recognition. 
   The ID2020 Alliance recognizes that taking these ideas to scale requires a robust evidence base, which will inform advocacy and policy. As such, ID2020 Alliance-supported pilots are designed around a common monitoring and evaluation framework.

<p>NOTE: This article was updated to align to the&nbsp;FAPI 1.0 Final version&nbsp;which was published in March, 2021.</p>
 Introduction 
<p>Financial-grade API&nbsp;(FAPI) is a technical specification that&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">Financial-grade API Working Group</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>&nbsp;has developed. It uses&nbsp;OAuth 2.0&nbsp;and&nbsp;OpenID Connect&nbsp;(OIDC) as its base and defines additional technical requirements for the financial industry and other industries that require higher API security.</p>

 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 OpenID Foundation Working Groups and Financial-grade API Stack
 History 
<p>Implementer’s Draft 1&nbsp;— The initial version of the FAPI specification was published in 2017. The version is called Implementer’s Draft 1 (ID1).</p>
<p>Implementer’s&nbsp;Draft 2&nbsp;— The second version was published in October, 2018. The version is called Implementer’s Draft 2 (ID2). In this version, the FAPI specification was renamed from “Financial API” to “Financial-grade API” for wider adoption across various industries.</p>
<p>Final Version&nbsp;— The final version was published in March, 2021. In this version, the main two parts of the FAPI sepecification, “Part 1: Read-Only Security Profile” and “Part 2: Read and Write API Security Profile”, were renamed to “Part 1: Baseline Security Profile” and “Part 2: Advanced Security Profile”, respectively.</p>
<p>FAPI 2.0&nbsp;— The FAPI WG has started to discuss the next version of the FAPI specification, which is called “FAPI 2.0”. The&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>&nbsp;published on March 31, 2021 (<a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/31/picking-up-speed-on-the-fapi-roadmap-from-the-fapi-rw-implementers-draft-2-to-fapi-1-0-advanced-final/">announcement</a>) mentions FAPI 2.0. Authlete is mentioned in the answer to the question “Are there FAPI 2.0 implementations?” because Authlete has already implemented new technical components of FAPI 2.0 such as&nbsp;PAR&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>),&nbsp;RAR&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>) and&nbsp;DPoP&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop/">OAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer</a>).</p>

 Prior Knowledge 
 Basic Specifications 
<p>The format of the FAPI specification is a terse list of technical requirements, so the document is not long. In exchange, a lot of prior knowledge is required to read it smoothly. Especially, you have to learn&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>&nbsp;(the core of OAuth 2.0) and&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>&nbsp;(the core of OpenID Connect) by heart.</p>
<p>In addition, because specifications related to JWT (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515">JWS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516">JWE</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JWK</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">JWA</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>) are prior knowledge to understand OIDC Core, they are of course prior knowledge to read the FAPI specification. Therefore, you need to understand them perfectly.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWS Compact Serialization (RFC 7515 Section 7.1)
<p>Furthermore,&nbsp;PKCE&nbsp;(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">RFC 7636</a>) which was published in September, 2015 is now regarded as a part of the basic set of OAuth 2.0 specifications as well as RFC 6749 and RFC 6750.</p>
<p>The following is a list of specifications that you should read at least once before the FAPI specification.</p>
 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>&nbsp;— The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework

 Mutual TLS 
<p>In general, “Mutual TLS” means that a client is also required to present its X.509 certificate in a TLS connection. However, in the context of FAPI, Mutual TLS means the following two which are defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>” (MTLS).</p>
 
 OAuth client authentication using a client certificate 
 Tokens bound to a client certificate 
 
 OAuth Client Authentication using a Client Certificate 
<p>When a&nbsp;confidential client&nbsp;(RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">2. Client Types</a>) accesses a token endpoint (RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2">3.2. Token Endpoint</a>),&nbsp;client authentication&nbsp;(RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3">2.3. Client Authentication</a>) is required. Client authentication is a process where a client application proves it has its confidential authentication information.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication at Token Endpoint
<p>There are several ways for client authentication. The following are client authentication methods listed in OIDC Core,&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication">9. Client Authentication</a>&nbsp;(except&nbsp;<code>none</code>).</p>
 
 <code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;— Basic Authentication using a pair of client ID and client secret 
 <code>client_secret_post</code>&nbsp;— Embedding a pair of client ID and client secret in a request body 
 <code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;— Passing a JWT signed by a key based on a client secret with a symmetric algorithm 
 <code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;— Passing a JWT signed by a private key with an asymmetric algorithm 
 
<p>In&nbsp;<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code>, a client application directly shows the server its client secret to prove that it has the confidential information.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Client Authentication using Basic Authentication
<p>In&nbsp;<code>client_secret_jwt</code>, a client application indirectly proves that it has the client secret by signing a JWT with the client secret and passing the JWT to the server. On the other hand, in&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>, signing is performed with an asymmetric private key and the server verifies the signature with the public key corresponding to the private key.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Client Authentication using JWT
<p>Apart from the above, “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-for-oauth-client">2. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>&nbsp;introduces new client authentication methods below.</p>
 
 <code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;— Utilizing a PKI client certificate used in a TLS connection 
 <code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;— Utilizing a self-signed client certificate used in a TLS connection 
 
<p>These two utilize the client certificate used in a TLS connection between the client and the token endpoint for client authentication.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Certificate for Client Authentication
<p>In&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>, the PKI client certificate used in a TLS connection established between a client and a server is used for client authentication. The server verifies the client certificate (this should be done even in a context irrelevant to OAuth) and then checks whether the Subject Distinguished Name or Subject Alternative Name matches the pre-registered one. For this process, client applications that want to use&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;for client authentication must register Subject Distinguished Name or Subject Alternative Name into the server in advance. The specification newly defines the following client metadata for this purpose (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-client-registration-metadata">2.1.2 Client Registration Metadata</a>).</p>
 
 <code>tls_client_auth_subject_dn</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_dns</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_uri</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_ip</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_email</code> 
 
<p>In&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>, a self-signed client certificate is used instead of a PKI client certificate. To use this client authentication method, client applications have to register a self-signed client certificate into the server in advance.</p>
<p>The following table is the list of client authentication methods mentioned in the FAPI specification.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods

 X.509 Certificate in PEM Format
 Certificate-Bound Tokens 
<p>Once a traditional access token is leaked, an attacker can access APIs with the access token. Traditional access tokens are just like a train ticket which anyone can use once it is stolen.</p>
<p>An idea to mitigate this vulnerability is to check whether the API caller bringing an access token matches the legitimate holder of the access token when an API call is made. This is just like the boarding procedure for international flights where passengers are required to show not only a plane ticket but also their passport.</p>
<p>This idea is called “Proof of Possession” (PoP) and FAPI lists “Mutual TLS” as an only possible option of PoP ( — in the previous versions (ID1 &amp; ID2), “Token Binding” was mentioned as a PoP mechanim but it was dropped by the final version). In this context, “Mutual TLS” means the specification defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica">3. Mutual-TLS Client Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>.</p>
<p>Because Mutual TLS has several meanings as explained above and I actually experienced a problematic conversation like below,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: The API management solution of your company does not support Mutual TLS (as a PoP mechanism).<br>
The company: Not correct. Our solution supports Mutual TLS (because it can be configured to request a client certificate for TLS communication).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve personally decided to call Mutual TLS as a PoP mechanism “Certificate Binding”. This naming is not so bad (at least for me) because it sounds symmetrical to Token Binding and because actual implementations will eventually become just binding a certificate to an access token and won’t care whether the certificate has been extracted from a mutual TLS connection or has come from somewhere else.</p>
<p>In an implementation of Certificate Binding, when the token endpoint of an authorization server issues an access token, it calculates the hash value of the client certificate presented by the client application in the TLS connection and remembers the binding between the access token and the hash value (or embeds the hash value into the access token if the implementation of the access token is a self-contained JWT). When the client application accesses an API of the target resource server, it uses the same client certificate that was previously used in the communication with the token endpoint. The implementation of the API extracts an access token and a client certificate from the request, calculates the hash value of the client certificate and checks the hash value matches the one that is associated with the access token. If they match, the API implementation accepts the request. If not, it rejects the request.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Certificate Binding
<p>It is relatively easy to implement Certificate Binding because it can be implemented only if the client certificate is accessible. On the other hand, Token Binding is relatively hard because it is necessary to modify multiple layers such as TLS layer and HTTP layer. In addition, the future is uncertain as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5097603234529280">Chrome has removed the Token Binding feature</a>&nbsp;although the community strongly tried to urge Chrome team to rethink it (“<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/OkdLUyYmY1E">Intent to Remove: Token Binding</a>”). However, anyway, related specifications were promoted to RFCs at the beginning of October, 2018.</p>
 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8471">RFC 8471&nbsp;</a>— The Token Binding Protocol Version 1.0 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8472">RFC 8472</a>&nbsp;— Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extension for Token Binding Protocol Negotiation 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8473">RFC 8473</a>&nbsp;— Token Binding over HTTP 
 
<p>“<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-token-binding/?include_text=1">OAuth 2.0 Token Binding</a>” (its status is “expired”) is a specification that defines rules to apply Token Binding to OAuth 2.0 tokens based on the specifications listed above.</p>
<p>NOTE: The final version of the FAPI specification dropped Token Binding due to its unlikeliness of future availability.</p>
 JARM 
<p>JARM&nbsp;is a new specification which was approved at the same timing with FAPI Implementer’s Draft 2. JARM is referred to in FAPI Part 2.</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-jarm-ID1.html">Financial-grade API: JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM)</a> 
 
<p>The specification defines new values for the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter as shown below.</p>
 
 <code>query.jwt</code> 
 <code>fragment.jwt</code> 
 <code>form_post.jwt</code> 
 <code>jwt</code> 
 
<p>If one of the above is specified, response parameters of an authorization response are packed into a JWT and the JWT is returned as the value of a single&nbsp;<code>response</code>&nbsp;response parameter.</p>
<p>For example, a traditional authorization response in the authorization code flow looks like below.&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;response parameters are included separately.</p>
 HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.com/callback?code={CODE}&amp;state={STATE} 
<p>On the other hand, if&nbsp;<code>response_mode=query.jwt</code>&nbsp;is added to an authorization request, the authorization response will become like below.</p>
 HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.com/callback?response={JWT} 

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 JARM example
<p>Because the JWT is signed by a key of the server, a client can confirm that the response has not been tampered by verifying the signature of the JWT.</p>
<p>Client Metadata for JARM</p>
<p>Before using JARM, client applications have to set a value to the&nbsp;<code>authorization_signed_response_alg</code>&nbsp;metadata in advance. The metadata represents an algorithm for signature of response JWTs. If the value of the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter is&nbsp;<code>*.jwt</code>&nbsp;although the metadata is not set, the authorization request fails because the specification requires response JWTs be always signed.</p>
<p>To encrypt response JWTs, algorithms have to be set in advance to the&nbsp;<code>authorization_encrypted_response_alg</code>&nbsp;metadata and the&nbsp;<code>authorization_encrypted_response_enc</code>&nbsp;metadata. To use an asymmetric algorithm, configuration about client’s public key is necessary, too.</p>
<p>The screenshot below is client-side settings for JARM in Authlete’s web console that is provided for client management.</p>

 Part 1: Baseline 
<p>As introduction of prior knowledge was done, let’s start the main part of this article. To begin with, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html">Part 1</a>” which defines baseline security profile.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Authorization Server 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization server</a>” in “Part 1” lists requirements for authorization server. Let’s take a look one by one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 1.</p>
<p>shall support confidential clients;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 2.</p>
<p>should support public clients;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of “confidential clients” and “public clients” is described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">2.1. Client Types</a>” of RFC 6749. I don’t explain the difference between the client types here as it is prior knowledge for those who read the FAPI specification. However, the relationship between client types and OAuth 2.0 flows is often misunderstood even by those who are familiar with OAuth 2.0. It is only the combination of a “public client” and “client credentials flow” that RFC 6749 explicitly prohibits. Other combinations are allowed. Without this understanding, you would misread the FAPI specification.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Combinations of Flow and Client Type (RFC 6749)
<p>Just FYI. It is confidential clients only that are allowed to make backchannel authentication requests which are defined in CIBA.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Combinations of Flow and Client Type (CIBA)
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 3.</p>
<p>shall provide a client secret that adheres to the requirements in section 16.19 of OIDC if a symmetric key is used;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC Core states that a value calculated based on a client secret must be used as the shared key when a symmetric algorithm is used for signing and encryption. If the entropy of the client secret is lower than the one required by the algorithm, the strength of the algorithm is weakened. Therefore, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SymmetricKeyEntropy">16.19. Symmetric Key Entropy</a>” requires that client secrets have entropy strong enough for used algorithms. For example, when&nbsp;<code>HS256</code>&nbsp;(HMAC using SHA-256) is used for signing algorithm of ID tokens, client secrets must have 256-bit entropy at minimum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 4.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the confidential client using one of the following methods:</p>
<p>1. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication as specified in section 2 of MTLS;</p>
<p>2.<code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that&nbsp;<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code> defined in RFC 6749 are not allowed as client authentication methods at the token endpoint.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods allowed in FAPI Part 1
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 5.</p>
<p>shall require and use a key of size 2048 bits or larger for RSA algorithms;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 6.</p>
<p>shall require and use a key of size 160 bits or larger for elliptic curve algorithms;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, when&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;is used as client authentication method and RSA is used for signing the JWT, the key size must be 2048 or bigger. Likewise, when an elliptic curve algorithm is used, the key size must be 160 at minimum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 7.</p>
<p>shall require RFC7636 with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is required to implement RFC 7636 (PKCE) which is a countermeasure for “authorization code interception attack”.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authorization Code Interception Attack
<p>RFC 7636 has added&nbsp;<code>code_challenge</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method</code>&nbsp;request parameters to the authorization request and&nbsp;<code>code_verifier</code>&nbsp;request parameter to the token request. Because the default value of&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>plain</code>, authorization requests that comply with FAPI must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>&nbsp;explicitly.</p>
<p>See “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/pkce/">Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC 7636)</a>” for details about PKCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 8.</p>
<p>shall require redirect URIs to be pre-registered;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, registration of redirect URIs is not required under some conditions. For FAPI, registration of redirect URIs is always required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 9.</p>
<p>shall require the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter in the authorization request;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter of an authorization request can be omitted under some conditions. For FAPI, the request parameter must be always included. OIDC has the same requirement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 10.</p>
<p>shall require the value of&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;to exactly match one of the pre-registered redirect URIs;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an authorization server checks whether the value of the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter matches a pre-registered one, the rule described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6">6. Normalization and Comparison</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>&nbsp;(Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax) is applied unless the pre-registered one is an absolute URI. On the other hand, FAPI (and OIDC also) requires that simple string comparison be always used to check whether the redirect URIs match.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 11.</p>
<p>shall require user authentication to an appropriate Level of Assurance for the operations the client will be authorized to perform on behalf of the user;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is required that user authentication performed during authorization process satisfy an appropriate level of assurance. ID1 and ID2 required LoA (Level of Assurance) 2, which is defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.1254">X.1254</a>&nbsp;(Entity authentication assurance framework. However, the Final version made the requirement more abstract (= changed the requirement from “LoA2” to “appropriate LoA”).</p>
<p>FYI: The following is the definition of LoA 2 described in “6.2 Level of assurance 2 (LoA2)” of X.1254.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At LoA2, there is some confidence in the claimed or asserted identity of the entity. This LoA is used when moderate risk is associated with erroneous authentication. Single-factor authentication is acceptable. Successful authentication shall be dependent upon the entity proving, through a secure authentication protocol, that the entity has control of the credential. Controls should be in place to reduce the effectiveness of eavesdroppers and online guessing attacks. Controls shall be in place to protect against attacks on stored credentials.</p>
<p>For example, a service provider might operate a website that enables its customers to change their address of record. The transaction in which a beneficiary changes an address of record may be considered an LoA2 authentication transaction, as the transaction may involve a moderate risk of inconvenience. Since official notices regarding payment amounts, account status, and records of changes are usually sent to the beneficiary’s address of record, the transaction additionally entails moderate risk of unauthorized release of PII. As a result, the service provider should obtain at least some authentication assurance before allowing this transaction to take place.</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 12.</p>
<p>shall require explicit approval by the user to authorize the requested scope if it has not been previously authorized;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 13.</p>
<p>shall reject an authorization code (Section 1.3.1 of RFC6749) if it has been previously used;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prohibiting reuse of authorization codes and ensuring that authorization codes have never been used previously are different things. If the current implementation of an authorization server uses randomly-generated strings as authorization codes and removes them from the database after they are used, the authorization codes have to be kept in the database even after they are used just only for the verification. If strings that represent authorization codes are generated randomly with high enough entropy, it is wasteful to keep authorization codes in the database even after their use. A certain famous engineer says&nbsp;“Most implementations prevent reuse of authorization codes by deleting corresponding database records and don’t check if they have been used previously, and such implementations are sufficient enough.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 14.</p>
<p>shall return token responses that conform to Section 4.1.4 of RFC6749;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a FAPI-specific requirement. Every authorization server implementation that claims it supports OAuth 2.0 must conform to&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4</a>&nbsp;of RFC 6749.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 15.</p>
<p>shall return the list of granted scopes with the issued access token if the request was passed in the front channel and was not integrity protected;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;response parameter can be omitted unless requested scopes and granted ones are different (RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.1">5.1. Successful Response</a>). In FAPI, the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;response parameter is required (even if the requested scopes and granted ones are equal) if the authorization request is passed in the front channel and is not integrity protected.</p>
<p>“Integrity protected” here means that a Request Object (OIDC Core&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">Section 6</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq/">JAR</a>) is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 16.</p>
<p>shall provide non-guessable access tokens, authorization codes, and refresh token (where applicable), with sufficient entropy such that the probability of an attacker guessing the generated token is computationally infeasible as per RFC 6749 Section 10.10;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ID2 requires that access tokens have a minimum of 128 bits of entropy, but the Final version avoids mentioning the exact size of the minimum entropy and just says “sufficient entropy”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 17.</p>
<p>should clearly identify the details of the grant to the user during authorization as in 16.18 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose that a client application requests&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope. A typical authorization page will tell the user just that the client application is requesting the&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope. However, recent regulations in financial industries require that details be explained to the user. For example, information about the purpose of the&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope, the amount of money transferred, and so on. Generally speaking, recent regulations require that grant be more specific.</p>
<p>UK Open Banking has invented “Lodging Intent” for the purpose. In the mechanism, (a) a client application registers details of grant it wants into an authorization server in advance, (b) the authorization server issues an intent ID that represents the registered details, and (c) the client makes an authorization request with the intent ID. As a result, the authorization server can generate an authorization page which includes the details of the authorization request.</p>
<p>To make the lodging intent pattern available as standards, OpenID Foundation has developed two separate specifications; “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” (PAR) and “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>” (RAR). These specifications will be mentioned again later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 18.</p>
<p>should provide a mechanism for the end-user to revoke access tokens and refresh tokens granted to a client as in 16.18 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that,&nbsp;if the format of access tokens is self-contained-type (e.g. JWT), the access tokens cannot be revoked&nbsp;unless the system implements and operates a mechanism like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">CRL</a>&nbsp;(Certificate Revocation List) or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP</a>&nbsp;(Online Certificate Status Protocol) of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI</a>&nbsp;(Public Key Infrastructure). If the system does not provide such mechanism, it means that the system has decided to give up revocation of access tokens. In this case, the duration of access tokens must be short enough to mitigate damage of access token leakage. See “<a href="https://medium.com/@darutk/oauth-access-token-implementation-30c2e8b90ff0">OAuth Access Token Implementation</a>” for further discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 19.</p>
<p>shall return an&nbsp;<code>invalid_client</code>&nbsp;error as defined in 5.2 of RFC6749 when mis-matched client identifiers were provided through the client authentication methods that permits sending the client identifier in more than one way;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FAPI Part 1 requires MTLS (<code>tls_client_auth</code>,&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>) or JWT (<code>client_secret_jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>) for client authentication.</p>
<p>MTLS uses a client certificate but a certificate does not include the client identifier of the client which tries to authenticate itself with the certificate. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter needs to be given explicitly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, JWT-based client authentication methods present a JWT as the value of the&nbsp;<code>client_assertion</code>&nbsp;request parameter and the JWT contains the client identifier as the value of the&nbsp;<code>iss</code>&nbsp;claim. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter is not necessary. In addition, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523">RFC 7523</a>, 3. and OIDC Core, 9., the&nbsp;<code>sub</code> claim also holds the client identifier when a JWT is used for client authentication.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWT-based Client Authentication and Client Identifiers
<p>In MTLS, it is only the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter that represents a client identifier. On the other hand, in JWT-based client authentication, both the&nbsp;<code>iss</code>&nbsp;claim and the&nbsp;<code>sub</code>&nbsp;claim hold a client identifier. The values of the claims must match. Also, if the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter is redundantly given although JWT-based client authentication is used, the value of the request parameter must match the client identifier, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 20.</p>
<p>shall require redirect URIs to use the&nbsp;<code>https</code>&nbsp;scheme;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence added by FAPI Implementer’s Draft 2 is short but has a big impact. Because of this sentence, developers&nbsp;cannot use custom schemes in FAPI&nbsp;any more. To process redirection on client side only without preparing an external Web server, developers have to use the method described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.2">7.2. Claimed “https” Scheme URI Redirection</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212">BCP 212</a>&nbsp;(OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 21.</p>
<p>should issue access tokens with a lifetime of under 10 minutes unless the tokens are sender-constrained; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the FAPI Final version. “sender-constrained” here means that access tokens have to be bound to a client certificate (MTLS).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 22.</p>
<p>shall support OIDD, may support RFC8414 and shall not distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) by any other means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the FAPI Final version. OIDD here is short for “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</a>”. Therefore, authorization servers for FAPI must implement a “discovery endpoint” which is defined in OIDD&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig">Section 4</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier</p>
<p>Further, if it is desired to provide the authenticated user’s identifier to the client in the token response, the authorization server:</p>

<p>Section 5.2.2.1. lists requirements that an authorization server must follow when the authenticated user’s identifier is requested. In other words, when an ID token is requested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the authentication request as in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a>” of OIDC Core is the definition of a request to an authorization endpoint in the context of OpenID Connect. RFC 6749 calls a request to an authorization endpoint “authorization request”. OIDC Core calls it “authentication request”. Aside from the names, considering that the specification of an authorization endpoint is the main part of OIDC Core, the FAPI’s requirement is almost equal to stating&nbsp;“shall support OIDC Core”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 2.</p>
<p>shall perform the authentication request verification as in Section 3.1.2.2 of OIDC;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 3.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the user as in Section 3.1.2.2 and 3.1.2.3 of OIDC;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 4.</p>
<p>shall provide the authentication response as in Section 3.1.2.4 and 3.1.2.5 of OIDC depending on the outcome of the authentication;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 5.</p>
<p>shall perform the token request verification as in Section 3.1.3.2 of OIDC; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 6.</p>
<p>shall issue an ID Token in the token response when&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;was included in the requested&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;as in Section 3.1.3.3 of OIDC with its&nbsp;<code>sub</code>&nbsp;value corresponding to the authenticated user and optional&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;value in ID Token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary of the requirements above is&nbsp;“shall follow OIDC Core specification.”&nbsp;Nothing special for FAPI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.2. Client requesting openid scope</p>
<p>If the client requests the&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;scope, the authorization server</p>
<p>1. shall require the&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC in the authentication request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">Section 3.1.2.1</a>&nbsp;(Authorization Code Flow) states that&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;is optional. On the other hand, OIDC&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitAuthRequest">Section 3.2.2.1</a>&nbsp;(Implicit Flow) states that&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;is mandatory.</p>
<p>The FAPI requirement above requires&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;even in the authorization code flow if&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is included in&nbsp;<code>scope</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.3. Clients not requesting openid scope</p>
<p>If the client does not requests the&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;scope, the authorization server</p>
<p>1. shall require the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 4 of RFC6749</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter is optional. FAPI makes the parameter mandatory when&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is not included in&nbsp;<code>scope</code>.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Public Client 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#public-client">5.2.3. Public client</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for public clients. Let’s take a look one by one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support RFC7636;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RFC 7636 is PKCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 2.</p>
<p>shall use&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method for the RFC7636;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means&nbsp;“an authorization request must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 3.</p>
<p>shall use separate and distinct redirect URI for each authorization server that it talks to;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 4.</p>
<p>shall store the redirect URI value in the resource owner’s user-agents (such as browser) session and compare it with the redirect URI that the authorization response was received at, where, if the URIs do not match, the client shall terminate the process with error;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements are so clear that further explanation is not needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 5.</p>
<p>(withdrawn); and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“(withdrawn)” here indicates that the requirement which existed in the previous FAPI versions has been withdrawn. You’ll see more “withdrawn”s in following sections, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 6.</p>
<p>shall implement an effective CSRF protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In normal cases, CSRF protection is implemented on server side. What is CSRF protection as a requirement for public clients? This is CSRF protection for redirect URIs. The following is an excerpt from “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12">10.12. Cross-Site Request Forgery</a>” of RFC 6749.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client MUST implement CSRF protection for its redirection URI. This is typically accomplished by requiring any request sent to the redirection URI endpoint to include a value that binds the request to the user-agent’s authenticated state (e.g., a hash of the session cookie used to authenticate the user-agent). The client SHOULD utilize the “state” request parameter to deliver this value to the authorization server when making an authorization request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the requirements from “Public client, 1” to “Public client, 6”, “if it is desired to obtain a persistent identifier of the authenticated user”, that is, if an ID token is requested, an authorization request by a public client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 7.</p>
<p>shall include&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;value; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 8.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC in the authentication request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, “If&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is not in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;value”, an authorization request by a public client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 9.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in section 4.1.1 of RFC6749;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 10.</p>
<p>shall verify that the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;received in the token response is either an exact match, or contains a subset of the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;sent in the authorization request; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 11.</p>
<p>shall only use Authorization Server metadata obtained from the metadata document published by the Authorization Server at its well known endpoint as defined in OIDD or RFC 8414.</p>
</blockquote>
 Part 1: Requirements for Confidential Client 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#confidential-client">5.2.4. Confidential client</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for confidential clients. The requirements are positioned as additions to the requirements for public clients. Therefore, confidential clients must follow not only the requirements in 5.2.4 but also the requirements in 5.2.3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the following methods to authenticate against the token endpoint:</p>
<p>1. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication as specified in Section 2 of MTLS, and</p>
<p>2.<code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in Section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that client authentication methods defined in RFC 6749 (<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code>) cannot be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 2.</p>
<p>shall use RSA keys with a minimum 2048 bits if using RSA cryptography;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 3.</p>
<p>shall use elliptic curve keys with a minimum of 160 bits if using Elliptic Curve cryptography; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that its client secret has a minimum of 128 bits if using symmetric key cryptography.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements apply when encrypted JWTs are used.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Protected Resources 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#protected-resources-provisions">6.2.1. Protected resources provisions</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for protected resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the use of the HTTP GET method as in Section 4.3.1 of RFC7231;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 2.</p>
<p>shall accept access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, protected resource endpoints must support HTTP&nbsp;<code>GET</code>&nbsp;method and be able to accept an access token in the format of&nbsp;<code>Authorization: Bearer&nbsp;{AccessToken}</code>.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Request to Protected Resource Endpoint
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 3.</p>
<p>shall not accept access tokens in the query parameters stated in Section 2.3 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, protected resource endpoints must not accept a query parameter in the format of&nbsp;<code>access_token={AccessToken}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that the access token is neither expired nor revoked;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 5.</p>
<p>shall verify that the scope associated with the access token authorizes access to the resource it is representing;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 6.</p>
<p>shall identify the associated entity to the access token;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 7.</p>
<p>shall only return the resource identified by the combination of the entity implicit in the access and the granted scope and otherwise return errors as in Section 3.1 of RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are general steps of access token verification that protected resource endpoints are expected to take.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1">3.1. Error Codes</a>” of RFC 6750 defines three error codes. They are&nbsp;<code>invalid_request</code>,&nbsp;<code>invalid_token</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>insufficient_scope</code>. One point those who are not familiar with RFC 6750 may feel strange is that an error code is embedded not in the response body but in the&nbsp;<code>WWW-Authenticate</code> HTTP header.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 RFC 6750 Error Response
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 8.</p>
<p>shall encode the response in UTF-8 if applicable;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 9.</p>
<p>shall send the&nbsp;<code>Content-type</code>&nbsp;HTTP header&nbsp;<code>Content-Type: application/json;&nbsp;</code>if applicable;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Protected resource endpoints in FAPI are expected to return their responses in JSON format.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 10.</p>
<p>shall send the server date in HTTP&nbsp;<code>Date</code>&nbsp;header as in Section 7.1.1.2 of RFC7231;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The format of&nbsp;<code>Date</code>&nbsp;header is defined in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1">7.1.1.1. Date/Time Formats</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231">RFC 7231</a>. Below is an example.</p>
 Date: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT 
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 11.</p>
<p>shall set the response header&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;to the value received from the corresponding FAPI client request header or to a RFC4122 UUID value if the request header was not provided to track the interaction, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a</code>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a requirement specific to FAPI. Responses from FAPI protected resource endpoints must include an&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;header.</p>
<p>When an incoming request has&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>, the same value of the header must be included in the response. Otherwise, the protected resource endpoint must generate a new value for&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 12.</p>
<p>shall log the value of&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;in the log entry; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also specific to FAPI. This requirement doesn’t have any impact on request and response formats, but this can make it easy to correlate server-side logs and client-side logs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 13.</p>
<p>shall not reject requests with a&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address</code>&nbsp;header containing a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 14.</p>
<p>should support the use of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and or other methods as appropriate to enable JavaScript clients to access the endpoint if it decides to provide access to JavaScript clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if a protected resource endpoint wants to allow JavaScript clients to access it from anywhere, the endpoint should include an&nbsp;<code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>&nbsp;header in responses.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Clients to Protected Resources 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#client-provisions">6.2.2. Client provisions</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for clients to follow in accessing protected resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 1.</p>
<p>shall send access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, clients send an access token in the format of&nbsp;<code>Authorization: Bearer&nbsp;{AccessToken}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 2.</p>
<p>(withdrawn);</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 3.</p>
<p>may send the last time the customer logged into the client in the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-auth-date</code>&nbsp;header where the value is supplied as a HTTP-date as in Section 7.1.1.1 of RFC7231, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-auth-date: Tue, 11 Sep 2012 19:43:31 GMT</code>;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 4.</p>
<p>may send the customer’s IP address if this data is available in the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address</code>&nbsp;header, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address: 2001:DB8::1893:25c8:1946</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address: 198.51.100.119</code>; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 5.</p>
<p>may send the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;request header, in which case the value shall be a RFC4122 UUID to the server to help correlate log entries between client and server, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are FAPI-specific HTTP headers. It is up to clients whether to send the headers or not.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 FAPI-specific HTTP Headers
 Part 1: Security Considerations 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#security-considerations">7. Security considerations</a>” of “Part 1” lists security considerations. Summary is as follows.</p>
<p>7.1.&nbsp;— Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp195">BCP 195</a>. Use TLS 1.2 or newer. Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125">RFC 6125</a>.</p>
<p>7.2.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t authenticate authorization request and response.</p>
<p>7.3.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t assure message integrity of authorization request.</p>
<p>7.4.1.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t discuss encryption of authorization request.</p>
<p>7.4.2.&nbsp;— Be careful not to leak information through logs.</p>
<p>7.4.3.&nbsp;— Be careful not to leak information through referrer. Make duration of access tokens short.</p>
<p>7.5.&nbsp;— Native applications shall follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212">BCP 212</a>&nbsp;but must not support “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.1">Private-Use URI Scheme Redirection</a>” and “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.3">Loopback Interface Redirection</a>”. They must use&nbsp;<code>https</code>&nbsp;for the scheme of redirect URI as introduced in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.2">Claimed https Scheme URI Redirection</a>”.</p>
<p>7.6.&nbsp;— Both FAPI implementation and underlying OAuth/OIDC implementation must be complete and correct. See&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Certification</a>.</p>
<p>7.7.&nbsp;— Use a separate&nbsp;<code>issuer</code>&nbsp;per brand if multiple brands need to be supported.</p>
<p>“Part 2” provides solutions for security considerations listed in “Part 1”, for example, by making “request object” mandatory. “Part 2” is recommended when higher security than “Part 1” is needed.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Part 2: Advanced 
<p>Next, let’s read “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html">Part 2</a>” which defines advanced security profile.</p>
 Detached Signature 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#id-token-as-detached-signature">5.1.1. ID Token as Detached Signature</a>” of “Part 2” states that it uses “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken">ID token</a>” as “detached signature”.</p>
<p>An ID token is signed by an authorization server, so even if an attacker tampered the content of the ID token, it could be detected. A client application that has received an ID token can confirm that the ID token has not been tampered by verifying the signature of the ID token.</p>
<p>If an authorization server embeds hash values of response parameters (such as&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>state</code>) into an ID token, a client application can confirm that the values of the response parameters have not been tampered by computing hash values of the response parameter values and comparing them to the hash values embedded in the ID token. In the context, the ID token is regarded as a detached signature.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 ID Token as Detached Signature
<p>For the&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;response parameter that represents an authorization code,&nbsp;<code>c_hash</code>&nbsp;has already been defined in OIDC Core as a claim that represents the hash value of&nbsp;<code>code</code>. Likewise,&nbsp;<code>at_hash</code>&nbsp;has been defined as a claim that represents the hash value of&nbsp;<code>access_token</code>.</p>
<p>What is missing is a claim that represents the hash value of the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;response parameter. So, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#id-token-as-detached-signature">5.1.1. ID Token as Detached Signature</a>” defines&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;for that purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>s_hash<br>
State hash value. Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most half of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value, where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm used in the&nbsp;<code>alg</code>&nbsp;header parameter of the ID Token’s JOSE header. For instance, if the&nbsp;<code>alg</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>HS512</code>, hash the state value with SHA-512, then take the left-most 256 bits and base64url encode them. The&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;value is a case sensitive string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because “Part 2” uses ID tokens as detached signatures, even if client applications don’t need ID tokens in their application layer, they have to send authorization requests that require an ID token. To be exact, they have to include&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter. This is the reason that the second requirement in “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization Server</a>” is saying&nbsp;“shall require the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;values&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>”.</p>
<p>However, since Implementer’s Draft 2,&nbsp;ID tokens don’t have to be used as detached signatures when JARM is used. It is because the entire set of response parameters is packed into a JWT.</p>
 Part 2: Requirements for Authorization Server 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization server</a>” of “Part 2” lists requirements for authorization server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 1.</p>
<p>shall require a JWS signed JWT request object passed by value with the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or by reference with the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameters are defined in “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">6. Passing Request Parameters as JWTs</a>” of OIDC Core. To use these parameters, the first step is&nbsp;to pack request parameters into a JWT. This JWT is called “request object”. An authorization request (1) passes the request object as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter directly or (2) puts the request object somewhere accessible from the authorization server and passes the URI pointing to the location as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code> parameter.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Passing a Request Object by Value
<p>Signing a request object is not mandatory in OIDC Core, but signing is mandatory in FAPI Part 2. If request objects are signed, authorization servers can confirm that the request parameters have not been tampered by verifying signatures of the request objects.</p>
<p>To be honest, what surprised me most when I read the FAPI specification for the first time (many years ago) is this requirement. It’s because I knew from my experience it is hard to implement the request object feature on authorization server side. As the feature is hard to implement and optional in OIDC, there are many authorization server implementations that claim they support OIDC but don’t support request object.&nbsp;Be careful not to choose an authorization server implementation that doesn’t support request object if you want to build a system that supports FAPI Part 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 2.</p>
<p>shall require</p>
<p>1. the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;values&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>, or</p>
<p>2. the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;in conjunction with the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use ID token as detached signature, even if an ID token is not needed in the application layer,&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;must be included in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter.</p>
<p>But, as mentioned in the previous section,&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;doesn’t have to be included in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter when JARM is used. “When JARM is used” is, to be concrete, “when the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter is included and its value is one of&nbsp;<code>query.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>fragment.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>form_post.jwt</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>”.</p>
<p>NOTE: ID2 requires that&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;be either&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>code id_token token</code>&nbsp;when JARM is not used, but the Final version has removed&nbsp;<code>code id_token token</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 3.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 4.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 5.</p>
<p>shall only issue sender-constrained access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this clause was&nbsp;“shall only issue authorization code, access token, and refresh token that are holder of key bound;”. However, because the requirement was impractical, it was changed to the current one. See&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/202">FAPI Issue 202</a>&nbsp;for details if you are interested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 6.</p>
<p>shall support MTLS as mechanism for constraining the legitimate senders of access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this clause was&nbsp;“shall support [OAUTB] or [MTLS] as a holder of key mechanisms;”. However, OAUTB (Token Binding) was removed from the Final version due to its unlikeliness of future availability.</p>

<p>shall only use the parameters included in the signed request object passed via the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
<p>shall require that all parameters are present inside the signed request object passed in the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this requirement was&nbsp;“shall require that all parameters are present inside the signed request object passed in the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;”. The expression was changed but the point remains the same. A request object must include all request parameters to conform to FAPI Part 2.</p>
<p>This is different from OIDC Core which allows request parameters to be put inside or outside a request object and merges them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 11.</p>
<p>may support the pushed authorization request endpoint as described in PAR;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “pushed authorization request endpoint” is a new endpoint defined in “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” (PAR). A client application can register an authorization request at the endpoint and obtain a&nbsp;Request URI&nbsp;which represents the registered authorization request. The client specifies the issued Request URI as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter when sending an authorization request to the authorization endpoint.</p>
<p>The following diagram excerpted from “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/illustrated-par-oauth-2-0-pushed-authorization-requests-652d71ed5cfb">Illustrated PAR: OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” shows the authorization code flow which utilizes the pushed authorization request endpoint.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authorization Code Flow with Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint
<p>HISTORY:&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-ID2.html#request-object-endpoint">The 7th section of ID2</a>&nbsp;showed an idea about pre-registration of an authorization request. The section named the endpoint for the pre-registration “request object endpoint”. The specification of PAR was developed based on the idea. As a result, the FAPI Final version has withdrawn the 7th section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 12.</p>
<p>(withdrawn)</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 13.</p>
<p>shall require the request object to contain an&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;claim that has a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC Core does not require that request objects include the&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;claim. In contrast, FAPI Part 2 requires&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;as a mandatory claim.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Final version has added a requirement&nbsp;“a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim”. Because of this requirement, the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim has become mandatory.</p>
<p>The new requirement is a breaking change from a viewpoint of client applications because authorization servers now reject authorization requests whose request object does not include the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim. As a matter of fact, some test cases in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite">conformance suite</a>&nbsp;had to be updated for the new requirement.</p>
<p>Authorization server implementations may provide a mechanism to mitigate the impact of the breaking change. For example, Authlete has defined&nbsp;<code><a href="https://authlete.github.io/authlete-java-common/com/authlete/common/dto/Service.html#isNbfOptional--">Service.nbfOptional</a></code>&nbsp;flag that indicates whether the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code> claim in the request object is optional even when the authorization request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request. The value of the flag can be changed by “nbf Claim” in the Service Owner Console.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Service Configuration: nbf Claim
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 14.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the confidential client using one of the following methods (this overrides FAPI Security Profile 1.0 – Part 1: clause 5.2.2-4):</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 2 of MTLS, or</p>
<p>2.<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that&nbsp;<code>client_secret_jwt</code> is not allowed in Part 2. This is different from Part 1.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods in FAPI
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 15.</p>
<p>shall return the&nbsp;<code>aud</code>&nbsp;claim in the request object to be, or to be an array containing, the OP’s Issuer Identifier URL;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the Final version. Client applications have to put the&nbsp;<code>aud</code>&nbsp;claim in request objects. The value of&nbsp;“OP’s Issuer Identifier URL”&nbsp;can be found in the discovery document as the value of the&nbsp;<code>issuer</code>&nbsp;metadata (cf. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0,&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata">3. OpenID Provider Metadata</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 16.</p>
<p>shall not support public clients;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement is a new one added by the Final version, but it is said that it has been logically impossible to support public clients in the context of FAPI Part 2 since older FAPI versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 17.</p>
<p>shall require the request object to contain an&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim that is no longer than 60 minutes in the past; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 13th requirement implies that the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim is mandatory. This 17th requirement states it explicitly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 18.</p>
<p>shall require PAR requests, if supported, to use PKCE (RFC7636) with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“PAR” here is “OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature</p>
<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>value&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;is used, the authorization server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 5.2.2.1. lists requirements for authorization servers which are applied when an ID token is used as a detached signature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 1.</p>
<p>shall support OIDC;</p>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 2.</p>
<p>shall support signed ID Tokens;</p>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 3.</p>
<p>should support signed and encrypted ID Tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a viewpoint of OIDC, these requirements are not new. By definition, ID tokens are always signed. Encryption of ID tokens is optional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 4.</p>
<p>shall return ID Token as a detached signature to the authorization response;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires that an authorization server issue an ID token, but because the condition written at the top of Section 5.2.2.1 requires that&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;be included in&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;and so an ID token is issued as a general consequence, this requirement doesn’t have to exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 5.</p>
<p>shall include state hash,&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>, in the ID Token to protect the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value if the client supplied a value for&nbsp;<code>state</code>.&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;may be omitted from the ID Token returned from the Token Endpoint when&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;is present in the ID Token returned from the Authorization Endpoint; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When JARM is used, this requirement doesn’t have to be followed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 6.</p>
<p>should not return sensitive PII in the ID Token in the authorization response, but if it needs to, then it should encrypt the ID Token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PII is short for “Personally Identifiable Information”.</p>
<p>The feature of ID token encryption has existed since OIDC Core. When the encryption algorithm for ID tokens is an asymmetric one, the authorization server must either (1) manage public keys of client applications directly in its database or (2) fetch JWK Set documents from the locations pointed to by clients’&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;metadata and extract public keys from the documents.</p>
<p>For signing ID tokens, it is server-side keys only that an authorization server has to handle.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 ID Token Signing
<p>In contrast, if an authorization server wants to support encryption of ID tokens, the authorization server has to handle client-side keys, too.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 ID Token Encryption
<p>This is the reason that not a small number of authorization server implementations don’t support ID token encryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.2. JARM</p>
<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;is used in conjunction with the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>, the authorization server</p>
<p>5.2.2.2. JARM, 1.</p>
<p>shall create JWT-secured authorization responses as specified in JARM, Section 4.3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clause does not include any FAPI-specific requirements. It just says that JARM implementations should function as the JARM specification requires.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;does not contain&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>, no ID token is issued. Therefore, an ID token cannot be used as a detached signature. In this case, JARM has to be used to assure that the authorization response has not been tampered.</p>
 Part 2: Requirements for Confidential Client 
<p>The FAPI Final version has renamed Part 2: Section 5.2.3 from “Public client” to “Confidential client”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support MTLS as mechanism for sender-constrained access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, the authorization server must issue certificated-bound access tokens as defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica">Section 3</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 2.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter as defined in Section 6 of OIDC in the authentication request;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As listed in the list of requirements for authorization servers, either the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter must be included. Note that OIDC Core says&nbsp;“If one of these parameters is used, the other MUST NOT be used in the same request.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 3.</p>
<p>shall ensure the Authorization Server has authenticated the user to an appropriate Level of Assurance for the client’s intended purpose;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement states just that the user shall be authenticated appropriately. The FAPI Final version removed the requirement&nbsp;“by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”&nbsp;which once existed in the clause.</p>
<p>HISTORY:</p>
<p>In ID2, this requirement was&nbsp;“shall request user authentication at LoA 3 or greater by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim as defined in section 5.5.1.1 of [OIDC];”.</p>
<p>When a client wants to require claims as essential ones, the&nbsp;<code>acr_values</code>&nbsp;request parameter cannot be used. Instead, a client must use the&nbsp;<code>claims</code>&nbsp;request parameter, pass JSON as its value, and include&nbsp;<code>{“essential":true}</code>&nbsp;inside the JSON. The following is an example of JSON that needs to be given as the value of the&nbsp;<code>claims</code>&nbsp;request parameter in order to mark&nbsp;<code>urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver</code> as an essential ACR.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Claims for Essential ACR
<p>BTW, this requirement is loosened in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">UK Open Banking</a>&nbsp;which is based on FAPI Part 2. That is, clients don’t have to require ACRs as essential. Probably, it is not intentional. I guess that the snapshot of FAPI specification which was referred to when&nbsp;Open Banking Profile&nbsp;(OBP) was developed didn’t contain the sentence, “by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”.</p>
<p>The official Financial-grade API conformance test suite (<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite">conformance-suite</a>) developed and maintained by&nbsp;<a href="https://fintechlabs.io/">FinTechLabs.io</a>&nbsp;contains test cases for OBP. When FinTechLabs ran the OBP test cases using Authlete to test the test suite itself, they encountered an error. Because Authlete strictly follows FAPI specification, Authlete reported&nbsp;“<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim is not required as essential.”&nbsp;However, the expected behavior in the context of OBP is to ignore the FAPI requirement.</p>
<p>The right approach for the error was to amend OBP (to make OBP compliant with the latest FAPI specification). However, I was given explanation like&nbsp;“if the official conformance test suite did it, all the existing OBP implementations wouldn’t be able to pass the official tests. Changing the tests at this timing might cause delay in the officially-announced schedule of Open Banking.”</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to tweak Authlete and added OPEN_BANKING option in addition to FAPI option.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Supported Service Profiles (in Service Owner Console provided by Authlete)
<p>If OPEN_BANKING is enabled, Authlete dare not to check if the&nbsp;<code>acr</code> claim is required as essential even in the context of FAPI Part 2. The code snippet below is the actual implementation excerpted from Authlete’s source code.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Code to judge whether acr should be required as an essential claim
<p>As a result of this, Authlete is listed as a platform vendor that has passed “<a href="https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/126321042/Open+Banking+Security+Profile+Conformance">Open Banking Security Profile Conformance</a>”.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authlete listed in Open Banking Security Profile Conformance
<p>~HISTORY END</p>
<p>However, again, the FAPI Final has removed the requirement&nbsp;“by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”, so Authlete no longer checks whether ACRs are requested as essential ones. Therefore, the flag OPEN_BANKING is not meaningful any more.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If request parameters are all put into a request object, either the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter is sufficient. However, if parameters that are mandatory in OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core (e.g.&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>) are omitted, the request is no longer compliant with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core. Therefore, parameters that are mandatory in OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core must be put outside the request object duplicately even if they exist inside the request object.</p>
<p>The FAPI Final version has added a condition&nbsp;“if not using PAR”. This implies that the set of request parameters don’t have to be compliant with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC when PAR is used. This incompatibility comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq/">JWT Secured Authorization Request</a>&nbsp;(JAR). See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/implementers-note-about-jar-fff4cbd158fe">Implementer’s note about JAR (JWT Secured Authorization Request)</a>” for details.</p>

<p>The same requirement can be found in Section 5.2.2. Authorization server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 15.</p>
<p>shall use RFC7636 with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method if using PAR; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, an authorization request must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>&nbsp;request parameter when PAR is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 16.</p>
<p>shall additionally send a duplicate of the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;parameter/value using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax to the authorization endpoint, as required by Section 5 of JAR, if using PAR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PAR specification requires that authorization servers handle request objects based on the rules defined in JAR. The JAR specification has made the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter optional, but the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;remains mandatory. See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/implementers-note-about-jar-fff4cbd158fe">Implementer’s note about JAR (JWT Secured Authorization Request)</a>” for details.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;is used, the client</p>

<p>Section 5.2.3.1. lists requirements for client applications which are applied when an ID token is used as a detached signature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 1.</p>
<p>shall include the value&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;into the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter in order to activate OIDC support;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a FAPI-specific requirement. OIDC Core requires that an OIDC request include&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter. See the explanation about the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter written in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">Section 3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a>&nbsp;in OIDC Core for details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 2.</p>
<p>shall require JWS signed ID Token be returned from endpoints;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing new from OIDC’s viewpoint. By definition, ID tokens are always signed. And when&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;contains&nbsp;<code>openid</code>, both the authorization endpoint and the token endpoint return an ID token. See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/diagrams-of-all-the-openid-connect-flows-6968e3990660">Diagrams of All The OpenID Connect Flows</a>” for details about what the endpoints return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 3.</p>
<p>shall verify that the authorization response was not tampered using ID Token as the detached signature;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, client applications have to compute hash values of response parameters outside the issued ID token and compare the values to the hash values in the ID token.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;value is equal to the value calculated from the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value in the authorization response in addition to all the requirements in 3.3.2.12 of OIDC; and</p>
<p>NOTE: This enables the client to verify that the authorization response was not tampered with, using the ID Token as a detached signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement particularly mentions the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter and the&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;claim in the ID token although they are just one of parameter/hash pairs that have to be considered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 5.</p>
<p>shall support both signed and signed &amp; encrypted ID Tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By definition, ID tokens are always signed. When ID tokens are encrypted, the order of signing and encrypting is “sign then encrypt”. As a result, an encrypted ID token takes the form of “Nested JWT” as illustrated below.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>

<p>But, from a viewpoint of interoperability of web browsers, additional cipher suites allowed in the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp195">BCP 195</a>&nbsp;are permitted for authorization endpoints.</p>
<p>Because I couldn’t find any good reasons to exclude the following cipher suites,</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code></p>
<p>6.<code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code></p>
<p>I created&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/216">Issue 216</a>&nbsp;(TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suites) to suggest adding them to the list of permitted cipher suites. 1 year and 4 months later, the issue was closed with the reason that FAPI now allows TLS 1.3.</p>
<p>8.6&nbsp;—&nbsp;<code>PS256</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ES256</code>&nbsp;only are allowed for JWS signature algorithm.</p>
<p>Signing algorithms of JWS are listed in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1">3.1. “alg” (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for JWS</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">RFC 7518</a>&nbsp;(JSON Web Algorithms). Among the 13 algorithms, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#algorithm-considerations">8.6. Algorithm considerations</a>” of “Part 2” permits&nbsp;<code>PS256</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ES256</code>&nbsp;only. The section explicitly states that RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (e.g.&nbsp;<code>RS256</code>) should not be used and&nbsp;<code>none</code> must not be used.</p>

<p>FYI: JWT is used at the following places in an authorization server implementation.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWT Usage in Authorization Server Implementation
<p>8.6.1&nbsp;—&nbsp;<code>RSA1_5</code>&nbsp;encryption algorithm must not be used.</p>
<p>This requirement about encryption algorithms was added by the FAPI Final version. FAPI prohibits&nbsp;<code>RSA1_5</code>. The algorighm identifier is defined in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-4.1">4.1. “alg” (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for JWE</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">RFC 7518</a>&nbsp;(JSON Web Algorithms). The identifier represents RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5.</p>
<p>8.7&nbsp;— Use certified FAPI implementations.</p>
<p>8.8&nbsp;—Don’t allow privileged actions without an access token.</p>
<p>8.9&nbsp;— Keys for signature verification should be accessible via the&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>jwks</code>&nbsp;client metadata (cf.&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>) and the&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;server metadata (cf.&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414">RFC 8414</a>).</p>
<p>8.10&nbsp;— A compromise of any client that shares the same key with other clients would result in a compromise of all the clients.</p>
<p>8.11&nbsp;— JWK sets should not contain multiple keys with the same&nbsp;<code>kid</code>, but other key attributes may be used to select one among multiple key candidates.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 FAPI implementation 
<p>This chapter picks up some topics related to FAPI implementation.</p>
 Baseline or Advanced? 
<p>When a client application requests an access token and accesses APIs with the access token, which security profile should apply, FAPI Part 1 or FAPI Part 2, or neither of them?</p>
<p>Some implementations may configure themselves statically and others may make the decision dynamically at runtime.&nbsp;The FAPI specification mentions nothing about how to determine which security profile should apply.</p>
<p>A simple approach would be&nbsp;“Regard all authorization requests as FAPI Part 2 requests.”&nbsp;Actually, UK Open Banking has adopted this approach. A hard-coded implementation like this may be acceptable if the system development is a one-time work.</p>
<p>However, this approach is not appropriate for a generic authorization server implementation. It’s because a hard-coded implementation hinders flexibility of system design too much. Therefore, in a generic implementation, it is better to judge dynamically at runtime whether an authorization request is for FAPI Part 1 or for FAPI Part 2 (or for normal OAuth 2.0 / OIDC).</p>
<p>If so, how to judge dynamically? The conclusion everyone will eventually reach after thinking will be just one. It is&nbsp;judged by checking the requested scopes.</p>
<p>(Note: Another possible way would be to utilize the&nbsp;<code>resource</code>&nbsp;request parameter defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html">RFC 8707 Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0</a>”.)</p>
<p>For example, (1) prepare scopes named&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>write</code>, (2) adopt a rule where the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope requires FAPI Part 1 requirements be satisfied and the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope requires FAPI Part 2 requirements be satisfied, and (3) implement APIs so that they interpret the scopes accordingly. If APIs are implemented in this way, the implementation of an authorization endpoint can change its behavior dynamically by (a) applying FAPI Part 2 requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter includes the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope, (b) applying FAPI Part 1 requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter does not include the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope but includes the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope, and (c) applying normal OAuth 2.0 and OIDC requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter includes neither the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope nor the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope.</p>
<p>How to implement the scope-based switch? For instance, one approach might be to regard scopes whose name starts with&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;as scopes for FAPI Part 1. However, this approach imposes heavy restrictions on scope names. If that is the case, what approach has Authlete adopted?</p>
<p>As the first step, Authlete implemented a generic mechanism to set arbitrary attributes to each scope. On the mechanism, Authlete treats the attribute name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;in a special way. An attribute having name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;and value&nbsp;<code>r</code>&nbsp;represents Read-Only (= Baseline). Likewise, an attribute having name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;and value&nbsp;<code>rw</code>&nbsp;represents Read-and-Write (Advanced).</p>
<p>The web console for FAPI-aware Authlete (version 2.0+) provides UI for scope attributes. The screenshot below defines a scope named&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;with an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=r</code>.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Scope Settings for FAPI Read-Only
<p>Authlete’s&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.authlete.com/#auth-authorization-api">/auth/authorization API</a>&nbsp;that parses an authorization request checks scopes listed in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter in the authorization request and regards the request as a request for FAPI Part 2 if the scope list includes a scope that has an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=rw</code>. If the scope list does not include any scope having an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=rw</code>&nbsp;but includes a scope having an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=r</code>, the authorization request is regarded as a request for FAPI Part 1. In other cases, the authorization request is treated as a normal OAuth 2.0 / OIDC request.</p>
<p>NOTE: In ID2, the names of FAPI Part 1 and Part 2 were “Read-Only Security Profile” and “Read and Write Security Profile”. The FAPI Final verison renamed them to “Baseline Security Profile” and “Advanced Security Profile”. The values of&nbsp;<code>r</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>rw</code>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;attribute were determined based on the old names.</p>
 Mutual TLS 
<p>“Mutual TLS” has three meanings as listed below (as already explained previously).</p>
 
 TLS communication using a client certificate 
 Client authentication using a client certificate 
 Certificate binding 
 
<p>The first part is handled by API management solutions. On the other hand, the second and the third parts don’t necessarily have to be handled by the API management layer. Rather, a better system architecture would handle them in a different layer that is independent of the API management layer.</p>
<p>Because of its unique architecture, Authlete doesn’t take on any task in the API management layer. That is, Authlete does nothing for the first part. On the other hand, Authlete supports the second and the third parts. Thanks to this, with Authlete, systems can support MTLS (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>) required by FAPI on any API management solution that developers want to use. I actually tried MTLS on Amazon API Gateway and wrote an article titled “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/tutorial/financial_grade_apigateway/">Financial-grade Amazon API Gateway</a>” to explains how to achieve it.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Example of Component Deployment for MTLS on Amazon API Gateway
<p>Any API management solution can support MTLS by using Authlete as long as the solution provides a mechanism which enables developers to access the client certificate used in TLS communication.</p>
<p>Existing API management solutions may try to implement MTLS directly. However, it would take time, and above all, it is not a good system design to support the functionality directly in the API management layer. At the time of this writing, if you use an API management solution provided by one of giant cloud vendors, Authlete is the best answer for MTLS.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/hYhHan5FzlA">video</a>&nbsp;below is a session in “<a href="https://financial-api.net/en/">Financial APIs Workshop</a>” that took place in Tokyo on July 24, 2018. In the video,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinricher/">Justin Richer</a>, one of the most famous software engineers in the community and the author of “<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/oauth-2-in-action">OAuth 2 in Action</a>”, is explaining Authlete’s MTLS implementation.</p>
<p>The material and transcript of the presentation are available at “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/resources/videos/20180724/authlete-fapi-enhancements/">Authlete FAPI Enhancements</a>”.</p>
 Access Token Duration 
<p>This is not related to FAPI, but I explain this feature here because I’m often consulted about the feature in the context of Bank API by customers who want to make duration of access tokens for remittance shorter than that of access tokens for other purposes.</p>
<p>The functionality can be achieved by making access token duration shorter when an authorization request contains a scope for remittance. For example, if an API for remittance requires a scope named&nbsp;<code>remit</code>, the authorization server would shorten access token duration when an authorization request contains the scope.</p>
<p>Authlete supports the functionality by treating a scope attribute named&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;in a special way.</p>
<p>Authlete checks all scope attributes of requested scopes, picks up the smallest value among values of&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes, and uses it as the duration of an access token being issued. If none of the requested scopes has an&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attribute, Authlete uses the default value of access token duration set per authorization server instance. If the default value is smaller than the smallest value of&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes, the default value is used.</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows how to set&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration=300</code>as a scope attribute.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Scope Settings for Access Token Duration
<p>Likewise, duration of refresh tokens can be set by utilizing&nbsp;<code>refresh_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>NOTE: Authlete 2.1 and newer versions support “access token duration per client”. See “<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/how-to-calculate-token-duration">How Authlete determines token duration</a>” on&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/">Authlete Knowledge Base</a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
 Access Token with Transaction Information 
<p>This feature is not related to FAPI, either, but I explain it here as I’m often consulted about it in the context of Bank API by customers who want to associate detailed transaction information with an access token. I hear that some regulations in Europe require an access token be issued per transaction under some conditions.</p>
<p>This functionality cannot be achieved by “scope attribute” which was explained in “Access Token Duration” because the functionality requires data be handled per access token, not per scope.</p>
<p>Since old days, Authlete has provided a mechanism to set arbitrary key-value pairs to an access token. This feature can be utilized to associate transaction information with an access token. Technical details about this feature are explained in “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/documents/definitive_guide/extra_properties">Extra Properties</a>”. See also “<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/extra-properties">How to add extra properties to an access token</a>” in&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/">Authlete Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
<p>However, note that it is not a smart way to associate detailed information such as amount of money with an access token directly. Instead, a recommended way is to (1) store detailed transaction information into another database and (2) associate the unique identifier of the database record with an access token.</p>
 Authorization Details 
<p>Since the version 2.2, Authlete supports “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>” (RAR). The standard specification adds a request/response parameter,&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>&nbsp;parameter is used to enable an access token to hold detailed information about authorization.&nbsp;For example, detailed information about payment such as “How much?”, “To whom?”, etc.</p>
<p>According to the specification, the&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>&nbsp;parameter can be used anywhere the&nbsp;<code>scope</code> parameter is used. For instance, (a) in the authorization request, (b) in the token response, (c) in the introspection response, and so on.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (a) authorization_details in Authorization Request (RAR Section 3)

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (b) authorization_details in Token Response (RAR Section 7)

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (c) authorization_details in Introspection Response (RAR Section 8.2)
<p>RAR is an open standard to describe details about authorization and tie the information to an access token. RAR is to be adopted as a component of FAPI 2.0 (cf. “Are there FAPI 2.0 implementations?” in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>).</p>
<p>Authlete’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/definitive_guide/extra_properties/">Extra Properties</a>&nbsp;can be used for the same purpose. One functional difference is that Extra Properties can choose to expose or hide extra properties. Hidden extra properties never appear in any OAuth/OIDC responses but can be retrieved by Authlete’s introspection API (<a href="http://docs.authlete.com/#auth-introspection-api">/auth/introspection API</a>). There are some use cases where you want to tie information to an access token but hide the information from the client application and the user. In such cases, Extra Properties is useful.</p>
 Finally 
<p>Thank you for reading this long post till the end.</p>
<p>Authlete has already supports the FAPI 1.0 Final version and known technical specifications of FAPI 2.0&nbsp;as mentioned in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>. You can try FAPI through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/tutorial/">Authlete API Tutorials</a>&nbsp;with an Authlete account (<a href="https://so.authlete.com/accounts/signup">signup</a>).</p>

 Gordian Work 

<p>Our advances on Gordian were linked to a large-scale transition in the meaning of the Gordian system. Prior to 2021, we were offering a variety of applications, but we were simultaneously working with companies to create specifications. This created a real tension. Now that we’ve seen the beginnings of adoption of our best practices, we’ve been able to change the focus of our applications from being consumer-focused to being exemplars for other companies to study. In Q2, we expect this to mature into a Gordian Seal™ program that denotes companies who are producing products that follow the Gordian principles and our best practices. Like similar projects such as the FIDO Alliance, we expect the Gordian Seal to make it easier for everyone in the blockchain ecosystem to work together, creating  bizdev and interoperability opportunities.</p>

<p>Gordian Testing. Blockchain Commons now has three iOS reference apps available for public beta testing via Apple’s Testflight: <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/sJTaoUsM">Gordian Cosigner</a>, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/0LIl6H1h">Gordian Guardian</a>, and <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8">Guardian Wallet</a>. Wallet was our original app, recently updated to support the newest Lifehash and <code>crypto-request</code> features; Cosigner is the companion signing app that we introduced last quarter; and Guardian is our newest release, a key-storage tool for iOS. As reference apps, these projects are mainly meant as exemplars, demonstrating the best practices and principles suggested by the Gordian architecture as well as exemplifying how multiple apps can interact through Airgaps and Universal Resources (URs). See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TosqR8a2OXg">our video</a> for a real-life example of Gordian Cosigner, Guardian, and Wallet working together to securely create a multisig account and sign a PSBT, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> that demonstrates AirGap signing between LetheKit and Gordian Cosigner.</p>

<p>Independent Recovery. We are already working to split a new app, “Gordian Recovery”, off of Gordian Guardian. One of our best practices for the Gordian system demands that a user can recover funds from a Gordian-approved wallet even if the company producing it disappears. Gordian Recovery will provide one way to do so, allowing a user to independently use the app to recover and sweep funds held in a multisig wallet, no matter the status of the wallet manufacturer. At its debut, we expect Gordian Recovery to support at least three different companies with their own multisig hardware or software wallet systems. Generally, Guardian Recovery, like Gordian Cosigner, demonstrates how Blockchain Commons will interact with the wallet ecosystem by providing not just specifications, best practices, and references, but also complementary apps that can support third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Keytool Updates. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli">keytool CLI (command-line interface) app</a> also received major upgrades in Q1. We expanded it to support the new UR (Universal Resource) <code>crypto-request</code> and <code>crypto-response</code> features that add support for arbitrary requests. This is a first step in moving away from the <code>m/48'</code> derivation used by current hardware wallets for multisig, which often results in master or cosigner xpub reuse and thus a risk to privacy. This means that we now have the infrastructure to demonstrate different solutions to the problems of <code>m/48'</code>xpub reuse, but there’s still a lot of legacy use cases that need to be resolved. (We also reviewed one solution for the <code>m/48'</code> derivation problem and found it unnecessarily complex, so: onward.)</p>

<p>Lifehash Improvements. Most of the Gordian specifications that we’ve created while working with our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> focus on interoperability, particularly moving data across airgaps. Lifehash is something else: it’s a user-interface specification meant to give users trust in the continuity of cryptocurrency accounts without having to depend on reading text addresses, which aren’t user-intuitive. Instead, Lifehash creates unique, colored icons for each account that remain consistent over time. This quarter, we adjusted the colors used by Lifehash so that they look better in black &amp; white printing, and simultaneously experimented with dithering on the 200x200 LetheKit display, to ensure that we could display meaningful information on a worst-case small black &amp; white display.</p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p>Lethekit Updates. The DIY <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit/">LetheKit</a> has been our prime reference for testing hardware implementations of our Gordian best practices. Not only did we test it out with dithered Lifehashes last quarter, but we also were able to use its display to test out animated QRs for transferring PSBTs. It worked! (Albeit, slowly.) See also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> of LetheKit exporting derived keys to Gordian Signer.</p>

<p>Gordian Adoption. Finally, as noted, we’re very happy to see continued adoption of Gordian. Last quarter, we talked about all of the software and library development being done by wallet companies. This quarter, we’re seeing more companies committing to including SSKRs (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction), URs (Universal Resources), and other Gordian features in their wallets. <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a> has been expanding its capabilities, while <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a> was the newest to announce their integration of some UR features, including animated PSBTs. Foundation and Sparrow have both been working with us for a while: we’re thrilled to see both hardware and software wallet companies incorporating Blockchain Commons specifications! We’re also aware of two more software-wallet companies who haven’t made announcements yet, and we’ve been extensively working with a third company to produce a Gordian-approved wallet that entirely matches our principles and best practices and adds on some great UI besides. We can now announce that third company is Bitmark …</p>

<p>Autonomy Architecting. Blockchain Commons has been working with Bitmark to design Autonomy, a bitcoin wallet and digital assets manager. Their goal is to make it easy for families to gain independence and preserve generational wealth. Autonomy combines a mobile app with your own dedicated full node running privately in the cloud. We used a partitioned architecture (keys across app+node) and a personal recovery network (using SSKR) to remove all single points of failure. When you transact, everything is multisig between your app and full node. Any single key can fail and you won’t lose your funds. Nothing else like this currently exists in the market.</p>

 Other Advances 

<p>Here’s some details on our other major projects:</p>

<p>Multisig Documents. This quarter, we released our first major expansion to our #SmartCustody tutorials since 2019: a 10,000-word document on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">Designing Multisig for Independence &amp; Resilience</a>. The state of multisig wasn’t sufficiently advanced to provide specific advice when we originally wrote #SmartCustody, so we’re now happy to include it by breaking down the design of multisig addresses into theoretical, transactional, operational, and functional elements and providing design patterns and examples to help you put those elements together. Want to know why Blockchain Commons is today focused on multisig technology and how to create them to meet your own needs? It’s all here.</p>

<p>DID Recommendation. We’ve been working with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a> since it was incubated at early <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting-the-Web-of-Trust workshops</a>, and co-authored by Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen. We’re thrilled that it’s now a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Candidate Recommendation</a>. There might still be revisions and new candidates, but this is the beginning of the last stage in creating an official internet standard for decentralized identity on the internet.</p>

<p>DID Method Expansion. Meanwhile, Blockchain Commons is doing its own work on DIDs, with a new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/did-method-onion">did:onion method implementation</a>. We’re happy to say that <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce Systems</a> is already considering it for their DID resolver. We’re also considering returning to work on our own <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">BTCR DID method</a>, which was one of the first DID methods, but has gotten somewhat out of date with recent updates to Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Apt Packages. We have produced apt packages for installing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli">seedtool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli">keytool</a> for use with Debian and Tails OSes. This is a first step in providing support tools for human-rights activists, which we expect to get more emphasis in our work in Q3.</p>

<p>Legislative Work. Finally, Christopher Allen’s work with legislatures multiplied last quarter. In Wyoming, he led efforts that resulted in the <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">Wyoming Digital Identity Act</a>, which includes a specific definition of digital identity that works toward the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of self-sovereign identity</a>. Work on a private-key-protection bill was less successful, as it had to be withdrawn after being spoiled by an amendment. Christopher has also recently testified before legislatures in <a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/testimony/HIBL-3024-20210208-5787-F-ALLEN_CHRISTOPHER.pdf">North Dakota</a> and Nevada. This is all crucial work because actual engineering will ultimately be limited and directed by what states legislate, so we want to make sure the laws fit the technology and the needs of the individual.</p>

<p>Intern Search. We’re thrilled that our Summer 2021 internship program has been sponsored by the <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1366880813845909506">Humans Rights Foundation</a>. We’ve thus put out <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/32">a call for interns</a>, and we’re expanding our usual development work to also include direct support for activists, who need help to maintain their privacy in potentially hostile regimes. However, to really support activists requires knowing what they need. So, we’re also considering working with interns to do research and conduct interviews to create user engagement models for activists. This would be similar to the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira model</a> from RWOT. If you are interested in having developers work with or mentor blockchain interns, want to suggest intern projects, or even have engineers who might be interested in working on Blockchain Commons projects briefly during the summer, <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">please mail us</a>.</p>

<p>Taproot &amp; Schnorr First Steps. We may see a major upgrade for Bitcoin as soon as this fall, if Speedy Trial is approved for Taproot and Schnorr. The first will increase privacy for #SmartCustody features such as timelocks and multisig, while the second will allow aggregated multisig, which offer several advantages over traditional ECDSA signatures. Our brand-new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign CLI</a> app provides the first experimental support for Schnorr signatures leveraging the Taproot/Schnorr BIPS, but independent from <code>bitcoind</code>. More to come as we ramp up to this expansion.</p>

 Supporting the Future 

<p>We’ve laid out our initial roadmap for the next two cycles of Blockchain Commons efforts, covering spring and summer. Important topics includes finalizing our Gordian Seal program, solving problems with xpub reuse in Bitcon multisig, supporting and advancing SSKR (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction) for not just cryptographic seeds but other data, continuing to support and advance URs (Universal Resources) with encrypted and/or signed CBOR, and architecting a new QuickConnect 2.0 for initiating TorGap-based services between peers. If you’d like to know more about our roadmap, especially if you considering becoming a sustaining sponsor or to sponsor a specific project on our roadmap, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us directly</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to support our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can continue to work new specifications, architectures, reference applications, and reference libraries to be used by the whole community, please become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a>. You can alternatively make a one-time bitcoin donation at our <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">BTCPay</a>.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 13 April 2021 — Today Energy Web announced a new initiative, funded by a €1 million grant from Google.org’s Impact Challenge program, to provide a digital framework for coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) across the transmission and distribution market interface of Europe’s power grid. <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/who-we-are/what-is-climate-kic/">Climate-KIC</a>, the EU’s leading knowledge and innovation community focused on climate, helped to select winning grantees.</p><p>The initiative will leverage the open-source Energy Web stack to make it easy for prosumers and DERs to register and participate in local and regional energy markets. Working with mobile network operators, IoT service providers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and grid operators across Europe, the initiative will foster the procurement of flexibility services in a transparent, non-discriminatory, and market-based way, as prioritized by the <a href="https://acer.europa.eu/en/Electricity/CLEAN_ENERGY_PACKAGE">EU Clean Energy&nbsp;Package</a>.</p><p>Energy Web’s grant comes from the <a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/climate2020">Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate</a>, which commits €10M to fund bold ideas that aim to use technology to accelerate Europe’s progress toward a greener, more-resilient future. It is expected to accelerate the strong momentum Energy Web has already generated working with European grid operators. This grant and initiative will build upon existing open-source software developed to support near-identical use cases with transmission system operators (TSOs) Austrian Power Grid, 50 Hertz, and Elia as well as distribution system operators (DSOs) Electra Caldense and Fluvius. The common theme across these projects is easing the digitization, registration, and participation of DERs in energy markets managed by both DSOs and TSOs. More recently, this same architecture underpinned <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/bebat-launches-easybat-an-open-source-decentralized-solution-for-battery-lifecycle-management-281f2ace61e9">EasyBat</a>, used to track the lifecycle of residential and commercial batteries in&nbsp;Belgium.</p><p>“This Google.org grant and the work it will fund supporting a pan-European electric flexibility market is the culmination of Energy Web’s mission to enable any customer and any asset to participate in any energy market,” explained Walter Kok, CEO of Energy Web. “We are able to harness the flexibility of prosumers to provide value throughout the electricity value chain to make DERs the backbone of the European&nbsp;grid.”</p><p>The initiative will focus on integrating the Energy Web stack with a number of electricity market participants, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Mobile Network Operators: in order to assign digital identities to all GSM-enabled energy assets via SIM&nbsp;cards.  IoT Service Providers: in order to co-develop SIM cards with electricity-sector roaming capabilities (i.e., independent of the Mobile Network Operator) that will allow energy assets to directly register with the Energy Web technology stack.  OEMs: in order to enable new generations of energy assets to directly embed an identity on the&nbsp;stack.  DSOs / TSOs: once integrated, DSOs will be able to tap into the flexible capacity of DERs connected to their networks and use them to procure flexibility. Likewise, TSOs will be able to simultaneously leverage DERs for regional / national markets in support of safer, greener, more-resilient electricity grids.  <p>Since it is common for Mobile Network Operators, IoT service providers, and payment solution providers to operate their own proprietary data systems and architectures, the project will ensure interoperability between these systems — including multiple blockchains — and the public Energy Web stack. Ultimately, at least 1 million DERs will integrate into electricity markets as part of the Google.org-funded project.</p><p>“We have received an overwhelming number of applications for our Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate,” said Rowan Barnett, head of Google.org in EMEA and APAC. “The Energy Web project is so exciting because it has tremendous transformative potential, not just for Europe, but for power grids around the world. We are catching a glimpse of the future electricity system — one that is inherently decentralized and democratized.”</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://energyweb.org.">https://energyweb.org.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/google-backs-energy-web-to-harmonize-low-carbon-electricity-markets-across-europe-204c18cd2f12">Google Backs Energy Web to Harmonize Low-Carbon Electricity Markets Across Europe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Clouds hover over the horizon. The San Gabriel foothills smell of sage and soil after the rain. I feel my muscles begin to relax for the first time in a&nbsp;while.</p><p>I’m not alone. Though serious hurdles remain in the United States and globally, increasing numbers of American adults see hope on the horizon. A recurring Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-coronavirus-americans-hope-4bcc2761-82f0-43d0-b9eb-552f6a9ada71.html">poll</a> shows “hopeful” taking the lead over “stressed” and “frustrated” for the first time since the pandemic began. Roughly one-third of US adults have been vaccinated; the rest will be eligible by the end of April. Recent jobs reports show signs of an economy waking from hibernation. The American Rescue Plan and proposed American Jobs Plan would invest a combined $4 trillion in recovery and infrastructure.</p><p>These new possibilities bring a rush of questions. What does life look like after the pandemic for my community; my generation? How will we juggle work, education, and care to make ends meet? Whose lives and livelihoods are valued? After a year of isolation, where will we find belonging?</p><blockquote>When we look back on 2020, will we remember it as the year everything changed?</blockquote><p>“Disasters are extraordinarily generative,” Rebecca Solnit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/books/excerpt-paradise-built-in-hell.html">writes</a>, but “there is no simple formula for what arises: it has everything to do with who or what individuals or communities were before the disaster.”</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">Our new PORTALS report</a> imagines possible futures arising out of today’s disasters. It is the latest installment of the annual <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/trends-to-watch-in-2020-beyond-16d457bf6b48">Trends to Watch</a> series, curated by our Exploration and Future Sensing team to support Omidyar Network’s mission of reimagining systems to build more inclusive and equitable societies. Across our focus areas of <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagining Capitalism</a>, <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology-2/">Responsible Technology</a>, and <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">Pluralism</a>, the work of “reimagining” requires that we interrogate our own assumptions about how systems need to change by <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">listening to diverse viewpoints</a>.</p><p>Created in collaboration with <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a>, the 2021 report distills four open-ended provocations, designed to stir imagination and action, from a yearlong process of collective foresight. Between November 2019 and February 2021, the Guild invited 1,000 people to participate in a series of virtual sessions asking how systems that shape our daily lives could become more just and inclusive by 2036. A critical part of looking ahead was also looking back at how we arrived at today’s social, economic, and political realities.</p><p>Here are the provocations:</p>  What if shared well-being became the standard of success for our&nbsp;nations?  Are we ready to move from an era that rewards extraction to one that prioritizes regeneration?  How will we move from an era of destabilizing information into an age of trusted&nbsp;wisdom?  Can we dismantle industrial-age silos between work, home, education, play, and community?  <p>Each one pairs with a “Spectrum of Possibility” exercise to stir your own thinking about how imagined futures could become reality. Taken together, we hope that these provocations offer useful foundations for people working now to build tomorrow’s systems.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">Download the full report&nbsp;here</a>. <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=5">What if shared well-being became the standard of success for our&nbsp;nations?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=14">Are we ready to move from an era that rewards extraction to one that prioritizes regeneration?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=23">How will we move from an era of destabilizing information into an age of trusted&nbsp;wisdom?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=32">Can we dismantle industrial-age silos between work, home, education, play, and community?</a><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">The PORTALS report</a> is a collaboration between Omidyar Network and the Guild of Future Architects.

<p>The Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) has been developed jointly by UN/CEFACT and OASIS as the successor to the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) version 1.3 and the OASIS Business Document Envelope (BDE) Version 1.1.</p>



<p>XHE defines a business-oriented artefact either referencing (as a header) or containing (as an envelope) a payload of one or more business documents or other artefacts with supplemental semantic information about the collection of payloads as a whole. An exchange header envelope describes contextual information important to the sender and receiver about the payloads, without having to modify the payloads in any fashion. This vocabulary is modeled using the UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification Version 2.01.</p>



<p>The TC received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ph-xhe open source project, Chasquis Consulting, and Efact [5].</p>

 It was business as&nbsp;usual <p>‘’Human rights protected offline should also be protected online’’</p><p>This was the resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) — the <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/38/L.10/Rev.1">resolution</a> on “the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet” at the 38th Session of the Human Rights Council of July 2018 which affirmed what we all held sacrosanct — that digital rights are human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Internet and digital access have <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ITU_regional_global_Key_ICT_indicator_aggregates_Nov_2020.xlsx">deepened</a> across Africa in the past 20 years, in the process ushering in new vistas of human development. An important dimension of this development has been the expansion of new media, where new technologies such as social media have <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-new-media-platforms-have-become-powerful-across-africa-107294">given voices</a> to the hitherto voiceless and amplifying once stifled perspectives.</p><p>Given that the tight control many authoritarian regimes on the continent exercised relied on having a tight grip on public discourse, the Internet and the new media it spawned soon ran into <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37300272">cross hairs</a> with governments from Cairo to Cape Town. Africa has one of the most censored digital environments in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pushing back against this censorship is a community of digital rights defenders. A basic, yet important tool in their efforts to promote media freedom is <a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018/05/23/why-and-how-do-we-document-the-impact-of-rights-violations/">documentation</a>. In the aid of digital rights defenders everywhere, here’s a summary of some of the most important developments in digital rights in Africa in Q1&nbsp;2021.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/human-humanity-silhouettes-camera-109103/">Pixabay</a> Internet shutdowns and website&nbsp;blocks <p>Sage-like, I had <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">written presciently</a> in the first week of January that it was not a matter of if, rather when Internet shutdowns will occur in 2021. Like clockwork, the first Internet <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/uganda-shuts-down-internet-during-presidential-election/av-56243961">shutdown</a> happened shortly later in Uganda on January 13 on the eve of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55649467">Presidential elections</a> which saw young activist Robert Kyagulanyi (aka Bobi Wine) challenge Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan President. The Internet shutdown was ordered by the government in retaliation for Facebook’s move to block a number of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-uganda-election-facebook-idUSKBN29G1H9">pro-government accounts</a>.</p><p>On November 4 2020, the Ethiopian government cut off <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/ethiopia-telephone-internet-services-tigray-2731442">telephone and Internet service</a> in the northern region of Tigray at the commencement of military offensive against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The restrictions on telephone and Internet service persisted into 2021. Curiously, numerous Twitter accounts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/17/ethiopias-cracking-down-tigray-activists-are-spreading-news/">were created</a> elsewhere in the country in the following days to fill the information vacuum created in the Tigray&nbsp;region.</p><p>Following opposition protests after run-off elections in Niger on February 21, mobile Internet service providers <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/niger-election-internet-blackout/">disrupted service</a>. The election was won by Mohamed Bazoum, a former Interior Minister and candidate of the ruling party in the first <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56175439">democratic transition</a> in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>On March 5, Facebook, YouTube, and Whatsapp were <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/social-media-and-messaging-apps-disrupted-in-senegal-amid-political-unrest-eA1R5pBp">restricted</a> on the Orange/Sonatel network in Senegal following protests against the arrest of opposition politician Ousmane Sonko of the Pastef party. Ousmane Sonko had been earlier accused of rape — an allegation he claimed was <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/03/05/senegal-blocks-social-media/">politically motivated</a>.</p><p>On Election day March 21, there was a disruption to Internet connectivity in Congo. The election, won by incumbent President Dennis Sassou Nguesso who was seeking his fourth term in office, was marked by low <a href="https://www.africanews.com/2021/03/21/congo-election-low-voter-turn-out-internet-shutdown-mark-polls//">voter turn-out</a>. The major opponent to the incumbent Guy-Brice Parfait Kolélas died of Covid-19 on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56474855">election day</a>, after being flown out to France for medical attention.</p><p>In January, People’s Gazette, a critical website in Nigeria, was <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2021/01/28/nigerian-government-blocks-peoples-gazette-website-over-critical-media-reports">blocked</a> ostensibly from orders from the Nigerian government following an <a href="https://www.gazettengr.com/atiku-rsf-global-rights-gatefield-others-condemn-nigerian-govts-blocking-of-peoples-gazette-website/">investigative report</a> about senior officials of the President.</p> Legal and Policy developments <p>In Kenya, the Finance Act of 2019 empowered the Kenya Revenue Authority to announce a Digital Services Tax in 2020. The tax came into <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/12/tnf-kenya-digital-services-tax-regulations-effective-date-2021.html#:~:text=Overview%20of%20the%20digital%20services,of%20the%20gross%20transaction%20value.&amp;text=The%20digital%20services%20tax%20will,services%20through%20a%20digital%20marketplace.">effect</a> on January 1 2021. The tax is 1.5% of the total value of business services <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-47639452?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_live&amp;ns_linkname=6006b04354a69202e80dcf9f%26Kenya%27s%20digital%20tax%20will%20%27undermine%20online%20businesses%27%262021-01-19T15%3A44%3A49.875Z&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:f0b242e5-daae-48c4-b704-ae3e99075ddc&amp;pinned_post_asset_id=6006b04354a69202e80dcf9f&amp;pinned_post_type=share">rendered</a> through online platforms and is expected to hinder the development of online businesses.</p><p>Also in Kenya, the Statute Law Miscellaneous Amendment Act, an amendment to the Official Secrets Act, was signed on December 11 2020. According to AccessNow, it gives sweeping <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/kenya-right-to-privacy/">powers</a> to the Cabinet Secretary of Interior and Coordination of National Security to access data from any phone or computer.</p><p>In a landmark judgment in <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/4416/south-african-constitutional-court-declares-bulk-surveillance-powers-unlawful">favour</a> of privacy in February, South Africa’s Constitutional Court declared the bulk interception of communications by the country’s spy agencies unlawful. The case was based <a href="https://www.techfinancials.co.za/2021/02/15/top-court-ruling-on-south-africas-spy-law-is-a-victory-for-privacy-but-loopholes-remain/">on evidence</a> that the state spied on investigative journalist Stephen Patrick Sole of amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism while communicating with a source. The applicants including amaBhungane Centre argued that the Regulation of Interception of Communications Act of 2002 (RICA) and the National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994 (NSIA) violate the right to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>In Uganda, the Tax Amendment Bills, 2021 is before Parliament for debate. If passed into law, will take effect from 1st July 2021. Among its goals are <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ug/Documents/tax/Uganda%20Draft%20Tax%20Amendment%20Bills%20Highlights%202021-2022.pdf?id=ke:2sm:3tw:4%23TaxAlert,%23Tax::6tax:20210401144115::4687826861:5&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_campaign=%23TaxAlert,%23Tax&amp;utm_content=tax&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;linkId=115105719">repealing</a> the top services (OTT) tax (reducing the rate of over the top tax from 20% to 12%) and introducing a new tax on internet&nbsp;data.</p><p>Zambia enacted a Cybersecurity and <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/acts/Act%20No.%202%20of%202021The%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Cyber%20Crimes.pdf">Cybercrime Act</a> which gives sweeping powers to the government to exercise greater control over social media and conduct communications surveillance without a court order. The Law has been quickly <a href="https://misa.org/news/zambias-newly-enacted-cybercrime-law-challenged-in-court/">challenged</a> in the High Court of Zambia by a coalition of civil society organizations who are praying the court to declare the law unconstitutional.</p> Arrests and detentions <p>In Zimbabwe Devine Panashe Maregere and his wife Vongai Nomatter Chiminya were both arrested in January for sending <a href="https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/africa/couple-detained-for-claiming-mnangagwa-died-of-covid-19-3272772">a message</a> on WhatsApp claiming that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had died of Covid-19. They were charged at Beitbridge magistrate court with publishing or communicating falsehoods.</p><p>On February 9 2021 Innocent Bahati, a poet and singer was <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/30/rwanda-arrests-prosecutions-over-youtube-posts">reported missing</a>. He was last seen a few prior in Nyanza, Southern Province. Innocent’s poems, which he recited in videos posted on YouTube, focused on issues such as poverty or criticism of the government, for which he had once been detained.</p> Countering Business as usual in Q2&nbsp;2021 <p>Why digital rights violations persist in the most brazen forms such as Internet shutdowns and clampdowns on freedom of expression in Africa has roots in the broader dysfunctional state of politics and society in general on the continent. We can only improve human rights standards when there has been a more fundamental change in the way our societies are run — which will include key institutional reforms in electoral democracy and economic justice. It is a campaign we’ve <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">commenced</a> in Q1 2021 and will gladly continue in Q2&nbsp;2021.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/what-happened-with-digital-rights-in-africa-in-q1-2021-93a890cf3e2d">What happened with digital rights in Africa in Q1 2021?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity</p><p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, "v1" so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p> What exactly is a “Sidetree”? <p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. &nbsp;Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains-- but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the &nbsp;Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF members.</p> The team that delivered the specification <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA, USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON, Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. &nbsp;Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX, USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p> The first generation of Sidetree Systems <p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey &nbsp;has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION network.   What's next for Sidetree  <p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p>

<p>Digital health passes — often mischaracterized as “vaccine passports” in the popular press — are making headlines as a key component in the drive to restore global travel and restart the global economy after the massive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Enabling individuals to receive and selectively share proof-of-test, proof-of-vaccination, and proof-of-recovery with the highest standards for security, privacy and data protection will allow destination countries and travel systems worldwide to accept credentials from multiple market vendors. But concerns related to equity and access can only be addressed if these health pass implementations are designed to be interoperable.</p>



<p>As the leading global consortium for interoperable digital trust infrastructure, the ToIP Foundation has partnered with the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> –&nbsp;a project of <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> –&nbsp;to host a new Working Group focused on the core issues of interoperability, privacy, and equity for digital health passes. The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pahttps://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73790">Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass </a>consists of nine drafting groups, each focused on a specific interoperability challenge as defined in the<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GHPC-Interoperability-Blueprint-Outline-v2.pdf"> Interoperability Blueprint Outline</a>.</p>



<p>“The Good Health Pass Collaborative is bringing people together to solve a set of problems that affect the entire world,” said John Jordan, executive director of the ToIP Foundation. “This ambitious effort uniquely aligns with the mission of ToIP because it requires interoperable digital credentials that can be accepted and verified anywhere they are needed. Getting this right, and doing so now, will not only make it safe for people to travel again, it will open the door for new tools and services that can solve other challenging problems that also require global-scale digital trust. For these reasons, ToIP is honored to contribute to this urgent global mission by hosting the Interoperability Working Group on behalf of the Good Health Pass Collaborative.”</p>



<p>Each drafting group, consisting of volunteer representatives from around the world representing the health, travel, technology, and policy sectors, will first conduct an intensive 30-day sprint to develop an initial set of draft recommendations. This will be followed by a second 30 day community and public review process to develop a final set of recommendations.</p>



<p>“Digital health passes –&nbsp;If properly designed and implemented –&nbsp;could offer a path to safely restore domestic and international travel, resume certain aspects of public life, and restart the global economy,“ said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “Collaboration is critical at this juncture. Our organizations share a commitment to ensuring that digital health passes are designed and implemented in ways that serve the needs of the individuals and institutions that rely on them, while simultaneously protecting core values like privacy, civil liberties, and equity. ToIP has developed a powerful set of tools and models for digital trust frameworks, and we are delighted to be partnering with them in this critically important effort.”</p>



<p>The nine drafting groups collaborating within the new Working Group are:</p>



  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Paper+Based+Credentials+Drafting+Group">Paper Based Credentials</a> will define how a paper-based alternative can be created for any digital health pass so access will be available to all.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Consistent+User+Experience+Drafting+Group">Consistent User Experience</a> will specify the common elements required so that individuals can easily, intuitively, and safely use digital health pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Standard+Data+Models+and+Elements+Drafting+Group">Standard Data Models and Elements</a> will determine the core data items needed across all digital health pass implementations for both COVID-19 testing and vaccinations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Credential+Formats%2C+Signatures%2C+and+Exchange+Protocols+Drafting+Group">Credential Formats, Signatures, and Exchange Protocols</a> will specify the requirements for technical interoperability of Good Health Pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Security%2C+Privacy%2C+and+Data+Protection+Drafting+Group">Security, Privacy, and Data Protection</a> will define the safety requirements for Good Health Pass compliant implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registries+Drafting+Group">Trust Registries</a> will specify how verifiers can confirm that a digital health pass has been issued by an authorized issuer.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Rules+Engines+Drafting+Group">Rules Engines</a> will define how digital health pass apps can access different sources of policy information to determine what test or vaccination status is needed for a specific usage scenario.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Identity+Binding+Drafting+Group">Identity Binding</a> will specify the options for verifying that the holder of a digital health pass is the individual who received the test or vaccination credential.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Framework+Drafting+Group">Governance Framework</a> will define the overall set of policies that must be followed for an implementation to qualify as Good Health Pass compliant.  



<p>By adhering to the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint that will be synthesized from the outputs of these nine drafting groups, airlines, airports, hospitality industries, international customs officials and others will be able to process visitors easily without requiring additional unnecessary steps mandated by proprietary systems. Travelers will not be confused about which credential they need for each point of verification. Moreover, since individuals will be fully in control of their own personal data in credentials in their own wallets or devices, they can be confident that their private health data is not being tracked or misused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested organizations are invited to join the ToIP Foundation to participate directly in this new Working Group or in the public comment period in May. They are also encouraged to join the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> at ID2020 to participate in the construction, adoption, and advocacy of the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p>

<p>Ceramic is a public, permissionless, open source protocol that provides computation, state transformations, and consensus for all types of data structures stored on the decentralized web. Ceramic's stream processing enables developers to build with dynamic information without trusted database servers to create powerful, secure, trustless, censorship-resistant applications.</p><p>This overview introduces how:</p>  Decentralized content computation gives rise to a new era of open source information  Stream processing provides an appropriate framework for dynamic, decentralized content  You can use Ceramic to replace your database with a truly decentralized alternative  <p>To skip ahead and get started building, try <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> to demo Ceramic in a browser application, the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI, or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p><p>This post was originally published on the Ceramic documentation site. Contents here may fall out of date, but you can always find the most up to date version <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">here</a>.</p> The internet of open source information <p>At its core, the internet is a collection of applications running on stateful data sources – from identity systems and user tables to databases and feeds for storing all kinds of content generated by users, services, or machines.</p><p>Most of the information on today's internet is locked away on application-specific database servers designed to protect data as a proprietary resource. Acting as a trusted middleman, applications make it difficult and opaque for others to access this information by requiring explicit permissions, one-off API integrations, and trust that returned state is correct. This siloed and competitive environment results in more friction for developers and worse experiences for users.</p><p>Along other dimensions, the web has rapidly evolved into a more open source, composable, and collaborative ecosystem. We can observe this trend in open source software enabled by Git's distributed version control and in open source finance enabled by blockchain's double-spend protection. The same principles of open source have not yet been applied to content.</p><p>The next wave of transformative innovation will be in applying the same open source principles to the world's information, unlocking a universe of content that can be frictionlessly shared across application or organizational boundaries. Achieving this requires a decentralized computation network designed specifically for content with flexibility, scalability, and composability as first class requirements.</p> Decentralized content computation <p>Open sourcing the content layer for applications requires deploying information to a public, permissionless environment where files can be stored, computation can be performed, state can be tracked, and others can easily access content.</p><p>Advancements in other Web3 protocols have already achieved success in decentralized file storage. As a universal file system for the decentralized web, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (including <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> and <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a>) provides an extremely flexible content naming and routing system. As a storage disk, durable persistence networks (such as <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>, and <a href="https://sia.tech/">Sia</a>) ensure that the content represented in IPFS files are persisted and kept available. This stack of Web3 protocols performs well for storing static files, but on its own lacks the computation and state management capacity for more advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. These are required to enable developers to build fully-featured decentralized applications.</p><p>Ceramic enables static files to be composed into higher-order mutable data structures, programmed to behave in any desired manner, and whose resulting state is stored and replicated across a decentralized network of nodes. Ceramic builds upon and extends the IPFS file system and underlying persistence networks, as well as other open standards in the decentralized ecosystem, with a general-purpose decentralized content computation substrate. Due to Ceramic's permissionless design and unified global network, anyone in the world can openly create, discover, query, and build upon existing data without needing to trust a centralized server, integrate one-off APIs, or worry if the state of information being returned is correct.</p> Streams <p>Ceramic's decentralized content computation network is modeled after various stream processing frameworks found in Web2. In these types of systems, events are ingested, processed as they arrive, and the resulting output is applied to a log. When queried and reduced, this log represents the current state of a piece of information. This is an appropriate framework for conceptualizing how dynamic information should be modeled on the decentralized web. Furthermore because the function that processes incoming events on any particular stream can be custom written with logic for any use case, it provides the general-purpose flexibility and extensibility needed to represent the diversity of information that may exist on the web.</p><p>On Ceramic, each piece of information is represented as an append-only log of commits, called a Stream. Each stream is a DAG stored in IPLD, with an immutable name called a StreamID, and a verifiable state called a StreamState. Streams are similar in concept to Git trees, and each stream can be thought of as its own blockchain, ledger, or event log.</p> StreamTypes <p>Each stream must specify a StreamType, which is the processing logic used by the particular stream. A StreamType is essentially a function that is executed by a Ceramic node upon receipt of a new commit to the stream that governs the stream's state transitions and resulting output. StreamTypes are responsible for enforcing all rules and logic for the stream, such as data structure, content format, authentication or access control, and consensus algorithm. If an update does not conform to the logic specified by the StreamType, the update is disregarded. After applying a valid commit to the stream, the resulting StreamState is broadcast out to the rest of the nodes on the Ceramic Network. Each of the other nodes that are also maintaining this stream will update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.</p><p>Ceramic's flexible StreamTypes framework enables developers to deploy any kind of information that conforms to any set of arbitrary rules as a stateful stream of events. Ceramic clients come pre-packaged with a standard set of StreamTypes that cover a wide range of common use cases, making it easy to get started building applications:</p>  Tile Document: a StreamType that stores a JSON document, providing similar functionality as a NoSQL document store. Tile Documents are frequently used as a database replacement for identity metadata (profiles, social graphs, reputation scores, linked social accounts), user-generated content (blog posts, social media, etc), indexes of other StreamIDs to form collections and user tables (IDX), DID documents, verifiable claims, and more. Tile Documents rely on DIDs for authentication and all valid updates to a stream must be signed by the DID that controls the stream.  CAIP-10 Link: a StreamType that stores a cryptographically verifiable proof that links a blockchain address to a DID. A DID can have an unlimited number of CAIP-10 Links that bind it to many different addresses on many different blockchain networks. CAIP-10 Links also rely on DIDs for authentication, same as the Tile Document.  Custom: You can implement your own StreamType and deploy it to your Ceramic node if the pre-packaged StreamTypes are not suitable for your use case.   Authentication <p>StreamTypes are able to specify their authentication requirements for how new data is authorized to be added to a particular stream. Different StreamTypes may choose to implement different authentication requirements. One of the most powerful and important authentication mechanisms that Ceramic StreamTypes support is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, the W3C standard for decentralized identifiers. DIDs are used by the default StreamTypes (Tile Documents and CAIP-10 Links).</p><p>DIDs provide a way to go from a globally-unique, platform-agnostic string identifier to a DID document containing public keys for signature verification and encryption. Ceramic is capable of supporting any DID method implementation. Below, find the DID methods that are currently supported by Ceramic:</p>  3ID DID Method: A DID method that uses Ceramic's Tile Document StreamType to represent a mutable DID document. 3IDs are typically used for end-user accounts. When 3IDs are used in conjunction with <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a> (as is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>), a 3ID can easily be controlled with any number of blockchain accounts from any L1 or L2 network. This provides a way to unify a user's identity across all other platforms.  Key DID Method: A DID method statically generated from any Ed25519 key pair. Key DIDs are typically used for developer accounts. Key DID is lightweight, but the drawback is that its DID document is immutable and has no ability to rotate keys if it is compromised.  NFT DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for any NFT on any blockchain. The DID document is statically generated from on-chain data. The DID associated to the blockchain account of the asset's current owner (using CAIP-10 Links) is the only entity authorized to act on behalf of the NFT DID, authenticate in DID-based systems, and make updates to streams or other data owned by the NFT DID. When ownership of the NFT changes, so does the controller permissions.  Safe DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for a Gnosis Safe smart contract on any blockchain. Typically used for organizations, DAOs, and other multi-sig entities.   Ceramic Network <p>The Ceramic Network is a decentralized, worldwide network of nodes running the Ceramic protocol that communicate over a dedicated topic on the Libp2p peer-to-peer networking protocol. Ceramic is able to achieve maximum horizontal scalability, throughput, and performance due to its unique design.</p> Sharded execution environment <p>Unlike traditional blockchain systems where scalability is limited to a single global virtual execution environment (VM) and the state of a single ledger is shared between all nodes, each Ceramic node acts as an individual execution environment for performing computations and validating transactions on streams – there is no global ledger. This "built-in" execution sharding enables the Ceramic Network to scale horizontally to parallelize the processing of an increasing number of simultaneous stream transactions as the number of nodes on the network increases. Such a design is needed to handle the scale of the world's data, which is orders of magnitude greater than the throughput needed on a financial blockchain. Another benefit of this design is that a Ceramic node can perform stream transactions in an offline-first environment and then later sync updates with the rest of the network when it comes back online.</p> Global namespace <p>Since all nodes are part of the same Ceramic Network, every stream on Ceramic exists within a single global namespace where it can be accessed by any other node or referenced by any other stream. This creates a public data web of open source information.</p> Additional node responsibilities <p>In addition to executing stream transactions according to StreamType logic, Ceramic nodes also maintain a few other key responsibilities:</p>  StreamState storage: A Ceramic node only persists StreamStates for the streams it cares to keep around, a process called "pinning." Different nodes will maintain StreamStates for different streams, but multiple nodes can maintain the state of a single stream.  Commit log storage: A Ceramic node maintains a local copy of all commits to the streams it is pinning.  Persistence connectors: Ceramic nodes can optionally utilize an additional durable storage backend for backing up commits for streams it is pinning. This can be any of the persistence networks mentioned above, including Filecoin, Arweave, Sia, etc. (coming soon).  Query responses: Ceramic nodes respond to stream queries from clients. If the node has the stream pinned it will return the response; if not, it will ask the rest of the network for the stream over libp2p and then return the response.  Broadcasting transactions: When a Ceramic node successfully performs a transaction on a stream, it broadcasts this transaction out the rest of the network over libp2p so other nodes also pinning this stream can update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.   Clients <p>Clients provide standard interfaces for performing transactions and queries on streams, and are installed into applications. Clients are also responsible for authenticating users and signing transactions.</p><p>Currently there are three clients for Ceramic. Additional client implementations can easily be developed in other programming languages:</p>  JS HTTP client: A lightweight JavaScript client which connects to a remote Ceramic node over HTTP. The JS HTTP client is recommended for application developers.  JS Core client: A JavaScript client which also includes a full Ceramic node. The JS Core client is for those who want the maximum decentralization of running the full Ceramic protocol directly in a browser application.  CLI: A command line interface for interacting with a Ceramic node.   Getting started  Try Ceramic <p>To experience how Ceramic works in a browser application, try the <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> app.</p> Installation <p>Getting started with Ceramic is simple. Visit the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p> Tools and services <p>In addition to various standards referenced throughout this document, the Ceramic community has already begun developing many different open source protocols, tools, and services that simplify the experience of developing on Ceramic. Here are a few notable examples:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect:</a> A authentication SDK for browser-based applications that allows your users to transact with Ceramic using their blockchain wallet.  <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX:</a> A protocol for decentralized identity that allows a DID to aggregate an index of all their data from across all apps in one place. IDX enables user-centric data storage, discovery, and interoperability. It is effectively a decentralized, cross-platform user table. IDX can reference all data source types, including Ceramic streams and other peer-to-peer databases and files.  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink:</a> A service that issues verifiable claims which prove a DID owns various other Web2 social accounts such as Twitter, Github, Discord, Discourse, Telegram, Instagram, etc. Once issued, claims are stored in the DID's IDX.  <a href="https://tiles.ceramic.community/">Tiles:</a> An explorer for the Ceramic Network.  <a href="http://documint.net/">Documint:</a> A browser-based IDE for creating and editing streams.

<p>The OpenID Foundation is proud to participate in the first ever ‘Identity Management Day,’ an annual awareness event that will take place on the second Tuesday in April each year. The inaugural Identity Management Day is&nbsp;April 13, 2021.</p>
<p>Founded by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/">Identity Defined Security Alliance</a>&nbsp;(IDSA), the mission of Identity Management Day is to educate business leaders and IT decision makers on the importance of identity management and key components including governance, identity-centric security best practices, processes, and technology, with a special focus on the dangers of not properly securing identities and access credentials.</p>
<p>In addition, the&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/">National Cyber Security Alliance</a>&nbsp;(NCSA) will provide guidance for consumers, to ensure that their online identities are protected through security awareness, best practices, and readily-available technologies.</p>
<p>From the point of view of an open identity standards development organization and with a hat tip to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Kim Cameron’s 7 Laws of Idenity</a>, here are my 7 Laws of Identity Standards:</p>
 
 A identity standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its implementations. 
 A standard’s value can be measured by the number of instances of certified technical conformance extant in the market. 
 Certified technical conformance is necessary but insufficient for global adoption. 
 Adoption at scale requires widespread awareness, ongoing technical improvement and a open and authoritative reference source. 
 When Libraries/Directories/ Registries act as authoritative sources they amplify awareness, extend adoption&nbsp;and promote&nbsp;certification. 
 Certified technical conformance importantly complements legal compliance and together optimize interoperability. 
 Interoperability&nbsp;enhances security, contains costs and drives profitability. 
 
<p>On behalf of the OpenID Foundation, I want to thank Julie Smith, Executive Director of the IDSA for her and her colleagues’ leadership. The OpenID Foundation looks forward to supporting this important event in the years to come.</p>

				 <p>Verifier Universal Interface (VUI) is an interoperability working group that aims at building a complete set of standard APIs for Verifier components in SSI ecosystems</p>
<p>As different technology providers build SSI solutions, it becomes critical to ensure interoperability between these solutions. Available standards for SSI still have important gaps, leading us to an ecosystem of full-stack providers whose approach to interoperability is building proprietary plug-ins for each one of the other available solutions. This approach to interoperability is not scalable.</p>
<p>The underlying problem is that building standards take time. That is the reason that we propose a practical and focused approach to enable scalable interoperability in the SSI community.</p>
<p>We propose to start with a specific SSI component, namely the Verifier component, and lead the definition of the minimum set of standard APIs necessary to implement or interoperate with such module. That is, a role-centric approach to standardization at API level.</p>
<p>To date, 12 organisations are contributing to this initiative. The VUI working group has already drafted a first version of a generic spec that integrates existing standards and interop efforts and fills the gaps to provide a complete set of APIs. This draft version can be found at <a href="https://bit.ly/3h5VE7P">https://bit.ly/3h5VE7P</a> and has been built using ReSpec.</p>
<p>This draft version for VUI includes today 6 APIs:</p>
 
 Presentation Exchange 
 Consent Management 
 Schema resolution 
 Issuer resolution 
 ID resolution 
 Credential status resolution 
 
<p>Next steps <br>As next steps, the Working Group (WG) needs to take this ground work to a more mature level. That is, to further define the specification by achieving consensus in the broader community, and bridging perspectives from DIF, W3C, EBSI, and Aries.</p>
<p>The WG is organized in Working Packages (WP), one for each interface. Any participant can lead or contribute to WP, which shall integrate at least 2 Implementors and 1 Integrator. Implementors are responsible for defining the API, a set of interoperability tests, and service endpoints for Integrators to execute those tests.</p>
<p>The WG has launched a survey in the broad SSI community and two of the 6 interfaces have been selected as initial WPs:</p>
<p>Presentation Exchange<br>Issuer Resolution</p>

 And nominations are now being accepted <p>DIF was established to represent our fast changing community and to create a safe space for the co-development of next-generation code and specifications. From the original handful of members 4 years ago, the foundation has grown to become an organization with over 200 member companies, representing thousands of PRs and a strong commitment to decentralizing identity software.</p><p>Since its inception, DIF has been primarily governed by a Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is a &nbsp;group of member representatives whom lead DIF, set strategy, assure the high quality of ratified work items, react to the community’s needs, among other decisions.</p>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/@element5digital">Element5digital</a><p>Over the last year, one of the main foci of the current Steering Committee has been restructuring itself to ensure it will represent the interests and diversity of its growing membership. Among the conclusions of this analysis was that a larger steering committee would garner more trust and visibility into DIF's internal governance as an organization. An operating addendum was adopted last month which formalizes procedures for periodic elections and distribution requirements. The following repackages those policies in the form of a Frequently Asked Questions document: for further clarification, see the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/c06c17bd2df58633eb74d9d5237281c79d9b676e/Org%20documents/Membership%20agreements/DIF%20Governance%20-%20Operating%20Addendum%20-%2020210304.pdf">addendum itself</a>.</p> 
    When are the dates and deadlines for this election cycle?
<br>  Announcement of election + Nomination starts - 8th April (Thu) 
 Last day for questions to candidates - 6th May (Thu) 
 Nomination Closes - 13th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot opens - 20th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot closes - 27th May (Thu) 
 New SC first meeting - 3rd June (Thu) 
 

    Who can be nominated and by whom?
    <br><p>Any individual who is active in DIF can nominate a DIF member to the Steering Committee, and/or get nominated for the Steering Committee by someone else. We recommend nominating members of the DIF community with high visibility and recognition, whether among DIF's membership or among the wider community. Only one individual can represent each DIF member organization, and there are distribution criteria to keep the Steering Committee balanced, but those considerations are applied *after* the election. This means that multiple colleagues from the same member organization can be nominated and accept that nomination, but only one of them can sit on the Steering Committee. The DIF membership includes Associate members, Contributors, individuals who signed a Feedback Agreement, and adjacent/partner organizations referred to as Liaisons (i.e. OIDF or Hyperledger).
    </p><p><br>
Nominations should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Nomination">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address.
</p><br> 

    How and when do nominated people become candidates?<br>
    <p>Nominees will be contacted by DIF staff and must accept the nomination before the nomination period closes. Along with confirmation that they would serve if elected, they also provide a short biography and an optional statement describing their interest in and qualifications for serving on the Committee.
Early nominations are encouraged.
</p>
<br>
    How do voting members select which candidates to support?<br>
    <p>DIF Staff will share this list of accepting nominees and their statements with the membership via Slack. Since all Associate Members are eligible for one vote, it is recommended that colleagues within one member company confer or discuss in backchannel before submitting a vote on behalf of their whole company.</p>
<br>
    How can interested DIF members ask questions of all the candidates to help them decide?<br>
    <p>    
    If there are specific issues of interest to all or most of the DIF membership, any DIF member (whether they work at an Associate Member organization or not) may send clear questions to DIF staff.  Nominees should send these questions to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Questions_for_the_candidates">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address, and a representative cross-section of these (lightly edited or unedited) will be compiled into a document sent to all nominees.
</p>
<br>
    Who votes and how?<br>
    <p>Only associate members can vote, and each votes as a whole on one ballot. This too is done as via email: ballots should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Ballot_for_NAME_OF_MEMBER_ORGANIZATION">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address. These will be audited confidentially and not published in any way (not even as tallies). If one member organization accidentally votes more than once, DIF staff will reply to the emails to clarify the issue, so please use a monitored/normal email address in the organization's domain rather an personal accounts or "alts". All ballots are assumed to be collective/company-wide decisions even if multiple are received.</p>
<br>
    How many candidates can each associate member vote for?<br>
    <p>Each ballot should contain between 0 and X names, where X is the number of open seats.  Most elections, X should be between 4 and 6.  If less than X are named, the rest of the organization's votes are forfeited-- each vote counts singly.</p>
<br>
    When is the actual election period?<br>
    <p>DIF elections run for one week, from the distribution of the final list of candidates to one week later at midnight EST. In this election, those dates will be Thursday 20 May and Thursday 27 May, respectively. In the weeks leading up to 20 May, DIF staff will also contact all associate members to clarify any questions about the process and confirm the dates, the number of seats, the nominee statements, etc.</p>
<br>
    How often will the Steering Committee elections take place?<br>
    <p>They are expected to be annual, with 2-year terms to preserve continuity across elections.  If seats are unexpectedly made available between elections, they will stay open until the next election.</p>

<p>Energy Web is thrilled to be one of the three founding organizations behind the newly announced <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord (CCA)</a>. In the next year, we anticipate dozens of novel approaches coming to market focused on decarbonizing the crypto industry in the spirit of the CCA. But we’ve also developed an open-source application that can play a major role in decarbonizing Crypto: <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero (EW&nbsp;Zero)</a>.</p><p>EW Zero is a public, low-cost application built on top of the open-source Energy Web stack that helps renewable energy buyers drive their carbon footprint to zero via purchases of different renewable energy products, such as <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/prec">impact-rich renewable energy certificates</a> from emerging economies and power-purchase agreements. We can use EW Zero beginning today to help the crypto industry achieve the provisional targets of the CCA by 1) helping crypto holders directly decarbonize crypto holdings while 2) enabling entire crypto networks to decarbonize from the bottom-up.</p> Demand-side solution: help crypto holders directly decarbonize their crypto&nbsp;holdings <p>Because of how energy markets are structured, cryptocurrency producers (such as miners) in many places around the world have very little choice in exactly where their power comes from. And even where that choice exists, given the extremely fragmented nature of renewable energy markets and regulatory frameworks with varying degrees of support for renewables, finding the right renewable energy product is a daunting task. EW Zero attacks both of these problems head-on by providing renewable energy buyers with a digital application for locating, procuring, and claiming emissions reductions from verified renewables around the world in a user-friendly, streamlined way.</p><p>In the spirit of the CCA, EW Zero can be used by crypto holders to make their crypto holdings green. Whether you are an institutional cryptocurrency investor, a retail crypto hodler, application developer, crypto service provider, or an exchange, EW Zero enables you to purchase renewable energy equal to the non-renewable energy used to create and maintain your cryptocurrency holdings.</p><p>This isn’t a new concept: corporates from around the world have been purchasing low-carbon products to help decarbonize supply chains in support of corporate sustainability objectives. In climate-speak, this concept of covering the power consumption from crypto purchases/holdings is analogous to actions to reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions. What’s new here is that we’re using EW Zero to apply these kinds of transactions to decentralized sources of power consumption: blockchains.</p><p>Here’s a simple example: you are an institutional cryptocurrency investor who purchased 20,000 BTC. Based on publicly available data, we can estimate the amount of electricity attributable to your 20,000 BTC holdings each year. By extension we can estimate the total carbon footprint of your BTC by making assumptions about how green various grids are around the world (in fact, one of the provisional objectives of the CCA is to develop an industry-wide open source account standard to make this even easier). With that information in hand, you can use EW Zero to search for different renewable energy products around the world. You can then buy enough renewables to make-up for the non-green energy that went into your 20,000 BTC. There are several renewable energy products to choose from: energy attribute certificates (EACs) from existing and future assets, power-purchase agreements, and onsite solar. Energy Web will encourage buyers to support impact-rich EACs, in part because locationality standards are less applicable compared to standard corporate renewables procurement. And once you’ve bought your renewables, you can “claim” the emissions reduction from them since EW Zero makes it easy for buyers to trace the full lifecycle of every megawatt-hour of clean power they bought all the way back to the specific power plant that the energy came&nbsp;from.</p><p>This is just one example for an institutional buyer. We can make the same kinds of transactions possible in a more automated way for retail crypto holders via exchanges (think “green crypto” features directly on your favorite exchange) and integrations with&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>This is just what we can do with EW Zero today. Our vision is for a whole new category of “negative emissions” products to make their way onto Zero. Here, instead of purchasing renewable energy, cryptocurrency holders invest in different negative emissions projects from around the world to remove and lock away carbon associated with their crypto holdings.</p> Supply-side solution: enable crypto networks to decarbonize from the bottom-up <p>Grids around the world are decarbonizing and so are the blockchains underpinning them. However, verifying and credibly measuring the share of crypto production powered by renewables is extremely challenging since most data come from self-reported surveys and proxies (see <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18642645/bitcoin-energy-price-renewable-china">Vox’s article </a>on this topic) and entities like crypto miners don’t normally get the certificates or bills they need to prove where their renewables come&nbsp;from.</p><p>EW Zero and other components of the Energy Web stack address exactly this issue irrespective of the geography or market. Crypto miners and other blockchain actors will be able to automatically track renewables consumption at any given time and report that while preserving privacy. These claims will be, on the other hand, verifiable using a validation mechanism. For example, imagine a miner has onsite solar connected to the grid. This solar, along with the miner, each have unique, self-sovereign digital identities verified by trusted sources like corresponding solar manufacturers and local grid operators. All relevant events, such as estimated power production and excess power sent to the grid, are documented and validated on a highly granular level (e.g., every 30 minutes). That way, this specific miner can provide a verifiable proof of renewably powered, mining-related consumption anywhere in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The last point is key for all industries, not just crypto. Today corporates face significant challenges with reporting their impact in countries without an official tracking system. Energy Web’s open-source tech stack solves this issue. This proposed concept is similar to how Google and Microsoft are working to make their data centers 100% renewably-powered on an hourly basis according to when their data centers actually consume electricity in line with the emerging <a href="https://www.energytag.org/">EnergyTag</a> standard for&nbsp;EACs,</p> Join the Crypto Climate&nbsp;Accord <p>We are excited to act on the goals of the CCA and decarbonize blockchains. Interested companies from the energy and crypto sectors can join the CCA by contacting Energy Web directly via <a href="mailto:doug.miller@energyweb.org">doug.miller@energyweb.org</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/making-crypto-green-with-energy-web-zero-301cf4a979e5">Making Crypto Green with Energy Web Zero</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

You can either open the demo on your phone or on a desktop browser. While we recommend using the <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">Android</a>) for an optimal experience, the demo also works with other compatible wallets.</p><p>The demo contains different example use-cases to illustrate a potential user journey. The use cases are adjusted to the demonstration setup, meaning that in a real scenario there might be additional steps necessary depending on the use case at question.</p> Use case 1: Base-ID (eID — electronic Identification) Get your&nbsp;Base-ID<p>In the first step, you get your Base-ID. This credential is issued to you from a municipal office&nbsp;. Imagine you are in this municipal office and show your physical ID card first. You could also get this credential by using the eID function of your pass and directly and digitally extract it via NFC from your eID-Card.</p> Use case 2: Credit&nbsp;Card Get your digital credit card from your&nbsp;bank.<p>Once you got your Base-ID in your wallet, you can use it to get a credit card. You can easily request a credit card as a new customer of a consumer bank. You will be provided with the card once you shared your data, which is a necessary step from a regulatory perspective.</p> Use case 3: Hotel&nbsp;check-in Check-in to you favourite hotel.<p>You want to do a digital check-in for your hotel stay. You can easily present your personal information as well as a payment option to get your room&nbsp;card.</p> Use case 4: Apply for a university and get a course certificate Apply for a university and get a course certificate.<p>You have successfully completed school and now want to enrol at a university. You can use your Base-ID and phone number to provide the university with the necessary information.</p><p>We are convinced this demonstrated user flow can help to better understand the interactions in a digital identity ecosystem such as <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>. The exact circumstances are always dependent on the use case at hand and might vary regarding their required level of assurance, which is a standardised measure to determine the trust you can allocate to the information presented to you. Regulated use cases have legal requirements regarding the level of trust needed. The Lissi team is in discussion with trust service providers, authorities, municipalities, agencies, associations and other relevant stakeholders to meet all the necessary requirements and provide you with the best user experience.</p><p>We would love to hear your feedback.

<p></p>     <p>Dallas, TX (April 8, 2021) – The Texas Blockchain Council welcomes its newest member, <a href="http://www.bonifii.com">Bonifii</a>, an industry leader in privacy- and security-enhanced digital identity solutions for credit unions.</p>
<p>The Texas Blockchain Council’s mission is to promote blockchain technology initiatives that drive growth and benefit the citizens of Texas.&nbsp; With the influence of their members, the Council advocates for blockchain-centric public policies, to educate members of government about the benefits of blockchain and provide subject-matter expertise on topics related to blockchain, virtual currency, and distributed ledger technology.</p>
<p>“We are excited to contribute to the Council’s efforts in advancing the understanding, use and practical application benefits of blockchain/distributed ledger and digital identity technology to Texas legislators from our experiences in working with the credit union industry,” said John Ainsworth, President and CEO of Bonifii.</p>
<p>Bonifii’s flagship product, MemberPass(R), enables the exchange of verifiable credentials between credit union customers and branches, leveraging a combination of distributed ledger, biometrics and cryptography to protect credit unions’ consumer and small business members.&nbsp; MemberPass is a digital passport that allows members convenient access to their financial accounts while providing control over and privacy of their personal information.</p>
<p>Natalie Smolenski, Chair of the Digital Identity Committee for the Texas Blockchain Council, said, “Blockchain technology provides a new infrastructure for digital identity that decentralizes the ownership and verification of claims. Organizations like Bonifii have been at the forefront of bringing these technologies to market in the financial sector. We are pleased to collaborate with Bonifii to reimagine the future of digital identity in Texas.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>1.What is the mission and vision of one37 Solutions?</p>



<p>Our mission is to unlock the potential of the universal identity with privacy, security and trust, one experience at time.</p>



<p>Our vision is to deliver unparalleled personalized user experience built on decentralized secure identity platform.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>The economic costs of the fragmented identity systems across various channels and businesses, the weak identity systems resulting in identity theft, SIM swaps and account takeovers, and increased corporate liability due to data breaches and regulatory non-compliance are skyrocketing and taxing in both existing and emerging markets.</p>



<p>The implementation of trustworthy digital identity systems will have exponential effects on the market growth and efficiency by streamlining and simplifying daily processes between citizens, governments and service providers in existing markets looking for efficiency and in emerging markets looking to close their digital gap and gaining security and speed of implementation.</p>



<p>At the onset, the rollout of decentralized identity systems seems both timely and significant. However, considering the various challenges that the global industries such as travel and healthcare have been currently facing in the form of security threats, adherence to health norms or regulatory compliances, there is a digital race to incorporate all of the above through a single trust platform while also ensuring a truly seamless experience. Thus, to stay competitive and build customer loyalty, there needs to be a paradigm shift in the way new advancements in technologies can be incorporated to balance such rising risk and opportunity demands.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>A trusted digital identity will have a major impact on the Canadian and world economies by adding tremendous value to a country GDP. The speed of trust will have ripple effects on every aspect of the economy.</p>



 <a href="https://www.one37id.com/"></a> 



<p>one37 provides a state-of-the-art, safe and secure decentralized identity platform for identity verification in verticals such as travel and health. We are working with our partners and service providers to improve the daily lives of citizens in various scenarios such as “Contactless &amp; Touchless Travel” and facilitate the seamless interactions between travelers and service providers along their journey while ensuring user authenticity, data integrity, compliance and governance for all relevant stakeholders within an ecosystem.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada&nbsp;is the world leader in digital identity and the protection of privacy and personal information. By championing the implementation of a decentralized identity technology across the public and private sectors, Canada will provide the role model for the decentralized identity implementation across the world and foster unprecedented growth in the digital identity economy. Canada is in a unique position to shape the future of travel, healthcare, banking and governmental services with monumental implications on both the governmental and corporate sectors worldwide.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>To &nbsp;participate in the on-going discussions and the valuable work that DIACC is spearheading in digital identity and the implementation of the PCTF and be able to add value, work with other companies and partners and contribute in return to the growth of the identity economy.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Every one37 team member is a strong believer in the deep impact that the decentralized universal identity will have on improving the life of every Canadian and world citizen and we are committed to working with our partners to add tremendous value one experience at a time.</p>

 An Open Letter to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Advocating for Financial Inclusion in its Regulations <p>April 7,&nbsp;2021</p><p>On December 23, 2020, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Treasury Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/15/2021-01016/requirements-for-certain-transactions-involving-convertible-virtual-currency-or-digital-assets">Requirements for banks and money services businesses</a>” related to certain transactions involving convertible virtual currency (CVC) or digital assets with legal tender status (“legal tender digital assets” or LTDA). FinCEN is identifying additional statutory authority for the proposed rule under the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, providing additional information regarding the reporting form, and reopening the comment period for the proposal.</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit"> Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a> took the opportunity to submit its formal response to FinCEN on March 29, 2021 — focusing explicitly on how their proposed rules will impact financial inclusion.</p><p>Sovrin Foundation asked Amit Sharma, Chair of the Sovrin CIFWG, to tell us more about the potential impact of the NPRM, their response and recommendations to&nbsp;FinCEN.</p><p>Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the Sovrin CIFWG? What’s your mission and who are your group&nbsp;members?</p><p>The purpose of the Sovrin CIFWG is to advance the mission of financial inclusion globally, by addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by innovations in the financial services and payments landscape, and the attendant financial and regulatory compliance implications. We are an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts who monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and under-served. CIFWG focuses on how economic and regulatory technologies can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and associated risks injected by innovation. We have developed and been actively promoting the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and virtual asset service providers (VASP) processes.</p><p>Q: What do you mean by global financial inclusion, and why is it important?</p><p>Global financial inclusion remains a desirable and necessary development goal — 1.7 billion adults lack a bank account[1], and millions more have limited or no access to traditional financial services around the world. Furthermore, “de-risking” — the efforts of financial institutions to terminate or restrict relationships of certain clients and customers — has continued to be amplified by the continued growth of global anti-money laundry (AML) / counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls[2]. The result is a disproportionate impact for the financially under-served, the global poor, and institutions and sectors that provide services to these segments of the economy. The attendant consequences of financial exclusion cannot be overstated given that remittances from migrant workers alone total over $500 billion a year (three to four times foreign aid) and is a vital source of finance for poor countries.</p><p>Q: What is the NPRM regarding “Requirements for banks and money services businesses” proposed by FinCEN&nbsp;about?</p><p>The December NPRM proposed to address the threat of illicit finance with respect to certain transactions involving CVC or LTDA by (a) establishing new reporting requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions analogous to existing currency transaction reports, and (b) establishing new record keeping requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions that is similar to the record keeping and travel rule regulations pertaining to funds transfers and transmittal of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>On January 1, 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (Division F of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283?link-type=html">Pub. L. 116–283</a>) (“AML Act of 2020”) became law. FinCEN proposed that by regulation, CVC and LTDA are monetary instruments because they are “similar material” to “coins and currency of a foreign country, travelers checks, bearer negotiable instruments, bearer investment securities, bearer securities, [and] stock on which title is passed on delivery[3].”</p><p>Q: What do you think about the NPRM? How does it impact the fintech sector and its key stakeholders?</p><p>We believe combating illicit finance activities is necessary and a top priority for FinCEN. But efforts to serve both law enforcement equities and financial inclusion do not present a binary choice. An effective anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime should also prioritize increased engagement of financially underserved, de-risked and/or excluded parties to foster a financial system that provides enhanced participation, greater transparency, and innovation in domestic financial systems.</p><p>Further, the data on illicit finance risks in the CVC sector don’t necessarily support the need for the proposed rule changes which are motivated to strengthen law enforcement and regulatory oversight efforts. According to a recently released report by Chainalysis, illicit activities or crime related to virtual assets has continued to decline, with the illicit share of cryptocurrency activity falling to just 0.34% in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Importantly within the data analyzed by Chainalysis, the concentration of illicit activities has shown to be primarily with a “small group of shady cryptocurrency services, mostly operating on top of large exchanges, [who] conduct most of the money laundering that cybercriminals rely on to make cryptocurrency-based crime profitable[4].” This data would seem to call for more targeted efforts by law enforcement to concentrate investigations of criminals by identifying owners of these deposit addresses and the organizations that are conducting deliberate money laundering operations at scale (among otherwise legitimate activities).</p><p>As such, we are concerned with the proposed rules as they impact a growing sector that is increasingly providing solutions to marginalized and financially excluded constituencies. Also, organizations operating in CVCs, including fintech companies, virtual asset services providers (VASPs), and other similar organizations may fall under the broader definition of nonbank financial institutions or money services businesses/money transfer operators (MSBs/MTOs) that already face enormous scrutiny by mainstream financial institutions when evaluating their respective risks related to onboarding into new accounts. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) itself has acknowledged the fact of de-risking disproportionately impacting certain sectors like MSBs/MTOs[5].</p><p>Q: What is the role of the CVC services in regards to global financial inclusion, and how secure are&nbsp;they?</p><p>As CVC services continue to evolve and grow, so do the applications and opportunities inherent in facilitating greater inclusion of underserved and marginalized communities and organizations into the global financial ecosystems. As such, self-hosted wallets are playing an increasingly important role with virtual assets, as global financial operations continue to be unbundled, and an ongoing trend toward de-centralized financial services continues unabated[6].</p><p>Self-hosted wallets enable anyone with an internet connection to transact with others in digital assets on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis. Additionally, these wallets can be used to store value or digital assets securely and provide capability for the user/consumer to hold resources personally that enable them to interact in the fiat and digital financial context. This enables consumers to transact with counterparties directly without the need for a third-party intermediary–similar to making a cash transaction for a purchase of a good, pay an expense, or transfer value to a friend or family&nbsp;member.</p><p>When combined with blockchain technology, P2P transactions are arguably more secure and more transparent than activities undertaken in cash, as the convenience of cash and the efficiencies that come with electronic payments are combined with the risk controls associated with pseudonymous transactions that are not otherwise dependent on a specific financial intermediary[7].</p><p>Q: In sum, what are your recommendations to FinCEN regarding the&nbsp;NPRM?</p><p>We really appreciated the opportunity to comment on the NPRM. We believe that any proposed rule should explicitly include a thorough assessment of the threats to financial inclusion that may come about with such a proposal, and the Agencies should consider the concerns outlined in the response in our letter as part of such an assessment.</p><p>Secondly, increased targeted enforcement and requirements for transaction monitoring would strengthen law enforcement regulatory intentions with the proposed rules vs a more wholesale application of record keeping and reporting for related to all noncustodial wallet holders and their activities. In short, a smaller group of actors are engaged in such activity, and enforcement and regulatory measures should be better targeted to them vs the industry as a whole — especially in light of the financial exclusion implications of such proposed&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Strengthening financial inclusion, including by encouraging innovation in the financial services arena with technology applications that extend beyond existing banking and payments systems can actually provide enhanced security, risk and compliance controls, while bringing greater opportunities to marginalized and otherwise financially underserved or excluded communities. The underlying technologies include:</p>  The facilitation of cross-border remittances via P2P and blockchain networks that provide efficiency, cost advantages and security;  The enhanced auditability and traceability of transactions conducted via these applications that better enable financial services regulators and law enforcement interests; and  The application of digital and sovereign identity management capabilities that strengthen know-your-customers processes and customer information programs while preserving the essential privacy protections inherent in financial services.  <p>We welcome follow up with Agencies and participating members that are interested in providing guidance, examples and use cases of inclusion efforts — including the application of self-hosted/un-hosted wallets in particular.</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;Amit!</p><p>Anyone can download the full letter <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvQOHN9LeyoLAZFMgpYENLUXhYZaWClK/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<p>By: FIDO Alliance staff</p>



<p>A major milestone has been realized, with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI-Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) becoming the first organization to the achieve the Certified Authenticator Level 3+ level, which is the highest level of validation currently offered by the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The path toward the Level 3+ designation has been several years in the making.</p>



<p>Dr. Rae Rivera, Certification Director for the FIDO Alliance explained that the Certified Authenticator program was originally launched in August 2018 in a bid to define greater levels of assurance for FIDO authenticators. She noted that the FIDO Specifications include an inherent amount of security and privacy. The goal with the Certified Authenticator program is to provide additional security assurances for the authenticators themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the first Certified Authenticator Level 3+ designation now granted, Rivera expects other organizations will follow, helping to improve strong authentication for users and organizations around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re continuing to see more pickup and uptake in the Certified Authenticator program,” Rivera said. “At each higher level, there’s less risk of a vulnerability.”</p>



<p>Understanding the Different Certified Authenticator Levels</p>



<p>There are three core levels (L1, L2, L3 and ) in the Certified Authenticator program with each level building on the requirements of the preceding level. Incremental additional assurance can be obtained to allow a vendor to achieve a “+” within each level (L1+, L2+, L3+).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program evaluates authenticators to answer the question ‘how well does the authenticator protect the private key?The most basic entry level is L1 which Rivera said a vendor can achieve by supporting and implementing the FIDO specifications. An authenticator certified at L1 provides protection against phishing and credential abuse.</p>



<p>Moving up to L2, Rivera noted that restricted operating environments are required to protect against malware attacks. When you get to L3 and L3+, Rivera said that it’s all about looking at hardware authenticators, and how they provide protection against brute force attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the core attributes of our higher level programs, specifically level three and three plus, is that they require the product to have what we call a companion program certification,” Rivera said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She noted that the companion program certification that has been defined for those higher levels is <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/">Common Criteria</a> &nbsp;which provides sets of evaluations and designations to help define the security posture for a given device or service.</p>



<p>“The higher level that you go, the less vulnerable the authenticator is to any kind of attack,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Why the Level 3+ Certification is Significant</p>



<p>With BSI now certified at L3+ the door is open to others to follow the same path toward the highest level of security assurance.</p>



<p>“Personally I feel like this is a huge leap forward for the program,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Rivera noted that to date there have been many products that have been certified at the lower levels of the Certified Authenticator program. Now that the first L3+ has been achieved she anticipates that there will be more interest from organizations to go through the program to gain that additional higher level of assurance.</p>



<p>“This certification clearly demonstrates the value of our certified authenticator program – particularly at the higher levels,” she said. “Government and regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, energy and education often have more sensitive use cases that require specific types of authentication into their networks. Vendors and relying parties in these markets see this as a benefit because it meets the need for hardware protection and is also Common Criteria certified.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How Others Can Benefit from the First Level 3+ Certification</p>



<p>Now that BSI has hit the Level 3+ certification, there is now quite literally a path for others to follow.</p>



<p>Rivera explained that with the L3+ certification there is a protection profile associated with it. The protection profile contains all the components that are used to achieve the L3+. As such, another vendor could utilize the protection profile to develop their product to get certified at the higher level.</p>



<p>“The protection profile serves as good guidance for those that are seeking the higher levels as to what they need to do and what modifications they need to make to their implementation,” Rivera said. “BSI getting certified at Level 3+ has made it a little easier for others to start achieving this level.”</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation held three interop events for implementations of the OpenID Connect Federation specification during 2020.  The learnings from each were used to iteratively refine the specification after each round, just as we did when developing OpenID Connect itself.  The current specification is the result of the iterative rounds of improvement, informed by the experiences of multiple implementations.</p>

<p>First public reviews for 3 extensions to popular messaging standard Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) are open through April 29th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) TC are pleased to announce that three new AMQP specifications are now available for public review and comment:</p>



  Event Stream Extensions for AMQP Version 1.0  AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0  AMQP Claims-based Security Version 1.0  



<p>The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations. It connects systems, feeds business processes with the information they need and reliably transmits onward the instructions that achieve their goals.</p>



<p>Event Stream Extensions for AMQP Version 1.0 defines a set of AMQP extensions for interaction with event stream engines, including annotations for partition selection and filter definitions for indicating offsets into an extension stream to which a link is attached.</p>



<p>AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0 describes a syntax for expressions consisting of property selectors, functions, and operators that can be used for conditional transfer operations and for configuring a messaging infrastructure to conditionally distribute, route, or retain messages.</p>



<p>AMQP Claims-based Security Version 1.0 describes an AMQP authorization mechanism based on claims-based security tokens.</p>

<p>The FAPI Working Group published a <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> as a resource for those new to FAPI and implementing FAPI. This FAQ will evolve over time as the Foundation engages with new members like the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission as well as colleagues in the US, Australia, Brazil and other jurisdictions on their open banking initiatives which were <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/16/standards-adoption-and-the-adoption-of-standards-financial-grade-api-fapi-1-0-final-specifications-published/">recently highlighted in an OIDF blog</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the OpenID Foundation achieved a major milestone in <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">publishing the Financial-grade API (FAPI) Parts 1.0 and 2.0 final specifications</a>. This is a true accomplishment for open banking initiatives worldwide.</p>
<p>Many organizations and jurisdictions have utilized the FAPI Implementers Draft 2 as the starting point of their adoption of FAPI in defining their open banking solution stacks. To assist these organizations and jurisdictions in transitioning from the FAPI RW Implementers Draft 2 to the FAPI 1.0 Advanced Final specification, Joseph Heenan, led the OpenID certification work and&nbsp; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/FAPI_1.0/changes-between-id2-and-final.md">published a non-normative list of changes document</a>.</p>
<p>This document is a non-normative list of the changes between the second implementers draft of FAPI1 part 1 (read only / baseline) and part 2 (read-write / advanced) and the final versions:</p>
 
 Changes are listed as major if they may require alterations to implementations. 
 Changes are listed as minor if they are generally clarifications and are unlikely to require alterations to existing implementations that were already applying best current practice. 
 Most changes have both client and server clauses that reflect the same change to the protocol; such a change is only listed once below in the interests of brevity. 
 
<p>The progress and pace of standards development is a function of the contribution of human capital, especially domain expertise. The Foundation would like to thank member, Authlete, a consistent key contributor to the FAPI standards. Authlete’s contribution of Joseph Heenan’s time and talent that was key to the ongoing improvements in the evolution of the FAPI standard.</p>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>For many women, March symbolizes more than just a month of observance. It’s a time where women across all industries and geographies celebrate the achievements of their peers and colleagues today and take a critical look at the opportunities they’re creating for young women just entering the workforce. It’s also a chance for us to celebrate the historic achievements of the pioneering women that came before us. At Omidyar Network, we’re constantly working to create a culture and world where all women have equitable access to the systems and powers that govern our daily&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Like many, I was inspired to do this work by the first woman in my life — my mother. My commitment to social justice was developed while watching her work as a special education teacher for more than 30 years. As an educator, she worked passionately to support and empower students who were often marginalized because of their race, class, or learning abilities. As an active member of her union, she understood why it was critical for people to have power and voice in the workplace. She taught me the importance of being engaged in my community and how to live my values and support my community through politics — one of my first memories is stuffing envelopes for our neighbor who was running for the Montgomery County Council and reading her NOW newsletter.</p><p>After her sudden death in 2000, I’ve always wondered what she would think of some of the unfortunate events the country has endured over the years. Part of me is relieved that she did not have to witness the horrors of 9/11, the recession, and the pandemic. On the other hand, I think she would have been amazed to see the remarkable women who have trailblazed their way through the world by challenging the status quo, reimaging what’s possible, and ensuring equality for the leaders of the future. My mom, along with other women before me, would have beamed with pride to bear witness to the accomplishments of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and most recently, Vice President Kamala&nbsp;Harris.</p><p>I am constantly awed and inspired by the incredible women grantees we work with at Omidyar Network who are shaping a new inclusive economy, ensuring a responsible tech ecosystem, and positively impacting our society. We have the honor to work with a powerhouse team of women leaders such&nbsp;as:</p>  Ifeoma Ozoma with Earthseed who’s taking on the role of Big Tech as a brave whistleblower at Pinterest, holding the company to account for racial bias and inequality;  Lisa Donner from <a href="https://ourfinancialsecurity.org">Americans for Financial Reform</a> who’s working to reimagine our economic system by way of representation and ensuring equality; and  Solana Rice from <a href="https://www.liberationinageneration.org">Liberation in a Generation</a> who’s providing equitable access to communities for meaningful social&nbsp;change.  <p>Click <a href="https://twitter.com/OmidyarNetwork">here</a> for a look at how we’ve highlighted our grantees for our Women’s History Month campaign!</p><p>I feel an obligation and a great sense of joy to carry out the legacy built by these women, my mother, and many others, through the work Omidyar Network does every day. We’re committed to showing up for each other and addressing all instances of biases and inequality. I see so much of what my mother believed in and stood for in Omidyar Network’s mission and through our phenomenal team of women grantees, including:</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/legacy-community-and-equity-reflecting-on-womens-history-month-9ac5c5edff80">Legacy, Community, and Equity: Reflecting on Women’s History Month</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Drilling down: Co-development <p>Competitors working together in the&nbsp;open</p><p>Having gone over the subtleties and complexities of <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c61c55cdec30169ea99471b9bd09e81b">open-source software</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495?source=friends_link&amp;sk=971c11824b0023758c34114cffc6c339">open standards</a> in general, we will now drill down into how exactly DIF advances both, in the form of a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) document. Topics covered&nbsp;include:</p>  What “standardization” means to DIF and what DIF means to standardization.  A newbie-friendly survey of how DIF relates to nearby organizations with overlapping or related&nbsp;foci.  What “co-development” and “coöpetition” really mean, concretely  <p>The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>We can start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations. Click on the image below to download a clickable PDF&nbsp;file.</p><a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/ssi-architectural-stack--and--community-efforts-overview.pdf"></a>Src: E.D. Rouven Heck 2019, updated by Interoperability Working Group,&nbsp;2020 What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization.</p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through&nbsp;OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening.</p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation.</p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working&nbsp;groups.</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”.</p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.”</p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the&nbsp;group.</blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development — patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to&nbsp;market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or&nbsp;not.</p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further&nbsp;down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape! In our next piece, we’ll sketch out how you can get strategic about open source, roll up your sleeves, and get your hands dirty at&nbsp;DIF.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-co-development-in-the-open-765a86ab153f">Drilling Down: [Co-]Development in the Open</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Berkman Klein Center event explores how technology factors into pandemic&nbsp;response Kendra Albert, Tanya Cooper, Roslyn Satchel, and Thema Bryant-Davis during a Berkman Klein Center event on “Marginalized Women, Technology, COVID-19, and Intimate Partner Violence.” Screenshot by Lydia Rosenberg.<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has upended myriad aspects of everyday life, from education to the economy to interpersonal relationships. For victims and survivors of intimate partner violence, the many struggles of escaping or finding support are particularly exacerbated by the pandemic. An <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">event</a> hosted by the Berkman Klein Center explored how technology factors into this problem — how it can help, and how it can&nbsp;harm.</p><p>Moderated by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/roslyn-satchel">Roslyn Satchel</a>, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center and the Blanche Seaver Professor of Communication at Pepperdine, the event convened an interdisciplinary group of scholars to discuss various issues surrounding intimate partner violence, particularly for marginalized women, during the pandemic. The discussion covered fostering safe spaces online, access to resources, and navigating the legal system during the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://gsep.pepperdine.edu/about/our-people/faculty/thema-bryant-davis/">Thema Bryant-Davis</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Pepperdine University, and director of the Culture and Trauma Research Lab, spoke about coping with trauma and supporting victims and survivors.</p><p>“The reality is that COVID-19 has also increased the risk of intimate partner violence when we see the large number of people who are practicing physical distancing and social distancing. There has been less of a buffer, less of an opportunity to come outside of the home and to seek services. And so we are mindful of the urgency of this work, as well as the additional barriers that make help-seeking difficult,” Bryant-Davis said.</p><p>“Part of what we are mindful of in the midst of COVID is the need for technology to be utilized in order to reach survivors and in order to protect survivors and help us to heal and restore,” Bryant-Davis said. “Many clinicians like me are currently practicing telehealth solely, so working with people in their healing journey by phone and by Internet which has benefits and challenges.” She pointed to easier access to resources not requiring travel, but also the dangers of sharing spaces with&nbsp;abusers.</p><p><a href="https://law.pepperdine.edu/faculty-research/tanya-asim-cooper/">Tanya Asim Cooper</a>, associate clinical professor of law and director of the Restoration and Justice Clinic, shared her experience working with victims of intimate partner victims from a legal perspective and illustrated her work through a case&nbsp;study.</p><p>“Studies show racial disparities in domestic violence for victims of color, predominantly women and they are in the greatest danger,” she said. “From my experience and based on my research, victims of color generally are perceived as less credible victims, suffer more serious violence, and require more concrete evidence of abuse, especially physical violence. They need photographs, they need not just medical records, they need medical professional live testimony.”</p><p>These demands are hard for people to meet — especially during the pandemic, with courts closing and forcing victims to wait. Cooper described how her clinic transferred their work online, but how she worries about people lacking technological skills or access to the internet.</p><p>“If law enforcement and courts can’t or won’t assist, especially during the pandemic, let’s equip faith communities and other online communities where marginalized women go, and let’s equip them to help,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Several event participants mentioned the idea of fostering online communities and safe digital spaces during the event. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Kendra Albert</a>, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, prompted the panel to question some of the values embedded in technologies and online tools and how those can be challenged in the intimate partner violence&nbsp;context.</p><p>As examples, Albert cited how phone companies may provide data about recently contacted phone numbers because “insiders are assumed to be safe.” Albert also pointed to Facebook’s “People You May Know” feature as a tool that has been shown to suggest mutual friends but that may expose degrees of connection that should remain private, such as therapist relationships “It’s just one example of these technologies that are often built on the assumption that more connection is better, that Facebook wants to connect to all of us or thinking about sharing as a net good, while not considering the very real reasons that people’s sharing or engagement with these platforms might be deeply contextual and they may have concerns about this information getting shared more broadly,” Albert&nbsp;said.</p><p>Although these contexts and situations are often not considered when developing such technology or their values, marginalized people are able to adapt the technologies to their circumstances, circumventing the intended uses and norms, Albert&nbsp;added.</p><p>“The reality is marginalized folks have been using, thriving, and changing technologies that were built without them in mind forever, for as long as we’ve had technologies,” they said. “And that we can think of examples of marginalized folks innovating and actually driving these technologies forward as the things that create change and in some cases, create money for these platforms. So I think while still keeping in mind that domestic violence victims and survivors, especially domestic violence victims and survivors that are women of color, Black and brown women could be much better served by these platforms and that their needs for contextual controls and control over one’s information.”</p><p>Towards the end of the conversation, Satchel drew connections between the speakers; she highlighted the theme of safety and security and acknowledged that the event is continuing an important conversation about centering the experiences of marginalized people and the value of cross-disciplinary discourse.</p><p>“This question of safety and security is really animating the very core of this discussion. And as a communication ethicist, as a person who actually studies communication in a variety of contexts, I really value interdisciplinarity. Why? Because it allows for conversations like this to happen,” she said. “The beauty is that we’re coming back to a common core, marginalized women. Women who are marginalized by race, socioeconomic status, ability, gender, sexual orientation, language, ethnicity, immigration status, and many more caste markers have very unique experiences, unique experiences that may very well cause them to call for different solutions and different options for justice.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">here</a>.

<p>Recognition of the value of FIDO in European digital identity systems and eIDAS continues to grow.&nbsp; This month has featured two new updates in Europe on the FIDO front: the release of a landmark ENISA report that discusses the role FIDO2 plays in eIDAS, and the accreditation by the Czech government of a new eID solution using FIDO2.</p>



<p>In March 2021, the EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) issued the report <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-report-remote-id-proofing">Remote ID Proofing</a>, which describes the current regulatory landscape and supporting standards for the European countries’ remote identity proofing laws, regulations and practices. ENISA’s report is based on the ETSI TR 119 460 and ETSI TS 119 461 documents, which describe the policies and practices for remote identity proofing among trust service providers in the EU. Especially the eIDAS regulation, the AMLD5 directive to prevent money laundering, and EU directives on issuing ID-cards and exchanging identity information have been taken into account from a legal perspective.</p>



<p>Several methods for remote identification are proposed in the ENISA report: video recorded sessions, identification based on eID schemes or electronic signatures, bank identification, scanning of existing ID-cards, or a combination of several methods. In particular the option to identify a user with an eID scheme is of interest from a FIDO perspective. The following statement is written in section “2.2.4 Electronic identification means” of the ENISA report:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A protocol used by several electronic identity means providers is OpenID connect. It is an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0 and is specified by the OpenID foundation. This protocol allows to verify the identity of the applicant based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, and by obtaining basic information about the applicant. Another technology that can be used in eID solutions is FIDO2. The FIDO Alliance explains in a <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FIDO_Using-FIDO-with-eIDAS-Services-White-Paper.pdf">whitepaper</a> how FIDO2 can be used for eID means corresponding to eIDAS article 8.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In the very same month, the Czech ministry of interior <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/e-podpis-povinne-zverejnovane-informace-oznameni-o-udeleni-akreditace-pro-spravu-kvalifikovaneho-systemu-elektronicke-identifikace-poskytovatel-cz-nic-z-s-p-o.aspx">issued eIDAS accreditation</a> for the Czech domain registry CZ.NIC, meaning that their identity provider mojeID can deploy FIDO2 as an eID scheme at eIDAS level of assurance High under the following conditions:</p>



  The FIDO2 authenticator is FIDO certified at Level 2 (or higher)  The FIDO2 authenticator is based on a secure element that is certified at FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or Common Criteria EAL4 + AVA_VAN.5  The FIDO2 authenticator has a PIN set and the PIN is required for all transactions at level of assurance High  Username and password are used in conjunction with FIDO2  



<p>Both ENISA’s report on remote identity proofing and the official approval of CZ.NIC’s FIDO-based eID scheme are great examples of how FIDO has been recognized as a viable authentication protocol for eIDAS compliant eID schemes in the EU.</p>

<p></p><p>Having gone over the subtleties and complexities of <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c61c55cdec30169ea99471b9bd09e81b">open-source software</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495?source=friends_link&amp;sk=971c11824b0023758c34114cffc6c339">open standards</a> in general, we will now drill down into how exactly DIF advances both, in the form of a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) document. In this FAQ, we'll cover what co-development means in general, at DIF, beyond DIF, and in legal terms. The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>Let's start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations. &nbsp;Click on the image below to download a clickable PDF file.</p> What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these &nbsp;technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. &nbsp;On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the sector. </p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization. </p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening. </p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. &nbsp;It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation. </p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. &nbsp;The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. &nbsp;The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working groups. &nbsp;</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. &nbsp;DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). &nbsp;The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”. <br></p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.” </p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the group. </blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. &nbsp;These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development -- patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. &nbsp;In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or not. </p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape! In our next piece, we’ll sketch out how you can get strategic about open source, roll up your sleeves, and get your hands dirty at DIF.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Alliance Staff</p>



<p>What’s the role of FIDO authentication in financial services and what can be done to help consumers and issuers be more secure? Those topics were at the foundation of the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Modern Authentication for Financial Services, hosted by the FIDO Alliance on March 25.</p>



<p>The financial services focused event included speakers from eBay, Financial Data Exchange, Gemini, Google, Javelin Strategy and Research, Mastercard, JP Morgan Chase, StrongKey, Trusona and Visa, with topics spanning from the future of authentication to best practices on how to optimize the authentication experience for users.</p>



<p>In his opening keynote, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance noted that over the course of the pandemic there has been an increase in cyberattacks against financial services institutions, which has only heightened the need for stronger authentication methods.</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, the vast majority of statistics and the vast majority of these problems come down to fundamental truth, which is that we’re trying to run a hyper connected economy, a networked society, on a authentication model that simply is not fit for purpose and that of course is our dependence on passwords,” Shikiar said.</p>



  



<p>Shikiar detailed how the FIDO Alliance is working to help move the world away from passwords and help users benefit from stronger forms of authentication. In particular, FIDO is playing a key role in the financial services market across a number of categories. FIDO specifications are being used today by financial services firms to help protect online accounts against account takeovers and phishing attacks. A key goal is to also make it easier for organizations to use strong authentication. Shikiar emphasized that the FIDO Alliance’s tagline is: simpler, stronger authentication.</p>



<p>“If there’s one thing the industry has seen is that the more complex the approach is for MFA [Multi-Factor Authentication] , the less likely someone is to stick with it,” Shikiar said. “So for people to keep using strong authentication, it needs to be easy and single gesture, which is the core of FIDO’s approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Improving Authentication with FIDO at Visa</p>



<p>Visa is one of the world’s largest credit card brands and financial services firms on the planet and it sees FIDO as being a strong tool for helping to improve security and reduce fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a keynote presentation, David Henstock, Head of Identity and Authentication Products at Visa, observed that FIDO specifications have a significant role to play in helping to drive better outcomes within the payments industry. Henstock noted that what has increasingly occurred in recent years is that fraudsters are targeting the authentication layer.</p>



  



<p>“The question that always comes up is what can Visa do to help fight account takeover fraud?” Henstock stated. “The culprit more often than not is knowledge based authentication, or simply put&nbsp; – passwords.”</p>



<p>Henstock noted that FIDO is an easy way to upgrade from usernames and passwords to a more secure standard upgrading the authentication experience that sellers have. He added that overall FIDO helps to provide a better, more easy to use customer experience for authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO is also important to help with regulatory compliance. In Europe, the PSD2 [Payment Services Directive version 2] is a key driver for strong authentication adoption as it mandates the use of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).</p>



<p>“If you’re doing digital commerce in Europe, you must abide by the SCA regulations,” Henstock said.</p>



<p>In a bid to help organizations with FIDO deployment, Arshad Noor, CTO at StrongKey used his Authenticate session to detail new capabilities in the StrongKey FIDO server that can help organizations meet the challenges of global requirements.</p>



<p>“We see a lot of confusion in the WebAuthn and FIDO ecosystem where people are confused between security capability, and the user experience that consumers go through when interacting with FIDO,” Noor said. “We believe that FIDO should first be viewed as a security technology, and second as a convenience technology.”</p>



<p>Consumer Confidence in Passwords is Declining</p>



<p>The need to move away from passwords isn’t just about regulation, it’s also about consumer confidence in the security of password based authentication.</p>



<p>In a session, Javelin Strategy &amp; Research analysts Rachel Huber and John Buzzard outlined the state of the market in terms of fraud and online security.</p>



  



<p>“We have discovered trend wise that consumer confidence with passwords is down substantially and I want to say -finally,” Buzzard stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Buzzard noted that consumers have begun to realize that stronger authentication methods including biometrics are effective ways to validate identity. He added that consumers are now indicating that they are ready to move away from passwords.</p>



<p>“Whether the password disappears, maybe it becomes sort of like the Mayor McCheese of the city in the sense that it’s there but it doesn’t mean anything if that’s what it requires,” Buzzard said. “That’s still okay because we’re ready to move forward with stronger forms of authentication.”</p>



<p>Payments and the Future of Authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO standards are at the core of security efforts at eBay, which helps the online marketplace meet the needs of its diverse user base. In a panel on Payments and the Future of Authentication Ashish Jain, Product Management Executive, Identity, Mobility &amp; Analytics, eBay explained that a key challenge for his platform is having the right experience that can fit the needs and requirements of a broad customer base.</p>



  



<p>“When we started investigating FIDO and saw that it was supported by Google, Microsoft, and Apple, it gave us the confidence that it can meet the needs for a variety of our customers and hence, we continue to investigate and invest in the protocol,” Jain said.</p>



<p>For Christiaan Brand, Product Manager for Identity &amp; Security at Google, FIDO adoption started out as a way to help curb phishing risks and has evolved to become a way to help improve multiple aspects of security for both Google and its users.</p>



<p>“FIDO is one of those few security inventions, which aims to both address security and improve on that axis, while at the same time also improving on the usability front,” Brand said. “The FIDO components that have been built into the platforms nowadays do give our users, better and more secure experiences.”</p>



<p>For Ranjita Iyer, SVP, Identity Solutions at Mastercard, FIDO specifications are being combined with other standards including the<a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/"> EMV 3D Secure</a> effort to enable a seamless authentication and payment experience that can lead to better approval rates for digital transactions and lower fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Integrating FIDO with other standards is also something that the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) is implementing with its stack. Don Cardinal, Managing Director, Financial Data Exchange explained in a session that his organization is dedicated to unifying the financial service industry around an interoperable royalty free standard for secure permission to access data.</p>



  



<p>“The whole idea is to stop sharing user IDs and passwords and stop using them in the entire session,” Cardinal said. “Ideally, if you have OIDC [<a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>] and FIDO throughout FDX you can enroll, use and consume the whole setup and never use a credential, which I think is really powerful in today’s day and age.”</p>



<p>Optimizing UX for Strong Authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the technical details of FIDO specifications are critical to enabling strong authentication, optimizing the user experience is critical to adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the final panel of the day, Megan Shamas, Director of Marketing, FIDO Alliance noted that there is an effort that is currently underway to to test and improve the FIDO user experience. Guidance from that testing effort is set to be publicly available in late 2021.</p>



<p>Kerry Hebert, Design Director (CX/UI) at Visa emphasized that it’s likely that FIDO implementation hinges on user adoption and adoption is only going to happen if the user registers. She noted that for&nbsp; users to take the step of registering, they need to believe that there’s value in what it provides and in some way makes the consumer’s life a little bit better.</p>



  



<p>Kevin Goldman, Chief Experience Officer, Trusona strongly suggests that financial services firms not think about user experience as something that is bolted on to the end of the process. Rather he suggests that it’s an integrated part of the entire process of supporting and enabling FIDO standards.</p>



<p>Judy Clare, Vice President, Product Manager, Digital Identity and Authentication at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, suggested during the panel that from an experience perspective, FIDO engagement needs to be easily digestible for consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You really have to have that value proposition out there&nbsp; – what’s in it for me, and why should I be clicking through this and take an extra 30 seconds to sign up for it and then go on my way, because I am here to do something and this wasn’t it,” Clare stated. “So it’s really important to keep the user in mind.”</p>



<p>Next Up: More Authenticate Summits and Authenticate 2021 Conference</p>



<p>There’s much more content to come from the FIDO Alliance in 2021.</p>



<p>Looking forward there is another virtual event coming in June which will focus on strong authentication in Europe. Plans are also coming together for a physical Authenticate conference set for October in Seattle.</p>



<p>“In general, what we see is a lot of best practice sharing, everyone is in this together, and is motivated to help protect the networked economy and FIDO authentication presents a great way of doing so,” Shikiar said. “So we encourage you to certainly take part.”</p>

<p>Today, SecureAuth is an official member of the OpenID Foundation a non-profit international standardization organization committed to enabling, promoting and protecting OpenID technologies. As a distinguished member of the Foundation, SecureAuth also now has a voice in the elections for the governing body.</p>
<p>SecureAuth Innovation Labs is dedicated to actively supporting and participating in the Shared Signals and Events Working Group (SSE WG) of the OpenID Foundation. This includes research and development teams commitment to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. This protocol serves as the identity layer for human-based and machine-to-machine communications alike, which is built into SecureAuth’s Protect platform.</p>
<p>Always at the forefront of innovation, SecureAuth has been a long-time advocate and contributor of the OpenID Foundation prior to becoming an official member. As a trailblazer of the interoperability and extensions of authentication protocols that are integrated into every app to verify users, SecureAuth aligned with the latest standards for customers across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We welcome SecureAuth’s membership in the OpenID Foundation and look forward to their contributions to the SSE WG and their support for open standards in identity, access control and authentication”, said Don Thibeau of the OpenID Foundation. “The success of the Shared Signals Working Group is one of the great hidden successes. One objective is to define mechanisms to deliver system implementers with an approved standard for securely sending signals and receiving signals, access and avoid account takeover.”</p>
<p>The mission fits with SecureAuth’s core objective, which is to enable the continuous assessment of risk and trust, by leveraging signal and events in a way that security can be achieved without compromising the user experience and sharing of security events, state changes, and other signals between dependent systems.</p>
<p>SecureAuth’s participation in the SSE WG will aid in implementing two new standards: Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol (CAEP) and Risk &amp; Incident Sharing and Collaboration Initiative (RISC).</p>

<p>DIACC is hosting a series of spotlights showcasing our amazing female DIACC members in the digital identity space, noting the importance of diversity. These spotlights will be regularly socialized through DIACC’s LinkedIn and Twitter channels as well as our monthly member newsletters.</p>



<p>If you’re a DIACC member and would like us to feature your spotlight,&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/contact-us/">contact</a>&nbsp;us today to learn more!</p>


 
 
 

 



 
<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>My journey has been far from a straight line. I have a BA in political science from the University of Alberta and a masters in African Studies from the University of Oxford. Since finishing my education, I’ve worked in multiple sectors and countries. I started in student journalism, shifted to the non-profit start-up space working on community development with a social justice lens and dabbled in academia for a bit. Eventually, I settled into public relations in Nigeria for 4+ years. Upon moving back to Canada, I spent time in customer experience strategy for a power utility before joining the Saskatchewan government, first as the director for digital citizen services and now for digital ID.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>I’ve never quite had a dream job but I always knew I wanted to make a positive impact in people’s lives and somehow do my part in making the world a better place. That’s why I am so drawn to the public sector.</p>



<p><br></p>
 
 
 


<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>I’m extremely fortunate to say that I’ve had very few challenges on account of my gender identity. That said, I’ve grown up in professional environments where the gender balance is more prevalent. I have heard enough horrendous stories from other female leaders to know that my experience is not the norm. My barriers have more come from age, especially in my earlier years of leadership. As a young leader people consistently assumed I knew less and could do less. We often undervalue our youth as a society and this is something I consistently remind myself of as I work with the next generation of youth.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Work life balance is sacred to me, as is my respect for deadlines, and those two things can often come into conflict. My general rules for myself and my teams:</p>



  Work to outcomes. Be clear on your deliverables and get the job done. But in doing so, set boundaries and prioritize.  Ask for help in doing this if you need it. We only have 8 hours in a day and weekends and evenings should be exceptions, not the expectation.  Take your holidays! Payouts and carrying over should be exceptions not the norm.  


 
 
 
<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Tech doesn’t have to be intimidating (look at my background!) and tech also doesn’t have to mean being a developer. But I do believe that, love it or hate it, tech will continue to grow ever more central to our society. Dig into your passion and spend the time to understand how technology is impacting, shaping and changing that space. If the actual technical details aren’t for you, look to the concepts, outcomes, and impacts that technology has to offer and dig in there.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Lift people up. Lift people up. Lift people up.</p>



<p>This goes for all voices that need more prominence in our organizations, not just women. Take the time on projects, in meetings etc., to give space to those who may not naturally take it themselves. This can come in many forms:</p>



  End meetings with a round table.  Work with a teammate or colleague to help them find professional outlets to develop their passion.  Be a mentor and a coach.  Offer public praise and private – and always constructive feedback.  If you have a hand in assigning resources, prioritize diversity. Diverse perspectives always benefit an organization and provides opportunities to lift people up.  



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you? </p>



<p>Women are a very diverse group and our challenges are not homogenous. For those like me, who have faced very little discrimination on account of their gender identity, the challenge will continue to be to recognize and use that privilege to widen the conversation and create space, not just for other women but for all those along the gender spectrum. We cannot become complacent that equality for some women is equal to equality for all.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Find your passion. Hone your strengths. Dig into the details, stay outcomes focused and curious, and always, always stay open to feedback.</p>

<p>This is a transcript of a keynote originally delivered at the 2021 Stefan A. Riesenfeld Symposium, <a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/">Global Speech Under Pressure</a>. The video of the speech can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/recordings">here</a>.</p><p>Thank you so very much: both for this incredible honour and for these kind words. And thank you to everyone who is joining us today via Zoom or the livecast — I am deeply grateful that you are making the time to engage with us on the many important topics we will be discussing at the Symposium today and tomorrow. To me the honour to kick us off with a few words, so let me do&nbsp;that.</p><p>Freedom of expression is an important right in and of itself. It plays a key role in our societies as an enabler of democratic debate, in holding our leaders to account, and it is crucial for truth finding. It is a fundamental right for us as individuals: expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</p><blockquote>…expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</blockquote><p>Freedom of expression also is a basic right for us as we act and organise in groups: it allows us to share information with each other, exchange views and opinions, and debate matters that concern us all. The American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman Frederick Douglass summed up the important role freedom of expression plays by saying that: “To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker. It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to speak and hear as it would be to rob him of his&nbsp;money.”</p><p>But one of the things that makes freedom of expression so especially important is the way in which it facilitates the enjoyment of other fundamental rights. Here, it is obvious to think of the role of the press in bringing wrongs to light and thereby helping the enforcement of human rights standards. And the press, often referred to as the “lifeblood of democracy”, is indeed crucial. However, what I am getting at is something more all-encompassing. It is the interconnectedness of the different human rights acknowledged in international and national frameworks, and the role freedom of expression plays in that constellation as a facilitator.</p><p>This special role that freedom of expression plays as a supporting right inevitably also has its drawbacks.</p><p>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation for the purpose of undermining, abusing or even destroying these other rights. Put very simply: if you can make good things happen, it also offers an opening for bad things to happen. Today, I want to look at some examples of the benefits of freedom of expression in this facilitating and supporting role, and also reflect on some of the challenges it&nbsp;brings.</p><blockquote>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation</blockquote><p>In doing so, I want to take a slightly broader view than many of us have the liberty of taking day to day, confronted with a world in which — currently by necessity due to the pandemic — we are living significant parts of our lives online. Much focus is placed at the moment on the challenges that technology and social media bring for freedom of expression — and human rights in general — in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>In doing so, we don’t always properly take into account that the right — which the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights wisely framed as applying without frontiers and as a right that can be exercised through any means — already has a history of having been tried and tested through a variety of contexts and rapid societal developments.</p><p>When I say this, I by no means intend to downplay the novelty of the developments we are seeing unfold at the moment, nor the speed or scale at which this is happening. But I do want to emphasise that the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too.</p><blockquote>…the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too</blockquote><p>Another aspect I want to place squarely within the frame before we enter into the panel discussions today and tomorrow (which I am very much looking forward to), is that the way freedom of expression plays out in different contexts, online and offline, is a manifestation of the choices we make as a society and the power structures that govern it. This is a consideration that I don’t think is always sufficiently taken into account. Too often the focus in our debates about free speech in the digital age lies in dealing with symptoms, rather than reflecting on their root&nbsp;causes.</p><p>To illustrate these points, I want to highlight three contexts in which we’ve seen freedom of expression facilitate other rights in both the offline and online contexts: publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights. After that, I’ll conclude with some reflections that we can jointly look at in more detail during the various panel conversations of the Symposium.</p> Examples of Freedom of Expression as a Facilitating Right <p>The Impact of Printing and Digital Publishing</p><p>The ability to express ourselves in writing and to share those writings with others has facilitated a great deal of other rights and advances in our societies over the centuries. It has helped the promotion of freedom of religion, the right to health, the right to rest and leisure, education, culture, and generally allowed us to share ideas and scientific discoveries across frontiers when we were not yet able to text or e-mail each other in&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>To start with its offline variety: the printed word has been referred to as one of the “Four Great Inventions” of ancient China, alongside the compass, gunpowder, and papermaking. When the German goldsmith Gutenberg adapted the technique in the 15th century, it made printing more affordable, easier to use, and more accessible. Historians often note the printing press’ significance as an “agent of change” throughout history, including during the Reformation, Renaissance and Scientific Revolution.</p><p>The printing press also provided more general access to the written word, which in Europe had been the domain of universities and the church. Universities and church institutions managed libraries and if books needed to be reproduced, this was done by making careful copies by hand. These books were mainly written in Latin, which made them inaccessible to anyone who did not master the language, even if they were literate.</p><p>As printing made the production of written texts at scale so much easier and affordable, it became lucrative to start printing works in languages that were accessible to those outside of ecclesiastic and academic circles. By starting to print in languages other than Latin, “regular” languages were standardised. It also facilitated the creation of communities around commonly read works to discuss their&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that anyone was able to get printed whatever they wanted. Governments were able to restrict what did and did not get printed, and the workings of the “market” also made sure that not just everyone was able to see their ideas published and circulated.</p><p>Prior restraint, a form of censorship that allows government to review the content of printed materials and prevent their publication, was, and in some countries still is, a reality. Just like the practise of banning certain books on grounds such as national security, or for being perceived as obscene or blasphemous. Here, it is good to keep in mind that even books we would deem fairly innocent now, such as Alice in Wonderland, Ivanhoe, and Oliver Twist, all have been banned by various governments at some point in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Besides government interference, “access” — a concept I always find hard to define, but which speaks volumes about our ability or inability to effectively get to those with power in our societies — to a large extent determined who got to publish. A lot of power lies in the hands of the publishing industry, whose decisions of what “audiences” will want to read are made by teams and individuals that, according to recent survey data, still are predominantly white, cis-gender, straight and able-bodied. This inevitably has led to an underrepresentation on the shelves of our public libraries and bookshops of authors that do not fit that&nbsp;picture.</p><p>The arrival of digital publishing and online self-publication has shaken up the publishing landscape to some extent, in the sense that the lower barrier for “access” and the lower cost of publishing mean that authors have more options to get their work out in public now that this no longer is the same as getting “printed”.</p><blockquote>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications</blockquote><p>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications and reach a wider, more international audience than would be possible with, say a physical “”, the nonconformist, self-published booklets made by&nbsp;hand.</p><p>This does not mean that we’re now, in the digital age, completely free from the power dynamics and censorship at play in traditional printing and publishing. First, the traditional barriers that exist for those who are systematically excluded remain: think of the time, space and resources it takes to write in the first place. The “room of one’s own” and money to support themselves that Virginia Woolf argued women needed in order to write was accessible only to a privileged few.</p><blockquote>…we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free&nbsp;word</blockquote><p>Second, digital publishing brings its own specific drawbacks with it. The website of an online Zine can be geographically blocked, doxxed or taken down; and we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free word, trading traditional publishing houses as gatekeepers for a trillion-dollar capitalist behemoth.</p><p>The Galvanising Effect of Seeing Civil Rights&nbsp;Protests</p><p>Freedom of expression has traditionally been closely linked to the right to protest and the right to assembly. We organise and take to the streets to express our views on matters we believe should change in our societies, to get those in power to listen to us and, sometimes, even to tell them to step down. An important role in this is played by the media, and nowadays by us as citizen journalists and activists.</p><p>Gil Scott-Heron said that the revolution will not be televised, but television did play an important role in advancing the fight for civil rights in the South of the United States. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. understood the role the press and television could play in the civil rights movement by helping make visible to audiences across the United States — where, by the early 1960s, about 90% of households had a television set — what the Black experience in the country was. In their history of television news, Unsilent Revolution, journalists Robert Donovan and Ray Scherer wrote that “The civil-rights revolution in the South began when a man and the eye of the television film camera came together, giving the camera a focal point for events breaking from state to state, and the man, Martin Luther King Jr., high exposure on television sets from coast to&nbsp;coast.”</p><p>This attention from the media is often credited to have helped activists and politicians push for the adoption of key legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in&nbsp;1965.</p><blockquote>…the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to&nbsp;us.</blockquote><p>There are also some critical notes to be placed here, of course. Not only is who gets to broadcast determined by a licencing system, which is administered by the state; the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to us. We’ll talk about the theoretical aspect of that in a moment, but I want to note here that the way in which events in the South were covered and the imagery of resistance that was spread was to a large extent shaped by the needs of the then-new television stations and their desire to connect with a wide audience across the US. I think I do not need to make explicit what the makeup of those news stations looked like — today, still, diversity within broadcasting and news companies is lamentable.</p><p>Social activist and civil rights movement leader Julian Bond summed up the media’s approach at the time as follows: “What the media craved was a steady diet of bold mass action campaigns in the streets, ideally faced by violent white resistance, which could dramatize the issues at stake and make good print or electronic copy.”</p><p>The television networks had a clear idea of what their viewers wanted to see, and this resulted in an imagery of Black suffering, combined with extraordinary restraint in not responding in kind to any violence endured. This means that other narratives and perspectives of the fight for civil rights, which was of course a lot more complex than the TV version, did not get a place on prime time television. To come back to Gil Scott-Heron: to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white audience.</p><blockquote>…to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white&nbsp;audience</blockquote><p>If television was the medium that controlled audiences at scale in the 1960s, social media platforms perform that function in our current day and age. And of course especially since the COVID-19 pandemic took on a global scale in early 2020. Here, we are not dependent on a state body granting broadcasting licenses or newsroom making editorial choices, but what we do and do not see appear in our timelines is just as curated, and guided by the terms of service on which social media platforms operate and the algorithms that make sure items either end up “trending” or quietly slip out of&nbsp;sight.</p><p>There are many examples of social media playing a role in organising protests offline, of which the street protests against structural racism and police violence against Black people and people of colour last year is a recent and vivid&nbsp;example.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter hashtag and movement was born in the summer of 2013, when labour organiser Alicia Garza responded on her Facebook page to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the man who murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</p><p>Following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, the Black Lives Matter movement swelled in numbers, with protests not only taking place across the United States, but also internationally. Social media facilitated much of the organising and allowed information, images and videos of protests to be instantly shared with millions worldwide.</p><blockquote>The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see</blockquote><p>Another protest that we saw in 2020 was the #EndSARS demonstrations in Nigeria. The movement had started in 2017 to protest against police brutality in the country by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and was reinvigorated in October last year after new abuses were brought to light. The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see.</p><p>This online sharing of information — photos, protest details, livestreaming videos — is also where the greatest vulnerability lies for movement organising. Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use of and, of course, a variety of private companies have been able to monetise. By monitoring messages and images posted on social media, sometimes through the use of fake user accounts, and combining that with other information, it is possible to identify upcoming protests and even individual protesters.</p><blockquote>Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use&nbsp;of</blockquote><p>While the FBI needed to get Attorney General Robert Kennedy’s approval to place wiretaps on Dr King’s home and offices in an attempt to discredit him and destroy his reputation, no such measures are needed when surveilling movements through public social media posts. The same information that helps us mobilise in the streets can be collected and turned against&nbsp;us.</p><p>Supporting the Fight for LGBTQ&nbsp;rights</p><p>Freedom of expression ties in with the fight for equal rights of LGBTQ people in many ways. Amongst others by bringing to light inequalities and calling for them to be addressed; through organising and demonstrating, as we just touched upon; and by supporting the expression of individual identity.</p><p>Just like exposure was important for the civil rights movement to get racial inequalities examined and addressed, it is important for many other rights movements to see their cause featured in the media. But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</p><blockquote>But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</blockquote><p>A well-established media theory is that of “Hallin’s spheres”, developed by journalism historian Daniel C. Hallin in the late 1980’s. Hallin divides the world of political discourse into three concentric spheres: the middle circle is the sphere of consensus, which concerns topics on which there is widespread agreement. In the sphere of consensus, journalists assume everyone agrees. There is not a lot of exciting material for them to cover there, but it is also not kept out of the press. The next circle is that of legitimate controversy, topics on which people hold differing views. These topics are the most important to cover for journalists: there will be a lot of interest in them and journalists can help facilitate an informed debate. The outer circle is that of “deviance”, a label we wouldn’t really choose anymore nowadays, and those are the topics that fall outside the bounds of legitimate debate. Journalists are free to ignore these topics in their coverage. What falls within these categories shifts as public opinion shifts, which of course raises a bit of a chicken and egg question on how public opinion can shift if no one is reporting on certain&nbsp;issues.</p><p>For a long period of time, LGBTQ issues were part of the third circle we just looked at: they were not reported on at all in mainstream media or only to a limited degree, and then often negatively. In response to a nationwide demand in the United Kingdom by lesbians and gay men to be able to access news on the gay and lesbian liberation movement, the newspaper Gay News was founded in 1972 in a collaboration between former members of the Gay Liberation Front and members of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.</p><p>The paper played a key role in the struggle for gay rights in the 1970s in the UK. Described as the movement’s “debating chamber”, the paper reported on discrimination, progress that was made in the fight for political and social equalities, and campaigned for further law reform, including equal rights in employment and the trade union movement. It also published personal ads, even though this was illegal at the time, under the headline “Love knoweth no&nbsp;laws.”</p><blockquote>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed</blockquote><p>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed. And this is where Gay News ran into difficulty a number of times. It had repeated clashes with W.H. Smith, which controlled one-third of the newspaper and magazine distribution in the UK at the time and who initially refused to stock the paper due to an alleged “low potential for&nbsp;sales”.</p><p>In countries like the UK, distribution is less of a problem these days for LGBTQ publications. In addition to self-published online Zines as touched upon earlier, big commercial publishers like Condé Nast have started to take on intersectional queer publications like the community platform them. To speak with Hallin’s circles: they are no longer part of the “outer” circle. This is not to say that the playing field is even now, but the landscape is starting to&nbsp;change.</p><blockquote>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities</blockquote><p>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities. It is not entirely a rosy picture, however. While there is no need to rely on a conservative establishment to get content distributed, like Gay News had to if it wanted to effectively reach its audience, social media platforms bring their own obstacles. Content “moderation” is often skewed against queer expression, and platform policies, such as Facebook’s real name policy, which effectively forces transgender persons to use their dead name if they want to be able to access the platform, are highly problematic. Going online also doesn’t mean it is possible to fully escape government censorship: platforms tend to comply with local “gay propaganda” legislation like we see in, for example Russia, and take down LGBTQ content or suppress related hashtags and search&nbsp;results.</p><p>Freedom of Expression and&nbsp;Power</p><p>We just looked at publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights, and how freedom of expression facilitates — and sometimes hampers — other rights both offline and online in those contexts. Now, before we move on to the panel discussions, I would like to share some further reflections on where we are with freedom of expression at the moment and what I believe we should be thinking of as we navigate the digital landscape.</p><p>At the outset of this talk, I said I did not want to downplay the challenges we are facing at the moment, with most of our lives moving online and the exercise of our human rights along with it. And it is of course a reality that the exercise of many of our rights are now taking place on private platforms.</p><p>But: the question how we hold “big business” to account for human rights violations is also something we have struggled with before speech moved online. We are all too familiar with the images of, for example, big oil companies destroying wildlife and the livelihood of farmers through their negligence, as well stories about the use of child slavery in the production of our food, clothes, and smartphones. And while the conversation about corporate social responsibility and business and human rights is still very much ongoing, there are some positive lessons we can draw on for rethinking responsibility and accountability when it comes to corporations.</p><blockquote>…the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will.</blockquote><p>In the end, though, the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will. How far are our societies, the governments that we elect, willing to go to guarantee that human rights are upheld, guaranteed and protected?</p><p>The main challenge is of course how the human rights framework is set up, which is state-centric: the state has a number of obligations — to respect, protect and fulfil human rights — vis-à-vis individuals. We are not yet at a stage where direct horizontal effect of human rights, which would allow individuals to seek redress for human rights violations from another individual directly, including from actors like companies, is a&nbsp;fact.</p><p>So for the moment, we will need to work within the framework that we have, which means that human rights enforcement against companies and corporations, including the platforms on which much of our public debate takes place nowadays, will have to go via the&nbsp;state.</p><p>And this brings us back to the question of power dynamics: as individuals, we are dependent on the state and the international systems that states have created to see our human rights respected. Who actually gets to seek redress is a matter of access to justice, which is by no means equally distributed. The quip that “justice is open to all, like the Ritz hotel” still very much holds&nbsp;true.</p><p>This is what often makes me a bit anxious about the discussions on “regulating platform power”. Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very nervous. As some of the examples we just looked at demonstrated, and the overall picture around the globe when it comes to protecting free speech and journalism shows, government is often the problem and not the answer when it comes to stifling the free flow of information.</p><blockquote>Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very&nbsp;nervous</blockquote><p>Take an example like the NetzDG legislation in Germany, which makes it mandatory for companies like Facebook to remove “hate speech” from its platform or risk hefty fines. Enthusiastically copied by countries across the world, often by countries that do not have a good track record when it comes to protecting free speech, and often modified to expand the type of speech that should be taken down, this type of legislation has been shown to incentivise an overly zealous approach to speech removal. Putting the wrong type of pressure on platforms, and giving governments more power to suppress expression is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>If we are talking about regulation, I am much more in favour of thinking in the direction of parallels to the way another powerful private sector, that of banking and finance, is regulated. This would include putting in place stringent transparency obligations: what is taken down and promoted online and why; how are these processes and decisions automated? It would need to be combined with clear and accessible procedures for people to seek redress for perceived violations within an acceptable timeframe (as “justice delayed is also justice denied”…).</p><p>My main qualm with theorising about “solutions” for the conundrum of online speech regulation, however, is that we must ensure to not mistake the manifestation of a problem for the problem itself. Our societies have big, structural problems: power asymmetries that maintain structural inequalities, institutional racism, capitalism. Whatever we create in that setting, including internet platforms, will reproduce that.</p><blockquote>…while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look&nbsp;deeper</blockquote><p>So while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look deeper at the root causes of why it’s broken in the first place. If we accept societies in which those whose human rights are routinely violated generally won’t be able to easily seek justice, how do we expect to do better when it comes to safeguarding their human rights&nbsp;online?</p><p>You have heard me be critical of our societies and its power structures and I imagine some of you might be asking the question: “But wait: what about the human rights system itself? This, too, is a product of those same power structures and interests.” This is a very good point, and one I often struggle with, especially when I am reminded of Audre Lorde’s quote that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house”.</p><p>Where I stand on this at the moment is a belief that we need to combine a longer-term, aspirational vision with a certain degree of pragmatism. Even if our human rights framework may not be perfect, it is a good place to start to fight for our rights as individuals and as communities. And while we do so, we can work on changing the system itself in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>In doing this, we have to continue to be mindful of the broader impact our work has. Will taking up this particular fight lower barriers for others or increase them? Are we trading individual success for common good? This will entail making difficult choices at times, in which especially those of us who are lawyers and litigators will need to set our egos aside and look beyond short-term wins and ask what structural, systemic change we want to work towards in the longer&nbsp;term.</p><p>Coming back to the right to freedom of expression, and the role it plays in facilitating not only other human rights, but also the very struggle for their realisation, I want to make one final&nbsp;note.</p><blockquote>Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement</blockquote><p>And that is that it is important to make sure that, whatever we do, we don’t end up with a lowest common denominator approach or a restrictive interpretation of what a good space for debate is. Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement. When I say this, I am not arguing for a right to insult, but rather for a right to provoke. Professor, feminist, and social activist bell hooks expressed this wonderfully in her 1994 essay “Censorship from Left and Right”, and I would like to close with her&nbsp;words:</p><p>“When repression via censorship becomes the norm in progressive political circles, we not only undermine our collective struggles to end domination, we act in complicity with that brand of contemporary, chic fascism that evokes romantic images of unity and solidarity, a return to traditional values, while working to deny free speech and suppress all forms of rebellious thought and action. In recent years, feminist thinkers have fought long and hard to make feminist thinking, theorizing, and practice a radical space of openness where critical dialogue can take place. Much of that struggle has been waged by women of color, beginning with the conflict over whether or not to see issues of race and racism as feminist agendas. Feminist movement, black liberation struggle, and all our progressive political movements to end domination must work to protect free speech. To maintain the space for constructive contestation and confrontation, we must oppose censorship. We remember the pain of silence and work to sustain our power to speak-freely, openly, provocatively.”</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://digitalfreedomfund.org/the-great-facilitator-free-speech-and-power-online-and-off/">https://digitalfreedomfund.org</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-great-facilitator-free-speech-and-power-online-and-off-9651b38c4803">The Great Facilitator: Free Speech and Power, Online and Off</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m very grateful for the opportunities provided to me as an employee of RBC. The bank has created a fast paced environment where I truly learn something new each day. I’m constantly challenged to grow in my role, something I find very rewarding as I know it’s because my team sees potential in me.</p>
<p>This type of environment is something I never thought I’d be able to find in a role that doesn’t require me to travel extensively. I’m very fortunate that I can develop my my career each day while still being home in time for dinner with my family each night.</p>
<p>My work allows me to be my best self in all aspects of my life and that’s what drives me to get out of bed.</p>
 
How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Throughout my career, I’ve been in many different roles – systems administrator, business analyst, technical lead, project manager and project control officer. The wide variety of experiences has really helped me understand how these various functions work together technically.&nbsp; More importantly, I’ve learned many power skills from the people that I’ve worked with. Each person we meet has a story to tell and a lesson to teach.</p>
<p>In one of my first corporate roles, my supervisor was a former submariner, obviously carrying a superhuman level of diligence that I try to incorporate into my own work. There we shared a manager who taught us the importance of being calm and approaching things rationally in every situation.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve had an amazing manager and mentor, Melissa Carvalho, who has taught me what it means to be agile. Melissa has taught me to always be prepared with facts and data surrounding every situation so we know when to push and when to pivot. This has allowed me to accomplish more and deliver higher quality work than I honestly knew I was capable of.</p>
<blockquote>
 It’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.<br>
What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
</blockquote>
<p>Another mentor I’ve learned a lot from taught me about working with people in unique environments. Every environment is truly unique. As non-unionized employees in a union environment, we needed to learn very quickly how to be aware of and always respectful of the protections afforded to our unionized counterparts. The team had a large workload and needed to comply by certain timelines to ensure they were following their commitments to the union too. With limited time to get to know everyone and learn the roles I’d be helping them with, I found that it’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>I want to focus on continue here…Continue setting baselines and benchmarks to ensure we’re all held accountable to providing equitable opportunities. Continue facilitating discussions on how we can build better products that work for all of our clients. Continue cascading these messages into the workforce.</p>
<p>I know we still have so much work to do, but I’m very inspired by the conversations I’ve had in recent months. A lot of questions after previous WiD engagements centered on why diversity matters. In the past year, there’s definitely been a shift. People are now asking how they can be a part of creating diverse teams and providing equitable opportunities.</p>
 
In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In terms of technology, diverse workforces create better solutions that work for more people. More importantly, diversity brings a richness to our lives that make us all better, stronger, more creative and more compassionate.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>We’ve been looking at a lot of art over the past year- almost like a tour of museums from home. I’m currently reading about Burhan Doğançay (1929 – 2013), a Turkish-American artist probably best known for his works turning graffiti and signs posted on urban walls into modern art. I love that art transcends time and provides a geo-political view of the past.</p>
  
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Work on time management and develop a better understanding of your priorities!</p>

 Tell us a little bit about what you do in the world of identity 
<p>My current role is Director, IAM Business Systems Analysis at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). In this role I oversee a team of Business Analysts who are assigned to work on the various solutions we implement to help centralize the bank’s internal enterprise Identity and Access Management</p>
<p>Another service I oversee is the enhancement process, basically managing requests to enhance and innovate the solutions that support our various objectives. We also manage the Intake process for new capability requests across the many IAM services to ensure they align to our roadmaps and strategic direction.</p>
<p>More recently we have started to focus on Customer IAM (CIAM) and my team will support these initiatives that look to centralize not only our enterprise IAM but also CIAM within the bank. It’s a really exciting development for us as it aligns to such a core focus for our industry.</p>
<p>I can certainly say no two days are the same!! There are so many moving parts. Recently, I have been handling the organizational change management responsibilities for the IAM services we work on, which has added an exciting new layer not only for me but for the wider team.</p>
<p>What I really love most about my role is the combination of self-growth opportunities, the people I work with, the organization as a whole, the great leadership I have experienced,&nbsp; Leading a team of amazing and resilient individuals, I am so proud to be able to support their career growth and development,</p>
<blockquote>
 Diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table. 
</blockquote>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Firstly I had to remove any self-doubt and trust that I was capable.</p>
<p>Although I have been in the IAM space for 10+ years, I came in with no experience or formal training and that was scary. Much of what I know I learned on the job but I was also fortunate to have had a number of great leaders and mentors. Here I want to call out Melissa Carvalho, Her knowledge and expertise really motivated me. Thanks to her and my other mentors I became a sponge just absorbing everything they taught me. I am convinced that has contributed to getting me to this point, encouraging me to continue to grow and learn.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>To ask questions and encourage questions, feedback, recommendations and input.</p>
<p>We may have always done things a certain way&nbsp; but it does not always mean this is the only way. Being curious allows us to find efficiencies and improvements. It helps build a culture of creativity and thought leadership, driving and seeking change.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>As we focus on identity trends from advancing MFA with adaptive authentication, AI, biometrics or even self-sovereign identity, challenge the status quo.&nbsp; Do not rush into digital identity solutions without the backing of a diverse team who can help address the wide range of issues faced by our users.</p>
<p>Continue to focus on diversity within this space, to make room for different opinions and drive new discussions.</p>
<p>Stop looking for specific, pre-defined skillsets and start and/or continue to provide opportunities for candidates from outside our sector and ‘different’ backgrounds. Different people bring different perspectives which is exactly what we need if the identity sector is to thrive.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Because it broadens our perspective and allows for a variety of viewpoints that inspire me. I see real creativity and innovation come through from our teams but, more importantly, diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80240086">RBG (Ruth Bader Ginsburg)</a></p>
<p>This documentary is so powerful and moving and gives a real insight into the life and personality of this amazing woman who drove so much change around women’s rights.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>When a plan does not work out the way you envision, don’t let it stop you!</p>
<p>Adapt to change; failure is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Look at the lessons it taught you, rather than the setbacks or discomfort you felt.</p>
<p>And, finally, fall forward and use it to build your resiliency tool kit!</p>

 Berkman Klein event explores the early years of online platforms, the state of current platforms, and the&nbsp;future <p>“Today’s platforms were inspired by the many that preceded them, but along the way, we started to go astray. How can we make sense of where we are today? What can we understand about the decisions that were made and the structures we had in place? And most importantly, how can the builders of new platforms that also intend to bring the world closer together, give everyone the power to create or organize the world’s information, do it&nbsp;better?”</p><p>BKC fellow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jad-esber">Jad Esber</a> posed these overarching questions at the start of a Berkman Klein Center <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">event</a> that looked back on online platforms over the past 30 years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a>, the founder of Flickr, <a href="http://www.bohnettfoundation.org/david-bohnett-bio/">David Bohnett</a>, the founder of Geocities, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/baym/">Nancy Baym</a>, Sr. Principal Research Manager, Microsoft Research, joined Esber to reflect on early platforms, the state of newer platforms today, and what they could look like in the future. Their conversation covered topics including subcultures, content moderation, and the evolution of technology.</p><p>Fake and Bohnett are themselves founders of early popular platforms, and early in the discussion, the panelists highlighted the significance of founders’ values shaping the platforms, and how that trend continues today.</p><p>“You can do a lot to influence and change and manage how a community grows and develops from the outset,” Fake said. “And so much of it is based on the personalities of the founders: what they value, what they don’t value, how they design the software,” she said, also pointing out the important role of business&nbsp;models.</p><p>“I paid a lot of particular attention to the values of building communities of interest,” Bohnett added, highlighting that founders’ values also play a critical role in the inclusiveness of platforms. “Do the founders and the early settlers or participants in these communities value inclusiveness and diversity through their actions?” he asked. “That’s what helps foster&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Baym, in turn, emphasized that values may be harmful in the long run. “They’re essential but I think that we see platforms over and over kind of lose their way when it becomes about the founder’s values,” she said. “And one of the ways I think that they go really wrong is that early on their users who are different from the founders who were running into real problems with those platforms and the users are going, ‘hello, there’s this really bad thing happening to me here.’ And the founders for whatever reasons are not fully able to absorb what they’re hearing about the dangers their platforms are posing. And I don’t mean to underestimate the technical and human labor demands of trying to deal with all of that adequately. They’re very, very hard problems.”</p><p>The discussants also talked about the shift from free services that run on users’ data towards fee-based platforms and how these business models may shape or inform user behavior and investment in the online communities.</p><p>“I do think that people are evolving into a kind of a paid model in reaction to a lot of the exploitation that they’ve suffered under for a long time. And as a result of that, I think, these are obviously very positive trends,” she said, citing Patreon and Substack as examples. “I do think Internet business models swing back and forth between the paid and the free and it’s a pendulum swing that many of us, I think that work in kind of online social systems actually welcome to a great degree. So, I do think that the behaviors are different on platforms that you pay for for all of the reasons David and Nancy have already kind of explained.”</p><p>But the pay-to-play model is not an option for everyone, Baym noted. “I think the trick with platforms you have to pay for, of course, is that we want people who don’t have excess income to be able to participate in online communities,” she said. “So we have to think through how do you enable that so that people in poverty are not getting a third rate internet while the rich folks get the really good community, which of course exacerbates wealth and&nbsp;equity.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">here</a>.

  <p>The origin of the LEI is firmly rooted in financial services and regulation, yet its future undeniably points to universal applicability across public and private sectors, with relevance to organizations large and small. This potential was recognized at the nascence of the LEI by its chief endorsers, the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). While the LEI’s initial purpose was to provide unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions across the globe, the G20 and the FSB were clear from the start that the LEI should become a broad public good and that it holds vast opportunity for the private sector. </p>
<p>Happily, the success of the LEI in context of its initial purpose has stimulated enthusiastic attention for the potential it offers outside of financial services regulation. With 1.82 million LEIs issued to date, 116 regulations and laws globally mandating LEI usage across financial services reporting, supervision and identification use cases worldwide, and a well-established and optimally functioning global LEI issuance and management infrastructure, there is a very convincing and reliable case for its use to be explored and championed in other areas.    </p>
<p>Consequently, in recent years there has been advancing acceptance and advocacy of the LEI’s value as a unique universal identifier among regulators, governments, public authorities and private sectors worldwide. Alongside increasing legislation that mandates the LEI as an identifier for participants in certain financial transactions, there is a growing appetite among leading industry influencers for LEI usage to be extended across existing and new markets and applications. All of this signals that we are on the verge of exciting and transformational developments as we look to the years ahead. </p>
<p>Yet with so many – as yet unidentified and untested - ways in which the LEI’s capabilities can be harnessed, there are many current and potential LEI stakeholders who are unaware or unclear of its potential to deliver unique trust benefits to identity management scenarios and ecosystems globally. GLEIF recognizes that the universal relevance of the LEI means that its future potential far exceeds its current application. Quite simply, all use cases have not yet been envisioned, least of all demonstrated, because its use cases are potentially limitless. This is especially true as society moves towards digitalization, and digital identity management systems are increasingly required to establish trust and transparency in online exchanges. The LEI is perfectly poised to support this challenge. </p>
<p>For this reason, GLEIF is launching this ‘LEI Lightbulb Series’. Its aim is to bring clarity, knowledge and understanding of how the LEI is being used and championed, both inside and outside of regulatory realms and who its advocates are, in order to create a ‘complete picture’ of the LEI’s progress. We hope that by sharing news of high-profile support and implementation by regulators and public and private sector influencers across a myriad of sectors, applications and geographies, we may help readers arrive at their own ‘light bulb’ moment regarding the increasing relevance and universal application of the LEI in use cases and industries beyond those circles where it is already well established.   </p>
<p>While educating on the powerful impact the LEI has already had on industry transformation and digitalization through regulatory mandates, and where its value has been recognized through endorsements by credible authorities, this blog series will also aim to outline the business case for consideration of further LEI usage and potential regulation, in industries and for use cases where it could make an immediate and positive impact. </p>
<p>By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a groundswell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide.</p>

 Here’s what the next three months look like for BrightID. BrightID Q2 2021&nbsp;Roadmap<p>Let’s go into each of the six milestones in a little more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>🔬 Node discovery. How does a client (for example the BrightID app on your mobile device) know which node in the BrightID network to connect to? After this milestone, clients will be able to find out about other nodes from a small list of hard-coded “seed” nodes. If seed nodes trust other nodes, they’ll be added to the list. Then clients can use a “<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race">promise race</a>” and other data to find the best node to connect&nbsp;to.</p><p>👩‍🔬 Anti-Sybil: Stronger connection types. You may have noticed there are different connection levels in BrightID. Different connection levels create different graphs of users. The goal is to have a verification that uses the very strong “recovery” connection level, which real people only assign to others they trust enough to help guard their BrightID against theft or&nbsp;loss.</p><p>🕵🏽‍♀️ Blind signatures. Currently, BrightID nodes store mappings between anonymous identifiers used by apps and BrightID identifiers so that an app can query about someone’s unique verification using their own identifiers. (BrightIDs are not shared with apps.) While this structure makes it less likely that a data leak could reveal information from one app to another, we can do even better. <a href="https://forum.brightid.org/t/improved-privacy-social-recovery-for-apps-no-need-for-contexts/54">With blind signatures, we can remove this mapping completely</a>. This simplifies the architecture and makes the system even more immune to data&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>📲 Client portability. We’ve already created the necessary features in the node API for a user to install BrightID on multiple devices and backup or recover their BrightID using another device, but would be hard to implement this without an example. We’re going to build a web version of BrightID that supports these features so that others can use it as an example to make their own BrightID&nbsp;clients.</p><p>💉 Anti-Sybil: attack modeling and injection. <a href="https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-AntiSybil">We’ve already created a great platform for modeling sybil attacks and comparing the results of different algorithms or parameters</a>. In some approaches to sybil-resistance in social networks, there is a manual review step, and the algorithm is used to prioritize accounts to review. As a pseudonymous network, BrightID prefers an automated way to define the line between sybil and honest users. We can do this by automatically injecting modeled attacks into the real graph and measuring their rank against previously measured&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>🛡️Node Security. BrightID nodes have already gone through a hardening process, with sensible rate limits in place by default, but we want to take another pass at this. We also want to create <a href="https://stoplight.io/blog/introduction-to-api-testing/#api-producer-contract-testing">API contract tests</a> to make sure our node API and <a href="https://dev.brightid.org/docs/node-api/">reference docs</a> match. We will also audit the use of digital signatures and secure message&nbsp;passing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/brightid-2021-q2-roadmap-e8585a42c3fc">BrightID 2021 Q2 Roadmap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 We meet Krista Pawley to find out about her role as a&nbsp; ‘woman in identity’ …. 
<p></p>
 Tell us about yourself and your work as Co-Lead at IdentityNORTH 
<p>We started IdentityNORTH as a small group of 30 people in a conference room and we’ve now grown into a community of over 3000 leaders from all sectors dedicated to working together to build a more innovative, secure, and inclusive digital economy.</p>
<p>What gets me excited about this work is the ability to connect with some of the smartest people in tech, public policy, civil society and business on some of the biggest questions facing our our world.</p>
<p>Over the years that I have been doing this work, I have seen how our conversations have evolved&nbsp; from highly technical discussions focused on IT and workflows to a more user-centric dialogue, focused on people, privacy and leveraging digital Identity.&nbsp; We are much more focused now on how we enable a more inclusive and safe digital economy.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we have the talent, vision, and community in Canada to lead the world in digital transformation. It’s what gets me up each morning!&nbsp; And I know we can do it in an inclusive, privacy-enhancing way that will benefit all Canadians. The ability to be part of something that makes that kind of positive impact is so exciting to me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I have had the privilege of working at senior levels across government&nbsp; (on and off Parliament Hill),&nbsp; the private sector (financial services, loyalty, and consumer retail sector leading teams in over 50 countries) and the non-profit world (working with a global leader in education and financial inclusion). Five years ago I decided to take what I had learned over the past 20 years and turn my experience, network, and energy towards building communities of action around the big questions that have the potential to drive positive change in Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>Inspired by the leaders and mentors who guided me throughout my career, I worked with communities like IdentityNORTH, SingularityU Canada, the Atlantic Council Geo Tech Centre, and Equitas to build communities of leaders who believe that we have the tools, the technology, and the responsibility to build a better future together.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation.</p></blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>People like to be asked, and they like to be thanked. A political boss taught me that!</p>
<p>If you are looking to build a community, you need to think about who should be part of that community. Don’t go just for those you already know and who look, sound, and think like you. Invite people from different backgrounds and perspectives. Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation. This is how we grow, how we learn. When people feel included, they are more likely to help you and you are more likely to learn.</p>
<p>Oh, and say thank you. Being grateful and expressing that gratitude shows others that you recognize and appreciate them. It also re-enforces your own sense of appreciation for all that is good and constructive around you. That gratitude can help see you through a lot of challenges.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>If you are looking to grow your business in the digital age, digital identity is a vital enabler of that growth. The Pandemic pushed us forward at least five years in terms of customers’ willingness to adopt and demand secure, trusted, convenient, and user-centric digital services. From e-commerce and on-line banking to healthcare and education, every sector has the potential to be transformed through digitisation. The leaders who recognize this and build tools to enable their organisations to adapt will not only survive; they will thrive.</p>
<p>CEOs and Boards need to STOP looking in the rearview mirror and building strategies and business models that imagine a future that looks like our past. They need to START thinking about the exponential technologies that are transforming our world and think about how these might impact their business and sector. This new way of leading will require both courage and imagination. They need to START seeking out truly diverse perspectives to help them imagine the unimaginable future and plan for it – because chances are what is unimaginable is more likely than many believe.</p>
<p>Lastly, they need to CONTINUE building the critical infrastructure that will enable them to seize these opportunities. Working with organizations like DiACC (Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada), Women in Identity, and IdentityNORTH, leaders have the opportunity to move ahead of the competition. Diverse viewpoints from these extended teams helps with understanding and implementing the critical frameworks and tools that will make a real difference.</p>
<blockquote><p>diverse perspectives help to imagine the unimaginable future</p></blockquote>
 
Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the key to learning. If all we ever hear are the voices of those who look, think, and feel like us, we will fail to learn and grow.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>Warren Berger’s A More Beautiful Question.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of us have lost our curiosity; we are afraid to ask questions for fear of looking foolish. Berger shows us that the foolish thing is , in fact, to stop asking. That learning, wisdom, and growth come from the courage to ask and stay curious.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Seek out the people you admire and ask them for advice. I was too shy as a teen to do this. When I got older, I learned that many of the people I admired were kind, generous people who were happy to help when approached with a thoughtful, clear request.</p>

<p>Digital Identity NZ is entering a new phase of its journey; our superlative inaugural Chair David Morrison is joined by Ben Tairea as Co-Chair and Tamāra Al-Salim as Deputy Chair.&nbsp; You can read more about Tamāra’s and Ben’s stories below.&nbsp; The trio will lead the governance of the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>&nbsp;as we navigate the next period of rapid change.&nbsp; This is also my last newsletter as Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ.&nbsp; Like David, I took on this role upon the formation of Digital Identity NZ in 2019, and after nearly 2 ½ years it is time to hand over the pleasure and responsibility to someone new.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I reflect on the last 2+ years, an overriding theme is one of interconnectedness, both technically and socially.&nbsp; The premise and promise of digital identity is more seamless and efficient ways of interacting online, whilst at the same time improving privacy, transparency, security and choice (solutions that are truly mana-enhancing).&nbsp; The words of the karakia gifted to us by Janelle Riki-Waaka (kaiwhakahaere/advisor and member of our Executive Council) are apt to the journey we are on:</p>



<p>Unuhia te pō, te pō whiri mārama<br>Tomokia te ao, te ao whatu tāngata<br>Tātai ki runga, tātai ki raro, tātai aho rau<br>Haumi e, hui e, tāiki e!<br>&nbsp;<br>From the confusion comes understanding<br>From understanding comes unity<br>We are interwoven, we are interconnected<br>Together as one!</p>



<p>We start and end all of our Council meetings, webinars and working groups with these words as a reminder of our shared past, present and future.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is much work still to be done as we collectively work on a digital identity ecosystem designed for Aotearoa.&nbsp; This is the work of Government, iwi, innovators, advocates, academics, community groups and businesses of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; My parting challenge to us all is to continue to work in trusted collaboration for the benefit of all people in Aotearoa, and to do so with the core principles of Te Tiriti anchoring the mahi (work); kāwanatanga (honourable governance), rangatiratanga (self determination and agency) and ōretitanga (equity and partnership).</p>

The solution is built on the<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/"> Energy Web Decentralized Operating System</a> (EW-DOS) open-source technology stack and focuses on the entire battery lifecycle. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, installers, and accredited inspection and certification organizations issue and verify every relevant asset transaction. The fact that all these entities work together on a shared decentralized ecosystem is an important and never-seen-before innovation.</p><p>“By having created a decentralized digital passport, the entire logistic flow — from put-on-market all the way to reverse logistics for the takeback obligation and waste collection — is digitized on a decentralized digitally trusted ledger,” said Philippe Decrock from Bebat. “This represents a revolutionary, customer-centric solution and affirms a key business case for distributed ledger technology.’”</p><p>In recent years, battery lifecycle management has taken on heightened importance, thanks to the fast-growing adoption of customer-owned distributed energy resources (DERs), including residential batteries and electric vehicles&nbsp;(EVs).</p><p>Just last month, the European Commission<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2312"> announced the first initiative</a> (the EU Battery Regulation) under its Circular Economy Action Plan: making batteries sustainable, high-performing, and safe along their entire life cycle — thus making them consistent with the carbon-neutral ambition of the European Green Deal. This includes minimizing the environmental impact of batteries and repurposing batteries from electric vehicles and industrial batteries so that they can have a second life. The core of this new initiative is the idea of a Battery Digital Passport, which is exactly where the EasyBat solution built on EW-DOS comes into&nbsp;play.</p><p>“We’ve long focused on creating ‘passports’ for assets like batteries. This concept is core not just to our tech stack but to the evolving electricity system around the world. The European Commission’s new initiative on Battery Passports is a strong validation of the concept and sets the stage for market transformation throughout the EU. We’re excited to see it come to life in EasyBat,” said Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer for Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>EasyBat will help Bebat to easily monitor the specific data linked to the legal takeback obligations and/or extended producers responsibility (EPR) of battery manufacturers. They have an obligation to register and report the put-on-market of various batteries (including technical specifications such as chemistry/weight/modules) through the battery’s lifecycle up to the moment of collection at a battery’s end of life. EasyBat makes it possible to holistically manage customer-owned batteries (both private &amp; professional use) participating in Belgian electricity markets — including those on the Fluvius network. EasyBat heavily leverages the open-source EW-DOS technology stack, including EW Switchboard, a new interface for managing decentralized, self-sovereign identities, as well as their associated assets, roles, and permissions.</p><p>Thanks to Switchboard and EW-DOS, customers remain in control of their own identity and the information associated with their assets, such as EV, residential, commercial, and industrial batteries. They create a self-sovereign ‘digital twin’ for any assets, which third-parties such as the manufacturer, installer, and/or DSO can verify. Such a DER Passport — or Battery Passport, in EU Commission parlance — provides a shared state of the asset and its history to any pre-approved energy market participants.</p><p>For example, DSOs like Fluvius and lifecycle management programs like Bebat can monitor batteries throughout their full value chain, from manufacturing to sales to providing energy services such as grid flexibility to secondary re-use (in the case of electric vehicle batteries) to end-of-life disposal (collection, dismantling, and recycling).</p><p>“This approach extends far beyond tracking the history of every DER throughout its lifetime, from manufacturing to operation to end-of-life recycling or decommissioning,” said Bart Coelus of Fluvius. “Creating digital twins of assets, especially DERs at the grid edge, gives grid operators like Fluvius unprecedented visibility into the physical grid they manage. That digital representation of the actual grid will be the core layer of future grid operations. EW Switchboard accelerated our progress on this front, allowing us to move further, faster down the path of digitalization.”</p><p>About Bebat<br>Bebat is a Belgian nonprofit association (vzw) established in 1995 by battery manufacturers — including Duracell, Energizer, Varta and Panasonic — to enable companies to meet the take-back obligation for the Belgian market. Bebat gives new life to used batteries and ranks among the world leaders in the collection of used batteries. Used batteries can be handed in at one of 24,000 collection points, convenient and free of charge. Bebat organises their collection as well as the sorting and recycling process. In 2019 Bebat collected more than 3,600 tons of batteries in Belgium. Over the last five years, Bebat has already collected 10.000 electric vehicle (EV) batteries, which it recycles through the best recycling companies in Belgium and Europe. With the growth of waste industrial batteries, Bebat also measures to make possible repurposing, re-use of waste batteries with still-usable capacity, and responsible end-of-life disposal for spent batteries. Bebat is also part of <a href="https://www.reneos.eu/">Reneos European cooperative</a>, a network of Europe’s top national battery collection systems, including GRS Batterien in Germany, Stibat in the Netherlands, Batteriretur in Norway, and Cobalt in Italy. The Reneos network covers 20 EU countries.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://www.bebat.be/en/homepage">https://www.bebat.be/en/homepage</a>.</p><p>About Fluvius<br>Fluvius is the network operator created on 1 July 2018 by the merger of Eandis and Infrax.

<p>I’m pleased to announce that the OpenID Foundation has <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">published the Financial-grade API (FAPI) Parts 1.0 and 2.0 final specifications</a>. This is a true accomplishment for open banking initiatives worldwide. The Foundation couldn’t have reached this important milestone with the FAPI specification without the leadership of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> led by&nbsp;Chairman Nat Sakimura, Anoop Saxena (Intuit), Dave Tonge (MoneyHub), and a diverse group of experts with the technical chops, persistence and patience for the painstaking work of open&nbsp;technical standards development.</p>
<p>In many respects this is old news. &nbsp;Hundreds of organizations, large and small, from around the&nbsp;world, have for years adopted FAPI in the most&nbsp;important way, they’ve implemented it. &nbsp;They’ve&nbsp;implemented it after&nbsp;publicly self-certifying&nbsp;their&nbsp;conformance. In doing so they’ve confirmed:</p>
 
 FAPI is good for adoption (A standard is only as good as its adoption) 
 FAPI delivers on its promise of reliability, repeatability and security 
 FAPI is being adopted by others 
 
<p>Ultimately FAPI has reached a tipping point in the lifecycle of a standard where there is positive feedback:</p>
 
 A standard is only as good as its adoption 
 A standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its results 
 A standard’s value is measured by the number of instances of certified conformance extant in the market 
 
<p>Few areas of the increasingly noisy, fragmented global ecosystem demonstrate the importance of a standardized, certified approach better than open banking. Despite the potential, many stakeholders are still struggling to&nbsp;keep to open banking rollout schedules more than two years after the UK Open Banking Implementation Entity and PSD2 came into effect. The lack of a standardized security approach is acknowledged as a key factor in this, and one the&nbsp;OpenID Foundation is trying to right through ongoing collaboration with the American, Australian, Brazilian and European colleagues. And if standardization is essential, certification has a critical role to play:</p>
 
 Ensuring implementations’ interoperability and security, while bringing clarity and stability to a complex functional standards environments 
 Helping enforce the secure data exchanges between banks, Fintechs, and schemes to facilitate meeting the&nbsp;complex and changing regulatory requirements 
 
<p>The best way to celebrate the final publication of FAPI 1.0 is to note its <a href="https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor-fase2/">unheralded but important adoption in Brazil</a>. When visiting “Welcome to the Open Banking Brasil Portal developer area”, the references to&nbsp;Financial-grade API (FAPI) are clear even without the English translation. And there are indications of FAPI adoption in Bahrain and the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>But our collective efforts lack a home. Whether in an OIDF, FDX, Berlin Group or STET Group container there is no single,&nbsp;trusted place where anyone, at any time, at no cost can&nbsp;reliably find an&nbsp;authoritative&nbsp;listing of all open&nbsp;finance technical&nbsp;standards.&nbsp;Simply described we need a database, an online library of libraries, of all the technical standards in the open finance ecosystem. While simply described, it is not without challenges. While modest, it solves a burning&nbsp;business problem and one that requires a solution that best comes from an international collaboration of organizations, perhaps beginning with the OpenID Foundation.</p>

<p>President Biden’s ability to rebuild alliances, restore America’s standing in the world and unite the nation hinges on his ability to reign in tech giants here at&nbsp;home</p><p>By Gus Rossi, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>President Biden’s pledge to restore diplomacy as the United States’ primary instrument of foreign policy is an important and necessary shift away from his predecessor’s destructive America First approach that shunned multilateralism and jeopardized relationships with important allies.</p><p>But diplomacy alone is not a cure-all for America’s diminished standing abroad. To regain the trust of our allies and the American people, the Biden administration must wrest control of international affairs from American technology giants and into the hands of US citizens.</p><p>For decades, America’s foreign and digital trade policies had been guided by the notion that whatever Silicon Valley wanted was good for America — and for the world. That naive assumption is finally giving way to the recognition that unregulated and unaccountable tech giants pose great and literal danger for public safety, democracy, and competitive markets.</p><p>President Biden now has an opportunity to act against these&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The hands-off approach began in an era when the internet promised a free flow of information and ideas around the world. Technology, many believed, brought down autocracies in the Arab Spring with tweets instead of bombs. By unlocking social media’s organizing and mobilizing power, Barack Obama became America’s first Black president.</p><p>Democrats, including the Obama administration, were enamored by the tech industry. It helped that many tech leaders supported the administration’s priorities and gave generously to support those progressive causes. Inevitably, this love affair shaped Democrats’ digital foreign and trade&nbsp;policy.</p><p>But Big Tech has long enjoyed a cozy relationship with the executive branch, regardless of which party occupies the White&nbsp;House.</p><p>Silicon Valley has for decades pressured the US to limit the role of the International Telecommunication Union (the U.N. body tasked with setting internet, telecom, and other technical standards) so that tech companies can operate with as few regulations as possible.</p><p>In the early 2010s, the US Embassy to the E.U. lobbied on behalf of Silicon Valley against Europe’s privacy laws and promoted the APEC privacy framework, an alternative that was both toothless and&nbsp;weak.</p><p>When negotiating trade agreements, the US Trade Representative tried to include the Communications Decency Act (CDA) third-party liability shield that enables tech platforms to profit from disinformation and hate&nbsp;speech.</p><p>Both the Obama and Trump administrations consistently fought European efforts to tax tech companies.</p><p>By doing Big Tech’s bidding, US policies left consumers — and our national interest — vulnerable. The result is waning US influence across the globe and a fraying democracy at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Abroad, the EU has become the de-facto regulator of the tech economy with the 2014 adoption of its data and privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has since threatened to ban American companies from moving data across the Atlantic because the US does not offer guarantees for Europeans’ data. China has also seized the opportunity and is promoting its technology to manage our ally’s critical telecom infrastructure. Meanwhile, Chinese social media companies are collecting reams of American and European personal data through social media platforms.</p><p>Stateside, organized online and in plain sight across a variety of internet platforms, the failed insurrection at the Capitol was only the latest, most shocking example of Big Tech’s perverse incentive to promote disinformation and radicalization, suppress innovation, monopolize markets and other anti-democratic activities.</p><p>Fortunately, there signs that the love affair between Democrats and Big Tech is disintegrating:</p><p>Last year, dozens of Democratic state attorneys general brought antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Facebook of being complicit in adding disinformation to the public debate. California, the heavily Democratic home to Silicon Valley, adopted a second landmark privacy law. The House Antitrust Subcommittee subpoenaed thousands of documents from tech titans, grilled CEOs at hearings, and published a report that outlines how to make digital markets competitive. And many Democratic members of Congress are actively considering bills to curtail the power of tech platforms.</p><p>Now, President Biden can both strengthen US democracy and rebuild relationship with allies by making substantial updates to America’s digital foreign policy including:</p><p>· Collaborate with the EU’s to develop and promote a framework for democratic governance of the tech economy, pro-competitive rules, and accountability principles.</p><p>· End trade agreements that make it harder for third countries to hold platforms responsible for promoting disinformation and hate speech. The CDA should not be exported.</p><p>· Protect transatlantic data flows and consumer data with an international agreement that commits the US to a privacy framework compatible and equivalent to Europe’s.</p><p>· Update global corporate tax rules for online companies to avoid a costly balkanization of taxation to American companies and allow third countries to collect a fair amount of taxes from the profit that companies make&nbsp;abroad.</p><p>· Diversify the State Department’s delegations to international institutions by offering travel stipends to independent academics and civil society experts to ensure corporate interests are not the only ones represented.</p><p>How we approach diplomacy abroad should reflect our values and interests at home. More than ever the world needs to hear that America and President Biden believe in the democratic governance and regulation of the tech economy for the public’s interest, not Silicon Valley. Only then will the US begin its uphill fight to restore its standing in the eyes of the world and its citizens&nbsp;alike.</p><p>About Gus Rossi, Principal, Responsible Technology</p><p>As a principal on the Responsible Technology team, Gus is focused on Omidyar Network’s work on encrypted messaging, platforms and power, and alternative business models, with a vision for technology that underpins greater individual empowerment, social opportunity, and user&nbsp;safety.</p><p>Prior to joining Omidyar Network, Gus was the director of global policy at Public Knowledge, an advocacy-oriented nonprofit that promotes freedom of expression, an open internet, and access to affordable communications tools. At the Inter-American Development Bank, Gus served as the director of the Multilateral Investment Fund, a 100 million-dollar investment fund for social innovation in Latin America, and advised the government of Argentina on over 100 loan proposals to develop public and private sectors in the region. Previously, Gus consulted on digital rights issues for Raul Romeva, a member of the European Parliament, as well as served as co-spokesperson for Joves d’Esquerra Verda–Barcelona, the youth branch of the Catalan Green&nbsp;Party.</p><p>Gus holds a B.A. in political science from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, an M.Sc. in international political economy from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and a Ph.D. in political science from the European University Institute.</p>

<p>One of the key principles of DIDAS is that we help experts coming from various industries and professions to work together, learn from each other and bring new ideas on how to apply SSI technology in real world.</p>
<p>To make it happen, we encourage our members to propose topics and explore ideas in dedicated working groups.&nbsp; Working Groups allow us to agree on the goals that the experts will pursue jointly,&nbsp; structure the work and define the results. After all, we want to see SSI become a reality in Switzerland!</p>
<p>We are very happy that more than 15 experts got together to kick off our Onboarding Working Group. This group grew out of the idea that many different activities today require sharing of verifiable information – personal identity, company registration, tax identifiers, addresses, and so on and so forth.<br>
In Switzerland, Financial sector is very strong and so a lot of innovation happens around Fintech.&nbsp; Our original idea, therefore, was to focus on Fintech use-cases around onboarding, KYC and AML processing and similar activities.</p>
<p>As we started to explore these ideas in depth during the session, we understood that not only Fintech, but other Industries ( e.g. Insurance, B2B Supplier onboarding, etc) can benefit strongly from an ability to securely exchange identity and registration data using Verifiable Credentials, which are easy to maintain in the future, including automated invalidation of credentials that were recalled by their issuers.</p>
<p>It is also clear that various use-cases depend on the existing legislation and might be difficult to implement in today’s legal environment.<br>
In recognition of this fact, the group has agreed to catalog various use-cases, examine their legal implications and requirements, explore whether or not it is possible to find solutions and approaches that are compatible with the today’s set of laws, plan technical PoCs and implementations.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Swiss lawyers are among the most creative professionals in the world and are enthusiastic about opportunities to find improvements in the legal system that are required to make Switzerland the best and the most innovative country to do business. The recent legislation on Blockchain Assets in Switzerland is a great demonstration of that fact.<br>
Even in the case that some SSI onboarding use-cases might be difficult to implement within the limits of the current legislation, the group will identify the needed improvements and&nbsp; work with the lawmakers, regulators and politicians to develop and promote the required changes.</p>
<p>This is one of the core missions of DIDAS –&nbsp; drive Thought Leadership and remove barriers to implementation of SSI and Verifiable Claims technology&nbsp;in Switzerland.</p>
<p>If you are interested and want to bring your technical, business, legal and/or creative skills and ideas into the effort, even if you know nothing about the SSI yet, we are looking for you!</p>

<p>ebCore TC's latest specification ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that ebXML Messaging Protocol Binding for RegRep Version 1.0 from the OASIS ebXML Core (ebCore) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) is a family of standards developed through a joint initiative of OASIS and the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). Five of these ebXML standards, including Collaboration Protocol Profile and Agreement, have been approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as the ISO 15000 standard. ebXML provides an open, XML-based infrastructure that enables the global use of electronic business information in an interoperable, secure, and consistent manner by all trading partners.</p>



<p>The ebXML Messaging Protocol Binding for RegRep v1.0 specifies a messaging protocol binding for the Registry Services of the OASIS ebXML RegRep Version 4.0 OASIS Standard. This binding is compatible with both the versions 2.0 and 3.0 of ebMS as well as the AS4 profile and complements the existing protocol bindings specified in OASIS RegRep Version 4.0.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>

 Q&amp;A explores threat actors, early detection, and content moderation Oumou Ly interviews Lisa Kaplan for the latest episode of The Breakdown from the Berkman Klein&nbsp;Center.<p>From 2016 to 2020, research, civil society organizing efforts, industry planning, and national security responses to disinformation centered on the issue from the perspective that malign influence was propagated almost exclusively by foreign adversaries. This thinking was upended to a large extent in 2020 when disinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the presidential election, and other sustained-attention information events exposed the severity of the threat posed by domestic disinformation.</p><p>In this episode of the Breakdown, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly</a> is joined by Lisa Kaplan to further unpack what accounts for the shift in focus, whether stakeholders might consider adjusting mitigations already deployed to combat disinformation, and assess how current organizing around the disinformation problem can be reevaluated and repurposed to suit new challenges.</p><p>Read the transcript, which is lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou, I’m a fellow on the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/assembly">Assembly: Disinformation</a> Program. I am recording today from California, and that is why my background doesn’t appear the way it normally does, but I am excited nonetheless to be joined by Lisa Kaplan of the Alethea Group. Lisa founded the Alethea Group to help organizations navigate the new digital reality and protect themselves against disinformation. Thank you for joining us, Lisa. I’m so excited to have a conversation with you about this and many, many other pertinent issues.</p><p>Lisa Kaplan (LK): Thanks so much for having me, excited to be&nbsp;here.</p><p>OL: Yes. So our conversation today centers on a really, really big topic in the disinformation space, and that is the shift in focus among a bunch of different stakeholder groups, including the national security community, academics, civil society, and others, in focusing on disinformation from a national security/foreign policy geopolitics perspective. Can you give us a little taste of your background and talk about what compelled you to found the Alethea&nbsp;Group?</p><p>LK: So I started the Alethea Group in 2019. And prior to that, I was the digital director on a 2018 Senate campaign.</p><p>One of the things about disinformation that I always like to remind people is that it’s not always a foreign government and it’s not always people who are seeking necessarily geopolitical ends. The goals for threat actors really do vary depending on the threat actor. And that’s one of the reasons why the hard work, the attribution that we do at Alethea Group is so important. But it does depend on who the actor is and what their motive is. And once you know that, you can infer what their goal may be and it can help to mitigate a situation before it even starts or we use [it] to mitigate a situation that’s elevated into more of a crisis situation.</p><p>So I was working for Senator Angus King and because he was running against a Democrat and a Republican, we were looking at disinformation narratives from both sides, not necessarily doing the work of attribution, but because we were a campaign, we had limited resources, trying to understand what the narratives were that were out there. And what we realized is the disinformation, it was targeting candidates, it was targeting issues, but at the end of the day, it’s really targeting voters, us as people. And when you think about it as an election context, it’s really straightforward. It’s trying to influence people’s decisions around when, where, and who to vote for. You know targeting those decision points. Are you going to vote? And then if so, for whom are you gonna cast your&nbsp;ballot?</p><p>However, disinformation, it’s not an issue that’s limited to just elections and especially for sophisticated actors. So think foreign adversaries, think for-profit disinformation networks who have built up influence to then sell to the highest bidder or are building up influence to be able to generate ad revenue through clicks, for example. They’re not just talking about one election or one candidate, they’re talking about a variety of different issues. And so I say that because for us, and it’s the proliferation of this, the number of threat actors since 2016 has been exponential. What started as being primarily Russian, we now have, according to Oxford, over 80 countries who are actively engaging in social media manipulation, and that doesn’t even account for all of the individuals who have stood up their own operations. We also see both sides of the aisle to be clear, political consultants engaging in similar behaviors as on social media manipulation tactics. So it really comes down to who is the actor and what is the goal. Now fast forward. One of the things that we saw, unfortunately, and it’s very unfortunate that it took essentially an insurrection attempt at the US Capitol to really catapult this conversation.</p><p>And there are a variety of research organizations including ours that had been beating this drum for several years now. And so people were saying, oh, it’s just a meme, but no, it can really, you know, disinformation really can lead to offline harms. And we know that. We’ve seen that with Pizzagate, We’ve seen that with different events such as the LA Dodgers stadium being shut&nbsp;down.</p><p>So we are seeing more and more offline action happening as a result of disinformation. I think one of the things about what happened at the US Capitol, is it’s a really important case study. And I say that, and I know it sounds clinical but because what happened was obviously a horrible day for our democracy. And I think it affected the research community in a variety of different ways. That was a very tough month for everyone. So I don’t wanna sound overly clinical about it, but in a lot of ways, there are a lot of lessons that can be learned. So for example, we can draw a straight line from some of the narratives that were happening in March saying that the election would be rigged, that there would be political violence, that people needed to start preparing for the worst, to what happened on January 6th. One of the good things to come out of January 6th, though, is that most people get a second chance. Not everybody, obviously there’s a Capitol police officer who died in the line of duty protecting the Capitol, but we’re able to really learn from this moment and move forward so that we’re addressing this threat in a way that does make it so that we’re able to identify these online threats and prevent them from becoming offline&nbsp;harm.</p><p>OL: Thank you for that summation of not only what happened on January 6th but for illustrating that you can draw a through-line between the initial Stop the Steal on narratives and organizing to what ended up happening on the 6th. And what I think is also projected to continue this week on the 4th. Can you talk a little bit about your practice at Alethea Group and how you help organizations navigate through this new digital environment?</p><p>LK: So at Alethea Group, what we do is we detect instances of disinformation, misinformation, and social media manipulation, as well as track other types of online harm such as targeted harassment to be able to help individuals figure out how to navigate this new digital reality. I think that a lot of times people don’t realize how many options they actually have. So for example, if you’re able to detect what a lot of people are doing right now is they’re analyzing something once it’s already gotten onto Twitter, onto Facebook, onto YouTube, for example, and it’s on one of these mainstream platforms and they call the social media platforms and they say, please take it down. That’s one option. But if you’ve gotten to that point, in a lot of ways it may already be too late. So what we do is we practice early detection. So we catch narratives when they start and we’re able to then track them and understand how they may be influencing individuals and seeking to change individual’s behavior. We analyze on the network level. And what that does is it enables us to take more&nbsp;options.</p><p>So for example, let’s take these for-profit disinformation networks. Well, you know, if they’re making a profit off of a potential organization, there could be an opportunity to seek damages. If they’re misappropriating intellectual property such as your name, your likeness, trademarkable or patentable, or copyrighted material, there are legal options that organizations can take to seek recourse. And if there is an opportunity to do counter-messaging, and I’m not talking about fact-checking and our experience fact-checking, while it’s helpful in creating a paper of record or it’s helpful in giving something to point to, to set the story straight, it’s not sufficient. And here’s why. The people who are choosing to believe in a narrative aren’t necessarily going to believe something salacious about — change their mind — and say they no longer believe something that’s totally salacious about you and confirms their biases about you just because you’re the one that said it isn’t true. So we’re talking about really counter-narrative building. And that can be done in an ethical way by creating a greater understanding around an individual or an organization. So what we do is we help through the entire process. So we detect what’s happening, we assess whether or not it’s having an impact on an organization’s goal. And then we help to mitigate any potential impacts, the idea being that we can solve a lot of problems before they become a real issue or a challenge for an organization.</p><p>OL: Along with the expansion of the threat landscape, there has been sort of an uptick in sustained information events, like the COVID pandemic, like Stop the Steal, and just a lot of that, not just disinformation, but chatter around the election. Are there other structural developments or other factors that you attribute to the expansion of the threat landscape and the shifts that you know the shift in focus from foreign disinformation to domestic?</p><p>LK: Yeah. I think one of the things about disinformation and, you know, there was conversation around how this was gonna happen after 2016 because it’s fast, cheap, and easy to do. If you know how to run a good marketing campaign, you can probably figure out how to run a disinformation campaign. And so with that, and then you also look historically, open-source estimates say that the Russian inner attempt to influence the 2016 election cost a million dollars, which is a rounding error to most large organizations or federal governments. So it wasn’t a question of if other organizations were going to start engaging in these tactics, it was a question of when. And I think what we’ve seen is the proliferation of that. It’s the proliferation of the number of threat actors that’s causing an increased number of threats when it comes to the disinformation landscape.</p><p>So going to the COVID-19 pandemic, and these narratives have shifted over time and they vary again, based on the threat actor. So one thing we saw, and again this is all open-source, just Russian state media. You know we did see Russian state media pushing race narratives targeting different communities and trying to pit them against each other. We saw RT put out content that was more focused on, you know, “what’s the big deal with calling it the China virus,” for example, “we called it the Spanish flu.” And RT typically targets one audience. And then we saw it in the NOW, which is, typically targeting younger audiences on Instagram with videos being like, “if you are Asian, you will get attacked in New York City.” And it’s not to say that people haven’t experienced those sorts of attacks. And, you know, as a result of disinformation, going back to the online to offline action, and I don’t wanna make it sound like it’s just the Russian government because there are definitely other actors who are playing in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>But it is I think just providing more opportunities from that perspective. And then, similarly, there’s the financial motivations and the financial perspective. So we’ll see some of these junk domains pushing false information about the pandemic and they’re doing so because they are likely to generate a profit. They have advertising revenue that they’re getting from clicks. So I think it really does depend on who the actor is as to why they’re pushing it, but because it’s so cheap, easy, and potentially lucrative to do as well as it works from a geopolitical perspective. So, and if it’s cheap, why not try it? There’s not really a high cost to people who are executing these sorts of campaigns.</p><p>OL: Not at all. And I would just echo what you said by pointing out that it’s been so interesting that since 2016, you know our own elected leaders see value in exploiting the sort of fissures in society that we have and exploiting them for their own political gain. And as you mentioned, this happens both on the right and on the left. I wanna shift gears and talk about some of the specific mitigations.</p><p>So one of the most significant impediments to legislating on disinformation and engaging on it from a policy or regulatory perspective is that moderation is often criticized as being a brush up against the First Amendment. What is your thinking around how regulation can encourage effective moderation without brushing up against those First Amendment concerns? And then I guess also more broadly, what is your thinking around what the government’s role should be in addressing domestic disinformation?</p><p>LK: Well, I do appreciate and admire a lot of our colleagues in this space who are putting out really important research that can inform eventual legislation. Where I see the opportunity for more immediate action is actually through other means such as our judicial system. And I’ll get to that in a second. When it comes to the First Amendment, that’s an argument that I just don’t really buy. We accept limits to speech in real life. I can’t yell fire in a movie theater — like there will be consequences for me. We’ve accepted that there are some limits on speech in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>And so I think we should be reframing this question to say, how can we make the online conversation more reflective of the conversations that we have offline? I think one of the things that’s become really clear in the pandemic when we’ve all been forced inside and online to a degree is, that that’s not where we’re at right now but there’s no reason why that’s not where we can be. I think what we need to be talking about too, though, is when it comes to content moderation, I don’t think that that necessarily removes the threat altogether. For example, we saw a lot of accounts be deplatformed for breaking the terms of service multiple times. And again, I think that’s a perfectly acceptable consequence. It’s kinda like the “no shirt, no shoes no service” version of social media platforms. It’s like, if you break the rules on multiple occasions you’re not gonna be allowed back in. But where I think we need to be headed and where I think we’re going to see the most progress in the immediate, is enforcing some of the laws that are already on the&nbsp;books.</p><p>So for example the Dominion lawsuit that’s ongoing right now is something that I’m paying attention to. I think that that is a potential avenue. We’ve also seen some successes when it comes to copyright infringements because bad guys aren’t really paying attention to following the laws if they’re spinning up disinformation campaigns. So I think that we can potentially anticipate some actions taken there. I think that the other thing that has been interesting to watch unfold is, the Stop Hate for Profit sort of activism. I think that that is potentially having an impact as well. So all that said, I don’t see this as a speech-only issue. I think that there are very serious concerns especially when we’re thinking about the world outside of the United States and the Western liberal order where sometimes social media is how you evade censorship. And so these are really tough challenges and there are no easy solutions. And I think having these conversations and debates is hugely important because if this were an easy fix, it would be solved by now. But I am confident that this is something that we will begin to see, and we’ve seen progress since 2016 to be fair. But we will continue to see progress. We will continue to see solutions proposed and implemented.</p><p>OL: You had mentioned earlier that you have observed that fact-checking is not necessarily the most effective way to clamp down on some of the bad and false information we see circulating online and certainly not enough to interrupt the cementing of alternate realities that really disinformation is intended to&nbsp;foster.</p><p>LK: Yeah. So I think that fact-checking definitely plays a role but I don’t think it’s something that can be done alone. I think, you know, labeling that sort of thing. These are relatively new features. And so, well, how effective they are — that’s a little bit outside of my purview. And I look forward to reading somebody’s research someday that did a longitudinal study on how effective labels were on any given social media user. But I do think we need to start thinking about this challenge more holistically than we currently are, right? So for example, it’s not just what’s happening on social media platforms, it’s also what’s happening on blogs. It’s how some of these disinformation networks are being financed. It’s through advertising revenue, it’s through, frankly, people who are building influence and then turning around and selling it for profit. Those are all things that I think we can incorporate into part of the solution when we’re trying to figure out, how do we put out the fire that’s happening right&nbsp;now?</p><p>I think when we look towards long-term solutions to figure out, what is it that we can do to really change the equation to make it so that disinformation is not as successful as it is now? There’s all kinds of things we can do but I keep coming back to education. If every single person knew what we knew and likely what everybody who’s listened to these podcasts knew, we’d be in a lot better shape. So how do we make it so that we’re not so special anymore? How do we make it so that the general population is more resilient to disinflation? And a lot of that has to do with education. So when I was in high school we used to do these things where we would basically learn how to read a news article. We would learn how to read a newspaper based on, you know what page was the article on in the newspaper for relative importance. What paper were we reading? Who’s the author? When was the paper published? How do you read the first two paragraphs? How do you read for bias? Why aren’t we teaching that for a digitized world? Because I am still pretty old school and I like physical newspapers, so I get them but I am like the rarest subscriber you will see for my age demographic. Like one of the things we need to consider is how do we modernize our approach to consuming media? And I don’t wanna put it on the social media user to protect themselves from a sophisticated information operation. But again, when you think about it as a holistic solution this can also be a piece of the puzzle that really makes the difference.</p><p>OL: So Lisa, my final closing question for you is, do you have anything that you think about as something that could be maybe a smaller low-intensity effort, but could make a world of difference in terms of moving the needle forward on this&nbsp;problem?</p><p>LK: Yeah, so I think that I always come back to, if every individual just stopped and thought before they hit send, or tweet, or post, or share, or whatever, I think we are all potential threat vectors, for furthering a disinformation or misinformation flow because disinformation and misinformation target us and our biases. And so by not sharing it and spreading it, we’re not making the problem worse. So I think if everybody did that, it would go a long&nbsp;way.</p><p>OL: Thank you so much, Lisa. I really enjoyed our conversation. Thanks for joining&nbsp;me.</p><p>LK: Thanks for having&nbsp;me.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-lisa-kaplan-on-domestic-disinformation-f86bdecf3147">The Breakdown: Lisa Kaplan on domestic disinformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>The past year has seen working Americans struggle amidst a global pandemic and economic crisis, further exacerbating the deep, structural inequities in our society. Over and over again, the rules, ideas, and power that lie at the heart of our economy and democracy have rewarded the few at the expense of the many. In order to build a truly equitable and inclusive society, these trends must be quickly reversed. President Biden signing the American Rescue Plan into law today moves us one step closer to that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Because of critical aid in the American Rescue Plan, child poverty in the United States is expected to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/26/970999998/with-one-move-congress-could-lift-millions-of-children-out-of-poverty">drop by half</a>. More than one million unionized working people who faced the prospect of losing their pensions will now receive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/business/dealbook/bailout-pensions-stimulus.html">full retirement benefits</a> for at least the next 30 years. The government will be sending direct <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/1400-stimulus-checks-who-is-eligible-how-soon-they-could-arrive.html">relief checks</a> to the majority of Americans who earn less than $75,000 a year. Unemployed Americans will receive an extra $300 on top of their current benefits through the end of this summer. State and local governments will finally get <a href="https://statescoop.com/senate-approves-relief-package-with-350b-in-state-and-local-aid/">urgently needed aid</a> so they don’t have to make harmful cuts or enact&nbsp;layoffs.</p><p>This $1.9 trillion investment in families will help set us on a course toward an economy that works for all Americans. While there is still much to be done, Omidyar Network welcomes this momentous piece of legislation and we look forward to collaborating with our partners, grantees and policy makers to continue the path forward to a more equitable and inclusive society.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-network-applauds-enactment-of-the-american-rescue-plan-5d2b395e90d5">Omidyar Network Applauds Enactment of the American Rescue Plan</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Announcing ELP <p>Today we're excited to announce that we are officially opening applications for the Ceramic Mainnet Early Launch Program (ELP). This program allows a limited number of projects to get early access to the Ceramic mainnet before it is opened to the general public later this year.</p><p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply to the Early Launch Program</a> if you want to deploy your <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> and/or <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> project to production in the coming months. </p> FAQs  Who is the program for? <p>ELP is for projects that want to use Ceramic and/or IDX in production ASAP. We created this program so you could get started immediately.</p> When does the program start? <p>Starting today we will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. For those accepted into the program, mainnet access will begin in approximately 4-6 weeks. We will communicate the official mainnet start date via email. Before mainnet is ready, you can start prototyping your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a>.</p> How do I apply? <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply using this form</a>. Our team will promptly evaluate submissions and reach out via email when we are ready to onboard your project. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us evaluate your submission.</p> How will you evaluate applications? <p>We have a set of evaluation criteria but generally we will prioritize projects with the most active users, those who have been most active in our community, those who plan to go live with Ceramic/IDX as soon as possible, those with the most interesting use cases, those that deliver the most aggregate value to the Ceramic ecosystem, and those who can commit to providing us detailed feedback.</p> What happens if I'm on the waitlist? <p>While you're waiting, you can begin prototyping and building your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a> and contributing in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>. We will accept projects from the waitlist on a rolling basis.</p> What are the program details? <p>Projects that have been accepted into the ELP get early access to Ceramic mainnet nodes running on <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/">3Box Labs</a> infrastructure. For the duration of the program, these will be the only nodes connected to mainnet.</p> Is this a "centralized mainnet"? <p>We like to think of ELP as a mainnet with training wheels. All the primary features of mainnet are there such as a Ceramic mainnet pubsub topic and anchoring document updates on the Ethereum mainnet, but by limiting variables such as the number of nodes on the network and the number of overall participants we can make sure everything works well in a controlled production environment before opening the network to the chaos of the general public.</p> How long does the program last? <p>We have not yet set an end date. We will conclude the program and launch the public Ceramic mainnet when we feel the network has been battle tested enough by applications in production during ELP.</p> What happens at the conclusion of the program? <p>After ELP has concluded, Ceramic mainnet will be released to the general public and anyone can run a node and deploy their project in production.</p> When is public mainnet launching? <p>At the conclusion of ELP.</p> Where can I learn more? <p>Join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Sign up today <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Complete the ELP application</a></p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to sponsor the Identity, Unlocked podcast. This week’s episode <a href="https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/public/49/Identity%2C-Unlocked.--bed7fada/ad784008">“eKYC with Mark Haine” features host Vittorio Bertocci and special guest Mark Haine</a>. The episode focuses on the work of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">OpenID Foundation’s eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group</a>. Mark Haine is the Director at considrd.consulting and one of the Co-chairs of the eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group. Among the many dots Mark is connecting on behalf of the OpenID Foundation is work with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, the Open Identity Exchange Trust Framework Initiatives and the Open Banking Implementation Entity.</p>
<p>The working group is named for two processes that are largely the same but represent different industries. eKYC or Electronic Know Your Customer is a process most closely tied to the financial industry, whereas identity assurance is the more generic counterpart present in most other sectors. Identity assurance is the process of establishing the Identity of someone you’re interacting with within a very reliable fashion, and while it was historically often carried out in person, the rapid transition to new technologies and options for remote engagement have created a need to find ways of moving identity assurance online and allowing for it to be done in a standardized fashion.</p>
<p>The working group <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/charter/">charter</a>, in summary, explains the group’s aim to deliver a tech solution that communicates “verified claims” and information about how they were verified. The metadata about the “verified claims” answers questions of how and when claims were established. The working group represents many countries and industries and was launched in the context of the OpenID Foundation because of the natural connections between the foundation and the group’s initiative. Offering further detail on this project, Mark comments on the choice not to mandate but strongly encourage the use of FAPI, the level of adoption of the working group’s spec thus far, and – with regard to deliverables – what specification documents and definitions the group is working with. As the conversation winds to a close, Mark explains the danger of using scope, the benefits of the TXN claim within the working group’s specification, the PKI analogy for the trust framework, and ways listeners can help by fostering awareness of the program and its many less obvious use cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Mark Haine</p>
<p>Mark is an engineer and entrepreneur who has focussed his career on building solutions that enable business and mitigate risk in financial services.</p>
<p>Most recently Mark founded <a href="https://www.considrd.consulting/">considrd.consulting</a> and (with his team) is providing strategic security consultancy to a range of clients. He has also taken on a leadership role in the OpenID Foundation as Co-Chair of the eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group.</p>

<p>10 March 2021 – Today, the <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">Baseline Protocol</a>, part of the Ethereum OASIS Open Project and in partnership with <a href="http://opencollective.com/opensource">Open Source Collective</a>, announced that it has received a grant of $100,000 from the <a href="https://ethereum.foundation">Ethereum Foundation</a> to be used for the purpose of encouraging and accelerating baseline protocol R&amp;D and enablement efforts. This comes on the first anniversary of the community’s formation.</p>



<p><a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/">Launched in March</a> of 2020, the Baseline Protocol uses advances in peer-to-peer messaging, zero-knowledge cryptography, and blockchain technology to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises without moving company data out of traditional systems of record.&nbsp; Today, hundreds of companies and thousands of individuals are actively participating in the initiative, which coordinates with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.&nbsp; For more information go to <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">baseline-protocol.org</a>.</p>



 “2021 is stacking up to be a breakout year for Enterprise blockchain usage with more and more projects landing on the public Mainnet,” said Dan Shaw of the Ethereum Foundation. “Baseline has been a key driver of this, since the protocol enables private collaboration between enterprises without putting any sensitive data on-chain.” 



<p>The Baseline Protocol community conducts steering committee meetings every two weeks. Starting in April 2021, these meetings will include a segment to hear proposals for projects seeking funding from the grant pool. Each month, the Technical Steering Committee will allocate a portion of the total grant to selected projects. Allocations are managed by the <a href="https://opencollective.com/baseline-protocol">Open Source Collective</a>. These projects can include technical work such as contributions to open source code and also can include work to contribute enablement content, documentation and outreach programs. For more information on proposing projects for grants and bounties, go <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/news/grants-ef-funding-2021/">here</a>.</p>



<p>It is hoped that this grant will attract other organizations to contribute additional funding to the effort. Organizations interested in contributing can do so <a href="https://opencollective.com/baseline-protocol#category-CONTRIBUTE">here</a>.</p>

<p>Conviction Voting (CV) is a governance mechanism that allows users to signal their preference on various issues by staking their tokens on proposals. A proposal passes if it has sufficient weight allocated to it. The weight of a proposal is calculated based on the amount of tokens that have been staked and the amount of time these tokens have been staked. The <a href="https://medium.com/commonsstack/announcing-the-conviction-voting-cadcad-model-release-8e907ce67e4e">introduction to conviction voting</a> by Common Stack is a great primer if you want to learn more about how CV works. </p><p>Implementations of CV so far have been developed on the EVM, which makes the results and outcomes completely trustless. While there are some deployments like <a href="https://1hive.org">1Hive</a> and <a href="https://cv.commonsstack.org">Common Stack</a>, high gas costs and the sub-optimal user experience of transferring tokens for every vote make this quite problematic. Fortunately conviction voting systems can be securely implemented using off-chain, verifiable data structures. Building CV systems off-chain, as opposed to on-chain, avoids the high gas costs and poor user experience that plagues current implementations while still achieving verifiability and participant trust.</p><p>This article will explain how you can use <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> as an underlying data structure to build a conviction voting dapp.</p> Intro to Ceramic and IDX <p>Ceramic is a decentralized protocol for verifiable, version-controlled content. Ceramic is used to create mutable data on IPFS with permanent identifiers, called StreamIDs. All updates are signed and then periodically anchored into the blockchain for time-stamping and consensus. You can think of a single Ceramic stream as its own ledger which contains all the information needed to reconstruct the state of the stream in a completely trustless manner. For more details refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md">Ceramic specification</a>.</p><p>IDX is a decentralized identity protocol built on top of Ceramic which makes it easy to associate data to a user, discover data a user has created, and build user-centric applications. You can think of IDX as a decentralized user table. Each user has their own index which is a map from definitions to records. Definitions are globally-defined descriptions of data created by developers. Each user has their own individual record for each definition which stores their content. For more information have a look at the <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/overview/">IDX developer documentation</a>.</p> System overview <p>The proposed conviction voting system is based on an ERC20 token that is periodically snapshotted. This means that the token balances of all users are not updated continuously but instead on a set interval, e.g. twice a day. Additionally, users can easily change their voting preferences at any time.</p><p>There are three main system components:</p>  User-created content including: 1) proposal documents which contain information for a given proposal, and 2) conviction documents where users set their preferences among all live proposals. Both proposal and conviction documents are stored as Ceramic TileDocuments.  A snapshot service that takes snapshots of the balances of all users of a particular ERC20 token, calculates the total conviction weight for all proposals from users' conviction documents, and saves them into a conviction state document  An oracle system that resolves passed proposals on-chain when the conviction state document has sufficient conviction weight for any given proposal   User-created content  Proposal document <p>Any user can create a proposal document when they want to request funds for a project. This document could contain any amount of information, but most important to be included is: <code>context</code> the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-19.md">caip-19 asset id</a> (ERC20 token address) that is used for the conviction voting, <code>beneficiary</code> the receiver of the funds if the proposal passes, <code>amount</code> the amount of funds to send if the proposal passes.</p><p>Example content<br>This example is a proposal to get some funding for a project. Other proposals might include executing a transaction with call data, setting a protocol parameter, or updating some organizational document.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  title: "Develop an off-chain conviction voting system",
  currency: "ETH",
  amount: 200,
  beneficiary: "0xabcdef",
  description: "Fund team X to implement off-chain conviction voting using Ceramic &amp; IDX.",
  url: "https://ceramic.network"
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Proposal document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Convictions document <p>Each participant in the conviction voting system creates their own convictions document when they first interact with the conviction voting dapp. This document contains the convictions the user has assigned to various proposals as a fraction of their entire token holdings. Every time they change their preference the underlying Ceramic document gets updated, signed, and eventually anchored on-chain.</p><p>A conviction voting dapp would create a definition as defined in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">CIP-87</a> and each user would store a convictions document as a record in their IDX.</p><p>Example content<br>In this example we see a single user's convictions document. They have created <code>proposal2</code> and they have allocated different fractions of their token holdings to proposal 1, 2, and 3.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  proposals: ["&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;"],
  convictions: [{
    proposal: "&lt;proposal1-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.2,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.5,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal3-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.3,
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Preference document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Snapshot service <p>The snapshot service performs the task of periodically taking a snapshot of the balances of all token holders of the particular ERC20 being used. Using this information together with individual users' conviction documents, it <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">calculates the total conviction</a> and writes it to a conviction state document. This service is not trusted since anyone could compute the same conviction state by simply grabbing the data from the blockchain. The service executes at a set time interval, for example twice a day.</p> Syncing data &amp; performing calculations <p>Since we are not restricted to calculate the conviction score for all proposals on-chain we can simply use the discrete version of the conviction voting algorithm which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad</a>. On every discrete time interval the snapshot service grabs all token holders and their balances from the blockchain (e.g. using TheGraph). The address of each token holder is used to look up their individual IDX document which should contain their convictions document. The total conviction y_t+1 can now be calculated for each proposal using the formula in Figure 1.</p>Figure 1: How to calculate the total conviction for each proposal j. Source: <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb</a><p>Once total conviction for each proposal is calculated, the snapshot service also calculates the trigger function for each proposal. Finally the service updates the conviction state document with the new state.</p> Conviction state document <p>The conviction state document stores the full state of the conviction voting system. It is created and updated by the snapshot service. It contains two main arrays as well as supply information:</p>  <code>participants</code> - all token holders, their current token balance, and the latest CommitID of their convictions document at the time the snapshot was made  <code>proposals</code> - all active proposals and their total conviction which has been calculated by the snapshot service  <code>supply</code> - the total supply of the ERC20 token that is used for governance  <p>Example content<br>In this example we see that there are two participants who have a token balance and have created their own convictions documents. We also see that there are two active proposals, both of which have not yet been triggered, and have different levels of total conviction.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  supply: 9001,
  participants: [{
    account: "0x12345...",
    balance: 1337,
    convictions: "&lt;convictions1-CommitID&gt;"
  }, {
    account: "0xabcde...",
    balance: 42,
    convictions: "&lt;convictions2-CommitID&gt;"
  }],
  proposals: [{
    proposal: "&lt;proposal1-DocID&gt;",
    totalConviction: 234,
    triggered: false
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;",
    totalConviction: 432,
    triggered: false
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Conviction state document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Oracle system <p>Once we have the conviction state document it's trivial to check the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BlockScience/Aragon_Conviction_Voting/blob/master/models/v3/Trigger_Function_Explanation.ipynb">trigger function</a> for any particular proposal. When a proposal has sufficient weight an oracle service (e.g. Chainlink) can be triggered to submit the data of the passed proposal on-chain. This would send the requested funds to the beneficiary in the proposal. It's also possible to use conviction voting to set smart contract parameters or proposal ranking (not execution). In these cases we would calculate a dynamic average instead of using a trigger function.</p> Executing proposals on-chain <p>In order to execute the transaction on-chain we can use an oracle system to get the relevant state from the conviction state document on-chain if a proposal has been triggered. Ideally this would be a set of oracles that can independently verify the state of this document before it's committed on-chain. However, in many cases it might be sufficient to use a simpler oracle system such as Chainlink to simply fetch the state of the document from the Ceramic gateway. The main data that needs to make it on-chain is <code>beneficiary</code> and <code>amount</code>.</p> Notes on security  Snapshot trust <p>The main point of trust in this system is the snapshot service. While anyone can independently verify that it has performed the proper calculations, this might not always happen. When implementing this CV system in production there likely needs to be some additional checks and balances that enable the snapshot service to be replaced. Alternatively a system may choose to require multiple snapshot service providers that are operated by independent parties.</p> Proposal manipulation <p>The proposal document could be updated to request a larger <code>amount</code> of funds after it has already started getting a large amount of conviction. In order to mitigate this attack, the snapshot service might require users to reconfirm their conviction for the proposal, without losing the time staked, before it is triggered.</p> Convictions reorg attack <p>Since Ceramic TileDocuments currently rely on the "earliest anchor wins" conflict resolution method, a user could perform a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md#data-withholding-attacks">data withholding attack</a> where their conviction would be counted twice. The attack would involve the user first updating their preference document to proposal A and anchoring it, but withholding this data by not submitting it to the Ceramic network. Then they would set their preference doc to proposal B and publicly submit this to the network. Once proposal B has been passed, they would publish their data about proposal A which would invalidate their conviction on proposal B (because A was anchored earlier) and it would look as if they have staked their tokens on proposal A for a long period of time. This entire problem is solved by the fact that the snapshot service sets the CommitID of the user's preference doc in the snapshot document. So if a user cheats like this it would be simple to see that they have double voted and all of their votes would be invalidated from that point in time.</p> Alternative implementations <p>IDX can be used to store any type of user-related data such as verifications for social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Discourse, ...), a BrightID score, or any other similar information. This flexibility makes it possible to easily experiment with quadratic voting where accounts that are less likely to be sybils can influence the vote more.</p><p>Using an oracle to trigger actions on-chain would be ideal, but as a minimum viable product it might be simpler to just use the off-chain voting system as a way to generate signal. A trusted multi-sig can then be used to execute on-chain actions, similar to how <a href="http://snapshot.page">snapshot.page</a> is used.</p> Get involved! <p>This article outlines a basic framework for how off-chain conviction voting systems can be built, but there are still many details that need to be solved.

<p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>This post expands on the first key pillar for building a new economic paradigm as outlined in <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Our Call to Reimagine Capitalism</a>. Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>Five decades ago, our society experienced a seismic shift. Underneath the layers of headlines about the crises of the day — lingering economic stagnation, growing calls for civil rights and racial justice, and the departure of a disgraced president — the values that we used to guide our lives were changing. Old traditions and ideals were being abandoned, and new ones were emerging. <br> <br>One value, in particular, quickly rose to the forefront of our social discourse and crystalized to become our cultural touchstone: individual liberty. <br> <br> Liberty, of course, is a bedrock American value — ranking right in between “life” and “the pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence. Our country was founded on the belief that a society and economy can only truly thrive when individuals are free to pursue their desires and self-interests, both at the ballot box as a citizen of a democratic nation, and in the free market as an enterprising participant of a capitalist system.<br> <br>For two hundred years, a commitment to liberty was one of the integral pieces of the base on which we sought to construct an ever-larger, ever-more-inclusive American society. In the 1970s, however, this base of diverse values and norms failed to shelter us from the crises of the time, and we chose to prioritize liberty as the base value that could keep our social edifice standing. Meanwhile, we abandoned the other values, norms, and institutions supporting our society as unnecessary constraints on liberty, and through willful neglect if not active undermining, allowed these parts of our social foundations to erode and decay.<br> <br>To build on this new, more sparse, foundation of values, we turned to a set of ideas that described markets as the ideal tool for maximizing liberty. Ideal markets, after all, are ones where anyone is free to buy, sell, work, or trade without interference. We therefore accepted as fact a simple, yet compelling theory: that these free markets, by generating wealth and automatically distributing it from businesses to working people, would create the best possible society for everyone. <br> <br>For the past fifty years, these ideas have been the blueprint we used to design and build our society.<br> <br>We have measured the wellbeing of our society by tracking the wellbeing of markets, and lauded ourselves as GDP, corporate profits, job numbers, and the stock market continued to rise. <br> <br>We have sought to remove government from markets and our lives: lowering taxes, deregulating, and increasingly relying on markets to provide services that had once been the responsibility of government. We worked to weaken labor unions, community leaders, even our own elected representatives — anyone who threatened to challenge the wisdom of markets. <br> <br>At the same time, we have empowered business leaders and trade associations, assured that these job creators knew best how to generate profits that would naturally, and without intervention, trickle down to the rest of society. <br> <br>Have trickle-down economics worked? If we view our society through the narrow frame of profits and growth, we could almost believe that the last fifty years have been a success. Look at the stock market! If it’s reaching record heights, then we must all be richer than we’ve ever been before!<br> <br>But, of course, we all know this view to be a delusion. By so many measures, our economy has failed us. Our growing GDP masks our growing inequality, just as rising job numbers ignore how job quality and wages have been falling, forcing more and more people to work multiple jobs while still being barely able to support their families. Meanwhile, growing corporate profits do not mean this wealth is shared with the working people who made those profits possible — let alone invested to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/windfall-profits-and-deadly-risks/">protect people’s health during a pandemic. </a>Finally, an excess focus on free markets has, if anything made the markets themselves weaker — less innovative, less competitive, less resilient — as businesses used their new freedom to earn profits through monopolies and rent seeking rather than producing services of value to society.<br> <br>If these fifty years have been an experiment of an economic theory, it is time to conclude, based on overwhelming evidence, that it has failed. Freer markets did not create a freer society. In fact, by “freeing” business from having to account for the negative consequences of their behavior, we burdened people, communities, and the planet with the growing weight of these costs, and by “freeing” people from familial, community, and public support systems, we forced people to pay the full price of any accident or mistake they might run into. <br> <br>In doing so, we eliminated the choices people could make. How many of us have been unable to search for a better job, move to a new state, or open a new business because we and our families simply cannot afford the risk? Our living costs are rising, and there is nothing left to catch us if we fall.<br> <br>We have spent too long trying to balance the entirety of our vibrant and complex society on top of a narrow and crumbling foundation. It is time for us to widen our frame of thinking and design a society built using a broader set of values that will be resilient to the growing tremors facing the world. <br> <br>We need values like the dignity of having one’s worth measured by one’s contribution to one’s community, and not one’s wage; like the security and stability that comes from knowing that, even if the worst were to happen — unemployment, sickness, injury, natural disaster, or even a pandemic — you would still be able to keep your family in your home, put food on the table, and receive needed care; like the justice of seeing past harm accounted for, and future harm averted; like the sustainability of a society that can prosper in perpetuity.</p><blockquote>Our definition of success must be more than just a subset of economic indicators. True success is achieved when our families are safe and healthy, when our communities are welcoming and full of opportunity, when our use of our planet’s resources are not unsustainably destructive…and, yes, when our businesses, small and large, can thrive and support our society’s wellbeing.</blockquote><p>Omidyar Network supports a number of organizations that are pushing to expand the range of values and ideas used to understand the economy. Our goal is not to advance any one solution, but rather to generate a multitude of proposals for moving us from a society that prioritizes only profits to a reimagined capitalism which prioritizes human flourishing in all its&nbsp;forms.</p><p>Our search for new ideas led us (unsurprisingly) to think tanks. This is why we are supporting a range of organizations that are elevating human centered perspectives on the social role of our economy and proposing innovative solutions to our collective challenges.<br> <br>The <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/">Roosevelt Institute</a>, for example, advocates for structural economic change through progressive policies. Their fellows are key voices in promoting the pursuit of economic security, more dignity, and, ultimately, more human thriving for more people. As its President and CEO Felicia Wong <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RI_EmergingWorldview_report-202001-1.pdf">notes</a>, “The move to values beyond ‘freedom to participate in a capital-focused marketplace’ is the central pillar of post-neoliberal thinking. If the new progressivism is to thrive, making plain the values inherent in our economic choices will be essential.” One of their recent reports, <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/new-rules-for-the-21st-century-corporate-power-public-power-future-american-economy/">New Rules for the 21st Century</a>, discusses the need to strengthen our democracy by thinking differently about the respective social roles of markets and government; last summer, they released a <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RI-TrueNewDealReport_202008.pdf">True New Deal</a> promoting essential reforms for the COVID-19 era. <br> <br>Meanwhile, <a href="https://americancompass.org/about/">American Compass </a>is working to create a coalition of thinkers drawing on conservative values for family, community, industry, and strong social and political institutions to advance economic ideas that ensure markets are serving people and their communities. Launched in May 2020, they have published and hosted discussions with thinkers from across the conservative and broader political spectrum. In September, they released a <a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/conservatives-should-ensure-workers-a-seat-at-the-table/">joint-statement calling for a renewed conservative labor movement</a> that elevates worker voices in economic and market discussions, which was signed by a number of prominent conservative figures, including Senator Marco Rubio and former attorney general Jeff Sessions.<br> <br>Our second focus is in strengthening the coalition of organizations working to disseminate these new economic ideas and incorporate them into strategic and policy discussions. <br> <br>Although the academic field of economics has developed <a href="http://www.oecd.org/governance/beyond-growth-33a25ba3-en.htm">an array of new branches of research</a> — from behavioral to ecological economics — that deepen our appreciation for the complexity of markets and their impact on society, this new thinking is not reflected in the ways that economics is taught in schools and universities, especially at the introductory level. We are therefore supporting the dissemination of <a href="https://www.core-econ.org/">CORE</a>, a new open-source economic curriculum developed with the collaboration of top economists, which incorporates recent advances in economic thinking. This curriculum is being adopted by schools and universities around the world.<br> <br>To help coordinate and align this growing global field of organizations that are developing and implementing new economic ideas, we are also supporting the <a href="https://www.econchange.org/">Economic Change Unit</a>, which both amplifies new ideas and works to strengthen the groups working around the world to transition us to a more equitable, sustainable, and democratic socio-economic paradigm.<br> <br>We have also turned to the media, given its power to shape how we all understand the economic forces impacting our lives, to help disseminate these ideas and reframe how we think about our economy. To that end, we have supported compelling reporting on the structural economic inequities that have been laid bare by the pandemic by journalists and photographers from new outlets such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/21362321/economy-american-policy-coronavirus-covid-recovery-fix-solutions-mobilization-great-rebuild">Vox</a>, and <a href="https://covid19-biggerpicture.trust.org/">Thomson Reuters</a>. <br> <br>Finally, we know that good ideas do not come from experts alone, and that real change is impossible without a broader cultural shift in how we, as a society, understand and discuss the economy.<br> <br>In addition to supporting a range of local and national organizations that are working to formulate and disseminate new ideas at the grassroots level, we are also working to cultivate the next generation of economic leaders and thinkers. Last year, we collaborated with The <a href="https://prospect.org/essaycontest">American Prospect </a>in a high school essay contest inviting students to read and reflect on one of four books highlighting the interlinking economic and racial justice challenges facing our country. We also partnered with <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/sponsored/story/tell-us-your-plan-to-reimagine-capitalism">Teen Vogue </a>to solicit ideas from young people about how they would redefine economic success in our society. Amongst hundreds of submissions, we heard ideas ranging from educating people to move money in support of racial justice to a worker-owned coffee shop on a mission to end wage theft and democratize the workplace.<br> <br>The ground below our feet is shifting, as it did all those decades ago. It is our mission to ensure that we have a solid foundation of values on which to build, and as many design ideas as possible at our disposal. With these, we can embark on the collective task of making American society as resilient and inclusive as possible.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Grounding Our Economy in a New Ideas and Values</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Tell us what you do and what it is about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I have been managing the World Bank’s (WBG) Identification for Development Initiative (ID4D) for the last 5 years alongside a sister initiative – G2Px – which we launched end of 2019.&nbsp; Through ID4D, we are helping countries realize the transformational potential of digital identity in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. G2Px focuses on supporting countries on digitizing payments from government to individuals, but in a more holistic way so that it can pave the way for broader outcomes of financial inclusion and women’s economic empowerment. It’s why we have the tagline of “payments that empower”.</p>
<p>These two WBG-wide initiatives are aimed squarely at helping governments and policy makers to reimagine and build the digital rails that underpin the way they transact with individuals. It also can transform the way people engage with their governments and with each other.&nbsp; A digital stack of ID, together with digital payments and trusted data exchange, has the ability to really empower individuals and change the way services are delivered – faster, more transparently and more conveniently.&nbsp; This past year, under the COVID pandemic, we have seen the need for all of this come to light with countries ramping up service delivery digitally, including social assistance to those most in need.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I joined the World Bank Group 20 years ago. &nbsp;I was passionate about international development and eager to contribute.&nbsp; The same passion sustains and energizes me to this day. When I joined, I didn’t imagine I would stay this long, but it’s hard to leave when the Bank provides the opportunity to work both in support of countries and on global public goods around on key development issues.</p>
<p>My earliest support system was generated at home. Growing up, my mother and father always encouraged my sisters and I and set the expectations to try our best and make a difference in any way we could.&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents came to the US in the mid ‘60s from Sri Lanka. At the time, it wasn’t always the norm for parents to push their daughters academically. &nbsp;But my parents certainly did (much to my annoyance at that same time) and that support helped me tremendously. And of course, now, that support system has expanded to include my husband who shares equally with the kids and at home.</p>
<p>The other thing that has helped me tremendously is my wonderful set of colleagues, team members and mentors – both within the Bank and in our wider group of external partners who have been with us since the beginning of these initiatives.&nbsp; We could not have achieved the multi-sector approach we have taken to digital public platforms without a really strong ecosystem of senior management support and hard-working teams who are passionate about this agenda across the Bank and externally.</p>
<blockquote>
 The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies. 
</blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>One of my favorite quotes is from anthropologist and women’s rights campaigner, Margaret Meade: “”Never doubt&nbsp;that a small group of thoughtful committed individuals can change the world. In fact, it’s the only thing that ever has.”</p>
<p>It’s been a guiding principle for me and I’ve adopted it in the advice I give to all our new team members. &nbsp;“Don’t wait until a system or an individual tells you to do something. Change comes from a group of individuals, not a “system”.</p>
<p>People often think reforms come from “policy” or “a system”. But what I have realized is that behind any policy or any system or organization are people – individuals and groups of human beings just like us!&nbsp;&nbsp; At work, we often will work with senior levels of governments and of course a high-level vision is key. But behind the vision you’ll always find a group of individuals who are shaping that vision and a group of individuals that need to work together to make the vision a reality.</p>
<p>So the advice I give to young professionals joining the Bank or newer team members is to know that you have the capability to be a shaper.&nbsp; An organization like the World Bank may appear to the outside as large and bureaucratic. But you can be quite entrepreneurial. You can shape the agenda – as long as you work hard to bring together different teams and different ideas as part of it. And don’t surprise anyone!</p>
<p>Collaboration is also part of what I do today. I know, for instance, that we couldn’t have agreed the updated Principles for Identification for Sustainable Development we have just published without a strong team of partners and collaborators working together on a shared vision.</p>
<p>It’s summed up in the words of an African proverb, printed on the walls of Gates Foundation HQ. “If you want to go fast, go alone.&nbsp; If you want to go far, go together.”</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>We have been working with governments to shift the identity agenda away from the way it has traditionally been viewed it.&nbsp; Identity is a core element for countries to transform service delivery to people, particularly in the digital age.&nbsp; The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies.</p>
<p>So, to CEOs I would say: “Build greater innovation on top of foundational ID systems, including new applications that will help people transact more seamlessly.&nbsp; There are increasingly ambitious countries all wanting to do digital ID the right way.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the combination of different ways of thinking, different cultures and ethnicities, gender that leads to whole being greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>As a woman in identity, I am proud that about 80% of our team is female!&nbsp; Given the dearth of women in technology and identity space, I feel like we’re making a real contribution towards shaping the next generation of identity and digital development experts.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
Vyjayanti Desai
<p>Amanda Gorman’s poem at the inauguration of Joe Biden, “The Hill We Climb” Not only was it great to have a young woman captivate the entire world but it was hopeful and unifying, while also surfacing some of the very real issues that we face today.&nbsp; And her delivery of it was so inspiring.</p>
<p>I also have grown to really enjoy podcasts this past year. It was one of the things that kept me sane while taking my daily walks during the pandemic. Two podcasts: “It Was Said” and “Hope through History” by Jon Meacham are among my favorites.&nbsp; Each episode centers around a powerful, impactful public speech including Franklin D Roosevelt during the Great Depression, Hillary Clinton’s speech on ‘Women’s Rights are Human Rights’, Robert F Kennedy’s eulogy for Martin Luther King and Ronald Reagan’s farewell address.&nbsp; &nbsp;I’d love to see him expand this podcast and bring in speeches from across the globe.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>I have teenage twin boys, so I get plenty of practice giving unsolicited advice to teenagers!  But the advice I would give to the teenage me is: “Live in the moment; cherish everyone and everything around you because you never know when it may change.” My mother passed away from cancer when I was in high school and that definitely made me change my perspective. I try to ground myself by not worrying about the little things and try to live with a perspective of a glass half full.</p>
<p>And .. “be that change maker!”</p>

 Indian Farmers’ Protest, Blocking Orders to Twitter, and the Fragile Balancing of Free Speech Amid Abysmal Regulation  Outlining limitations of blocking&nbsp;orders <p>February 2021 has borne witness to a standoff between Twitter India and the Modi Government. In the backdrop of a six-month-long <a href="mailto:https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/indian-farmers-protest-in-delhi-determined-to-stop-modi-s-new-laws">farmers’ protest</a> which has garnered both national and international support, the Indian Government issued blocking orders for Twitter to <a href="mailto:https://thenewsmen.co.in/india/india-directs-twitter-to-block-1178-accounts-in-fresh-notice/33050">remove over 250 accounts</a> linked to the farmer’s protest that were considered a threat to public order. At first, Twitter complied with the order, but within a few hours unblocked the accounts. This led to the government issuing a non-compliance order to Twitter which threatened to impose fines and imprison Twitter executives for up to seven years. As a result, Twitter complied with the order and blocked a majority of the accounts. However, in a <a href="mailto:https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html">statement</a> that followed, they clarified that they would not take action on 250 of the accounts, those that belonged to media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians, since removing those would violate their owners’ right to freedom of speech. Further, they stated that they would continue to explore options under Indian law for the accounts that had been affected by the Government’s blocking&nbsp;order.</p><p>The resulting hornet’s nest stems from a combination of the Modi government’s strong-armed will to curb dissent and the inability of current Indian laws to provide a fair balance between restrictions on illegal speech and procedural safeguards to protect freedom of speech. This article will shed light on the flaws with the current procedure laid down for issuing blocking orders, which the Government frequently and arbitrarily uses to seek the removal of content that is entirely legal under Indian law but simply critical of government actions. Some examples of such behavior include the recent blocking of over <a href="mailto:https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/aliexpress-to-tiktok-to-pubg-mobile-full-list-of-all-chinese-apps-banned-in-india-so-far-7064134/">100 Chinese mobile applications</a> and discussing the <a href="mailto:https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/government-may-block-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-in-specific-situations/1271470/">possibilities of blocking Facebook, Whatsapp, and Instagram</a> citing reasons of public&nbsp;order.</p><p>Government blocking orders in India are primarily regulated by Section 69A of the <a href="mailto:https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1999/3/A2000-21.pdf">Information Technology Act, 2020</a> (“IT Act”) and the procedure for blocking is laid out in the <a href="mailto:https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28%20Procedure%20and%20safeguards%20for%20blocking%20for%20access%20of%20information%20by%20public%29%20Rules,%202009.pdf">Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009</a> (“Blocking Rules”).</p><p>Section 69A of the IT Act provides that the Central Government may block public access of any online information if it is believed to be necessary in the interest of the state, public order, or for preventing incitement to commit a crime. Most of the controversial or speech-restrictive requests for removal are initiated by the Government under this section because of the opacity and flexibility of the accompanying Blocking Rules, which provide the procedure that must be followed for the issuance of such&nbsp;orders.</p><p>The Blocking Rules essentially set up an examining committee with a designated bureaucratic officer acting as its chairperson to consider the legality of blocking requests. There are three main shortcomings of the Blocking Rules, first lack of transparency, second, fundamentally inadequate provisions for allowing a response from recipients, and third, casting a wide net over what qualifies as an ‘emergency’ blocking&nbsp;order.</p><p>The first of these concerns the lack of transparency: the blocking rules mandate strict confidentiality of any requests made for removal of content and the subsequent action which is taken by the intermediary. This not only means that blocking orders are not subject to the public’s right to information but also creates a serious obstacle for an aggrieved party who would want to appeal the decision. Hence, mandating secrecy within the rules renders judicial redressal futile. For instance, Tanul Thakur, the creator of a satirical website, was <a href="mailto:https://www.theleaflet.in/content-takedown-and-users-rights/">not given access to the blocking request</a> even after publicly claiming ownership of the&nbsp;website.</p><p>Next, it is difficult or impossible to successfully challenge an order once issued. The Blocking Rules provide that once the examining committee receives a blocking request, an opportunity may be given to the intermediary or content creator to appear and submit their “reply and clarifications”. However, in reality, this right to reply is hardly ever exercised. No record can be found of this having happened in the past. This may be for two reasons: first, because the designated officer in most cases does not issue a notice seeking an appearance and reply from the relevant party in the first place, and second, because intermediaries cannot be expected to be in a position to defend each of the millions of takedown notices that they receive. Hence, in the off-chance that the examining committee seeks a response from the intermediary, asking intermediaries to appear in front of designated officers to justify the content uploaded by one of its millions of content creators remains a futile exercise. It is even more so if such response is sought from the content creator because they would not have access to the blocking request in the first place, due to mandated&nbsp;secrecy.</p><p>This general lack of awareness of a right to respond to order is evident in the present case of the tweets supporting the farmers’ protest, where the designated officer told Twitter that there existed “no statutory requirement to provide or demonstrate justifications to the intermediary while passing orders under Section 69A”. Further, he stated that it was “astonishing” for Twitter to be commenting on “significant issues of freedom of speech”. This evidences an obvious departure from the due process — a process which, if followed appropriately, could have potentially led to several pieces of important information remaining online.</p><p>Finally, the language in the Blocking Rules providing for the issuance of emergency blocking orders is extremely broad, and confers almost unlimited discretion to the issuer, defining emergency orders only as an order that can be passed when “no delay is acceptable”. By contrast for regular blocking orders, it is required that the examining committee issue directions as a unit and then have the direction approved by the Secretary of the Government’s Department of Information Technology before notifying the intermediary. However, in cases of emergency blocking orders, the Department Secretary can decide on her own accord and retrospectively bring the request to the examining committee. The two disconcerting aspects here are first, lack of any clear definition of what comprises an emergency, and second, the liberty of the government to act as a check on itself without balancing this with sufficient transparency for an aggrieved person to seek judicial&nbsp;relief.</p><p>These shortcomings may very well be the reason that <a href="mailto:https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/ttr-17.html">India ranks in the top five countries</a> that made the most removal requests to Twitter in the first half of 2020. The Blocking Rules’ lack of procedural safeguards protecting freedom of speech makes it extremely easy for the Government to issue take-down orders, and very difficult to challenge those&nbsp;orders.</p><p>The constitutionality of Section 69A and the corresponding Blocking Rules was challenged in the Supreme Court of India in the landmark <a href="mailto:https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/">Shreya Singhal ruling</a> of 2015. This ruling is famous for invalidating Section 66A of the IT Act which prohibited the dissemination of information causing ‘annoyance’, ‘inconvenience’, or ‘insult’. However, the same ruling reaffirmed the constitutionality of Section 69A and the Blocking Rules on grounds that any violations could be reversed once individuals moved to Court. It seems clear it is time for this position to be reassessed, given the impossibility of judicial review due to the confidentiality provision.</p><p>Withholding information from the public, not providing sufficient opportunity for the aggrieved party to respond, and creating a vaguely defined situation of what comprises an emergency has allowed for a wide net to be cast for the situations in which such orders can be issued. This fear of over-regulation has exacerbated over the past few years and is evident in the severe crackdown on free speech by the Indian Government. For instance, over the past years, the Indian Government has issued several blocking orders for Twitter to remove legitimate content highlighting the <a href="mailto:https://thelogicalindian.com/news/twitter-blocked-kashmir/">human rights violations in Kashmir</a> and the <a href="mailto:https://lumendatabase.org/notices/22220327">Khalistani movement in north-west India</a>.</p><p>There is an urgent need to reform the Blocking Rules and place adequate procedural safeguards within the mechanism of issuing blocking orders. <a href="mailto:https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights</a>, an international human rights instrument to which India has ratified, lays down a three-part test of legality, legitimacy, and necessity that a law restricting freedom of speech has to be in line with. This test has been applied on several occasions by the Supreme Court of India, including in the Shreya Singhal ruling discussed above. The constructive way forward is through dialogue between lawmakers and civil society to ensure that the Blocking Rules are revised to comply with these tests and to ensure that the legal mechanism for the Government issuing blocking orders is transparent, contains adequate procedural safeguards, and provides for effective judicial oversight through transparency.</p><p>Finally, until these loopholes in the existing laws are fixed and adequate judicial and procedural safeguards are put in place, it is incumbent upon the Indian Government to ensure that such laws are used sparingly and not merely as armor to regulate content that is critical of its practices.</p><p>— About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

 How the EWT Escrow Model Unlocks the Full Potential of the Energy Web Tech&nbsp;Stack <p>As our <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">CEO Walter recently explained</a>, service-level agreements (SLAs) are important tools when it comes to widespread commercial adoption of new technologies, especially digital technologies like software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud computing. They give enterprise customers confidence by providing guaranteed performance and availability of service at a fixed cost, and they give vendors clear delivery requirements and stable&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>We intend for <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/">EW-DOS</a> to become a de facto standard for digital identity and infrastructure in the energy sector. For this vision to become reality, we need to figure out how to deliver the guarantees of traditional SLAs and the convenience of “-as-a-service” subscriptions—in the context of a public network operated by many different organizations from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Over the past year we’ve spent hundreds of hours researching technologies, brainstorming commercial and operational models, and speaking with members of our community to identify a solution. The result is an EWT escrow and subscription model for services in the Utility Layer of the EW-DOS stack that combines well-established elements from financial markets and enterprise IT procurement practices with features common in emerging decentralized finance and escrow applications.</p><p>In addition to promoting the physical, commercial, and political decentralization of EW-DOS, this model will catalyze the transition from pilots and proof-of-concept applications to mainstream adoption and commercial implementations. It’s also a triple-win scenario for the three primary stakeholders in the Energy Web community:</p>  Users of EW-DOS—especially enterprise customers like grid operators, OEMs, and energy companies—will gain easy access to performant, reliable services that help them realize the benefits of running applications on&nbsp;EW-DOS.  Operators of EW-DOS, including EWC validators and technology vendors, can build stable, profitable business models around hosting infrastructure nodes in a public&nbsp;network.  The EWT community gains a new way to use their EWT to contribute in the development and operation of EW-DOS infrastructure, which ultimately will accelerate digital transformation across the global energy sector and help to decarbonize the grid&nbsp;faster.  <p>This article describes the key roles, processes, and value propositions of the escrow model at a high level. While the main components are already being developed into a working prototype, some of the fine details have yet to be finalized. Our intent with this article is to elicit feedback and questions from the community, so don’t hesitate to respond in the comments&nbsp;below.</p>How it&nbsp;startedHow it’s&nbsp;going How EWT Escrow&nbsp;Works <p>Just like in proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus models (and in traditional escrow models in financial and energy markets), the purpose of EWT escrow is to incentivize/reward honest behavior and discourage/penalize bad actors. However, instead of being used to achieve consensus in a blockchain, EWT escrow is used to achieve performance guarantees for digital services like key management, data storage, and high-volume messaging in the Utility Layer of the EW-DOS stack. These services are necessary to support all types of applications running on EW-DOS, from <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/catalonian-grid-operator-electra-caldense-energy-web-and-bamboo-energy-announce-grid-flexibility-51c75e5bcc25">distributed flexibility markets</a>, to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">identity registries for energy assets</a>, to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/r3-joins-energy-web-to-provide-enterprise-grade-settlement-services-for-the-energy-sector-d4a6a834da44">enterprise-grade settlement</a>, and even <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">decarbonizing blockchains themselves</a>.</p><p>The EWT escrow model has two primary roles, which anyone in the global community can&nbsp;become:</p>  Service Providers (“Providers”) are organizations that operate Utility Layer service nodes. In order to become a qualified Provider, an organization must pass a basic KYC check and deposit a minimum balance of EWT into an escrow smart contract for a multi-year period. Once qualified, Providers can launch service nodes by depositing an incremental amount of EWT in escrow and passing a performance test for each node. To meet the minimum escrow balance requirement, providers can either acquire the necessary EWT themselves or accept EWT from external Patrons in the wider community. As long as Providers deliver services in accordance with the prescribed rules, they will earn a stable income on their deposited EWT.  Patrons are individuals or organizations that deposit EWT in escrow on behalf of Providers (similar to the relationship between <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-validator">validators</a> and <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-nominator">nominators</a> in Polkadot). Unlike Providers, there are no minimum balance thresholds or lockup periods for Patrons; anyone who holds any amount of EWT can participate. Patrons have the flexibility to withdraw or transfer their EWT from the escrow account(s) of Providers at any time, creating competition among Providers to deliver the most-reliable services (and thus earn the highest and most-stable income) and to offer the most competitive revenue-sharing models (to attract the most Patrons).  <p>There is no limit to the number of Service Providers. In fact, to meet the enterprise performance requirements for applications running on EW-DOS, we anticipate the need for hundreds of Providers operating thousands of nodes globally to ensure sufficient geographic coverage and network reliability for millions of applications and end-users.</p><p>At this time, the expected minimum escrow threshold for becoming a qualified Provider will be in the range of 10,000–100,000 EWT with an additional 1,000–10,000 EWT per service node. The incremental escrow requirement for individual nodes means each node will be judged (in terms of payments and penalties) on its own performance, and it also helps prevent monopolization. The final decision on the threshold requirements will be made based on feedback from the EW-DOS community, and must balance the need to ensure reliability and guarantee trust for enterprise users without creating insurmountable barriers to entry for potential Providers.</p><p>In addition to incentivizing good performance, Provider escrow accounts are used to make the Utility Layer carbon neutral from day one. Each month, the escrow accounts will be drawn down to purchase renewables via <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web&nbsp;Zero</a>.</p><p>Providers will be required to commit to delivering services for ~two or more years from the time of their initial enrollment (two years is a standard contract length for most enterprise IT services). During this period, deposited EWT will remain locked and if the Provider fully ceases delivering services they will forfeit their escrow balance. Providers who commit to a longer service delivery period will earn more each year than those who commit to the minimum duration. This multi-year commitment ensures that Providers are fully dedicated to delivering reliable services, and gives enterprise customers assurances about service availability and quality over a longer time horizon. After the initial commitment period, Providers may exit the Utility Layer service pool and withdraw their EWT from escrow by providing six months advance notice (which allows other Providers to backfill capacity as&nbsp;needed).</p><p>As long as Providers operate reliable service nodes that meet the performance standards (e.g., uptime, throughput capacity, latency) for each Utility Layer service, they will earn stable income through a combination of subscription payments and rewards from the Community Fund. Annual income for a Provider will be in the range of 10–20% of their EWT escrow account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Initially, Providers’ income will be subsidized by the Community Fund&nbsp;, but over time as adoption (and subscription volume) increases, this subsidy will diminish. We expect that within 3–5 years, the Utility Layer will be driven by a sustainable commercial model where the vast majority of Provider earnings will be derived from subscription payments.</p><p>Patrons should expect to earn similar, if not identical, income as Providers (i.e., at least 10–20% of deposited EWT annually), though exact revenue-sharing arrangements will be determined by each Provider individually. To reiterate, there are no minimum escrow thresholds or commitment periods for Patrons. It is up to each Provider to define their own terms for Patrons, and natural competition encourages Providers to invest in appropriate infrastructure to ensure high-quality services, and to offer favorable terms to attract Patrons and maximize their own earning potential. When evaluating Providers, Patrons should consider not just revenue-sharing terms, but also reputation (e.g., overall historical performance) and individual node&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>In the event that a node fails to deliver services in accordance with the performance standards, the offending node and its Provider each lose a portion of their EWT deposit (similar to slashing in other crypto staking models). Accordingly, Providers are strongly incentivized to invest in appropriate resources and backup systems to ensure that nodes do not experience unplanned outages (especially if they have accepted EWT from external Patrons). If they fall below the minimum threshold, they must replenish their balance to remain eligible to host their node(s). Importantly, Utility Layer services are designed so that the failure of any given node does not materially impact the overall service. Much like electric grids, the Utility Layer is built to withstand the unexpected loss of individual components.</p> What to expect moving&nbsp;forward <p>Our goal is to launch the first Utility Layer services, complete with escrow and subscriptions, in production by Q3&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Here’s what to expect between now and&nbsp;then:</p>  In the next two weeks, we will publish more information outlining the service subscription model and explaining how EW Switchboard is used to manage both escrow and subscriptions.  In April 2021, we will release a series of video demonstrations, technical documentation, and a clickable prototype for the escrow and subscription models.  In May 2021, we will conduct an alpha release of escrow and subscription tools on our testnet&nbsp;Volta.  In June 2021, we will conduct a beta release of escrow and service components on the Energy Web Chain (EWC), with an initial cohort of Service Providers from the EWC validator community.  Throughout the remainder of the year, we will focus on scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.  <p>We’ll also be publishing a steady stream of articles, tutorials, and demos in the coming months to further explain the operational and commercial details of the escrow model.

 Thriving or Surviving? A Conversation on the Black Informal Economy with Equity and Transformation <p>By Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Richard Wallace- Founder and Director of Equity and Transformation<p>For years, politicians have talked about the need to create economic opportunities that support and expand the middle class in America. On one extreme, the political dynamics and systems of power place the greatest attention on the well-heeled and the well off. However, at the other extreme are those everyday people struggling simply to survive day-to-day within the same system. In this economic system, individuals and families are either thriving or just surviving.</p><p>Richard Wallace, founder of Equity and Transformation [EAT] in Chicago, is an advocate for those working in the Black informal economy — people who are excluded from mainstream sanctioned opportunities to earn a livable wage, and instead, use creativity and community networks to make enough money to piece together a&nbsp;living.</p><p>As we continue our <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">blog series focused on racial justice</a>, we’re speaking with leaders in the field to highlight their perspectives and life journeys that led to their work. EAT [an Omidyar Network grantee] calls out the hypocrisy of our economic system by asking some direct questions: Who has economic privilege in our society, even at more disadvantaged levels, and why? How and why does the state determine which forms of work are sanctioned while others are illegal? In January, EAT issued the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a> which examines each of these dynamics and more as part of the organization’s mission to support those in the informal&nbsp;economy.</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-team/nicole-allred/">Nicole Allred</a> conducted this interview with Richard Wallace. A transcript of our conversation is below, edited for length and&nbsp;clarity.</p> Nicole Allred: Richard I want to go back to the beginning to hear about your childhood, your mother’s transition into the ministry, and how that shaped your worldview from the&nbsp;start. <p>Richard Wallace: It was an interesting journey. I grew up in a single-parent household raised by my mother, who often worked two jobs most of her life. I remember when she came home one day and said she was quitting her job for the ministry. We were already poor, but in my mind, it was about to get worse! So, she left her job and began her work in the ministry starting in the church. She wanted to preach, but the male dominated system wouldn’t allow her, so she found solace preaching where no one else was, and that was behind prison walls. This is really where I get introduced to the practice of being accountable to the people you want to help and, in the inverse, who are helping you, and this is how I approach the work&nbsp;today.</p> NA: And you were about six or seven when your mom started the ministry, right? <p>RW: Yeah, she would take me behind the prison walls without a pause. I would go through the searches and be back there with most of the folks we consider “heavies.” They would tell me stories about what they would do in the ’90s in Chicago if they were&nbsp;free.</p><blockquote>“These were genuinely great humans behind bars, and I knew that when I left, they couldn’t&nbsp;leave.”</blockquote> NA: So, what happened next, and talk a bit about your own experience with the system and incarceration. <p>RW: My mom and my family planted seeds, but no matter how deep the seeds are planted, there are still things you have to go through and experience as a young&nbsp;person.</p><blockquote>“My mom moved us into a townhouse in the suburbs, and I was like an ink drop in a glass of&nbsp;milk.”</blockquote><p>I was the only Black person on my block. It was exciting to have a townhouse, but we were poor. Middle class integration has always been the goal for Black families, but the truth is there was a contradiction that exists there. Things that other kids did in our community I would get arrested for. So, what was really a maladjusted reaction to that lifestyle turned into a two and a half year bid at the [Illinois Youth Center] state&nbsp;prison.</p><p>So, I was going to visit these places when I was six and seven years old, and now I’m in this place in my teens. It was a rude awakening for me. It became one of the core experiences that transformed my life. My service to the people began there. Incarceration was horrible, but the lived experience after incarceration was much&nbsp;worse.</p> NA: How was your current work with Equity and Transformation and its mission born out of your experience being incarcerated? <p>RW: There are thousands of collateral consequences to being incarcerated when you come home. Your citizenship has thousands of doors that are no longer open to you. You don’t have access to employment nor college because of your background. What that meant for me is that I had to hustle to&nbsp;survive.</p><blockquote>“Unemployed people are barred from the system on which they depend for subsistence. If you don’t stay in the system, then they dare you to find a means of subsistence for yourself.”</blockquote><p>In my work organizing the temp labor sector around issues of discrimination and exploitation, many of the immigrant workers faced higher rates of exploitation because of their undocumented status. Employers were able to extract higher value labor out of immigrant workers than Black workers. Meanwhile, Black workers would sit for hours before being chosen to go to the jobsite because the immigrant workers were always chosen first. So, there was a lot of tension between Black and Latino workers because of this notion of “privilege.” That said, immigrant exploitive wages of $4-$5 per hour would never have been accepted by Black workers, and that is why these groups need to be in solidarity.</p><blockquote>“Our folks are literally out here working and dying to survive.“</blockquote><p>They are standing in a temp line and often being passed over. Ironically, I can work for a Fortune 500 company in prison making 89 cents a day, but I come home, and I can’t work for that same Fortune 500 company. It’s the same in the temp labor sector. I can’t work for this institution for full pay and a union, but they can garnish my wages and charge me for transportation to and from&nbsp;work.</p> NA: EAT is the only organization working to support the Black informal economy and recently published the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a>. You reveal that policymakers are light years behind in the development of alternatives to formal employment. What do you mean by that? What are people doing to&nbsp;survive? <p>RW: When we started EAT, I definitely thought there was a range of things we could do including building informal workers associations built out by trade. The reality is our people are doing a multitude of activities. They’re hair braiding, scrap metal trade people, and street vending, which is a wide range of activities from selling DVDs to clothes. They’re ride sharing. There’s just a host of activities our people are engaged&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>“One of the patterns we discovered is that occupations that exist in the informal sector aren’t fixed. They don’t stay there for perpetuity. They migrate from informal to formal, and in that process of migration there is a lack of retention of Black&nbsp;bodies.”</blockquote><p>Let me break that down. Bootlegging alcohol had a high rate of Black activity. People could enter it and leave it at their leisure. Then it is legalized, and it becomes hard to find a Black alcohol manufacturer. People point to celebrities like 50 Cent and P-Diddy, but they own the label. They put the label on the bottle. We’re talking about manufacturing the actual&nbsp;product.</p><p>When you think about ride sharing, you get Uber, but you don’t think about the people who are already doing ride sharing in our communities. It supported people who didn’t have the money to take a cab or to own their own care. So, it was really about shared resources. Then it becomes formalized and makes billions for the owner but very little for the drivers using their own cars. Once again, the pioneers are left out of ownership.</p><p>So, I believe there are innovations galore. This is a pattern when I say our folks are innovative.</p><blockquote>“When you really begin to see informality, you get some of the strongest expressions of Black culture.”</blockquote> NA: There is also a certain level of organization, planning, hustle, and work that goes into these informal activities. The report reveals what goes into someone selling loose cigarettes, for example. You have to be at a certain place at a certain time or you’re going to miss your main morning rush. Come rain or shine you still need to be there. Even buying those cigarettes at the cost that you need so that you can then sell them at the right markup. There is so much that the report broke down that I hadn’t even considered. We then start thinking about COVID and how these activities require people to be close by. How have these activities been impacted by&nbsp;COVID? <p>RW: In mid-March it dawned on us that COVID was here to stay. We immediately took a look at the CARES Act, and there are two provisions that boxed out informal workers from receiving any aid — the child support clause and paying taxes. If they hadn’t paid taxes in the past five years, they were ineligible, and if they owed child support, they were ineligible. So, nine out of 10 Black folks who were informal workers were ineligible when in fact these were the people who needed the resources the&nbsp;most.</p><blockquote>“There is a consistent bifurcation of resources so that these people are said to be deserving and other people are not. What does it mean to self-quarantine when you are homeless? What does it mean to tell someone to self-quarantine in a home that may be more violent than the streets&nbsp;are?”</blockquote><p>We developed COVID 19 life kits to educate people about COVID because we were battling the ghost of Tuskegee and also the digital divide. A lot of our folks don’t have IDs nor smart phones. So, while the average person is watching the news, where are homeless people getting the information that is alarming the rest of the world? So, we developed the kit to myth bust and also provide mutual&nbsp;aid.</p> NA: Thinking about philanthropy and systems of power, what role do you think philanthropy should&nbsp;play? <p>RW: We need philanthropy to get behind us and invest in our experimentations of alternatives. It’s one thing to dismantle the system but invest in us to rebuild. Rebuilding requires experimentation.

<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit international standardization organization of individuals and companies committed to enabling, promoting, and protecting OpenID technologies. Formed in June 2007, the Foundation serves as a public trust organization representing the open community of developers, vendors, and users. The Foundation assists the community by providing needed infrastructure and help in promoting and supporting expanded adoption of OpenID.</p>
<p>The strength and viability of the OpenID Foundation is predicated on its ability to earn the active support of both individual members and innovative global organizations. Every member in the Foundation is valued for what they contribute to the larger whole and this is why it is so important that the Foundation strives to maintain long time members while attracting new membership.</p>
<p>As the Foundation continues to grow globally, it requires an increasing investment to support the day-to-day operations while enabling the expansion of the Foundation to include the certification program, driving new outreach opportunities – such as Open Banking initiatives worldwide, and supporting new working groups. The OpenID Foundation has not increased membership dues in over 10 years; the board of directors recently revisited the topic of membership dues and unanimously approved increases to membership fees effective July 1, 2021:</p>



Individual Level
$50


Non-Profit Organization Level
$250


Organization with 1-25 Employees Level
$1,000


Organization with 26-100 Employees Level
$5,000


Organization with More than 100 Employees Level
$20,000


Sustaining Organization Level
$50,000



<p>The Foundation recognizes that individuals and organizations have to make difficult decisions when it comes to both financial and time commitments to organizations like the OpenID Foundation. The Foundation cannot exist without the ongoing support of both long-standing and new members alike so the board of directors would like to thank all members and those considering membership for their support of the increases in membership dues.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/04/openid-foundation-announces-increases-to-membership-dues-in-2021/">OpenID Foundation Announces Increases to Membership Dues in 2021</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

 <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree Spec V1.0.0</a> 
<p>Working Group approved status</p>
 
 Sidetree is a protocol for creating scalable decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) networks that can run on top of any existing decentralized anchoring system (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, HL Fabric, QLDB) and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The protocol allows users to create globally unique, user-controlled identifiers and manage their associated metadata, all without the need for centralized authorities or trusted third parties.

 Migration to GHOST 
 
 DIF staff decided to migrate its blog, newsletter, and other content-hosting capabilities to the open-source GHOST self-publishing <a href="https://ghost.org">platform</a>. Over the coming weeks we'll be migrating our archive over from Medium and mailchimp, in the spirit of making our content more standards-conformant and portable. One bonus is that ghost uses markdown natively, bringing github and this newsletter into closer alignment!

  🎈 Community updates 
<p>DCMS Trust Framework - UK Govt.<br>
The UK government has published its draft rules of the road for governing the future use of digital identities.  The new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">trust framework</a> lays out the draft rules of the road organisations should follow. It includes the principles, policies, procedures and standards governing the use of digital identity to allow for the sharing of information to check people’s identities or personal details, such as a user’s address or age, in a trusted and consistent way. This will enable interoperability and increase public confidence.  The framework, once finalised, is expected to be brought into law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport">DCMS</a> are seeking feedback on the trust framework until 11 March, through a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">survey</a> that is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>The community effort to bridge DID methods with a new data model</p> <p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism. Standards are starting to connect and move towards functional interoperability, regulated by testable protocols. Most of this work is happening on the level of VCs. However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”<br>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>, 2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”<br><br>Dr. Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_%28PKI%29_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root%28s%29_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_%28C%29_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>. He has also worked with Consensys, contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">Seed Quest</a> project among others, soon to be donated to DIF.</p><p>Berlin-based <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom GmbH</a> has been a major interlocutor in the early development of KERI, since before the creation of the working group at DIF. Jolocom’s Charles Cunningham is the working group’s lead Rust developer, who has written a highly interesting post about mental models of <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">How KERI tackles the problem of trust</a> from a developer’s point of view for the Jolocom logbook.</p><p>Representing <a href="https://www.spherity.com">Spherity GmbH are the working group’s lead </a>JavaScript developer and note-taker. Spherity’s founder, Carsten Stöcker, has written a detailed piece for his company’s blog which called KERI “<a href="https://medium.com/spherity/introducing-keri-8f50ed1d8ed7">a more performant ledger for trusted identities</a>.”</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, has been co-developing on the Rust side as well, working in parallel and providing input on the design considerations. The Human Colossus Foundation has also put substantial energy into promoting and socializing KERI in the Trust-over-IP Foundation, the MyData community and in the Sovrin community, including featuring an hour-long KERI <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">session</a> prominently in a half-day <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">mini-conference</a> it organized.</p><p>At IIW31, the KERI developers will be demonstrating their initial work to date while there is still the opportunity to get involved and determine the course of KERI as the project moves from direct mode (two-party) to witness mode (multi-party, distributed consensus). Many sessions are planned for IIW, ranging from introductions to technical discussions to use-case and requirements gathering for KERI-based ideas. Additionally there will be a live demo of the working direct-mode prototype.</p><p>Introductory reading and video materials are collected at the main DIF <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">repository</a>, but even if you don’t watch them in advance (or fully understand them if you do), there are many ways to get involved and make this community project stronger and more diverse.

<p></p>      Now with more focus on growing solutions to deliver privacy, security and trust, CULedger announces company name change. 
<p>Denver, CO (March 3, 2021) – CULedger, an industry leader in privacy- and security-enhanced solutions announces today the changing of its name to Bonifii. This rebranding strategy reflects both the evolution of the company and its vision for future solutions.</p>
<p>CULedger started in 2017 as a research to action project from CUNA’s National Credit Union Roundtable focused on the development of a proprietary blockchain/distributed ledger network and a product exclusively used for call center identification purposes. As the technology evolved, so did the services the company offers. One of the strongest established use cases for blockchain or distributed ledger technology is a decentralized identity that supports the use of best-in-class privacy and security technologies.</p>
<p>Its flagship product, MemberPass(R), is an example of the exchange of verifiable credentials leveraging a combination of distributed ledger, biometrics, and cryptography to protect credit unions’ consumers and small business members. MemberPass is a digital passport that allows members convenient access to their financial accounts while allowing control and privacy of their personal information. MemberPass, powered by Bonifii, will change the way consumers engage and interact with products, services, and information in a digital financial world, and soon in other industries like health care, travel, and government.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Bonifii announced the acquisition of CUFX (Credit Union Financial Exchange) from CUNA’s Technology Council. Under Bonifii, CUFX will be positioned as the exchange of data supported by a systems integration standard and will allow credit unions to increase the speed to become more digital.</p>
<p>“The brand, Bonifii, is a play on the word “bona fide,” which means genuine or authentic and is reflective of our flagship MemberPass product. The “ii” at the end of Bonifii is a symbolic reference to our mission which is to deliver a trusted and verifiable peer-to-peer exchange network,” explains Julie Esser, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bonifii.</p>
<p>Consumers trust their financial relationships. Now financial institutions can invest in and deploy trust-first technologies to give consumers confidence and peace of mind while reducing fraud and improving the member relationships.

 2021: A New Year of Hope.. Implementing the Lessons Learned from 2020, the Good and the&nbsp;Bad <p>By Beth Kanter, Strategic Communications and Jessica Kiessel, Learning &amp; Impact, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>2020: The Year of Zoom (and the fatigue is&nbsp;real)<p>We began last year eager to put our freshly minted brand, approach, and teams into action to build more inclusive and equitable societies. AND THEN, <a href="https://youtu.be/gOxh_COf2VY">2020 HAPPENED</a>. In the midst of the twin public health and economic crises, we witnessed a racial justice reckoning and watched as our US democracy came under attack. We found ourselves — like so many others — balancing multiple urgent priorities.</p><blockquote>We focused on supporting staff and grantees through these difficult times, pivoting our work where necessary to meet the moment, and realigning our teams to capture new opportunities.</blockquote><p>Thankfully, even before the pandemic rocked 2020, we had shifted our accountability processes to recognize that contributing toward healthier, more resilient systems is long-term, complex work. Annually, we focus accountability measures on our ability to work with our partners to determine the most promising paths forward, what we have learned, whether we are living our values, and how we steward firm health. Over the long-term, we remain accountable for meaningfully contributions to healthier systems.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagining Capitalism</a> <p>The pandemic’s disproportionate impact on frontline and essential workers shined a much-needed spotlight on how our current economic system fails to adequately provide for working families. We were proud to be among one of the first contributors to the National Domestic Workers Alliance Coronavirus Cares Fund, which distributed $30 million in cash assistance to domestic workers in the US who have struggled to get by during the pandemic.</p><p>We also supported the work of Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings Institute, who produced a series of reports that highlighted the stories of working people on the frontlines and the need for “hero pay.” Her research and reporting led to policy changes in several cities to support these working&nbsp;people.</p><p>But even as the cracks in our current economic system’s foundation became glaringly obvious during the pandemic, the residual power structures have remained in place, and overall inequality only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/pandemic-widens-the-gap-between-the-haves-and-have-nots-report-finds.html">widened</a>.</p><p>Meaningful, structural economic reforms will likely continue to be difficult given political incentives that fuel gridlock and polarization, but we remain optimistic. We launched our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">POV</a> this year to articulate our vision to Reimagine Capitalism, and we are thrilled to have so many like-minded allies in some states as well as the federal government (so far, more than a dozen of our grantees and close partners have taken positions in the Biden Administration!). We see the possibility of real change on the horizon supported by some members of the business community, and at the local and state levels (like the organizations supported by the <a href="https://carryonthefightfund.org/">Carry on the Fight&nbsp;Fund</a>).</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology-2/">Responsible Technology</a> <p>As many workers left office buildings and students left schools following stay-at-home orders, our deep dependency on technology only increased. As a result, the power of those technology companies grew even more, and became clear and concerning to both the public (<a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/the-film/">The Social Dilemma</a> was a global smash hit and featured several of our grantees) and policymakers.</p><p>Building on our work outlining Big Tech’s <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Omidyar-Network-POV_Platforms-and-Power_2.7.2020.pdf">Unchecked Power</a> earlier in the year, the team released legal roadmaps for antitrust cases against <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roadmap-for-an-Antitrust-Case-Against-Facebook.pdf">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roadmap-for-a-Case-Against-Google.pdf">Google</a>. The recent lawsuits by the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and dozens of state attorneys general — along with upcoming legislative hearings — against these dominant tech platforms are critical steps to hold their outsized power to&nbsp;account.</p><p>We’re also seeing success with the Digital Services &amp; Markets Acts in the EU that ensures platforms behave in a more fair and competitive way, as well as the increase in uptake for <a href="https://www.mosip.io/about.php">MOSIP</a> (an open source, multipurpose foundation ID system) in Africa and across the Global&nbsp;South.</p><p>In a sense, the “techlash” came of age at the same time people embraced more tech. As a result, we continue to support developing and strengthening the field of responsible technologists, new constructs for data, and how technology and policy safeguards can strengthen innovation across the&nbsp;world.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">Pluralism</a> <p>Last year, we committed $500,000 to Black-led organizations on the frontlines fighting for racial equity. Among many organizations doing incredible work, we invested in seven achieving impact in ways that align with our current strategic focus, including those whose work combines economic, civic, or criminal justice reform with narrative shift or movement building towards racial&nbsp;justice.</p><p>We are committed to building true partnerships with these organizations and amplifying their work to a broader audience of both practitioners and funders. As funders, we acknowledge our privilege and we know our investments are only the first step towards our commitment to dismantling white supremacy.</p><p>Our work within pluralism continues to evolve as we refine our strategy and recognize that a global community that bridges divides is a prerequisite for meaningful social&nbsp;change.</p> Turning the&nbsp;Page <p>Many of us looked to 2021 as a light at the end of a dark tunnel. But, in reality, we are still facing many of the same challenges as 2020. We are entering another year of uncertainty, which will require deep care for our staff and our partners. We will be bold, get moving, and seize this transitional moment to put what we have learned into action. Managing this tension between hope and pragmatism will require important, but difficult tradeoffs. It is in this spirit that we set the following learning questions:</p><p>· What are we learning about what it takes to develop an internal programmatic structure that supports dynamic, complex, social change&nbsp;work?</p><p>· What roles and tools are serving us well in our efforts to influence social&nbsp;change?</p><p>· How can engaging and listening deeply to a diverse set of stakeholders lead us to be more effective in contributing to social change? What forms of engagement work more/less well?</p><p>From today’s perch, we believe these questions are critical for us to continue to learn and evolve as an organization in ways that help us contribute to meaningful social change. That said, we are prepared to adapt to whatever 2021 may throw our way, and our first priority will always be the well-being of our staff and partners.</p><blockquote>In 2021, we will continue to evolve as we use lessons from the past year to shape our portfolio. We will also be answering critical questions that will help us to further refine our role and boundaries (e.g., we define and advance <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">pluralism</a>). These insights will help ensure we invest in partners, systems, and processes that will not only increase our efficacy, but also foster a culture that reflects our values and enables staff to&nbsp;thrive.</blockquote><p>After a year of dramatic shifts and significant organizational transition, our staff is proud of the work we accomplished and grateful for each other, the firm, our board — and especially our partners. We expect challenges to surface, but we are energized by the opportunity to contribute towards long-term change on issues that&nbsp;matter.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/2021-a-new-year-of-hope-ce640aaa3a1c">2021: A New Year of Hope…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has approved <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> as the latest of Hyperledger’s projects to graduate from incubation to active status.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries provides reusable, interoperable tool kits designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. The Aries project grew out of the need for protocols, open source tools and interoperability test suites that leverage networks enabling verifiable credentials, such as those supported by <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy.</a></p>



<p>This major milestone shows that Hyperledger’s technical leadership recognizes the maturity of the Aries community and project. The TSC applies rigorous standards to active projects including code quality, security best practices, open source governance, and a diverse pool of contributors. Becoming an active Hyperledger project is a sign that Aries has grown in both community and code and is a big step forward for the decentralized digital identity community.</p>



<p>“This approval is further evidence that Hyperledger Aries is a breakout success for the Hyperledger community,” said Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation. “Convergence on common libraries for the exchange of credentials will help speed the development of urgently-needed solutions and systems, ranging from education to finance to the fight against the pandemic. Aries is key to that convergence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The TSC’s endorsement of Hyperledger Aries as out of incubation and into active project status is particularly important as the world grapples with finding trusted ways for people to prove their COVID-19 vaccination or test results. Aries’ maturity and protocol-driven approach to issuing verifiable credentials and presenting verified proofs has meant that Aries is a part of every technical discussion in that domain, and a core component of many of the technical stacks being deployed.<br><br>Key components of an Aries solution are:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">Agent</a> Frameworks: In the digital world, humans, organizations and things need a way to store, manage and exchange verifiable data, including the crypto that decentralized identity demands. Agents do this work in a decentralized environment, and Aries Frameworks make it easy for anyone to build agents tied to specific business needs.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md">DID communications</a> (DIDComm): Agent-like things have to interact with one another to get work done. How they talk in general is DIDComm. DIDComm was born in the Aries project, and work on the next version continues within a working group at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md">Protocols</a>: The Aries protocols run on top of DIDComm and enable peer-to-peer application-level interactions among&nbsp;agents, and shows how they should be designed and documented. The Aries community has developed an approach called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/305">Aries Interop Profiles</a> (AIP) that formalizes specific sets of protocols that any agent-maker must use to be interoperable across the community, and a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">test harness</a> that verifies interoperability across disparate implementations using the protocols that make up an AIP.  



<p>A Wallet is a common term for a mobile agent used by a person. Wallets are the important link that enables people to manage their connections, credentials, and other aspects of involvement in the decentralized identity ecosystem. This important area of work has just recently received another boost with the community organization of work around creating an open source mobile agent using the Aries Framework Javascript and React Native.</p>



<p>Aries also has close community ties with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> project, which is also housed at the Linux Foundation. Both projects are working on the issuing, holding, and presenting of cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials without the necessity of intermediaries. While Aries is focused on the tools required for verifiable credential exchange, the Trust over IP Foundation is a project working to define a complete architecture, or stack, that combines both cryptographic trust and human trust relating to decentralized identity.</p>



<p>The TSC commended the Aries project during the meeting for the project’s highly diverse contributors. Achieving a high number of organizations contributing to a project at Hyperledger is often a challenge. Congratulations are due to those participating in and supporting the Aries Project.</p>

<p></p>
<p>New Zealand Women in Identity members Tamara Al’ Salim and Andrew Weaver were featured on a panel discussing Contact Tracing and Data Ownership. They spoke to the members of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), a nonprofit based in Washington, DC, whose members are vital records professionals across the U.S. as well as other countries. Tamara and Andrew discussed their view of New Zealand’s response to the pandemic and the impact it had on the community’s behavior when it came to contact tracing.</p>
<p>Andrew described how New Zealand took a pragmatic and expert led approach to the pandemic, driven by medical recommendations and based on statistics and scientific data modeling, wrapped up with the message of kindness. With the continuing change in the pandemic’s landscape, and quoting Maya Angelou, New Zealand took the approach of “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tamara walked the audience through graphs that told a story about the New Zealand COVID-19 Tracer App including how its early inception didn’t have much uptake as New Zealand left lockdown with no community cases. The perception was , no community cases meant no need to keep track of our movements. As travel increased into the country, cases at the border increased as well, still yet, people didn’t feel the pressure to keep track of their movements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara went on to describe how the trend shifted dramatically when a community case linked to a ship at the ports got into the community, with a household of four people testing positive, the whole country had restriction levels changes, and the city the cases were in went into even high restrictions. This saw a significant uptake and a consistent trend of use of the app since then. New Zealand continues to report daily to its community on the number of border and community cases with none in the community since November 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara observed that complacency is natural and will continue to happen as people feel safe and not have the need to keep track of their movements. If there is any trend that is guaranteed, it would be the one when cases are discovered in the community people become more vigilant and keep track of their movements. That is possible the new normal in New Zealand. In the meantime, the message, is that is a collective responsibility, we all want to safe and be able to celebrate holidays safely, act like you have the virus, wear your mask on public transport and stay home if you are unwell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara is one of the Ambassadors for New Zealand and Andrew as an active member and supporter of Women in Identity encouraged the NAPHSIS members and especially many of the men to join the organization and support our work.</p>
<p>In addition, Kay Chopard spoke in the closing plenary about the Women in Identity organization and encouraged the NAPHSIS membership to become part of the organization and the mission. The conference took place virtually on November 30 to December 2, 2020.</p>

<p>By Jozette Allah-Mensah and Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustration by Superside.<p>“When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do&nbsp;it.”</p><p>These are the words of 22-year-old Amanda Gorman — the first National Youth Poet Laureate in American history. The opening lines from her poem, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/amanda-gorman-inaugural-poem-transcript/index.html">“The Hill We Climb,”</a> were first heard at President Biden’s inauguration and inspired millions around the world. Amanda Gorman was one of several youth who participated in inaugural events that day. They represent the next generation of activists meeting today’s challenges head&nbsp;on.</p><p>This group has experienced and persevered through cataclysmic terrorist attacks, economic disruption, the ever-present threat of police violence against Black and brown bodies, and politics that further divides us with every news cycle. Add to all of this the accelerants of the internet and social&nbsp;media.</p><blockquote>However, young people leading the way is not a new phenomenon.</blockquote><p>In the latter half of the 20th century and the first two decades of the 21st, youth have been conscientious revolutionaries working to ensure the words of our nation’s Constitution apply to all within our borders. Indeed, Martin Luther King, Jr., a 25-year-old Baptist preacher at the time he led the bus boycott in Montgomery, would be considered a member of Generation Z today. King and his generation of civil rights leaders, the people whose names we hear most often during Black History Month, serve as an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/children-who-marched-for-equal-rights-inspire-a-new-generation">inspiration to the current class of emboldened youth activists.</a></p><p>Viewed from this perspective, the voices of young people must be recognized and actively engaged in our fight for social justice in America and throughout the world. Those voices include the likes of <a href="https://time.com/longform/never-again-movement/">anti-gun activists</a> and Parkland school shooting survivors David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez, global environmental activists <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit">Greta Thunberg</a> and Flint, Michigan native Mari Copeny, known as <a href="http://Little%20Miss%20Flint">“Little Miss Flint,”</a> and now Gorman. It’s not only important to recognize their activism but to appreciate that without it, we will fail to reach the next rung on the ladder of equity, opportunity, and justice in&nbsp;America.</p><blockquote>Without the activism of Gen-Z, we fail to reach the next rung on the ladder of equity, opportunity, and justice in&nbsp;America.</blockquote> Generation Z: The Leaders We&nbsp;Need <p>Against the backdrop of the pandemic and economic devastation, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2020-12-07/us-saw-summer-of-black-lives-matter-protests-demanding-change">the summer of 2020</a> forced us to reckon with the horrific murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, George Floyd, and so many others at the hands of police. We marched, protested for change, and the surge of the Black Lives Matter movement spanned oceans. We called for legislative action to strike down the pillars of white supremacy undergirding the foundation of the United States. We forced the start of difficult conversations. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/06/08/the-nations-racial-justice-protests-are-a-pivotal-moment-for-millennials-and-gen-z/">And at the forefront of this cultural shift was Gen Z. </a><br> <br>This generation has called for expediency in eradicating inequities across the map. They have refused to accept silence from brands that have the platforms to speak up and make a difference, and pushed back against those whose words are solely performative. For Gen Z, a crucial requisite for justice is intention and purposeful action.</p><blockquote>As younger people continue to step up and speak out, we must ask ourselves: How can we learn and leverage their activism to effect change more broadly?

In referencing the “shadows” rather than the darkness, she may have been referencing the work of those freedom fighters for justice from generations ago. It’s not completely dark, but there still remains important work to be done. Her final refrain tells us inherently what Generation Z is already doing, and how we can emulate their example to bring about positive&nbsp;change.</p><blockquote>“For there is always light, if only we’re brave enough to see it. If only we’re brave enough to be&nbsp;it.”</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-dawn-is-ours-gen-z-the-fight-for-social-justice-9da40f48b54c">The Dawn is Ours: Gen-Z &amp; the Fight for Social Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>In an increasingly digitalized world, the G20 has its sights firmly set on enhancing cross-border payments. By making cross-border payment services faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive, the expectation is that economic growth, international trade and financial inclusion will all prosper, generating benefits for citizens and economies globally. The economic implications of the current global pandemic only strengthen the case for this to happen sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>To support this international priority, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its Stage 3 roadmap on Enhancing Cross-border Payments in October. The document was developed in coordination with the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and other relevant international stakeholders. It builds on the FSB’s Stage 1 report, setting out the challenges and frictions in cross-border payments that contribute to them, and the CPMI’s Stage 2 report, describing the necessary elements of a response, in the form of a set of 19 building blocks.  </p>
<p>In its publication, the FSB lists several key focus areas that require global coordination and action in order to overcome these challenges. These focus areas, which seek to enhance the existing payments ecosystem and also cover emerging payment infrastructures and arrangements, are mapped through building blocks to associated actions and indicative timelines, agreed upon by FSB member authorities, standard-setters and international organizations. This approach provides a high-level plan, which sets ambitious but achievable goals. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> Payments are at the heart of digitalization which is why the European Commission has set out a Retail Payments Strategy as a part of Digital Finance Package.  International payments represent a core pillar of this strategy and we are supportive of the G20’s roadmap, in particular with regard to global standards. Full consideration will be given to the LEI, as it is a strong and established tool which can be used for reducing the costs associated with cross border payments. - Ceu Pereira, Team Leader, Retail Payments at European Commission
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Global Unique Identifiers: a building block for cross-border payments </p>
<p>Of particular relevance to GLEIF, is the identification of ‘Establishing Unique Identifiers with proxy registries ’ as a key building block in the FSB’s roadmap to enhanced cross-border payments. This building block is mapped to the following focus area: increasing data quality and straight-through processing by enhancing data and market practices. </p>
<p>Within the roadmap’s action-oriented framework, FSB and GLEIF are committed to work in consultation with the CPMI, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, International Organization for Standardization and other stakeholders, to: “explore the scope for, and obstacles to develop, a global Unique Identifier (UI) for cross border payments and potentially other financial transactions, that takes into account existing identifiers including the LEI for legal entities….  The review would also: </p>
 
 Consider mechanisms to match UIs with payment information, such as visa a proxy registry, 
 Take into account the work of relevant standard setting bodies, including the FATF [Financial Action Task Force], on technical, governance or policy issues, 
 And analyse how to map existing identifiers.” 
 
<p>This collaborative work effort is scheduled to run from October 2020 until December 2021 and GLEIF welcomes the opportunity to engage with it.<br>
Additionally, as a further action mapped to the same ‘Establishing Unique Identifiers…’ building block, GLEIF will work in close coordination with the FSB, the Legal Entity Identifier Regulatory Oversight Committee (LEI-ROC) and national authorities to explore options for improving LEI adoption. This work effort will run from June 2021 to  June 2022</p>
<p>From GLEIF’s perspective, it is extremely encouraging to see that the FSB’s roadmap to enhanced cross-border payments makes a crystal clear connection between legal entity identification and a well-functioning global payment ecosystem. The absence of a system which uniquely identifies counterparties in any type of transaction, whether cross-border or otherwise, fundamentally limits transparency, the security of payments and the ability to track fraud. The FSB’s efforts to define a standardized global entity identifier which will allow this identity verification to happen across international borders should only be celebrated. Such a move has the potential to increase global trading confidence, which will result in significant commercial and economic opportunities.  </p>
<p>Can the LEI be leveraged?  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corporates need to be able to transparently identify counterparties when making and processing payments. This is challenging when dealing with legal entities in different jurisdictions. Airbus payment and KYC processes could be eased if transaction counterparties could easily be uniquely identified, alongside their ultimate beneficiary owners. LEI usage in cross-border payments would bring significant benefits to corporates globally. - Dr. Franz Kaiser, Head of Treasury Reporting &amp; Middle Office, Finance FTR at Airbus
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reassurance comes from the FSB’s commitment to consider the LEI in context of this initiative. The roadmap sets out clearly that there is exploratory work to do in assessing the role that the LEI might play in the identification of legal entities within the cross-border payments landscape. There is no doubt that there needs to be universal agreement on the Unique Identifer taken forward. And therein lies a key strength of the LEI; decisions on common standards for payments are often shaped by alignment among large and diverse groups of stakeholders – and the LEI is the legacy of such a global agreement. Given that the LEI was developed to create transparency in the derivatives market following the 2008 financial crisis, it seems a natural evolution of its purpose to play a critical role in delivering transparency across the global payments landscape. It is a very powerful proposition which poses an immediate solution for the global identification of legal entities. This is in sharp contrast to the question of how to address the need for a global unique identifier for individuals. In that case, an immediate solution is not quite so obvious. </p>
<p>As the FSB seeks to lay strong foundations for a future-proof global payment ecosystem, I’d like to reaffirm GLEIF’s commitment to playing a valuable and collaborative role in the transformation of the global payments landscape. We look forward to playing our part through engagement in the FSB consultations as we move forward and contribute purposefully to the enhancement of cross-border payments services. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to their broader financial stability benefits, LEIs can help enhance the payments ecosystem. Such support could range from enhanced AML and sanction screening to more effective internal reconciliation of payments. Given its importance to payments and as a valuable tool in an increasingly data-driven economy, the Bank of England will introduce the LEI into ISO 20022 CHAPS payment messages. This will start in February 2023 on an ‘optional to send’ basis. From Spring 2024, the LEI will be mandatory to send for payments between two financial institutions. I hope that with time as LEI adoption  increases we will be able to mandate to a broader set of payments. Achieving a greater critical mass will enable the greatest progress to be made.  - Victoria Cleland, Executive Director for Banking, Payments and Innovation, Bank of England
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Financial institutions across Europe have to speak the same technical language to process payments efficiently and safely. The EPC SEPA payment and payment-related schemes, therefore, rely on global open standards to ensure that all stakeholders exchange data which are commonly understood throughout Europe. Accordingly, the EPC is glad to see that the Global LEI System is growing and supporting businesses, and is ready to accommodate LEI in the new SEPA Request-to-Pay (SRTP) scheme as an option for identifying RTP service providers (SPs).  - Javier Santamaria, Chair of European Payments Council and GLEIF Board Member

<p>On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC) <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">launched</a>. This initiative is intended to define, in the context of test results and vaccination records for opening up borders for travel and commerce, a high bar for implementations of identity and credentialing systems to meet with regards to privacy, ethics and portability. They will also work with the implementers of such systems to converge towards common standards and governance.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>A set of Linux Foundation organizations – <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TrustOverIP</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a>, <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a>, and its <a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a> – have engaged as supporting organizations and were part of the announcement. We did this based on very encouraging signs during formation discussions that GHPC would not only help bring many of the organizations emerging into the self-sovereign identity space into alignment on platforms and standards we have long championed, but would also give us an external reference point for our position on the importance of privacy in the design and implementation of such systems.</p>



<p>Hyperledger has been home to the pioneering digital identity ledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> and agent toolkit <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a>, which form the basis of so many <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/culedger-case-study">production</a> <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/kiva-case-study">privacy-preserving</a> digital identity systems and, now, are serving as the basis for many of these emerging <a href="https://www.evernym.com/travelpass/">health pass solutions</a>. The TrustOverIP Foundation led the formal recognition of the need and role for governance organizations in the digital identity landscape – showing how we can get both optionality and interoperability when we weave global identity and credentialing systems together in a decentralized way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Covid Credentials Initiative, starting way back in March 2020, recognized the potential for credentials of all sorts in the fight against this and future pandemics, and have pulled together an amazing community of technologists and entrepreneurs working together on this. Now, as part of Linux Foundation Public Health, we are working to bring together a set of software projects that can implement credential systems and help accelerate adoption of these globally, centered on the needs of public health authorities.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49XvVxLMTLw&amp;feature=emb_logo">Thursday’s GHPC webinar</a>, Charlie Walton from Mastercard said GHPC is “in the business of describing what good looks like.” We will be working with GHPC to bring our own communities’ views of not just what good looks like, but how we’re already working together to standardize and implement this work. Furthermore we’ll see if our processes can directly support GHPC’s efforts to harmonize this domain.</p>



<p>We recognize there are quite a few of these initiatives now, reflecting just how broadly this issue is felt across society. We can play – we must play – a key role in channeling all this market activity and good-faith sharing of expertise into applications directly in people’s hands, so we can get back to travel and re-opening workplaces and schools in a safe and equitable way. Our key levers to move the world are open source software and open public engagement, and we will double-down on those tools to have a unique and substantive impact.</p>



<p>Look for more on this soon within our communities. We’re incredibly excited to be a part of this global effort.</p>

<p>Papaki kau ana ngā tai o mihi ki a koutou katoa.</p>



<p>As the Kiwi summer rolls on it brings with it a sense of optimism for 2021 and reminds us how truly blessed we are to call Aotearoa New Zealand home.</p>



<p>The year ahead for our digital identity ecosystem and DINZ is one of optimism and progress&nbsp; too – with our focus squarely set on leading a united approach to digital identity for the benefit of all New Zealanders.&nbsp; 2021 will be a significant year of progress as the work to formalise the DIA’s proposed Trust Framework is gathers momentum.</p>



<p>In the spirit of optimism and progress, I would like to let you know that Andrew Weaver will be leaving DINZ as our Executive Director at the end of March.&nbsp; Andrew has been a true rangatira and kaitiaki of DINZ since its establishment.&nbsp; Working together with our members and Executive Council, Andrew has set our association on the path to growth and success and developed significant local and international profile and respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew is leaving us to pursue other opportunities and we sincerely thank him for his contribution to DINZ and the ecosystem and wish him all the very best. Prior to the end of March we will take time to acknowledge his significant contribution to DINZ.</p>



<p>Our mission at DINZ is to create a digital identity ecosystem that enhances Kāwanatanga (honourable governance), Rangatiratanga (self-determination &amp; agency) and&nbsp;&nbsp; Ōritetanga (equity &amp; partnerships) for all people in New Zealand.&nbsp; We are on a journey to become more tiriti-honouring by enhancing our practice to embody Kāwanatanga, believe digital identity is a taonga and we collectively have a great responsibility as Kaitiaki to treat people’s identity with dignity, respect and care.&nbsp; We have started the process of looking for a new Executive Director who will drive this mission and kaupapa at DINZ.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.seek.co.nz/job/51507981">Learn more about the Executive Director role opportunity</a></p>



<p>I would also like to formally welcome our new <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council members</a> who joined in with our first meeting of the year on the 28th January.&nbsp; Welcome and we look forward to your wisdom and guidance on the Executive Council.</p>



  Sat Mandri, JNCTN  John Evans, TSB  Russell Craig, Microsoft NZ  Luke McIntyre, MATTR  



<p>In the Government seat on the Executive Council, the DIA will continue to represent the government and we are pleased to welcome Alan Bell replacing Tony Eyles as the government representative.<br><br>We look forward to engaging with you throughout 2021 as we shape a new future for digital identity in Aotearoa New Zealand.<br><br>He mihi mutunga kore</p>

<p>February 9,&nbsp;2021</p><p><a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">1.7 billion</a> adults and millions of organizations do not have access to essential financial services; billions more have bank accounts but are unable to use them. Despite initiatives such as the <a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">World Bank’s Universal Financial Access program</a> and governmental and industry encouragement, many remain underserved or entirely excluded from the global financial system. For many, the basic societal need to hold monetary value securely, transact for necessities, and transfer money to friends and family is still out of&nbsp;reach.</p> Regulatory Compliance Is an Enabler for Innovation in&nbsp;Fintech <p>Thankfully, financial services continue to evolve rapidly, providing new avenues for people and organizations to engage in essential services. Alternative financial technologies (fintech) are bursting into the marketplace, offering innovative products and services to banking participants through direct, smartphone-based, non-traditional channels. The digitization of monetary exchange has also experienced explosive growth, often proving to be faster, more convenient, more privacy-respecting, and more secure than physical transactions.</p><p>These trends expand the risk and compliance challenges of money transmission beyond traditional banks to startups, enterprises, and nonprofits/NGOs, which are typically unfamiliar with regulatory scrutiny or essential compliance controls. Global regulators are currently monitoring this transition and looking to ensure existing regulations apply to new fintech players. This transition includes virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and other non-bank financial institutions which act as a conduit for the financially excluded and underserved or those otherwise considered ‘high-perceived-compliance risk.’</p> Financial Inclusion Needs Identity for&nbsp;All <p>According to the World Bank’s ID4D, “<a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/953621531854471275/pdf/Global-ID-Coverage-Barriers-and-Use-by-the-Numbers-Insights-from-the-ID4D-Findex-Survey.pdf">People with an ID are more likely to own bank accounts and mobile phones, and financial and mobile services are among the most frequently reported uses of one’s&nbsp;ID</a>.”</p><p>Identity verification is at the core of essential financial regulations of Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT). Financial governance leaders are recalibrating their requirements to keep up with the pace of innovation to ensure that bad actors do not exploit the financial system and that intermediaries of all types have adequate financial crime compliance (FCC) programs in&nbsp;place.</p><p>The fundamental right for individuals to participate in society no matter their origins or circumstance has long been at the core of the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>’s vision. The Foundation promotes control of one’s own identity to utilize digitally stored credentials to access and engage daily services. While decentralized identity has been a barrier in traditional banking, fintech and regtech have introduced the constructs to leverage digital and self-sovereign identity to drive financial inclusion for tens of millions of outliers.</p><p>Indeed, these new technologies provide great promise in modernizing finance, payments, and identity management in tandem. But related regulatory compliance is in equal need of modernization. Traditional legal compliance relies on legacy banking infrastructure. Its growth has forced the sector into a false binary choice: provide incentives for universal access or protect financial system integrity with exclusionary compliance controls. This choice has disproportionately impacted those who are in most need of essential financial services, such as low- or moderate-income families, and access to vital services, such as international remittances. The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of such entry to small businesses reliant on support and financially underserved or excluded households looking for&nbsp;relief.</p> Innovation in Governance, Compliance, and Regulation <p>Since 2019, Sovrin has hosted the Compliance and Payments Task Force (CPTF), an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts. The CPTF has developed and promoted the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and VASP processes.</p><p>The Rulebook serves to ensure essential global banking compliance while accommodating fintech’s seamless experience and smooth flow of funds for members and reinforcing the application and intersection with traditional banking rails. The Rulebook defines technical standards for end-to-end transaction flows and service-level agreements between parties to reflect the operational realities of an increasingly decentralized and cross-border financial system.</p><p>As part and parcel of regulatory compliance to expand the operational focus of the CPTF to serve the Identity for All mission and advance inclusion, the Group has reimagined into the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit">Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a>. The CIFWG builds on the tactical efforts of the CPTF, with a robust and ambitious mandate: promoting financial inclusion as a critical enabler. CIFWG will monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and underserved, focusing on how economic and regulatory technologies, supported by self-sovereign identity (SSI), can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and the associative risks injected by innovation.</p><p>With the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a> as an anchor framework, the Group will facilitate the advancement of financial inclusion and a modernized application of established global banking requirements and the attendant and necessary FCC protocols. CIFWG is also engaging with other international organizations, initiatives, and regulatory-led groups that advance financial inclusion and modern regulatory compliance solutions. Its ultimate goal is to promote access to traditional and non-traditional financial services and highlight the resulting benefits of building economic resilience and prosperity.</p><p>CIFWG believes that SSI is a powerful enabler for security, compliance, and inclusion&nbsp;. “Our bedrock approach recognizes that any institution today can be a financial services provider; our job is enabling their full participation in the global banking system,” says Amit Sharma, CIFWG Chair. “Digital finance is not new, although the cryptographic creation and representation of value show promising applications to democratize finance truly. Innovative and modern FCC approaches must meet market innovation. We encourage all who are interested in joining us in the CIFWG to help facilitate a pathway to a more sustainable economic future for&nbsp;all.”</p><p>For more details about the Working Group and instructions on how to join, please see the Compliance and Inclusive Finance <a href="https://sovrin.org/inclusive-finance/">webpage</a> or contact <a href="mailto:cifwg@sovrin.org">cifwg@sovrin.org</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/promoting-banking-for-all-announcing-the-compliance-inclusive-finance-working-group-cifwg/">https://sovrin.org</a> on February 9,&nbsp;2021.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>At Equifax, I work with governments across Canada to help them utilize data, insights and analytics to make policy decisions more data driven. We also have fraud and authentication solutions that tend to work well for government departments administering social assistance programs. We are a member of DIACC and I am a Co-Chair of the Outreach Committee this year. We’re focused on getting lots of identity content out, on topics that might need more explaining like facial recognition technology, for example. It gets me out of bed in the morning because I enjoy the people I am working with and these are problems I really enjoy solving.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>That is a long story. My Dad was (and still is) the Mayor of the small town I grew up in, so I quite literally grew up in politics. In university, my desire to understand how governments worked was strong so I started doing internships. I got hired at Queen’s Park as my first job out of university and ended up in the Ministry of Finance. That led me to the financial services sector where I first got introduced to the world of identity and authentication as more transactions started happening online.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>My degree is in Environmental Policy so I always felt like I didn’t belong in financial services or technology. The most important lesson I have learned along the way is that hard work and a strong willingness to learn and execute is just as important as credentials. Work hard, have a growth mindset, and don’t be intimidated.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START /STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>There are a lot of solutions out there today and the sector is evolving so fast. What we are starting to do really well and need to continue to do is collaborate. I have been part of many co-pitches now<br>
and it is really fun.</p>
<p>What we need to start to focus on more is how do we better reach the general public and build trust? That’s not any one person or organization’s role, but it is a focus of the DIACC outreach committee because we believe that education will help adoption.</p>
<p>Communication is so important, and one thing I think we should stop doing is speaking too technically about product benefits and features. Let’s talk instead about values and solving customers problems. Identity solves so many customer problems and it will help people and organizations connect the dots.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>We need different perspectives around the table in order to make informed decisions.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>I recently read The Choice by Dr. Edith Eva Edger. She is a psychologist and one of the last remaining Holocaust survivors. It is one of those life changing books. Although the book is about struggle and suffering, it is an inspiration.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Don’t limit yourself to things that you know, accept failure as part of the skill development process.</p>

 Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global&nbsp;Economy <p>Today, <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> announced the launch of the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> along with more than 25 leading individual companies and organizations in the technology, health, and travel sectors — including the Airports Council International (ACI), Commons Project Foundation, COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, Evernym, Hyperledger, IBM, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Linux Foundation Public Health, Lumedic, Mastercard, Trust Over IP Foundation, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is an open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative to create a blueprint for interoperable digital health pass systems that will help restore global travel and restart the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every segment of the global economy, but none as profoundly as<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/industries-most-and-least-impacted-by-covid19-from-a-probability-of-default-perspective-september-2020-update"> travel and tourism</a>. Last year, airlines lost an estimated<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-24-01/"> $118.5 billion USD</a> with related impacts across the economy in excess of <a href="https://www.unwto.org/impact-assessment-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-on-international-tourism">$2 trillion&nbsp;USD</a>.</p><p>In conjunction with the announcement, the Collaborative also released its first white paper, entitled, <a href="https://goodhealthpass.org/good_health_pass-a_safe_path_to_global_reopening">Good Health Pass: A Safe Path to Global Reopening</a>.</p> Collaboration Among a New Ecosystem of&nbsp;Players <blockquote>“There’s one thing the world agrees on — we need to address the health concerns today to support a return to normalcy,” said Ajay Bhalla, President of Cyber &amp; Intelligence at Mastercard. “Delivering a global, interoperable health pass system can only happen if we come together in a way that meets the needs of everyone involved. This Collaborative will be critical in helping to define how we connect the pieces that will bring travel back safely, spark job creation and jumpstart the world’s economic&nbsp;engine.”</blockquote><p>Various efforts are currently underway to develop digital health credentials systems — both vaccination and test certificates — for international travel. Yet, despite this race to market, it is unlikely that a single solution will be implemented universally — or even across the entire travel industry. Thus, it is critical that solutions are designed from the onset to be interoperable — both with one another and across institutional and geographic borders.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is not intended to supplant existing efforts but rather to help weave them together, fill gaps where they may exist, and facilitate collaboration among a new ecosystem of stakeholders, many of whom have never worked together&nbsp;before.</p><blockquote>“Fragmentation is a risk we simply cannot ignore,” said ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener. “To be valuable to users, credentials need to be accepted at check-in, upon arrival by border control agencies, and more. We can get there — even with multiple systems — as long as solutions adhere to open standards and participate in a common governance framework. But without these, fragmentation is inevitable, and travelers — and the economy — will continue to suffer needlessly as a&nbsp;result.”</blockquote> Global Travel &amp; Digital Health Credentials <p>COVID-19 test results are already required for entry at some airports and at international borders. But existing paper-based certificates are easy to lose, unnecessarily expose sensitive personal information, and are prone to fraud and counterfeiting.</p><p>By contrast, digital health credentials can be printed (e.g., as a QR code) or stored on an individual’s mobile phone. They enhance user privacy and “bind” an individual’s identity to their test result or vaccination certificate, thus enabling real-time, fraud-resistant digital verification.</p><blockquote>“Our health data consists of the most sensitive personal information, deserving of the strongest privacy,” said Dr. Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security By Design Centre. “Release of our health data must be under our personal control. The Good Health Pass does just that: With Privacy by Design embedded throughout, you control the release of your digital health data, and to whom; all de-identified and decentralized. Privacy and functionality: Win/Win!”</blockquote><p>The World Health Organization recently convened the Smart Vaccination Certificate Consortium to establish standards for vaccination certificates, but no analogous effort currently exists for test certificates. Given that it is expected to take years for vaccines to be universally available globally, widespread testing will remain an essential public health tool — and one that must continue alongside vaccination to ensure a safe and equitable return to public&nbsp;life.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative has defined four primary requirements that digital health credential systems for international travel must&nbsp;satisfy:</p>  Cross-border: Solutions must work at airports, airlines, ports-of-call, and borders worldwide and comply with international and local regulations.  Cross-industry: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors.  Secure &amp; privacy-protecting: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. Solutions must comply with all relevant security, privacy, and data protection regulations and must be able to bind the presenter of the credential to the credential itself at the required level of assurance.  Frictionless: Solutions must seamlessly integrate into testing and travel processes, thus enhancing and streamlining the experience for individuals and airlines alike. Solutions must not add new material costs for travelers. Optimally, validation processes will be contactless to maintain or enhance&nbsp;hygiene.  <p>The Collaborative welcomes the participation of policymakers and representatives of government agencies; companies in the health, technology, and travel sectors; and civil society organizations who share a commitment to safely restoring international travel and economic activity while simultaneously ensuring that equity, privacy, and other civil liberties are protected.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more, please visit the Good Health Pass website at <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">goodhealthpass.org</a>.</p> Endorsing Organizations   Affinidi  Airport Council International (ACI)  Airside  analizA  AOKpass  Bindle Systems  BLOK Solutions  CLEAR  The Commons Project Foundation  Covid Credential Initiative (CCI)  Daon  Everynym  Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design&nbsp;Centre  Grameen Foundation  Hyperledger  IBM  idRamp  International Chamber of Commerce&nbsp;(ICC)  iProov  Linux Foundation Public&nbsp;Health  Lumedic  Mastercard  MIT SafePaths  National Aviation Services&nbsp;(NAS)  Panta  PathCheck Foundation  Prescryptive Health  SITA  STChealth  Trust Over IP Foundation  ZAKA   <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Team FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The second and final day of the Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead: Virtual Policy Forum event on Feb. 5 brought together government officials, tech experts and policy advocates in a packed agenda.</p>



<p>The two-day event was hosted by the FIDO Alliance together with the Better Identity Coalition and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and had over 1,000 registered attendees. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/identity-authentication-and-the-road-ahead-virtual-policy-forum-day-1/">first day</a> of the event saw sessions that outlined the clear and present need for the government and industry to make identity and strong authentication systems more pervasive, to help protect and serve individuals and businesses alike. The second day in contrast had a strong focus on the need for strong authentication and was highlighted by an expert panel that explained how FIDO authentication was able to help secure the 2020 U.S. election.</p>



<p>The day’s event kicked off with a keynote from Congressman John Katko (R-NY) who emphasized the critical need for secure digital identity.</p>



  



<p>“Our homeland security, national security, economic security and way of life are threatened in unprecedented ways by highly sophisticated adversaries and simply being vigilant is no longer enough,” Katko (pictured) said. “Today’s threat environment demands a posture of unwavering resilience. This is particularly true for ensuring the sanctity and resilience of our digital identities.” </p>



<p>How FIDO Helped to Secure the 2020 Election</p>



<p>The resilience of digital identity and strong authentication was called into question during the 2016 election cycle when hackers were able to infiltrate the email accounts of Democratic party staffers, notably the attack of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s gmail account.</p>



  



<p>The same type of event didn’t re-occur during the 2020 election cycle, in part thanks to FIDO standards and a concerted effort to make sure that both Democratic and Republican party officials had access to strong authentication. In a panel during the event, Michael Kaiser, President and CEO of <a href="https://www.defendcampaigns.org/">Defending Digital Campaigns</a> (pictured) explained that his organization was created to help solve the challenge of political campaigns not having the right cybersecurity resources to defend themselves. As companies cannot directly donate to campaigns, Defending Digital Campaigns was formed to act as an intermediary, that enables political campaigns to get cybersecurity services including FIDO based strong authentication resources, for free or low cost. </p>



<p>Kaiser explained that political campaigns are not like a typical organization in that they are short lived and don’t have long term thinking about a security maturity model. Despite that, political campaigns need to be protected as they sit on incredibly valuable and important information.</p>



<p>“I think we gave away more than 10,000 security keys in the political sector in the 2020 cycle,” Kaiser said. “That’s a lot of people and a lot of accounts as we gave away more than $1 million worth of products to 183 campaigns.”</p>



  



<p>Bob Lord (pictured), chief security officer of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) noted that after the events of the 2016 election, security was clearly under the microscope. </p>



<p>“Security is a real challenge and everybody really understands the importance of it, but the dollar figures really can get in the way,” Lord said. “Making sure that there was a reliable source for things like security keys was really instrumental in moving forward.”</p>



<p>Within the DNC and across campaigns, Lord and his team strictly implemented the use of FIDO based security keys to provide strong authentication capabilities and limit the risk of potential phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today 100% of the people at the DNC who need to get access to their email and&nbsp; access to their documents, they’re all using security keys – no exceptions, no executive privilege to opt out of this,” Lord said.</p>



<p>The DNC also benefited from Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP) which provides additional levels of protection and assurance beyond what a basic gmail account enables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re big supporters and real big believers in the combination of FIDO security keys and the APP,” Lord said.</p>



<p>Why DNC Believes in FIDO</p>



<p>Lord noted that there are a number of reasons why he is a big supporter of FIDO standards. For one is the fact that FIDO standards are built into the Google Chrome browser. Lord explained that the DNC was pushing the use of Chromebooks to campaigns and the integrated FIDO capabilities made it easier to deploy strong authentication.</p>



<p>While there are multiple types of two-factor authentication available in the market, for Lord there are really only two categories.</p>



<p>“I think there are really two kinds of multi-factor that are available in the consumer space – I think there are FIDO security keys and then there’s everything else,” Lord stated emphatically. “When I refer to everything else, I refer to those other multi-factors systems as legacy and I do that because I want people to get the mental model that this is something to be contained, minimized and eventually moved out.”</p>



<p>Lord observed that other multi-factor approaches, while better than not using multi-factor at all, have shown weaknesses, which is why in his view as an industry it’s important to really be pushing people pretty aggressively to move down the path of FIDO strong authentication adoption.</p>



<p>While Lord is an advocate for adopting FIDO based strong authentication with security keys, he also noted that there were some usability challenges his team had to work through as well training that was needed to educate and onboard users. The learning from the DNC’s efforts are all now being publicly shared by Lord’s team at<a href="https://democrats.org/security/"> https://democrats.org/security/</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s a non-partisan thing so there’s nothing red or blue about these best practices, but you’ll see in there that we really push pretty hard on security keys and the APP in particular,” he said.</p>



  



<p>Mark Risher, Senior Director of Security and Identity at Google (pictured) emphasized during the panel that in general adding a second factor does still objectively decrease the chances of a user becoming the victim of a phishing attack. That said, he noted that for an attacker, phishing a password, or just phishing a password plus a One Time Password (OTP) PIN code basically just&nbsp; requires basically one more line of code for an attacker. </p>



<p>“It does not require the funding of the nation state,” Rischer said about the ability to bypass OTP for phishing attacks. “So we need to get the world to understand the distinction, and to move into and start requiring these much more stringent hardware based strong authentication technologies and standards.”</p>



<p>How FIDO is Moving Forward to Enable Digital Transformation</p>



<p>The afternoon keynote at the event was delivered by Andrew Shikiar (pictured) the Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance. Shikiar noted that passwordless authentication is an important cornerstone for digital transformation.</p>



  



<p>“The security and authentication aspects of digital transformation came to the fore as everything was accelerated due to the pandemic,” Shikiar said. </p>



<p>Shikiar noted that social engineering had kind of a renaissance in 2020 as phishing continued to be successful.</p>



<p>“Simply put, the only way to break this cycle is to eliminate our dependence on server side credentials and password,” Shikiar said. “Anything on a server can and will eventually be stolen so they’re easy to phish, harvest and replay.”</p>



<p>The need to create stronger authentication is why FIDO was born. Shikiar explained that the FIDO Alliance’s mission is to create open standards for simpler, stronger authentication with public key cryptography and asymmetric public key cryptography, which is something that the average consumer should never have to pronounce, let alone know what it means.</p>



<p>Shikiar also outlined some of the FIDO Alliance’s highlights from 2020 including Apple joining the group. He added that Apple joining served as a powerful signal to the industry that really everyone is coalescing around the FIDO Alliance as the organization to collaborate on the standards based user friendly and strong authentication. Another key highlight from 2020 for FIDO was the level of support across operating system and browser combinations with different transport mechanisms for the authenticator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over 4 billion devices can support FIDO authentication,” Shikiar said. “So in short, you know, we think FIDO is becoming part of the DNA of the web itself, which is a pretty audacious thing.”</p>



<p>“To summarize, FIDO is very much the present and the future of user authentication.”</p>



<p>The Solarwind #Solorigate Attack as an Identity Authentication Issue</p>



<p>A key topic that resonated throughout the second day of the policy forum was the impact of the recent Solarwinds attack which is also commonly referred to as Solorigate.</p>



<p>During a panel about what policies the Biden Administration should consider with regards to Identity, John Miller Senior Vice President of Policy and Senior Counsel at ITI, commented that the Solarwinds attack has been accurately described as a software supply chain attack but it really is also fairly characterized as an identity attack.</p>



  



<p>“Characterizing Solarwinds as an identity attack presents an opportunity to remind policy makers of how fundamental identity is to not only what we’re doing online as consumers but to, but an enterprise environment,” Miller said. </p>



<p>In the final keynote of the event, Alex Weinert (pictured) Partner Director of Identity Security, at Microsoft, outlined the gory authentication and identity details behind the Solorigate incident and why zero trust principles would help to mitigate many risks.</p>



<p>Weinert noted that the Solorigate attack was a fundamental attack on trust. He also emphasized the clear role that authentication played in the attacks and the need to move to strong authentication.</p>



<p>“What are we doing to encourage explicitly verifiable credentials, we all know passwords are crap, we know they’re incredibly vulnerable,” Weinert said. “Are we doing enough as an industry to push for the end of passwords?”</p>



<p>Today’s sessions (February 5) have been recorded and will be available soon.</p>

<p>“CUFX is the result of a grass-roots initiative,” said Chris Seneda, past CUNA Technology Council chair, CUFX steering committee member, and executive vice president and chief operations officer at Virginia CU. “It started with senior IT credit union executives who recognized a need for credit unions as they were trying to get their different systems to work together. The CUNA Technology Council leadership was instrumental in helping to get CUFX off the ground and continued to provide resources as it progressed into its position today. With the transition to CULedger, CUFX will get added support and continue to work with its users and CUNA Technology Council volunteers to assist with future improvements.”</p>
<p>CUFX continues to thrive and meet the necessities of its credit union users. The latest update, which went live this past fall, included the advancement to support non-unique account ID architectures. This newest advancement was driven and reviewed by three core system providers currently implementing CUFX.</p>
<p>“Since its inception, CUFX has been evolving to meet the needs of credit unions,” said David Rohn, vice president of CUNA Councils.</p>
<p>With its transition to CULedger and continued connection to credit union technology experts, we’re confident that this solution will continue to evolve, expand and assist credit unions.”</p>
<p>CULedger delivers a trusted peer-to-peer services network of verifiable exchange for financial cooperatives. Its solutions include MemberPass, a digital ID held by credit union members that protects credit unions and their members from identity theft and fraud in all banking interactions.</p>
<p>“CULedger is proud to incorporate CUFX into our product offerings for credit unions,” said John Ainsworth, President, and CEO of CULedger. “This solution is already being utilized with other solutions within our portfolio, so we understand its value and support its continued advancements.”</p>

 About the Lissi&nbsp;wallet <p>The Lissi wallet is a simple but powerful tool to manage digital interactions. It can be used to establish connections to third parties and to exchange information. You can find a more detailed explanation <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/introducing-the-lissi-mobile-wallet-b2af9bccaf03">here</a> or on <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">our website</a>. It’s currently available as an open beta version for <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">Android</a>.</p> The importance of multi language&nbsp;support <p>Within the identity community, we spend considerable time to ensure interoperability between different solutions. We engage in conversations in a variety of standardization bodies to enable a seamless user experience on a global scale. Frankly speaking, we are not there just yet. But we are on a good way to enable access to the services regardless of where an entity is based or which social background an individual has. While regulation as well as technical and educational hurdles remain, it’s crucial to increase the accessibility of products to different cultures and languages.</p><p>We have already received feedback from multiple stakeholders from the public and private sector saying that multi-language support is essential for the execution of various use cases. There are several nations, which have multiple official languages. If our end-user facing products are not available in the most common languages, it creates entry barriers so big that not even a piloting of these use cases would make sense. Hence, we took note and worked hard to ensure the Lissi wallet is available in the languages of communities, which currently explore the self-sovereign identity&nbsp;concept.</p><p>The Lissi wallet now supports the following languages:</p>  Arabic  English  French  German  Italian  Korean  Polish  Portuguese  Russian  Romanian  Spanish, and  Turkish.   Challenges remain <p>When designing a wallet, the language is only a small part of the whole user experience. The task is to design a universal cockpit, which people can navigate regardless of their social background. Similar to a dashboard in a car, which doesn’t look too different wherever you go. In order to achieve this, we have to standardize the icons, colours and user-flows to a certain degree. However, on the other hand, they need to be adjusted to the target audience. Let’s take the colour red as an example. In western cultures, red is associated with excitement, danger, urgency and love, whereas the same colour evokes danger and caution in the middle-east. In India, it’s associated with purity, while in China it symbolizes luck and happiness. Finding the right balance between standardization and necessary adjustments for the target audience will require knowledge about the cultural differences, feedback and time. When it comes to language it creates its own set of difficulties. Differences can be observed in the usage of genders, the left-to-right or right-to-left reading, the information density or the usage of tenses, just to name a few. Furthermore, there isn’t a common terminology used within the community, which makes a translation into different languages even more challenging.</p><p>Hence, our translation won’t be perfect. While we worked with native speakers, the context is often difficult to explain without demonstrating the user-flow and an actual use-case. Languages also change depending on the use-case or the subject in question. Nevertheless, we are looking forward to making the Lissi wallet even more accessible by adding additional languages and improving our current translation with your feedback. What language would you like to have us support next? We are always looking for translators for additional languages, so reach out to us to get our winter 2021 edition of Lissi Merchandise!</p><p>Cheers. The Lissi&nbsp;team.</p>
