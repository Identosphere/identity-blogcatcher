 DIACC’s Written Submission for the Pre-Budget Consultations in Advance of the 2022 Budget 



<p>Ahead of the 2022 federal budget, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/FINA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=10877390">asked</a>&nbsp;Canadians to share their input.&nbsp;<br>DIACC is pleased to have submitted a brief, calling on the Federal Government to implement the following recommendations:&nbsp;</p>



  That the government secure adoption of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> by businesses and governments.  That the government act on the <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/FINA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=11021772">Finance Committee’s 2021 Pre-Budget Consultation</a> Recommendations 128, Implement a digital identity system that empowers Canadians to control their data that is held by the federal government, and 129, Create a national data strategy.  That the government work with provincial and territorial partners and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to ensure that all Canadians have access to an ISO-compliant government-issued digital ID credential with economy-wide utility by December 2022.  That the government make digital identity-enabled services available to all Canadians by December 2022.  That the government prioritizes funding and integration of digital ID as part of the <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/">Digital Technology Supercluster</a> Initiative.  



 The Key to Unlocking an Inclusive Digital Economy: Investing in Digital ID 



<p>To re-start the economy and deliver inclusive services to all Canadians, governments must invest in unlocking digital. Digital ID empowers Canadians with the choice to safely share their existing credentials (eg: passports, driver’s licenses, health cards) for digital transactions.</p>



<p>Investing in digital ID offers economic benefits to citizens, businesses, and governments and also establishes digital tools to support societal trust, security, privacy, and fraud mitigation. This is a win for all.</p>



<p>Few budget items have the potential to impact every government initiative – digital ID is one such investment with broad impacts and encompassing benefits. Digital ID offers service improvements across all government services and priority areas. This initiative has the potential to empower individuals, increase government efficiency, strengthen companies, and unite communities across the country with secure access to resources, economic development, trust, and support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canadians understand the potential. The pandemic has been an intense and polarizing experience, leading many Canadians to lose faith in institutions. The Edelman Trust Barometer reports that 46% believe that government leaders purposely misled them. At the same time, Canadians are relying more on technology, with the digital sector growing 3.5 percent in 2020, while the economy as a whole shrunk by 5 percent. With digital transformation happening across the country, Canadians are aware that online privacy is crucial. A recent poll from The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada reports that 89 percent of Canadians are concerned about people using information about them online to steal their identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How can the government build trust, enhance privacy, and demonstrate that citizens’ rights are top priority? The answer is clear: 9 in 10 Canadians are supportive of digital ID. Citizen-centric, standards-aligned Digital ID offers an ecosystem that reopens doors closed by the pandemic and unlocks entirely new paths to economic resiliency, cohesion, and social trust.</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑 Recommendation 1: Implement adoption of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> by businesses and governments to ensure Canadians are empowered post-pandemic and have clarity in building a secure, interoperable, and privacy-respecting digital ID.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) is a co-created framework that any jurisdiction — federal, provincial, or international — and industry sector can work with to ensure business, legal, and technical interoperability to realize the full benefits of a digital ecosystem. Rather than seeking a single solution, the PCTF promotes choice and offers a shared hub and language that distinct solutions can interoperate through. Developed by public and private sector experts over a decade, the PCTF provides organizations of all sizes, across sectors, industries, and locations with shared principles and guidelines for a digital ID ecosystem. Built based on recommendations from the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review in 2011, this work has been identified by the public and private sectors as key for Canada’s economic resilience but remains underfunded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While provinces, territories, and countries around the world set up COVID credentialing and proof of vaccination systems, the need for these systems is urgent. The credentials issued must be designed with common principles and security to enable acceptance across various jurisdictional and sector-specific solutions for their unique context. The PCTF makes this possible, working as a flexible foundation to connect systems without dictating a single technological architecture.&nbsp;<br>The PCTF includes adaptable recommendations that are currently being tested in-market, including standards for Notice and Consent, Authentication, Privacy, Verified Person, Verified Organization, Credentials (Relationship and Attributes), Infrastructure (Technology and Operations) and Assessment. A Model, Overview, and Glossary have been published for ease of use across industries and sectors. Developed with Canadians in mind, the PCTF is technology-agnostic, encouraging innovation while prioritizing privacy, safety and security, and supporting digital economic growth on a global scale.</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑&nbsp; Recommendation 2: Put citizens first and integrate cross-government priorities. Act on the <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/FINA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=11021772">Finance Committee’s 2021 Pre-Budget Consultation</a> Recommendations 128, Implement a digital identity system that empowers Canadians to control their data that is held by the federal government, and 129, Create a national data strategy.</p></blockquote>



<p>Empowering individuals to control their data, understand available services, and have more convenient and secure access to government services offers a direct path to rebuild trust. A recent Leger survey commissioned by Postmedia reports that the pandemic has eroded trust in the federal government, either a little or a lot, for 63% of Canadians. After a challenging year, it is critical that the budget puts citizens first. Digital ID is a proactive initiative that offers immediate and long-term benefits. It has the potential to restore confidence, act on Canadian values, and empower citizens.</p>



<p>Providing Canadians with the digital ID credentials necessary to access, manage, and share their own data ensures citizens have control over the important information they need to manage their health, business(es), and digital services. A national data strategy ensures all Canadians benefit from these advances. It also clarifies accountability for those who seek to use technology and personal information with malicious intent. A pan-Canadian strategy evens the playing field for businesses looking to operate digitally across provincial, territorial, and global borders. This approach also enhances Canadians’ ability to compete economically on a global scale, travel, and seek care with the virtual mobility afforded by a secure, verifiable digital ID.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑 Recommendation 3: Ensure all Canadians benefit from digital connections, opportunity, and the right to be recognized with digital ID. Work with provincial and territorial partners and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to ensure that all Canadians have access to an ISO-compliant government-issued digital ID credential with economy-wide utility by December 31, 2022.</p></blockquote>



<p>Digital ID is the key, as the pandemic has built and opened new doors for Canadians navigating their safety, financial security, health and relationships. According to a study by Brookfield Institute, 9 percent of Canadian businesses made 60 percent or more of their total sales online, up from 6 percent in 2019 — but this digital success has been difficult for small to medium enterprises to adopt. As digital service adoption grows, citizen and employee expectations have also shifted to demand more reliable and secure digital alternatives. Digital ID can encourage sustainable, long-term adoption of digital platforms and help organizations of all sizes to benefit from these systems. It also presents a more flexible and streamlined strategy for pan-Canadian notification systems, service delivery, and community safety initiatives.</p>



<p>Provinces and territories are establishing their own digital ID initiatives. <a href="https://account.alberta.ca/">Alberta</a> and <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-services-card/log-in-with-card/set-up-mobile-card/verify-by-video">British Columbia</a> have launched digital IDs, with BC including a mobile card and a <a href="https://youtu.be/nWC7H3LGlrE">Verify by Video</a> option. Significant investments have been made in <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/58872/ontario-making-government-services-more-convenient-reliable-and-accessible">Ontario</a> and <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/gouv/politiques-orientations/vitrine-numeriqc/se-transformer/">Québec</a>, where <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/progress-of-the-covid-19-vaccination/proof-covid-19-vaccination">proof of vaccination credentials</a> have been launched. <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/doing-business-with-government/saskatchewan-account-help/identity-validation-and-privacy">Saskatchewan</a>, Yukon, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick are launching pilots, proof of concepts and digital ID components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This prioritization demonstrates demand for this enabling capability across the country — but unequal funding and approaches developed in departmental silos pose a risk. Without cohesive federal leadership, these systems will be disjointed and miss the opportunity to be truly interoperable, efficient, and useful for all Canadians. Unlocking these opportunities in a synchronized and equitable manner will ensure Canadians can all access economic opportunities, required public services, and the chance to manage their own personal information.</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑&nbsp; Recommendation 4: Collaborate for the highest and most equitable impact. Make digital identity-enabled services available to all Canadians by December 2022.</p></blockquote>



<p>As the provincial and territorial governments take action to simplify and secure digital identities, private companies are also taking note of this massive market opportunity. Notably, Apple is teaming up with the TSA to be a trusted source of ID for Americans and Stripe is pursuing digital ID services partnering with other apps, including Discord, for user verification. Many more companies are entering the digital ID space in hopes of earning users’ trust and capturing market share. As the issuer of identity in Canada, the public sector is uniquely positioned to empower Canadians and enable the private sector — but the government needs to act now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While offering numerous economic and social benefits locally and globally, a Canadian digital ID builds citizen trust and mitigates risk. As the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security noted, “the number of cyber threat actors is increasing, and… Cybercrime will almost certainly continue to be the cyber threat most likely to affect Canadians.” This vulnerability means that Canadians urgently require an encompassing, policy- and leadership-driven approach to implementing and enforcing Privacy by Design principles. A McKinsey report confirms this, suggesting that, for national governments to address the heightened risks presented by cyber threats, “organizations can move from a ‘trust but verify’ mindset to a ‘verify first’ approach.” Pressures and requirements for proof of vaccination, contact tracing, and social distancing are also made possible, digitally secure, and more user-friendly through universal data minimization standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital ID offers the key to unlocking secure digital services and pathways. With opportunities to boost job creation, economic growth, citizen wellbeing, COVID-19 planning, support, and mitigation, and reconciliation efforts, digital ID is a budget line that prioritizes and directly benefits all Canadians. Digital ID offers Canadians more personalized control over personal information and convenient access to services. It can increase mobility and connect intra-provincial and territorial systems. It offers an opportunity to strengthen innovation and establish a secure foundation for international collaboration.</p>



<blockquote><p>🔑&nbsp; Recommendation 5: Embed within existing ecosystems. Prioritize the funding and integration of digital ID as part of the <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/">Digital Technology Supercluster</a> Initiative. Digital ID supports and intersects its areas of focus including health, sustainable natural resource applications, and digital training.</p></blockquote>



<p>Strides are already being made by Canadians. Purpose-built solutions, like the COVID Alert App, demonstrate that Canada has the talent and innovation to adapt and develop market-leading solutions. Unfortunately, the $20 million price tag and reactive nature of these innovations could be improved. The app has also not been approved by data authorities in Alberta, British Columbia, Nunavut, and Yukon, making it an incomplete solution that doesn’t account for different provincial regulations. Due to the nature of the pandemic, a pan-Canadian solution isn’t a nice to have — it’s a must. Digital ID is a proactive investment that could provide similar benefits in contact tracing and offer lasting impacts on service delivery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital ID has the potential to add $4.5 billion of added value to SMEs and reinvestments in the economy. It also directly meets the needs and preferences of consumers, with Signicat reporting that 68 percent of consumers expect 100 percent digital onboarding in the wake of COVID-19 and 60 percent would value digital identities to access services internationally.

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>In July 2021, the European Commission (EC) moved one step closer to a clampdown on illicit money flows; it published its long-awaited package of four legislative proposals intended to strengthen the EU’s rules on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).</p>
<p>Within the package, the EC officially recognized the value of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) as a unique mechanism capable of supporting transparency within any ecosystem, by formalizing it as an important component of future AML/CFT efforts. Two of the four EC proposals call for the LEI to be used in certain customer identification and verification scenarios where it is available: </p>
 
 New Regulation on AML/CFT: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing; 
 Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information accompanying transfers of funds and certain crypto-assets (recast). 
 
<p>Inclusion of the LEI within such far-reaching, EU-wide proposals for a future-proof AML/CFT regulatory  framework represents a huge leap forwards, in terms of realizing a key component of the G20 and Financial Stability Board’s vision to create the LEI as a public good. Any role played by the LEI in helping to protect EU citizens from the impact of terrorism and organized crime can be deemed of significant societal benefit. </p>
<p>A brief analysis of why the EC is championing the LEI within the AML/CFT context highlights that there are many benefits. Use of the LEI consistently for entity identification at the Member State level and the EU level can diminish the margins-of-error related to language ambiguity, human interpretation, and manual intervention. The LEI’s broad interoperability enables it to be integrated seamlessly into both centralized and decentralized digital identity management systems, together with the eIDAS-compliant digital certificates that are already harmonizing the use of e-signature technologies across the EU.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the new EC proposals are intended to create a much more consistent framework to ease compliance for operators subject to AML/CFT rules, especially for those active cross-border. Here too, and given the cross-border nature of money laundering and terrorism financing, the LEI can be used as the ‘Rosetta Stone’ for legal entities involved in financial transactions. Overseen by the <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/about/index.htm">Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC)</a>, the Global LEI System is the only system that establishes a recognized, monitored and standardized global identity for legal entities, linked to the entity’s national ID system. Its universality across borders, combined with open and online access to annually verified business card information linked to each LEI, makes it uniquely placed to enable efficient information exchange between the ‘obliged parties’ defined in the AML/CFT proposal and all competent authorities.   </p>
<p>And while this is the first time the LEI has been officially endorsed by the EC in its AML/CFT framework, the LEI has a long track record as a powerful tool in assisting the efforts of financial institutions to combat money laundering and terrorist funding. The LEI enables financial institutions to conduct fully automated, straight-through processing; by replacing outdated manual checks, the LEI increases both the speed and the effectiveness of client onboarding and ongoing compliance checks. This includes improving screening against sanctions and watch lists thereby enabling new efficiencies for both institution and client, lowering costs significantly. </p>
<p>The latest recommendation from the EC that the LEI is used, where available, for customer identification and verification in AML/CTF legislative reforms, has the potential to drastically increase the transparency of legal entities participating in financial transactions. Recent AML scandals have shown that financial criminals mostly operate through a network across borders to conceal their illicit transactions. The LEI, a global standard for unique legal entity identification, can make these connections and transactions across borders visible and easy-to-interpret to the financial institutions and Financial Intelligence Units. It can therefore contribute to the stronger authentication of entity clients, promote transparency and reduce illicit transactions.</p>
<p>By including the LEI in its AML/CFT legislative package, the EC strengthens efforts across Europe to use and reinforce global standards in the promotion of transparency and financial stability. The European Central Bank (ECB) recently recognized the benefits of extending LEI use to cover all future public reporting and financial transactions. As a result, the European Systemic Risk Board has recommended the establishment of an EU legislative framework for systemic and comprehensive adoption of LEIs across the EU by any organization involved in a financial transaction and to identify entities reporting financial information.</p>
<p>In context of the AML/CFT proposals, for those ‘obliged entities’ that want to surpass transparency goals, becoming a Validation Agent offers a vast array of business benefits. The Validation Agent role was created by GLEIF within the Global LEI System to simplify LEI issuance for clients and to deliver a variety of cost, efficiency and customer experience benefits for the Validation Agents organizations themselves. More information on the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agent role can be found on the GLEIF website</a>.   </p>
<p>How has the LEI Been Referenced Within the EC’s AML/CFT Legislative Package? </p>
<p>AML / CFT Regulation <br>
As defined in Article 1, this proposal lays down rules concerning: </p>
 
 Measures to be applied by obliged entities to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing;  
 Beneficial ownership transparency requirements for legal entities and arrangements;  
 Measures to limit the misues of bearer instruments.  
 
<p>Obliged entities are defined fully in Article 3 of the proposal, but include (with certain exceptions): credit institutions; financial institutions; and various natural and legal persons acting in a professional capacity, ranging from auditors, accountants and tax advisors to legal representatives involved in certain types of transactions, including property, precious metals and stones, gambling services, crypto-asset service providers and crowdfunding service providers. </p>
<p>Reference to the LEI is made in Article 18, which is titled ‘Identification and Verification of the Customer’s Identity’. The text makes clear that where available, an LEI should be obtained by obliged entities, in order to identify a legal entity customer. </p>
<p>Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds<br>
In a press release announcing the legislative package, the EC makes it clear that primary drivers for enhancements to the existing EU AML/CFT framework are “new and emerging challenges linked to technical innovation.” It names virtual currencies, more integrated financial flows in the Single Market and the global nature of terrorist organisations among these challenges. </p>
<p>The key focus of this Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds ensures that EU AML/ CFT rules are extended beyond their current remit, to fully apply to the crypto sector. This will ensure full traceability of crypto-asset transfers and allow the prevention and detection of their potential use for money laundering or terrorism financing. </p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the LEI has been referenced twice within the package of legislatory proposals. </p>
 
 In section (25), which outlines that transfers of funds or crypto-assets from the Union to outside the Union should carry complete information on the payer and payee, a new requirement has been introduced: “Complete information on the payer and the payee should include the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) when this information is provided by the payer to the payer’s service provider, since that would allow for better identification of the parties involved in a transfer of funds and could easily be included in existing payment message formats such as the one developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation for electronic data interchange between financial institutions.”  
 In a later section that outlines the obligations on the payment service provider of the payer, Article 4 of the Revision proposal sets out the requirements for information that must accompany transfers of funds. In the latest revision, a new requirement for the payer’s current LEI has been added, “subject to the existence of the necessary field in the relevant payments message format, and where provided by the payer to the payer’s payment service provider….”.

In such cases, these types of locations are best treated as facilities, with the GLN as main identifier.

     <p><a>GLNs are used to uniquely identify one party/location from another. As a result, a change or discontinuation to one GLN SHALL NOT require another GLN to be changed or have its use discontinued if nothing has been otherwise modified.</a></p> <p> Important: If a change occurs that may affect multiple GLNs, all impacted GLNs SHALL be assessed independently based on the GLN Management Rules. (e.g., merger or split) Other changes to GS1 Company Prefix or individual GS1 identification key licensing status SHALL be assessed based on GS1 General Specifications section 1.6 Allocation. GS1 Company Prefix or GS1 identification key licensees SHOULD refer to GS1 Member Organisations for details specific to their licences.</p> <p>Example 1:</p> <p>GS1 Garden Company dissolved their legal entity and then formed a new legal entity under a different framework. As a result, their legal entity GLN must change. A new GLN is allocated to the newly formed legal entity. All pre-existing GLNs that GS1 Garden Company had in use are reassociated to the new GLN identifying Dal Giardino as a legal entity. The pre-existing GLNs do not need to be discontinued or changed.</p> <p>Figure 2‑7 Update to GLN example 1</p> <p></p> <p>Example 2:</p> <p>A company has three GLNs allocated: GLN A identifies a legal entity, GLN B identifies a warehouse, and GLN C identifies an accounting department.</p> <p>The company makes a change which requires them to change GLN B. No changes occurred to the GS1 Company Prefix licensing. GLNs A and C remain the same because the modifications only impact GLN B.</p> <p>Figure 2‑8 Update to GLN example 2</p> <p></p>  <a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a>2.3.1 Impact to GLN extension component</a> <a> </a><p><a>GLN extension components only have meaning when associated to a GLN identifying a physical location. A GLN extension component SHALL only be used internally by an organisation or through mutual agreement between partners to identify a sub-location on or within the location of the GLN identifying the physical location. See section </a><a title="Go to 2.1.2.1">2.1.2.1</a> for details. Discontinuation of a GLN automatically discontinues the associated GLN extension component(s). When a sub-location associated to a discontinued GLN extension component needs to be identified within a new physical location, it would need to be allocated a new GLN or reassociated to a new GLN. </p> <p>Example:</p> <p>GLN H was discontinued as the result of a building remodel that modified the physical location. As a result, the GLN extension components that were associated to GLN H were also made inactive.

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of Trust Science?</p>



<p>Trust Science ® is a FinTech SaaS that delivers Credit Bureau 2.0 ® / Credit Bureau + ™. Its mission is to help deserving people get the loans they deserve.&nbsp;The service gives lenders highly accurate scores about underbanked and financially stressed borrowers in a fair, ethical and compliant way. This solution repairs the on-ramp to the modern credit economy, improving financial inclusivity while simultaneously boosting lender profitability.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Even in multi-billion dollar credit bureaus, data often crosses individuals, leading to frequent mix-ups and inaccurate credit reporting (i.e. lost opportunities for deserving borrowers or fraud committed by un-deserving people). With a trustworthy digital identity and interoperable digital credentials, lenders can ensure that individual data is correct and correctly attributed. As well, given the trends in Consumer Protection and Privacy laws, trustworthy identity is the first step toward returning control and consent to the use of personal data back to its rightful owners. Furthermore, in the rapidly emerging market of alternative credit underwriting, where Trust Science is a leader, digital identity enables new application processes, giving new-age credit bureaus fast and secure access to more data points for more accurate scoring. Trust Science believes that digital identity solutions will form the backbone of financially inclusive credit scoring and will be instrumental in a variety of other contexts.   </p>
 



 
<a href="https://www.trustscience.com"></a>



<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Interoperable digital credentials will transform all economies by significantly reducing cost and time for all forms of applications and sharing sensitive, verified information.&nbsp;Trust Science is designed to be a compliant service in all jurisdictions so that it can improve borrowing outcomes for global citizens and lenders. This is evidenced, in part, by a massive patent and trademark estate (comprising over 4 dozen patents, trademarks and pending patents across 18 different countries, and counting.) To support this transformation, Trust Science is pioneering the application of digital identity in the credit reporting industry. It is a Founding Steward of the Sovrin.org Identity network alongside industry heavyweights and it has now proudly joined DIACC. It will also provide services/consulting and its Smart Consent™ software to lenders and their borrowers to enable a transition to the use of digital credentials in loan applications, as digital wallets proliferate among consumers. As well, the company is working with regulatory bodies in both Canada (OSFI) and in the U.S. (RFI submission re: Explainable AI to 5 federal agencies in June 2021) to ensure that modern technology and its capabilities are fully understood and appreciated by all stakeholders, especially the topmost banking regulators.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada undisputedly has the technological capabilities and knowledge needed to be a global leader in digital identity and trust services. A strong supporter of digital identity standards, Trust Science is excited to be a part of that leadership, especially with the Canadian government’s “User-Centric Verifiable Digital Credentials” initiatives.</p>



<p>At a practical and real-world level, Canada shares the world’s longest border with the world’s biggest and most advanced economic and technological actor.&nbsp; It is incumbent on a partner in such a relationship to meet or beat best practices in all matters of identity and services (like money transfer) that rely on trust and KYC. Turning to the global space, Canada must continue to support domestically-driven innovations to maintain its position of leadership and continue to set the global pace&nbsp;of digital identity standards in the customary Canadian way: fair, ethical, and inclusive.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Trust Science joined DIACC to facilitate partnerships with other members that will further the adoption of emerging digital credential standards. The company believes that these partnerships will form the foundation of a strong Canadian ecosystem of digital identity companies and that all the different players’ collective&nbsp;experiences working on the cutting-edge of the tightly regulated lending industry will provide mutually valuable insights among each other.&nbsp; Trust Science looks forward to networking and collaborating with other DIACC members in a way that helps Canada maintain its reputation for having a very strong banking/lending sector and healthy financial (including Insurance industry) institutions.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Trust Science provides automated loan underwriting solutions leveraging traditional credit bureaus’ data, alternate data, and user-permissioned data. Given the risk associated with centrally stored personal data accessed during the loan application process, Trust Science aims to enable migration to decentralized digital credentials that will increase security and privacy while also significantly simplifying the application process. Put simply, Trust Science offers lending leaders a fair and ethical way of scoring financially stressed or under-banked customers, right now.</p>

	 Introduction to Me2B Relationships and Me2B Deals

<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#Me2BRelationship #Me2BDeal</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
There currently isn’t an adequate vocabulary to describe people’s experiences in the digital world, which impedes understanding and conversations around what’s actually happening, and what harms are lurking. The Me2B Alliance has developed a set of terms to help bridge this gap. Central to the vocabulary is the concept of Me2B Relationships, which are the relationships people (Me’s) have with purveyors of products or services (B’s), and the concept of Me2B Deals, which are exchanges of value between a person (Me’s) and a business (“B”).</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>In order to analyze and measure the behavior of connected technology, the Me2B Alliance has developed a way speak about our interactions in the digital world with specificity and nuance – a vocabulary that enables us to describe how we live and experience our lives in the digital world.</p>
<p>As described in Flash Guide #3, &nbsp;the Me2B Alliance’s ethical foundation, our Rules of Engagement, are based on the characteristics of healthy relationships and interactions. In our lives we experience several kinds of interpersonal relationships: with family, acquaintances, healthcare providers, guardians, colleagues, roommates, friends, business partner, romantic partner, spouse, ex-spouse, etc. Several of these relationships, like marriage, entail legal recognition and obligations. In addition, as part of our daily lives (especially in the US), we experience multiple instances of another kind of relationship – interactions with service providers, retailers, manufacturers, and the like. But what do we call these relationships?</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance proposes the term Me2B Relationship to cover all of the relationships between individuals (Me’s) and businesses (B’s) that are characterized by the presence of value exchange – I give you this, you give me that – also known as quid pro quo, Latin for “this for that.” &nbsp;Each individual value exchange is called a Me2B Deal.</p>
<p>Me2B Relationships and Deals take place in both the physical world and in the digital world, and there are some differences in the two planes of existence. This Flash Guide introduces the elements of Me2B Relationships&nbsp;and Deals as they occur&nbsp;“offline” – in the physical world. Flash Guide #5 will discuss how Me2B Relationships and agreements look online.</p>
<p>Me2B Relationships in the physical world occur most often with retailers, products and/or brands.&nbsp;People develop attitudes towards these products, brands, and companies on the basis of their interactions with them. Like interpersonal relationships, the quality of Me2B Relationships may change over time, as a person’s experience with the business, brand, or product changes. Finally, these relationships are layered – they may simultaneously involve attitudes towards a retailer, a brand that the retailer carries, and a specific product that the brand makes.</p>
<p>Let’s take a specific example. A typical “Me”, Mia, may really like shopping at Target (a “B”) – she has a Me2B Relationship with Target. She likes the product selection, the prices, and the customer service.&nbsp;Mia has&nbsp;an attitude&nbsp;regarding Target that’s formed by:</p>
 
 Her&nbsp;experiences over time buying, returning, and using stuff from Target. 
 What&nbsp;Mia&nbsp;reads or learns&nbsp;about Target from people in&nbsp;her&nbsp;life, or other news sources. 
 
<p>Me2B Relationships are often&nbsp;layered. Mia&nbsp;may purchase an OXO storage container set&nbsp;from Target, for instance. That transaction informs&nbsp;Mia’s&nbsp;opinion about Target (“Hmm, Target never puts OXO stuff on sale”).&nbsp;Simultaneously, it will affect Mia’s attitude toward the brand OXO (“They make really high quality, usable stuff; well worth the higher price”), and the specific storage container product (“I can really trust these containers to keep my food air-tight”). Mia now has Me2B Relationships with Target, OXO the brand, and the OXO storage containers. These are all “Me” to “B” relationships, but we refer to Mia’s relationship with the storage containers as a “Me-to-Product” or Me2P Relationship.</p>
<p>Like all the relationships in our lives, Me2B Relationships change over time.&nbsp;Mia’s ongoing use of the storage containers will inform&nbsp;her&nbsp;opinion about both OXO as a company and&nbsp;her&nbsp;opinion about the containers, themselves. Information&nbsp;Mia learns&nbsp;about OXO as a corporate citizen will also color&nbsp;her&nbsp;opinion about OXO.&nbsp;Mia’s opinion or attitude towards Target and OXO will change relative to her personal experiences with each.&nbsp;She&nbsp;may, for example, move far away from Target, or&nbsp;may find that&nbsp;she&nbsp;prefers&nbsp;a different store,&nbsp;or&nbsp;find a&nbsp;container&nbsp;brand that she likes better.</p>
<p>When Mia buys the containers from&nbsp;Target&nbsp;she’s performing a&nbsp;Me2B Deal, that is, she pays a certain amount of&nbsp;currency in exchange for the containers. These deals appear frequently in&nbsp;everyday life, and we each have our own personal “calculus” for what kind of deal is acceptable vs. unacceptable.&nbsp;When Mia goes to the corner deli at lunchtime, for instance, she pays $10 for a tuna salad sandwich, and that seems about right to her. Economists call this internal, private decision-making “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics">behavioral economics</a>”. The contextual nature of behavioral economics is at play, for instance, if Mia decides that $45 is acceptable for a reimbursed business meal, but not an everyday lunch.</p>
<p>Understanding the dynamics of Me2B Relationships and Me2B Deals in the physical world gives us an essential foundation necessary for describing and evaluating what happens in our online interactions.</p>

	 The Me2B Rules of Engagement: Our Ethical Foundation 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;July 27, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#EthicalTech #RespectfulTech</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
The Me2B Rules of Engagement translate the attributes of healthy interpersonal relationships into the types of respectiful and ethical behavior that technology can and should embody. Our eight Rules of Engagement are the product of years of discussion and analysis. They reflect how people like to be treated and serve as the core principles underlying the Me2B Respectful Tech Specification.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>In forming the Me2B Alliance, &nbsp;our very first step was to identify an ethical foundation – a concrete set of root principles to which each test in the Respectful Tech Specification traces back.</p>
<p>Me2B Alliance’s&nbsp;ethical north star, the Me2B Rules of Engagement,&nbsp;originally came out of&nbsp;two&nbsp;years of thinking and evaluation of a range of&nbsp;ethical frameworks. The conversation began at&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>&nbsp;in 2019,&nbsp;where&nbsp;the&nbsp;Me2B Alliance leadership&nbsp;had the first of several discussions&nbsp;around a&nbsp;“new social&nbsp;contract,”<a>[i]</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;existing ethical frameworks.&nbsp;Given the depth of the field of ethics, we&nbsp;definitely didn’t&nbsp;want to recreate the wheel.&nbsp;We also knew that privacy was too narrow a lens—that respectful behavior entailed more than privacy. In our analysis, we considered several&nbsp;frameworks over&nbsp;the span of many months, including:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights – Article 12</a> 
 <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">4th Amendment, US Constitution</a> 
 <a href="https://www.consumersinternational.org/who-we-are/consumer-rights">Consumer&nbsp;Rights</a> 
 <a href="https://moralfoundations.org/">Moral Foundations&nbsp;Theory</a> 
 <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/wlr/vol79/iss1/10/">Privacy as Contextual&nbsp;Integrity</a> 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_privacy_management_theory">Communication Privacy Management&nbsp;Theory</a> 
 <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/09/what-are-the-sustainable-development-goals/">WEF Sustainable Development&nbsp;Goals</a> 
 Social norms in the physical world 
 
<p>At the heart of our thinking was&nbsp;the idea that&nbsp;connected services&nbsp;are&nbsp;no longer just tools at our service. Instead,&nbsp;people are now&nbsp;having ongoing two-way dialogues—relationships&nbsp;—with connected technology. Because of this realization, we&nbsp;pivoted to looking toward inter-personal psychology, and specifically, the attributes of healthy interpersonal relationships. These attributes, we found, can be readily translated into behaviors that technology can and should embody.</p>
<p>Our resultant list is called the Me2B Rules of Engagement, and it should feel natural and intuitive, since the principles reflect how we generally like to be treated.</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 The Me2B Rules of Engagement<br>
 
 
 Freedom |&nbsp;We agree not to coerce or manipulate each other. 
 Respect of Boundaries |&nbsp;We agree to respect each other’s personal boundaries. 
 Respectful Defaults |&nbsp;In the absence of stated preferences, we default to the most conservative behavior. 
 Fairness &amp; Non-exploitation |&nbsp;We agree to treat each other fairly and not exploit things that are shared. 
 Good Communication |&nbsp;We agree to be forthright, honest and clear in our communication. 
 Promise-Keeping | We keep our promises. 
 Non-Harming |&nbsp;We agree not to willfully harm one another. 
 Respectful Dispute Resolution |&nbsp;We agree to respectful, collaborative and fair&nbsp;dispute resolution methods.

 With an initial pilot complete, we look ahead to what’s next for one of the world’s largest renewable energy&nbsp;markets <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/guy5aS3GvgA">ActionVance</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/guy5aS3GvgA">Unsplash</a><p>In the world of power grids, PJM Interconnection is a household name. It is a regional transmission operator (RTO) whose service territory spans a 13-state region in the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and Northeast region of the United States. It’s not huge by land area: as measured in square miles, all of PJM’s service territory could fit within the borders of France. But it is a massive electricity and renewable energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>PJM was the world’s largest competitive wholesale electricity market until the development of the European Integrated Energy Market in the 2000s. And it remains one of the world’s largest grid operators as a founding member of the GO15. On the renewable energy front, in 2020 PJM generated more renewable energy certificates (RECs) than the whole of Australia.</p><p>And so when we, Energy Web, kicked off a collaboration with <a href="https://www.pjm-eis.com/">PJM Environmental Information Services, Inc. </a>(PJM-EIS) — a subsidiary of PJM Interconnection — in late 2018, we were excited. That’s because PJM-EIS administers the Generation Attribute Tracking System (GATS), a platform for tracking and trading RECs in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>The focus of the collaboration was to build a blockchain-based pilot alongside PJM’s existing GATS system. Together, PJM-EIS and Energy Web wanted to explore the potential for bringing new functionality and benefits to GATS and evaluate how blockchain technology could be integrated into existing IT systems seamlessly and create value for PJM stakeholders.</p><p>Evaluating opportunities to modernize an existing U.S. REC&nbsp;platform</p><p>We set out to leverage the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS), an open-source tech stack of decentralized software and standards for the energy sector. More specifically, the pilot used <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a>, an open-source software development toolkit (SDK) for REC (and similar) tracking and trading platforms running on the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Energy Web Chain</a>, to create new functionality for the GATS Bulletin Board and assess the potential for decentralized technologies to support wider improvements to GATS beyond the Bulletin&nbsp;Board.</p><p>The Bulletin Board is a place on GATS where REC buyers and sellers can, respectively, post their bids and asks for specific REC volumes. Actually selling or buying those RECs remains the responsibility of the counterparties in bilateral agreements. We thought a blockchain-based solution could improve that experience and increase use of the Bulletin&nbsp;Board.</p><p>Historically, the Bulletin Board has been an underutilized feature available on GATS to facilitate trading of voluntary RECs. The central aim for this pilot was to test new functionality that could enhance the Bulletin Board as a means to grow the REC market in the PJM footprint while also improving security, increasing transparency, and reducing transaction costs for PJM stakeholders. In other words, this pilot assessed how improving the technical functionality and user experience of the Bulletin Board could remove market barriers and grow the local REC market — and possibly even attract greater REC imports from other U.S. REC&nbsp;markets.</p><p>The result: a pilot for the PJM-EIS version of GATS Bulletin Board with blockchain-based REC marketplace functionality that integrated with the existing&nbsp;GATS</p><p>This spring, five PJM subscribers tested the pilot GATS Bulletin Board. Seller participants posted asks on the Bulletin Board based on actual RECs in their respective GATS accounts and buyer participants posted their REC bids based on their procurement needs. Any matches made between bids and asks then triggered notifications for participants to confirm if they wanted to complete any REC transfers, where any completed trades would link back to the legacy GATS to update the buyer and seller’s respective accounts. For this pilot, the transactions were purely test transactions and so there was no financial settlement.</p><p>Here are some screenshots from the pilot GATS Bulletin Board to give a flavor of the updated user experience (shown from the perspective of a renewable energy&nbsp;buyer):</p>  Getting a view of the overall Bulletin Board market&nbsp;activity  <p>2. Starting the renewable energy procurement journey with various search filters to place&nbsp;bids</p><p>3. Identifying verified procurement options that match with&nbsp;bids</p><p>4. Viewing completed transactions and blockchain-based proof of each transaction</p><p>“We have learned a lot about what it would take to add new technical functionalities to GATS, how to integrate blockchain-based technologies ‘under the hood’ of GATS, and how PJM stakeholders support these improvements,” said Ken Schuyler, President of PJM-EIS. “We look forward to further understanding how we can use EW-DOS to support our overall digitization efforts.”</p><p>Energy Web Origin provided the back-end infrastructure for the marketplace functionality and use of a public blockchain — the Energy Web Chain — to digitize the RECs in GATS and anchor the proof of any REC transactions that occurred on the pilot Bulletin Board&nbsp;system.</p><p>Pilot feedback and next&nbsp;steps</p><p>In post-pilot interviews, pilot participants shared overall positive feedback about their experience, especially around the level of integration with GATS, and shared how they could successfully post bids and asks for RECs from their GATS accounts.</p><p>In the end, given how energy sector market participants typically adopt new technologies in phases (rather than in one fell swoop), this pilot illustrates that it is possible to integrate blockchain-based functionalities into existing IT systems to support wider digitization and tech modernization efforts.</p><p>Nevertheless, PJM-EIS and Energy Web experienced practical implementation challenges with the pilot. The core challenge revolved around how — while it’s possible to integrate new, blockchain-based tech with legacy IT systems — this integration process takes more time than designing and implementing an entirely new IT system from scratch. This is the main reason why the pilot took more time than initially expected to implement.</p><p>The pilot also raised bigger strategic questions that PJM-EIS will continue to evaluate as it explores next steps for technical upgrades to GATS in general and the Bulletin Board in particular. For example, this pilot showed that it is technically possible to integrate new technologies on a legacy system, but cannot answer the central question as to whether or not PJM-EIS wants to make the Bulletin Board an exchange where real REC purchases (and associated financial transactions) happen. In addition, the pilot did not assess the role of using new decentralized identifier technologies that make it possible to assign every energy device a unique digital identity anchored on a public blockchain so that a given device can plug into different PJM&nbsp;markets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/pjm-eis-update-modernizing-a-legacy-u-s-rec-tracking-system-with-blockchain-based-technology-db0ad5a4f924">PJM-EIS UPDATE: Modernizing a legacy U.S. REC tracking system with blockchain-based technology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Bárbara Villuendas. Digital Content Assistant de <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com">Cuatroochenta</a></p><p>Alastria ID es uno de los modelos referentes de identidad digital soberana en el que han colaborado empresas como Cuatroochenta a través de la firma 4TIC, a la que adquirió en 2020. El proyecto quiere que la ciudadanía y las empresas sean propietarias de sus datos personales y que tengan el control con todas las garantías de seguridad que aporta la tecnología blockchain.</p>Sistema de funcionamiento basado en la Identidad Digital Soberana. Foto: Cuatroochenta<p>Un negocio que quiera tener una cuenta corriente en una entidad bancaria ha de facilitar a la sucursal una copia del DNI del representante legal. Si la firma tiene cuentas en otras entidades, debe ofrecer esa copia a cada uno, redoblando trámites y riesgos de seguridad, ya que esa documentación se expone muchas más veces a un posible robo de información… Esto es lo que pasa hoy en día, pero imaginemos un escenario totalmente diferente. Un escenario en el que una empresa no tiene que ofrecer ningún documento físico ni electrónico, sino que simplemente permite al banco acceder a su número de DNI, a través de su cartera digital, es decir, su wallet. Este sistema serviría también, por ejemplo, para hacer los trámites para ser proveedor de un negocio o para licitaciones en administraciones públicas. Estamos hablando de la <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/blockchain-como-garantia-de-confianza-en-los-negocios/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">identidad digital soberana</a>, conocida por sus términos en inglés como self sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>La Comisión Europea ha presentado recientemente la identidad digital europea, sustentada en la SSI y en la <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/blockchain-como-garantia-de-confianza-en-los-negocios/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">tecnología blockchain</a>, que permite distribuir en una red el control de la información y validarla sin intermediarios.</p><p>Con este sistema, la ciudadanía y los negocios pasan a ser los propietarios de la identidad digital y, por tanto, de las credenciales que la conforman. Y ¿qué se entiende por credencial? Cualquier dato que identifica a una persona o empresa. Puede ser, por ejemplo, el número de DNI o NIF, el carnet de conducir, un título universitario o una aptitud profesional. Imaginemos el supuesto de una persona que debe acreditar que es mayor de edad. Con este sistema no es necesario que aporte el DNI con todos los datos personales que recoge, sino una <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">credencial verificable (VC)</a> en que una administración confirma esa mayoría de edad preservando la privacidad de los&nbsp;datos.</p><p>Es un giro y un cambio de paradigma hacia un <a href="https://elpais.com/retina/2017/06/05/tendencias/1496646930_763686.html">modelo descentralizado</a>. La Unión Europea con su <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_es">proyecto de identidad digital</a> quiere evitar que las personas cedamos y regalemos sin darnos cuenta datos a las grandes tecnológicas. En los últimos años se han implementado en toda Europa diversas iniciativas con la vista puesta en los usos de la SSI. En España uno de estos proyectos es el que ha desarrollado el consorcio multidisciplinar <a href="https://alastria.io/">Alastria</a>, del que es socio Cuatroochenta de forma colaborativa entre más de 200 miembros <a href="https://alastria.io/id-alastria/">Alastria ID</a>, un modelo técnico de identidad digital basado en los estándares internacionales y que quiere aprovechar las <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/tendencias-tecnologicas-que-marcaran-2021/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">capacidades de blockchain</a> y de la&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>Si quieres conocer cómo se construye la identidad digital, los beneficios de la SSI y las características del modelo Alastria ID puedes leer el <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/los-cimientos-de-la-identidad-digital-sobre-blockchain/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">artículo completo</a>.</p>

 Some Overviews 

<p>Blockchain Commons is getting big, so we produced some overviews of our work!</p>

<p>Video Overview. Over the last few years, Blockchain Commons has produced a number of specifications, including our fundamental work on Uniform Resources (URs), our other innovations such as Lifehashes and Object Identity Blocks, and our updates of sharding technology with SSKR. If you’re trying to get a handle on the technologies we’re using and the specifications that we’re creating with our Airgapped community, we invite you to take a look at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a>, which runs through our core conceptual and specification work one element at a time.</p>



  
<p><br></p>

<p>The Gordian Principles. We’ve also begun publishing some descriptions of what the Gordian architecture means to us. It’s focused on four principals that we believe are crucial to digital-asset management: independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. They’re all about ensuring that you’re the controller of your digital assets. Besides writing a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">short overview</a>, we’ve also begun adding descriptions to each of our reference apps, discussing how they embody those principles.</p>

<p>And, those reference apps were our biggest news for the quarter …</p>

 Reference App Work 

<p>Our reference apps show off how Blockchain Commons’ Gordian Principles work in real life. We made great progress on them this quarter.</p>

<p>Gordian Releases. Where we had three reference apps available for beta testing in Q1, in Q2 we advanced to having two available for release from Apple.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool is the app previously known as Gordian Guardian.
It allows for the management of your cryptographic seeds in a way that’s secure and resilient. You store your seeds in Seed Tool, ensuring that the data is encrypted and that it’s redundantly backed up to iCloud, and then you derive and export keys as they’re needed. As with all of the Gordian reference apps, this one demonstrates the usage of a number of Blockchain Common’s specifications, including SSKRs, UR, and even our new <code>request/response</code> airgap methodology that we just <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">debuted</a> this February.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
Gordian QR Tool is a simpler tool that similarly allows for the storage of QR codes in a secure and resilient way. Thus, if you had a largely unused seed or key, you could export it as a QR and store it here. QR Tool can also be used to store other private information such as 2FA seeds or the brand-new Smart Health Cards. QR Tool recognizes many categories of QR codes, including the UR types that Blockchain Commons has defined, allowing easy categorization and sorting of your cryptographic data. Our QR Tool was slightly held back by inadequacies we found in Apple’s QR creation functions, which can produce overly large QRs. We’ve already begun work <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/QRCodeGenerator">translating a better QR library into Swift</a> and expect to integrate that into v1.1 of QR Tool in the future.</p>

<p>QR Tool and Seed Tool also offer the first demonstration of the interactions possible in a Gordian architecture. One of the most powerful examples involves Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">SSKR specification</a>. Seed Tools allows a user to not only shard a seed using SSKR, but also to encode those shares as QR codes. The encoded shares can then be given to friends and family who have QR Tool, ensuring the safe storage of all the shares required to restore your seed!</p>

<p>We have more reference app releases planned for the future. Gordian Cosigner remains available as a Testflight beta release, and is our reference app for demonstrating how to conduct airgapped signing. We are also beginning work on the Gordian Recovery app, which we announced last quarter; it’ll demonstrate methodologies for recovering assets held by third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Sweeptool Debut. Recovering funds held in a third-party HD wallet can be tricky since you don’t always know which addresses were actually used. We’ve also been attacking that problem with a command-line tool called <code>sweeptool</code>, which sweeps funds  anywhere in the hierarchy defined by a descriptor. Sweeptool is the work of one of our intern graduates, and is already available as an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/sweeptool-cli">alpha release</a>.</p>

<p>Timelock Experiments. Our current architecture for #SmartCustody depends on multisigs to allow for the partitioning of keys and the creation of resilience. However, we’re already thinking about the next generation of #SmartCustody, which will allow the use of timelocks to recover funds in the case of the incapacitation of a principal. We did some deeper investigation into miniscript this quarter, which allows for easier integration of timelocks into Bitcoin addresses, and also mapped out some new architectures for progressively sweeping funds forward to keep ahead of timelocks. However, we discovered that at this point miniscript isn’t yet integrated with the descriptor-wallets that are another of the core elements of the Gordian architecture. This prevents integration with our Gordian apps.</p>

<p>We’ve published a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">preliminary paper</a> on the usage of Timelocks, but it isn’t finalized yet because of these issues. Meanwhile, one of our interns has begun work on a Rust-based Timelock project called <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli</a>. This work is all meant to ensure we’re ready when miniscript is added to Bitcoin Core, or when timelocks are integrated into descriptors in some other manner.</p>

 Coding Processes 

<p>Releasing apps is just one step of a larger coding process, which requires careful consideration of what languages (and libraries) to use and careful reviewing of their security.</p>

<p>Rust Focus. Sweeptool is written in Rust, which is an increasing focus at Blockchain Commons. We’ve also been using it for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign-cli work</a> and some of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap">torgap work</a> and have touched upon it in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/18_5_Accessing_Bitcoind_with_Rust.md">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a>. We think that Rust is an important language for the future of Bitcoin development in large part because of its safety guarantee, including <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/">memory safety properties, which can resolve 70% of security problems</a>. Our main barrier for wider use of Rust has been the fact that C and C++ are the main languages used by Bitcoin Core, iOS, and Android, but we’ve already seen the start of changes there, and hope to be able to integrate Rust even more fully in the future. The fact that the Rust-based <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/">Bitcoin Dev Kit</a> is actually in advance of Bitcoin Core in some features is very encouraging.</p>

<p>Security Review. Bitmark, one of our Sustaining Sponsors, has hired <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> to conduct a security review of our SSKR libraries, <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a>. This is crucial element in making Blockchain Commons’ specification work widely available, since it would be improper for us to review our own security code. As our first partners planning to use one of our libraries in a shipping project, as opposed to just our specifications, Bitmark is stepping up to the plate to fund the review of our core SSKR libraries. We expect this pattern to repeat with future partners and libraries in the future. It shows the power of our open libraries: future companies will be able to depend on our SSKR libraries thanks to Bitmark’s contribution, and then they’ll be able to make contributions of their own that will be much less than if they’d had to security review an entire suite of  themselves.</p>

 New Docs 

<p>The blockchain infrastructure is empowered by users and developers who know how to use it properly. Teaching them is the goal of our documentation projects.</p>

<p>UR &amp; SSKR Docs. The ultimate purpose of our reference applications is to demonstrate how our new specifications can be used in actual applications. Hand-in-hand with that, we’re also producing documentation that lays out in more detail how those specifications work. We’ve begun collecting many of those docs in the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/tree/master/Docs">documents area of our crypto-commons repo</a>. This quarter we added to our docs repo with several documents about our Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction system, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-users.md">SSKR for Users</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-developers.md">SSKR for Developers</a>. We also released a series of articles on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources (URs)</a> intended to show developers how they’re constructed and used.</p>

<p>We are also planning further support for our interoperable specifications such as UR and SSKR at a virtual interoperable wallet specification workshop. We’re currently working on locking down a date.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our best-known tutorial at Blockchain Commons, is our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a>, which we pushed to v2.0 last year and which has 1,700 stars and 100 watchers on Github. We’re thrilled that translations are now ongoing into both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a> thanks to a half-dozen core volunteers. Some of Blockchain Commons’ own programmers and interns entered the blockchain industry thanks to this course, so we’re looking forward to these translations opening the doors even wider.</p>

 Other Priorities 

<p>Finally, we have a lot of more varied projects that all saw some progress.</p>

<p>Our Summer Interns Have Begun Work. Thanks to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/human-rights-foundation-grants-bitcoin-defi-education-activism">a grant from the Human Rights Foundation</a>, we have a class of a dozen interns this summer. We’re engaging them with weekly calls to introduce them to crucial use cases and to let them talk with Bitcoin and Lightning experts from the industry and human-rights experts, most recently including John Callas from the EFF and Alex Gladstein from HRF.</p>

<p>Some of our human-rights-focused intern projects include a self-sovereign donation app, scripts to automate the setup of privacy and/or bitcoin services, documents on managing pseudonymity, and tracking of blockchain-based legislation.</p>

<p>Some of our more general intern projects include deployment of a full Esplora node for Blockchain Commons, the creation of scripts to make it easier for others to do so, documentation on bitcoin fee-estimation use cases, improvements to our Spotbit server including expansion of the Spotbit API and client app, and the aformentioned work on Mori and on Learning Bitcoin translations.</p>

<p>Our first completed intern ‘21 work is a short <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/15_0_Using_i2p.md">i2p chapter</a> for Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line, talking about an alternative (or supplement) to traditional Tor privacy.</p>

<p>Wyoming Testimony. Christopher’s testimony has continued in Wyoming, talking about DAO and identity, to improve and extend both laws. The most recent testimony <a href="https://youtu.be/ayQ086BVDXE?t=4060">on May 28</a> continued to work through the ramifications of the definitions of principal authority for self-sovereign identity.</p>




<p><br></p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity. Speaking of which, it was the fifth anniversary of the concept of self-sovereign identity, which first suggested that we should control our identities on the internet, not be beholden to centralized agencies. Christopher <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">wrote an article</a> for Coindesk celebrating that anniversary, talking about how far we’ve come and reflecting on how things could be improved.</p>

<p>BTCR. Finally, we’ve also been talking about another of our blockchain projects that originated in <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>: BTCR, a self-sovereign decentralized identifier that uses the Bitcoin blockchain. Recently Christopher and the other creators of BTCR talked with <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids">The Rubric</a> about the past and future of the DID.</p>

<p>As you can see, we’ve got lots of ongoing work that continue to expand the ideas of responsible key management and self-determination on the internet. If you’d like to support our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can continue to design new specifications, architectures, reference applications, and reference libraries to be used by the whole community, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a>. You can alternatively make a <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">one-time bitcoin donation</a> at our BTCPay.</p>

 Five Years of Assembly: Interdisciplinary fellowship offers paths forward in public interest technology <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/zenzele-best">Zenzele&nbsp;Best</a></p>Assembly Program logo, Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;&nbsp;Society<p>Between 2017 and 2021, the <a href="http://bkmla.org/">Assembly</a> Program at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> (BKC) at Harvard University brought together almost 150 professionals, experts, and students to better understand and develop solutions to some of the most intractable issues in technology policy. Led by Professor <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a> and supported by faculty, staff, and experts from across the University and the Center, the program explored topics in digital security, artificial intelligence (AI), and disinformation; produced a variety of prototypes and projects; and fostered a community that spanned across sectors and disciplines.</p><p>“Being academic isn’t, at its core, about credentials or paper-writing for its own sake,” said Zittrain. “It’s about approaching problems with humility, energy, and an open mind, attacking those problems rigorously, and reviewing whether one is even asking the right questions. Assembly was begun on the theory that people outside academia, from across disciplines and sectors, would be eager to take on problems that way, and with the overall public interest in mind, rather than the interests of one player in a larger ecosystem. We found an extraordinary number of people willing to engage in that&nbsp;spirit.”</p><p>Over five years, Assembly grew from a pilot project that brought together professionals from across sectors to a multi-pronged, interdisciplinary fellowship program that developed innovative approaches and cross-sectoral collaborations focused on the public interest. In 2019, Assembly expanded to include two additional tracks, the <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/forum-about">Forum</a> and <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/studentfellowship-2021about">Student Fellowship</a>, which convened senior leaders and Harvard students, respectively, to discuss the spread of disinformation on online platforms. In 2021 — the program’s fifth and final year — the Assembly Fellowship invited ongoing alumni project teams to return (virtually) to BKC to support their work and celebrate their continued success.</p><p>“Our initial goal with Assembly was to combine the real-world expertise of people in industry with the socially-motivated nature of academia,” said <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jordi-weinstock">Jordi Weinstock</a>, one of the founders of the Assembly Program. “From day one of the pilot year, we had no idea whether any of the projects would develop beyond a nascent stage, or even if that was a necessity. Instead, we worked to create a lasting community within the cohort, one that would continue to bring positive change for the world long after their program ended. Through the years, both the thematic focus and the people involved would change, but consistent throughout has been the strength of the Assembly community. To me, it is both a bonus and a testament to our Assemblers and staff that many projects did, in fact, flourish.”</p> Over twenty prototypes explore solutions to complex tech policy questions <p>How can we build AI systems to serve the public interest and not perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities? How can we improve security vulnerabilities among “<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot">Internet of Things</a>” (IoT) devices? Who should be held accountable for the spread of disinformation on social media platforms? How do we govern cyberspace across international borders?</p><p>Five years of Assembly projects have sought to make progress on complex, whole-of-society questions like these. Created as a model to help solve some of society’s most pressing issues around technologies, the program brought together a community of professionals from around the world to leverage their expertise across disciplines and actively collaborate on provocations and prototypes in the public interest.</p><p>Incoming fellowship cohorts convened at Harvard to meet each other, identify problem spaces and form project teams, and participate in programming in-residence before working asynchronously on their projects for the remainder of the four-month development period. Each cohort was supported by an expert Advisory Board of faculty and practitioners with expertise across the range of topics fellows explored. Between 2017 and 2020, four Assembly Fellowship cohorts developed twenty-one projects that aim to offer paths forward on complex challenges in the digital public sphere. As <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/hilary-ross">Hilary Ross</a>, Assembly’s program manager, put it, “Assembly created a space for people from across disciplines to come together around complex technology and policy problems, problems that at times feel intractable and really require effort from across all sectors. Through programming and projects, fellows got to both better understand those problems from varied perspectives, and collectively find paths forward and demonstrate possibilities.”</p> 2017 <p>Assembly’s pilot year in 2017 focused on the challenge of digital security and sought to answer a central question: how do we move beyond a world where virtually every computing device and network is insecure? Over four months, the sixteen professionals that comprised the <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2017people">cohort</a> explored the complex interaction between Internet governance organizations and sovereign states, the tension between the ease of disseminating information online and the interest of copyright holders, privacy advocates, and other stakeholders, and the roles of intermediaries and platforms in shaping what people can and cannot do online. The first year of Assembly produced five <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2017projects">projects</a> aimed at addressing these challenges, including: <a href="https://cleaninsights.org/">Clean Insights</a>, a privacy-oriented analytics tool and <a href="https://berkmancenter.github.io/datatransparency/">Information Fiduciaries and Data Transparency</a>, a prototype of a visualization tool that would enable companies to better document their collection and use of consumer&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“[Assembly] provided an opportunity for participants to pop out of their usual bubbles of collaborators, to connect with committed thinkers, scholars, experts, advocates and hackers from a diverse set of contexts and experiences. Whether participating on a project or reviewing the teams’ work as [an advisor], I benefited deeply from the exposure to smart people, working collectively, to find novel approaches to difficult challenges.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nfreitas">Nathan Freitas</a>, 2017 and 2021 Assembly Fellow, 2020 Assembly&nbsp;Advisor</blockquote> 2018–2019 <p>The <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2018about">2018</a> and <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2019about">2019</a> Assembly cohorts focused on the ethics and governance of artificial intelligence. AI technology has become increasingly sophisticated over the past decade, driving innovations in industries from <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/373927">healthcare</a> to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-next-car-may-anticipate-your-needsand-let-you-add-features-on-the-fly-11625684411">travel</a> to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/05/18/10-ways-ai-is-improving-manufacturing-in-2020/?sh=10729b5f1e85">manufacturing</a> and becoming a feature in many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/12/16/the-10-best-examples-of-how-ai-is-already-used-in-our-everyday-life/?sh=35a9e66a1171">homes</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-smartphones-artificial-intelligence-features-phones-2018-1">smartphones</a>, and <a href="https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/backgrounders/ai-and-personal-vehicles">vehicles</a>. However, as AI becomes even more ubiquitous, these advances have raised new questions: how do we prevent, detect, and mitigate bias in AI systems? What factors should municipal governments consider before deciding whether to implement AI technology in a city space? What are the risks of pursuing surveillance-related AI work, and how do we mitigate them? Between 2018 and 2019, the Assembly Fellowship developed ten frameworks, tools, and other projects aimed at addressing these challenges, including <a href="https://aiblindspot.media.mit.edu/">AI Blindspot</a>, a framework for identifying and mitigating bias in AI systems and the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a>, a tool that improves the accuracy and fairness of algorithms by helping practitioners better assess datasets.</p><blockquote>“The [Assembly Fellowship]…gave me an opportunity to experiment: I wore many hats, performed many roles, and ultimately learned more about myself and what I am good at and what I want to do. In a world that pushes us to excel rather than to explore, I really appreciated the space to try things I never thought I’d do — from writing a TV pilot to building interactive data visualizations to reading hundreds of military RFPs — and being given the support to try.” — <a href="https://bcavello.com/">B Cavello</a>, 2019 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</blockquote> 2020 <p>In 2019, BKC launched Assembly: Disinformation, which built on the success of both the previous three iterations of the Assembly Fellowship and other programs at the Center. The 2016 United States general election vaulted online disinformation — and its real world ramifications — into the national discourse. In the aftermath of the election, the program sought to make progress on important questions about the United States’ vulnerability for foreign influence operations, the importance of digital literacy, and the role of social media companies in disseminating and amplifying false information. The 2020 <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2020">cohort</a> developed <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2020projects">projects</a> that included <a href="https://medium.com/@Assembly_Program/semaphore-a-tool-to-flag-online-disinformation-3a71f522eae0">Semaphore</a>, a prototype of a tool to help users publicly flag false information on platforms, <a href="https://datavoids.2020.bkmla.org/#Part1">Into the Voids</a>, a framework for evaluating <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/">data voids</a> and the harms they pose, and <a href="https://disinfodex.org/">Disinfodex</a>, a database that indexes publicly available information about disinformation campaigns.</p><blockquote>“Outside of academia, it is so rare to be able to explore a complicated societal challenge like disinformation in a completely unconstrained way, and even rarer to actually produce a final project addressing that issue. The long-lasting relationships formed with my teammates and cohort from working on these projects will be something I take away long after the conclusion of Assembly.” — <a href="http://jennyfan.com/about">Jenny Fan</a>, 2020 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</blockquote> 2021 <p>In its capstone year in 2021, Assembly invited back five independently continuing alumni projects: <a href="https://aiblindspot.media.mit.edu/">AI Blindspot</a>, <a href="https://cleaninsights.org/">Clean Insights</a>, the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a>, <a href="https://disinfodex.org/">Disinfodex</a>, and <a href="http://cloakpixel.com/">Cloak &amp; Pixel</a> (an evolution of the <a href="https://equalais.media.mit.edu/">equalAIs</a> project, developed by Assembly fellows in 2018). The projects address the variety of challenges that the Fellowship explored since 2017: how can companies better balance user privacy and product development? How can we improve the accuracy and fairness of algorithms to help practitioners better assess the viability of datasets? How can we better track and understand influence operations on online platforms? Through this final year of the program, the cohort learned from each other, developed new iterations of their tools, and reached new audiences. Watch the cohort’s final showcase and learn more about the teams’ work&nbsp;<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/assembly-project-fellowship-showcase">here</a>.</p> Alumni community continues to integrate new approaches to responsible technology <blockquote>“Assembly was the most interesting collection of people I’ve ever met working on some of the hardest, most important problems on the internet. One unexpected gift I got from the program was a good look at the lots of different ways to change things: there are techniques and career paths I’d never have thought about [on my own]. Through the program, I met so many tremendous folks, and I now see so much more potential.” — John Hess, 2017 and 2020 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</blockquote><p>The Assembly Fellowship, one of three of the program’s core tracks, offered a model in which professionals from across sectors could learn from, challenge, and collaborate with each other. Its impact was twofold: while Assembly produced a number of public interest-focused prototypes, frameworks, and other projects, the Fellowship’s most lasting impact might be the people that comprise its community. The Assembly Fellowship helped to shape the way its alumni think about the intersection of technology and society: since their time in the program, alumni have pursued new career paths, continued to develop their Assembly projects, and used the tools and perspectives they gained as fellows to integrate new approaches to responsible technology.</p><p>Below are some stories from former Assembly Fellows about their experience in the program and its&nbsp;impact:</p><p>“As a practitioner working at the crux of democracy and technology for over a decade, Assembly was an opportunity to connect with the latest thinking about the challenges and solutions to how technology impacts people’s lives. The program offered a space to both reflect and learn, while at the same time contributing to developing practical tools and approaches that address some of the toughest challenges we face in data-driven societies… Being part of an interdisciplinary team expanded my interest in providing a useful bridge between advancing the intellectual frontiers of how data-centric technologies impact society and translating that knowledge into action by policymakers, technologists, and civil society. This has led to an exciting new path in my career as Managing Director at Data &amp; Society, working with our research and engagement teams to shift the focus onto the people most impacted by technological change.” — <a href="https://datasociety.net/people/calderon-ania/">Ania Calderon</a>, 2019 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“I was grateful that Assembly brought together people who might not have otherwise found each other…[my cohort was comprised of] a bunch of brilliant thinkers and doers who may have shared values, but certainly had different approaches and backgrounds that ultimately informed our work together. Working with activists and academics, corporate professionals and service members, and creatives and educators broadened my worldview and helped me realize that I have allies in more places than I would have thought. The fellowship also gave me an opportunity to experiment: I wore many hats, performed many roles, and ultimately learned more about myself and what I am good at and what I want to do. In a world that pushes us to excel rather than to explore, I really appreciated the space to try things I never thought I’d do — from writing a TV pilot to building interactive data visualizations to reading hundreds of military RFPs — and being given the support to try.” — <a href="https://bcavello.com/">B Cavello</a>, 2019 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“As someone working in industry, it’s almost impossible to get dedicated time to think through really challenging issues. I applied to Assembly because the fellowship gave me exactly that: a chunk of time to dig into the complexities around the ethics and governance of AI. Through Assembly, I met a truly inspirational community of people who were interested in the same questions I was asking, but coming from all sorts of backgrounds. Together, we launched a research group that continues to this day — the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a> (DNP), which builds ‘nutritional labels’ for datasets meant to increase overall awareness and health of datasets being used to build algorithmic systems. DNP, and the amazing support from the Assembly program and community since, has really changed the trajectory of my own career. I am much more aware of and focused on addressing issues of inequality in algorithmic systems, and I now bring that to everything I do during my daily work — from building COVID analytics frameworks to assessing the quality of humanitarian datasets.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kasia-chmielinski">Kasia Chmielinski</a>, 2018 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“Assembly, for me, achieved the delicate balance between the often slow, deeply considered pace of academia and the less thoughtful ‘move fast and break things’ mentality common in the tech industry. It provided an opportunity for participants to pop out of their usual bubbles of collaborators, to connect with committed thinkers, scholars, experts, advocates and hackers from a diverse set of contexts and experiences. Whether participating on a project or reviewing the teams’ work as [an advisor], I benefited deeply from the exposure to smart people, working collectively, to find novel approaches to difficult challenges. In addition, the access to and feedback of accomplished mentors and advisors was a critical aspect of the program, one that helped [project teams] reconsider, rethink, or more fully commit to a particular direction…In my case, I was fortunate to have Assembly be a place where a seed of an idea was germinated into a fully blossoming independent, grant-funded endeavor. Through our project [<a href="https://cleaninsights.org/">Clean Insights</a>], the Assembly Fellowship will have a lasting impact on data privacy, security and sovereignty for real people around the world.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nfreitas">Nathan Freitas</a>, 2020 Assembly Advisor, 2017 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“As a fellow, a member of the advisory board, and a member of the staff team, Assembly has been the most meaningful, impactful, and inspiring program I have been involved with in my more than seven years at Harvard: the support, the community, the ideas and their impact in the world are all things I expect to benefit and learn from throughout the remainder of my career. Launching and continuing to work with the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a> has been a consistent source of inspiration for me. So impressed by (and grateful for!) the reach and breadth of this program.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/snewman">Sarah Newman</a>, 2020 Assembly Advisor, 2018 and 2021 Assembly Fellow, and 2019–21 Assembly&nbsp;staff</p><p>Over five years, the Assembly Fellowship brought together nearly 80 journalists, engineers, policymakers, designers, and other practitioners all deeply committed to the public interest. As the program draws to a close, BKC will continue to carry forward Assembly’s models, lessons, and approaches through the Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/institute-rebooting-social-media">Rebooting Social Media Institute</a> and other programs and initiatives.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/five-years-of-assembly-e52809c41749">Five Years of Assembly</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

So what is special about children’s data, and why did we choose to focus on children in particular?</p><p>Children’s rights are afforded extra protections under international human rights laws such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and data processing impacts on virtually all areas of children’s rights to some degree. States, companies and guardians have a duty under existing international human rights laws to prevent children’s personal information and data from being used to exploit them or violate their freedoms. The main difference between general data governance and children’s data governance is the presumption that children cannot effectively advance and advocate on behalf of their own interests because of their age and capacity. That is why we believe that children’s data merit special protection and a distinct consideration in international, regional and national governance regimes.</p><p>Privacy and protection of children’s information and identities are particularly important as they grow and experiment by making different choices and exploring different preferences, and as they develop their personalities. Children need to be afforded the agency to define who they are for themselves, without having their future pathways predetermined or their learning styles unduly narrowed down by algorithms.</p><p>Governance of children’s data also presents some challenging questions in relation to consent and children’s agency over their own data. Children, depending on their age, may be less suited than adults to provide meaningful consent for their data collection and use. This is because children are often less able than adults to make mature decisions on data use that may impact their future in ways that are difficult even for adults to understand. This problem is compounded by a general lack of transparency in relation to how data is used by technology companies — it is rare to see terms and conditions of data collection explained in child-friendly language or translated into minority languages. Generally there is already a power imbalance between the public and governments, companies, or other institutions that process their data, and children are in an especially vulnerable position within these relationships.</p><p>On the flip side, we also wanted to focus on children’s data because we are excited about the potential for its use for good. We know that children’s data can support research, development and provisions of services, and poor data governance can lead to a loss of potential benefits for children. In an increasingly data-driven global economy good data governance for children is essential for children, for development, and for business.</p>Festusminja, via Wikimedia Commons What does good data governance for children look like, and how do we get&nbsp;there? <p>The working group members wrote a series of background papers that informed the manifesto, covering <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/state-surveillance-and-implications-children">state surveillance and the implications for children</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/data-governance-young-people-commercialized-digital-environment">young people in the commercialized digital environment</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/covid-19-spotlight-child-data-governance-gaps">data governance gaps in light of Covid-19</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/responsible-group-data-children">responsible group data for children</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/childrens-rights-design-new-standard-data-use-tech-companies">children’s rights by design</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/governance-student-data">governance of student data</a>, and exploration of <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/fiduciary-approach-child-data-governance">a fiduciary approach to child data governance</a>.</p><p>As part of tackling the question of what good data governance for children looks like, the working group took the manifesto through a series of regional workshops in the US, Europe, Asia, and Africa, which helped to flesh out ten key action&nbsp;points:</p><p>1. PROTECT children and their rights through child-centered data governance. Such data governance should adhere to internationally agreed standards that minimize the use of surveillance and algorithms for profiling children’s behavior.</p><p>2. PRIORITIZE children’s best interests in all decisions about children’s data. Governments and companies should give priority to children’s rights in their data collection and processing and storage practices.</p><p>3. CONSIDER children’s unique identities, evolving capacities and circumstances in data governance frameworks. Every child is different, and children mature as they get older, so data governance regulations must be flexible. Marginalized children must never be left&nbsp;behind.</p><p>4. SHIFT responsibility for data protection from children to companies and governments. Extend the protection measures to all children below the age of 18, regardless of the age of&nbsp;consent.</p><p>5. COLLABORATE with children and their communities in policy building and management of their data. Through distributed models of data governance, children and their communities should have more say in how data is processed, by whom it can be processed, and with whom it can be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>6. REPRESENT children’s interests within administrative and judicial processes, as well as redress mechanisms. It is imperative that children’s rights are integrated into existing mechanisms, such as the work of data protection authorities.</p><p>7. PROVIDE adequate resources to implement child-inclusive data governance frameworks. Data protection authorities and technology companies must employ staff who understand children’s rights, and governments should allocate funding for regulatory oversight.</p><p>8. USE policy innovation in data governance to solve complex problems and accelerate results for children. Policy innovation can help public authorities to make the most of data, while at the same time safeguarding children’s rights.</p><p>9. BRIDGE knowledge gaps in the realm of data governance for children. There are some urgent knowledge gaps that need further research to ensure that data governance regulations are evidence-based.</p><p>10. STRENGTHEN international collaboration for children’s data governance and promote knowledge and policy transfer among countries. This Manifesto calls for greater global coordination on law and policy. Uncoordinated national-level data governance laws can lead to competing assertions of jurisdiction and conflict.</p><p>At the time of writing, increased efforts are being made to regulate the technology sector in all regions. At the same time, promising local and national initiatives are exploring ways to manage data in the public interest. A key takeaway from this manifesto is that children’s rights need to be front and centre of all of these new data governance initiatives, rather than being side-lined. This is increasingly important in a world in which children’s data cannot always easily be distinguished from adult’s data, and children are often impacted by data processing even when they are not the primary intended users of a digital platform or&nbsp;service.</p><p>You can read the full manifesto <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/good-governance-childrens-data">here</a>, which contains rich information about many of the child rights issues impacted by data processing and elaborates on the ten action points listed&nbsp;above.</p><p>Watch Urs Gasser, former Executive Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society — Harvard University; Jasmina Byrne, Chief of Policy, Office of Global Insight and Policy — UNICEF; and Emma Day, UNICEF Consultant, discussing the manifesto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g309A5Gd2_s">here</a> with a panel of&nbsp;experts:</p>  Julie Brill, Chief Privacy Officer, Corporate Vice President, and Deputy General Counsel of Global Privacy and Regulatory Affairs — Microsoft;  Dorothy Gordon, Chair of the Inter-Governmental Council of the UNESCO Information For All Programme; and  Riita Vanska, Specialist in the IHAN (Human-Driven Data Economy) Project — SITRA.  <p>For further information contact Jasmina Byrne: <a href="mailto:jbyrne@unicef.org">jbyrne@unicef.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-all-data-governance-needs-to-consider-childrens-rights-8b218a825a08">Why all data governance needs to consider children’s rights</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation announced recently a new mechanism for rewarding and funding work in the common interest of its membership, the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/introducing-dif-grants/">DIF Grants Program</a>. The Steering Committee ratified an addendum defining these collaborations between a specific DIF working group and a grant sponsor, and this shiny new tool sits ready to be debuted in the toolkit available to DIF community work. &nbsp;DIF's work is leveling up with this new mechanism for transparently funding work that supports DIF's mission and benefits the membership as a whole.</p><p>The first such grant was initiated by Microsoft, which has a long history of collaborations in DIF. Of the various modalities described by the grant program, The Claims and Credentials Working Group will be overseeing a new work item open to all DIF members that creates and harden a JWS test suite, with this grant funding a lead editor to drive the work and keep it to a pre-determined timeline, paid upon stable and complete release. </p>Photo by Natasya Chen History <p>Pamela Dingle, co-chair of the Interoperability WG, identified a recurring theme in conversations about interoperability across the great "JSON"/"JSON-LD" divide: while considerable cross-vendor, cross-stack alignment had happened over the last years to address many other aspects of credential exchange and identifier resolution, "translation issues" and varying interpretations of the JSON sections of the VC data model specification lead to divergent ways of structuring, defining, signing, and parsing VCs in JWT form. &nbsp;The kinds of signature suite definitions that define Linked Data Proofs made strange bedfellows with the in-built mechanisms of JWT, which were hardened and commoditized earlier. &nbsp;This results in a slightly "balkanized" landscape of VC-JWTs that make different concessions to the expectations of JSON-LD-native parsers and systems.</p><p>Initially, the idea of iterating one or more foundational specifications seemed a natural solution: a few key sections of any specification could be made more explicit, more normative, or less ambiguous. But just as the plural of anecdote is not data, so too is the plural of specifications not disambiguation. Another tack was chosen: implementers of the existing specification would come together and compare their running code to identify every difference and incompatibility, defining a test suite that interpreted the current specification. &nbsp;They might still produce a list of changes they would like to see in a future specification, and that list might contain some contentious items that take a long time to align. &nbsp;But in the meantime, they would have a practical roadmap to alignment and a benchmark for conformance to drive interoperability amongst each other and clarity for external interoperability.</p> A signature suite that spans two worlds <p>The specification under test in this new work item is <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">Json Web Signature 2020 </a>("JWS2020" for short), a CCG signature suite that defines how the signature mechanisms and data structures native to "detached signature" JWS tokens can be parsed as <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>. The signature mechanisms of the <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/jwt-jws-and-jwe-for-not-so-dummies-b63310d201a3">JWT world</a> and the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Feb/att-0130/VerifiableTrustStandards.png">LDP world</a> are quite different– bridging them requires a deep understanding of both: differing security models, canonization and serialization complexities, explicit reliance on <a href="https://www.iana.org/protocols">IANA registries</a>, <a href="https://json-ld.github.io/rdf-dataset-canonicalization/spec/">URDNA dataset normalization</a>, and the like. &nbsp;Advanced topics, even for this blog!</p><p>Understanding such a specification on a deep intellectual level and understanding its design decisions requires a firm grasp on all these complexities spanning two very different engineering traditions. Implementing the specification, however, should not; to be blunt, our community cannot afford such understanding gating off successful implementation, particularly if industrial adoption of decentralized identity is a shared goal. &nbsp;Before the specification gets iterated, it needs to be testable, and even more implementable than it already is.</p><p>This is where a test suite offers pedagogical tool for first-time implementers, as well as a negotiation tool for seasoned veterans and large corporations managing vast roadmaps and production development pipelines. While many DIF members do not encode VCs in JWT form, this grant is clearly in the common interest because mainstream adoption will indisputably benefit from a clearer, more explicitly-defined, and definitively-testable "normative VC-JWT".</p> Next Steps <p>As of today, the Claims and Credentials Working Group is tasked with finding the best possible grantee in the next two weeks. The timeline is to have a complete and functional test suite that makes at least 3 DIF member org's implementations testable by the end of 2021. &nbsp;The selection criteria for the work item lead is as follows:</p>  familiarity with JWS mechanics and common JOSE libraries/best-practices  experience with automated testing, vector design, and test scripts/suites  familiarity with LD Proofs and signature suites generally  familiarity with JSON/JSON-LD interop problems, at the semantic, signature-verification, and representation/parsing levels  <p>The selection period is from 26July to 9Aug, with the work to begin immediately thereafter, so act quickly! If you think you or your team can lead this effort, reach out to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html#chairs">chairs of C&amp;C</a> on <a>DIF Slack</a> with any questions or just proceed directly to the <a href="https://forms.gle/hPCNWaAQZpLFZyXd7">google form</a>. &nbsp;There, you can submit a brief portfolio demonstrating the qualifications above and a brief statement of interest and availability to take on this work, which will be archived publicly on DIF's github. Note: grantees can be freelancers or companies, but must be DIF members and in the C&amp;C working group or willing to join it if selected.</p>

	 What is the Me2B Respectful Tech Specification? 
 
 
 
 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;July 22, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#SafetyStandard #RespectfulTechSpec</p>
 
 
 
 

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
The Me2B Respectful Tech Specification is a sorely needed ethical and safety standard for the internet. It consists of a series of tests that objectively measure the behavior of a connected product or service. The Specification helps people (“Me-s”) understand how technology is treating them, and helps businesses (“B-s”) build technology that is safe and respectful for the people that use it.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>The Me2B Respectful Tech Specification, produced by the Me2B Alliance’s Respectful Tech Spec Working Group, is designed to provide an objective standard for measuring safe and ethical technology behavior. The Specification is intended to be a living document, to be updated regularly until it addresses all of the harms listed in our <a href="https://me2ba.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Content/EZy_n9XR1hpImPh9DA3ng2UBw2yrVveVXLnaO_uE01eGIQ?e=jZJxCo">Digital Harms Dictionary</a>. Each version is voted on and approved by the Alliance before publication. We anticipate that the first version of the Specification will be approved by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The Specification consists of the following elements:</p>
 
 The Core Respectful Tech Requirements, 
 The Certification Application Questionnaire, 
 Templates used to document the raw data being evaluated. 
 
<p>Our current Core Respectful Tech Requirements evaluate the behavior of websites and mobile apps, and are organized around Me2B Commitments. Me2B Commitments are the agreements a person can make when engaging with connected technology, such as agreeing to cookies or signing up for a newsletter.</p>
<p>The Requirements include multiple tests that assess a website or mobile app’s behavior towards a user as they enter, engage in, and exit a Me2B Commitment. Each test includes a definition of Best Practice, Passing Behavior, and Failing Behavior, which map to a five-tier scoring system that ranges from -3 (riskiest) to +1 (exceptionally respectful):</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	
	



Best Practice
Passing Behavior
Failing Behavior




+1 = exceptionally respectful behavior
0 = neutral / no detected risk or harm to Me
-1 = some risk to Me<br>
-2 = moderate risk to Me<br>
-3 = riskiest to Me




 
	 

 

	
	<p>Conducting all of the tests described in the Core Requirements requires multidisciplinary expertise, including expertise in:</p>
 
 Data Integrity Testing: Examining the flow of data out of the website or app and determining where the data is going. 
 Product Integrity Testing: Examining the website or app functionality by exercising the user interface – i.e., using the service. This includes determining if individuals have an appropriate level of agency while using the service, as well as looking for other harmful usability patterns (often called “dark patterns”) in the user interface. 
 Legal and Policy Document Assessment: Examining the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to determine if they are understandable and appropriate. The Specification also validates if the product behaves as promised in these documents. 
 Security Assessment: Security is a highly standardized discipline, and it would be redundant (and perhaps futile) to try to duplicate a full security evaluation. However, the Specification does include a small number of security checks, conducted by reviewing self-reported information from the service provider. 
 
<p>The majority of the Specification tests can be run independently of the service provider. The Certification Application Questionnaire addresses those areas that can’t be independently audited. These questions include, for instance, whether the business is sharing data at the back office – i.e. not directly through the website or mobile app.</p>
<p>Finally, the Specification includes a number of templates used to record the raw data observed during the evaluation.</p>

<p>As many people working in the digital identity, security and privacy spaces will know, the Privacy Paradox is the discrepancy between an individuals’ intentions to protect their privacy and how they actually behave in the online world.&nbsp; The relationship between an individuals’ intentions to disclose personal information and their actual personal information disclosure behaviours, can often be very different.<br><br>Many surveys have shown that privacy is a primary concern for people across the globe in our digital age.&nbsp; However, on the other hand large numbers of people freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience, often for relatively small rewards such as interacting with others within a social network.<br><br>This inconsistency of privacy attitudes and privacy behaviour is often referred to as the Privacy Paradox – people expressing privacy concerns often fail to act in accordance with them.<br><br>There have been many explanations for the Privacy Paradox.&nbsp; Examples being that people:</p>



<p>find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it</p>



<p>do not consider their personal information to be their own and might not appreciate the need to secure it</p>



<p>lack awareness of their right to privacy or privacy issues&nbsp;</p>



<p>believe their desire for a fully personalised experience outweigh the potential risks from big tech companies using their data for profiling.</p>



<p>Others may have chosen to take it as a sign that, despite what people say, they really just don’t care about their privacy and have used it as an excuse to look at increasingly invasive methods for monetising personal data.<br><br>Well, hopefully as pointed out&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbird/">Richard Bird</a>, Ping Identity’s Chief Customer Officer at the&nbsp;<a href="https://identiverse.com/">Indentiverse conference</a>&nbsp;in Denver a few weeks back, this later explanation ran into a seemingly solid dead end earlier this year, when with great fanfare (and strong disagreement from the likes of Facebook) Apple released iOS 14.5 and began enforcing App Tracking Transparency.<br><br>All being well, most people should now be aware that the latest release of iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are required to request a user’s permission to track their activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.<br><br>The early data is not looking good for app developers and advertisers who rely on targeted mobile advertising for revenue.&nbsp; While the worldwide opt-in rate has been creeping up, as of 28 June (2 months into the release), it is still only at 17%.&nbsp; The US only figure is even lower, at 9%.<br><br>So ultimately if people are now showing they do care about privacy when they are given the choice, why has the Privacy Paradox been so persistent over the last ten years or so?<br><br></p>



<p>Is it simply that to date people have really not had a choice?&nbsp; Or perhaps more starkly, the only choice they have had was to not use a service at all?&nbsp; Is the greatest example of “an offer you can’t refuse” the ACCEPT button on the Terms of Use page?<br><br>Hopefully we are now heading into a time when the Privacy Paradox will be no more. A time when people are offered a genuine choice about sharing their personal information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>Boardroom, the governance middleware platform that powers some of Web3's biggest DAOs, has gone live on Ceramic mainnet. Among the many new features built on Ceramic, Boardroom is debuting an Ideation feature that lets protocol contributors suggest, discuss, and pressure test ideas in a collaborative, censorship-resistant, and fully decentralized way.</p><p>Want to try Boardroom’s new Ideation feature? Visit the <a href="https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/ideation">ShapeShift DAO</a>.</p> What is Boardroom? <p><a href="https://boardroom.info/">Boardroom</a> is addressing the fragmented governance landscape with a simple and transparent platform for stakeholder management over DAOs and protocols.</p><p>As DeFi and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have exploded in popularity, so has experimentation in new governance methods and tooling. This has led to massive market fragmentation, with no unified experience that serves all aspects of governance together. Today, proposal information, discussion, voting, and execution are splintered across many platforms.</p><p>Boardroom intends to fix this. They are building a powerful governance platform that allows many different governance tools to plug into a single seamless framework that can serve an organization throughout all stages of its governance lifecycle.</p> Governance is more than voting <p>Voting is often considered a critical part of governance for DAOs, but voting is only the tip of the governance iceberg. Long before any votes are cast, ideas are generated, discussed, signaled, and revised - then they come to a vote and potentially move to on-chain execution. Today, this frequently happens across many platforms and is often done implicitly through back-channels rather than in a clear and explicit way. This process is full of friction and often results in lackluster participation and suboptimal decision-making.</p><p>Good governance requires context around all the moving parts, and that was Boardroom's founding motivation: to bring context to governance by unifying the disparate pieces and making sure the relevant information can be surfaced in an easy and clear way to participants.</p>The portal pulls in profiles, project information, discussion forums, Snapshot votes, ideation tools, and more.<p>The Boardroom SDK normalizes data and governance-related actions from across multiple governance frameworks and lets projects build their own, into a single standardized platform. Built on the Boardroom SDK, Boardroom's governance portal provides a consistent, low-friction interface for community members to interact and engage with distributed governance.</p><p>As they were building Boardroom, the team recognized that two critical aspects were missing from most governance tools:</p>  The social layer: Contextualized discussion and debate  The people layer: Rich, pseudonymous reputations   The social layer: Contextualized discussion and debate <p>While much emphasis is put on formal proposals and votes, the Boardroom team found that ideation and discussion, while softer, are more influential in governing the direction of projects. Kevin Nielsen, Boardroom co-founder:</p><blockquote>The vote is extremely important to actually anchor a specific decision, but the most important part of the actual process is coordinating the human and social layer.</blockquote><p>To elevate this part of the governance process and connect it to decision-making, Boardroom is building a set of ideation and forum tools.</p><p>On the Boardroom app, each governance proposal will include its own forum for discussion on the same page, presented in a unified experience - with participation restricted to token holders in the network.</p><p>Additionally, a new tool designed for ideation allows the community to suggest, show support for, and discuss new ideas before moving to a formal vote. Ideation is a way to get more people involved in the process in a clear, contextualized, and collaborative way. After debuting the Ideation feature last week with the Shapeshift DAO, their community has already <a href="https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/ideation/kjzl6cwe1jw145n4mqq47jgbzojg9q07zgvnx0u2xy95rexpwo9kul4xydei9qt">generated and discussed</a> several new ideas using Ideation. Here's a preview:</p> Ceramic Streams: Web3-native content for DAOs <p>In governance, forum posts and discussions must be trustless and censorship-resistant, or else protocol governance could be shaped by a single party with the power to warp this crucial part of the process - including Boardroom. Storing discussion threads on a server would leave this data susceptible to corruption and posts couldn't just be stored on vanilla IPFS without a management layer to link posts, reactions, and responses together into a consistent thread.</p><p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> provided a perfect solution for this user-generated content, with signed streams of content persisted on a decentralized network. Because Ceramic content is authenticated with the same decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that sit at the heart of <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/identity/idx/">IDX</a> and Boardroom's user profiles, users can begin posting to forums without the need to authenticate in a new way. Each piece of content is signed, stored, and controlled by users, then aggregated into the complete thread by the application.</p><p>This approach provides a lightweight way to manage rich user content and enables full portability and composability of data. Other governance applications could easily build on top of the same ideation threads outside of the Boardroom UI by referencing the same Ceramic streams or discovering them through a users' IDX. This paves the way for a consistent ideation and discussion layer that can be used everywhere across the governance ecosystem.</p> The people layer: Rich, pseudonymous reputations <p>To be maximally effective, governance delegates and participants must be able to build and leverage a reputation. The anonymity provided by obscure hex addresses might be sufficient for one-off financial transactions, however governance is a long-term game and requires continuity across repeated social interactions. For example others might want to know, "Who are the delegates that are consistently making good suggestions, proving their intent, and putting skin in the game?" Says Nielsen:</p><blockquote>What we want to highlight with voter profiles is not about real-world identity. It's about mapping stakeholders in the network to their on-chain activity, their previous decisions, and their role. It's contextualizing how they fit into that specific DAO, or ecosystem, or decision.</blockquote><p>The fact that many users maintain multiple on-chain accounts and wallets adds complexity to this goal. While this practice may be good for opsec and privacy, it makes it more difficult to construct a unified governance experience for users across all of their accounts. To solve for this, Boardroom needed a way to allow users to link many accounts (and their interactions) together into a unified identity without compromising a user's desire for privacy.</p> Ceramic IDX: Aggregated identities for users <p>This is why Boardroom is moving their identity system and user profiles to <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a> - the identity protocol built on top of Ceramic. In addition to storing profiles and other arbitrary information, IDX lets users link multiple on-chain accounts to the same identity, as well as prove ownership of various Web2 accounts such as Twitter, Github, and Discord.</p><p>As more projects like Rabbithole, Sourcecred, and Gitcoin begin to also use IDX for identity and user data storage, a user's history of on-chain and off-chain transactions can aggregate into a unified, cross-platform reputation which can be used everywhere across the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>All of this information stored in IDX results in a rich source of user context which doesn't just aid the voting process, but rather adds value to every stage of engagement and governance across the Web3 ecosystem — all while staying pseudonymous.</p> Connecting the governance ecosystem <p>With Ceramic and IDX, Boardroom is building a DAO governance platform that brings together the on-chain, social, and human layers in a way that is lightweight and ready to scale. Said YJ Kim, engineer and co-founder of Boardroom:</p><blockquote>We initially thought we'd need to use Discourse forums for ideation. But data is not easy to fetch from the Discourse API, we can’t make a PR to suit our needs since it’s closed source software, and each integration required the forum admins to manually whitelist our IP.</blockquote><p>IDX allows Boardroom to build a focused, web3 version such that future applications both within Boardroom and in the broader governance ecosystem don’t have to face those hurdles. Everything is just...there. That not only makes future iterations easier, but also if a user begins using some other application built on IDX, we’ll be able to easily plug that data right into our portal if we wanted to - and vice versa.</p> What's next for Boardroom? <p>Boardroom recently announced the addition of projects using Governor Alpha, Governor Bravo, and AAVE-based governance frameworks to their platform, adding to existing integrations such as Snapshot. Any projects using these frameworks can easily onboard to Boardroom's platform and use their governance portal interface to vote, delegate, ideate, track treasury distributions, and more.</p><p>For projects using modified versions of these frameworks, Boardroom will work with teams to build adapters as needed.

<p>Newly Elected Officers Promote the Collaborative Development of Open Source and Standards</p> 


<p>20 July 2021 — OASIS Open, the international open source and open standards consortium, today announced the election of three new members to its Board of Directors: Nima Dokoohaki of Accenture Strategy &amp; Consulting; Ross Gardler of Microsoft Azure; and Anish Karmarkar of Oracle. Their collective experience in the standards and open source communities expands the Board’s reach and strengthens OASIS’ position as the home for worldwide standards in cybersecurity, blockchain, privacy, cryptography, cloud computing, IoT, emergency management, and other content technologies.</p>



<p>The newly elected members join the continuing members of the Board: Jeremy Allison of Google; Rich Bowen of Red Hat; Gershon Janssen, Independent Consultant; Wende Peters of Bank of America; and Richard Struse of MITRE. Jason Keirstead of IBM Security and Daniel Riedel of Copado were re-elected to the Board. Each director will serve a two-year term.</p>



<p>“At OASIS, it’s our mission to re-energize the collaboration between open source and open standards communities in order to fuel innovation. I’m confident that our Board will continue to provide valuable strategic guidance on the evolving needs of our organization,” said Guy Martin, Executive Director of OASIS Open. “I’m excited to welcome our new Board members Nima, Ross, and Anish, and I’m happy to welcome back our returning Board members, Jason and Daniel; thank you for your continued service to the OASIS community.”</p>



<p>Nima Dokoohaki, PhD, is a data science and engineering expert working with the Swedish Accenture Strategy and Consulting Applied Intelligence (S&amp;C AI) team, a group focusing on delivering business value to clients using data analytics. Nima has several years of practical knowledge of the adoption of many enterprise data-centric products from both enterprise architecture as well as enterprise analytics perspectives across several European industries.</p>



<p>“It’s great to be among a select few members being elected by the community to serve on the directorial board. I’m personally humbled and pleased to get to act as a trustee of the organization,” said Nima Dokoohaki. “I hope we can inspire more organizations and members to make a conscious effort to join and contribute to open standards and technologies development that impact the way we do modern business, especially across geographical borders.”</p>



<p>Ross Gardler joined Microsoft in 2013 and works in the Linux Solutions Team on Azure, which owns the full end-to-end experience for customers running Linux workloads on Azure. His team is actively engaged with many open projects for standards, software, and hardware. Ross has more than 20 years of experience in open source, most notably within the Apache Software Foundation, and has been a long-time proponent of the collaboration between open source and open standards.</p>



<p>“A robust and diverse standards system is critical to the technology ecosystem. OASIS has a long-standing tradition of excellence in standards setting, and is among the leaders in defining the future of standardization. Openness is key to innovation and I look forward to working with OASIS as it leverages the intersection of open source and open standards,” said Ross Gardler, Principal Programme Manager, at Microsoft.</p>



<p>Anish Karmarkar, PhD, is a Senior Director at Oracle and member of its Standards Strategy &amp; Architecture team. He is the chair of INCITS/Cloud38, the U.S. Technical Advisory Group to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38 (Cloud Computing &amp; Distributed Platforms) and the editor of ISO/IEC 5140 (Multi-cloud). In addition to his new duties on the OASIS Board, he also represents Oracle on the W3C Advisory Committee, Java Community Process (JCP) Executive Committee, and INCITS Executive Board. With 20+ years of experience in the software industry, Anish has a history of participation and leadership in standards setting organizations, serving on the Board of Directors of the Object Management Group (OMG) and OSGi Alliance, and as a longtime contributor to various OASIS Technical Committees.</p>



<p>“OASIS is a world class open, transparent, global collaboration environment for both standards and open source and Oracle is proud to continue its involvement in shaping it,” said Anish Karmarkar. “I’m honored and humbled to be elected by the membership to serve on the Board of Directors of OASIS. I’m excited to be given this opportunity to serve the needs of the community and use my experience in advancing the mission and vision of OASIS.”</p>



<p>“I want to give special recognition to our outgoing Board members: Dr. Martin Chapman of Oracle; Frederick Hirsch; Beth Pumo of Kaiser Permanente; and Bruce Rich of Cryptsoft,” said Guy Martin. “Thank you for your service; we’re very grateful for your commitment and contributions to OASIS over the years.”</p>

  <p>The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) is proud of its ongoing transparency initiatives. Namely its open approach to providing unrestricted access to the latest LEI data from around the world with the Quarterly LEI System Business Reports, which are made publicly available free of charge. Through this ‘LEI in Numbers’ blog series, GLEIF aims to highlight key data from the latest report, explaining trends and profiling successes from the global LEI rollout. </p>
<p>The latest report, covering Q2 2021, shows that 58,000 new LEIs were issued globally during that period. Issuance was slightly lower than the previous quarter (68,000 issued in Q1), however this trend is quite common during the second quarter of the year, as the world moves into the slower summer months. The overall picture is very encouraging; in Q2 2021, total LEI issuance grew by 3.3% and the total number of active LEIs now stands as 1.82 million. </p>
<p>For a further summary of the past quarter’s data, the below infographic contains the key statistics from Q2 2021. </p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/q2-2021-in-review-the-lei-in-numbers/gleif_jul21-1-750x1937.jpg"></a>
<p>For the first time, Turkey emerges as the largest growth market in Q2, with an impressive growth rate of 22.9%. This is one of the highest growth rates seen this year. This was driven largely by a regional deadline to map LEIs to legacy international securities identification numbers, in line with the joint initiative from the Association of National Numbering Agencies and GLEIF. In addition, Iceland has doubled its quarterly growth rate when compared to the previous quarter (19% in Q2, up from 9.2% in Q1). </p>
<p>While remaining high overall, there was a nominal decline in renewal rates across both EU and non-EU jurisdictions throughout the past quarter (64.3% down from 66%). In line with fluctuations in issuance and growth, it is normal for renewal rates to vary from quarter to quarter. GLEIF advocates for LEI renewals to be made mandatory whenever LEI issuance is mandatory. The prevention of lapsed credentials by proactive renewal of LEIs on an annual basis ensures that the Global LEI Index continues to provide the most accurate and up-to-date data as possible. This benefits the entire ecosystem and all users of LEI data, who rely on its accuracy to make informed business decisions with confidence. </p>
<p>For the full report which includes further detail on the status of LEI issuance and growth potential, the level of competition between LEI issuing organizations in the Global LEI System and Level 1 and 2 reference data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Reports page.</p>
<p>If you are interested in reviewing the latest daily LEI data, our Global LEI System Statistics Dashboard contains daily statistics on the total and active number of LEIs issued. This feature now enables any user to review historical data by geography, increasing transparency on the overall progress of the LEI.</p>
<p>For further detail, or to access historical data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Report Archive. We look forward to sharing our progress each quarter as we continue to drive LEI adoption in 2021.</p>

 🚀 Foundation News 
 DIF "Frequently Asked Questions" Knowledgebase 
<p>DIF has launched a massive <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">knowledgebase</a>, structured as a long series of frequently-asked questions and answers. This synthesizes a year of educational efforts in the interop WG, blog posts, newsletters, and many other DIF inputs in a format we hope will be useful as a reference and onboarding document throughout the decentralized identity space.  Please peruse it, particularly the sections about your personal research focus and/or your company's specialty and products, opening issues or PRs on github wherever you feel a correction or addition is needed.  This is intended as a community resource, so PRs are open to your input!</p>
 Interop WG election 
<p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/interop/">Interoperability WG</a> is seeking nominations for new chairs. The group is hoping to pivot to a greater focus on testing, so candidates with experience scripting tests or making specs testable (whether in decentralized identity contexts or otherwise) are particularly welcome. For details about the ballot, visit the mailing list or slack channel.</p>

TLDR; WACI isn’t being donated as a snapshot or as a reference implementation of a finished protocol; it’s being donated as a starting point for an ongoing work item in C&amp;C WG that will round out the spec to be more robust and flexible, after the WACI-PEx profile has been finished and there is feedback to consider from implementers of it, and/or of other applications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[DIF focuses on three distinct] “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is [the Interop WG's] contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community-- and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all three.</p>

				 <p>KP4 to join the Board of aNewGovernance AISBL:</p>
<p>Because human-centric data infrastructure has to be the new global model across all sectors, moving away from platform-centric and state-centric current situations, we are delighted to announce Toulouse-based OKP4 is joining our Brussels-based International Association</p>
<p>As the Data Strategy and the Data Spaces are being put in place in Europe, the other main priority of the EU27 is the Green Deal, probably with even more impact. We are therefore delighted to welcome OKP4 which is bridging both priorities:</p>
<p>“In today’s data-driven society, the success of any organization relies on knowledge extracted from relevant data. Paradoxically, 70% of data produced by companies is not exploited. Worse, data is almost never shared between stakeholders due to lack of standards, trust and/or common interests.</p>
<p>Because data is the only asset whose value increases when it is shared, OKP4 (Open Knowledge Platform for) proposes an infrastructure where stakeholders can share their data without exchanging it with the others. Our infrastructure indexes heterogeneous data and services (AI) to produce on-demand knowledge without disclosing the data. Another particularity of OKP4 is to fairly reward knowledge contributors: it aligns interests between parties, within a framework of security and mutual consent allowing trustworthy collaboration. We believe the current data economy helped by data marketplaces is just a transition towards a more efficient and fairer knowledge economy helped by actors such as OKP4.</p>
<p>OKP4 focuses primarily on the field of agriculture, but is a toolbox that could and will be applied to any data-based usecase. Today, we help organisations extract value from their data and help them build multiparty data-sharing ecosystems for maximum mutual benefits.”</p>
<p>In recognition to its valuable contribution, OKP4 will be represented in the aNewGovernance Board by its President, Emmanuel Aldeguer.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has released Gordian Seed Tool, a new iOS app that allows for the creation, storage, backup, and transformation of cryptographic seeds is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Apple appstore</a>. It is an independent, private, and resilient vault, which can protect the most important underlying secret used by most cryptocurrencies: the cryptographic seed.</p>

<p>Though most wallets focus on the private keys used to unlock their cryptocurrency transactions, Gordian Seed Tool takes a step back and allows you to manage the fundamentals upon which private keys are built: entropy and seeds. You can use coin flips, die rolls, card draws, or iOS randomness as the entropy to generate your seeds, or you can import them from other applications. Using those seeds, Gordian Seed Tool can then derive unique, non-correlatable public and private keys as you need them.</p>

<p>The focus of Gordian Seed Tool is to protect your seeds. It does so by supporting new approaches to security such as QR-based airgaps, where you store your secrets on a closely held device that isn’t fully networked, such as an offline device in airplane mode, or a strongly protected device like the secure enclave in Apple’s iPhone and more modern Macinotoshes. You then communicate with that device primarily through QR codes or text that can easily be transmitted across that gap of air. Your seeds are thus protected by modern mobile-device security such as data encryption, trusted hardware, and biometric access protection.</p>

<p>That data encryption comes about through Apple’s trusted encryption routines. Seed Tool then adds resilience through integration with iCloud. If your choose for your mobile iOS device to have a network connection, its seeds will be stored in iCloud using end-to-end encryption. If you lose your device, you can retrieve those seeds with a replacement device logged into the same Apple account. (If you prefer, you can also use a cellular networked device, such as an iPod Touch or wifi-only iPad, leveraging airplane mode, to entirely ensure that your seeds never leave your device.)</p>

<p>You’ll be able to easily identify your seeds using the Blockchain Commons <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-002-digest.md#object-identity-block">object identity block</a>, which includes a visual lifehash, a human-readable name, an icon, and an abbreviated digest. Put them together and you should be able to recognize each seed at a glance.</p>

<p>Besides generating seeds, storing them, and backing them up, Gordian Seed Tool can also transform your seeds. It can derive popular Bitcoin and Ethereum public and private keys from your seeds, answer requests for other derivations,  encode seeds as bytewords, BIP39 words, or hex, or shard them into SSKR shares and save them to different locations or as social recovery with your family, friends and close colleagues. Your seed is the basis for a whole tree of secure data, and Gordian Seed Tool gives you access to all of it.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool is just one of several Blockchain Commons apps that demonstrate the Gordian principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> offers a way to store confidential QRs such as 2FA seeds, SSKR shares, and (for that matter) cryptoseeds. Our forthcoming Gordian Cosigner will demonstrate how to easily manage Bitcoin transactions across an Airgap.</p>

<p>14 July 2021 – OASIS Open and the members of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti">Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee (TC)</a> are pleased to announce that Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) v2.1 and Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) v2.1 have been approved as OASIS Standards. STIX and TAXII are widely used to prevent and defend against cyberattacks by enabling threat intelligence to be analyzed and shared among trusted partners and communities. As full OASIS Standards, STIX and TAXII can now be recognized by other International Standards bodies and referenced in official government procurements and rules.</p>



<p>The STIX standard defines a JSON-based language for sharing structured threat intelligence in a consistent, machine-readable manner, allowing organizations to better protect against, detect, and respond to cyber threats. STIX v2.1 adds new objects and capabilities, enabling it to better describe the cyber threats we confront today, as well as future-proofing STIX via STIX Extensions. As a result, STIX v2.1 creates a solid and stable foundation for vendors and consumers alike to exchange actionable CTI.</p>



<p>The TAXII standard defines a transport protocol which supports the exchange of STIX data over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). TAXII enables machine-to-machine sharing of CTI by defining an API that supports common sharing models used by industry and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs).</p>



<p>“When I launched the STIX and TAXII initiatives at the US Department of Homeland Security over nine years ago, I always hoped that one day we would reach this milestone of full international standard status,” said OASIS CTI TC Co-chair Richard Struse of MITRE. “Since transitioning this work to OASIS six years ago, the members of the CTI TC have done a tremendous amount of work to give the global community practical standards that empower defenders to maximize their use of threat intelligence to protect their organizations. The community now should focus on using these standards to solve actual cybersecurity problems and to help thwart future cyber attacks.”</p>



<p>“OASIS has given us the ability to create a scalable and sustainable community where like-minded, passionate people come together to solve problems,” said Trey Darley of the Belgian National CERT, who co-chairs the OASIS CTI TC with Richard. “STIX v2.1 and TAXII v2.1 have reached full OASIS Standard status at a critical inflection point, when there’s such a need for more flexible and faster information sharing to enable defense against global cybersecurity threats. We have laid the foundation for cross-implementation interoperability, future-proofed STIX with the new extensions mechanism…I believe that these standards will enable the creation of new classes of security countermeasures…we’ve barely begun to scratch the surface.”</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">3Box Labs is sunsetting 3Box products</a> in favor of the new and more powerful combination of <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a>. This post provides a short tutorial on how to update your application to load user profiles using the IDX SDK instead of the 3Box profiles API. Making this upgrade ensures your application will always be loading the most current profiles for your users.</p> Why use IDX instead of 3Box? <p>Migrating your application from using 3Box to IDX for fetching user profiles will ensure you are always querying up-to-date profiles for your users, whether a given user has migrated from 3Box to IDX or not.</p><p>As Ceramic mainnet goes live, existing 3Box users will have their profiles migrated over to IDX. Updating a user's IDX requires the user to be authenticated and sign the updates, so this will not happen all at once. Instead, the first time a user interacts with a Ceramic-enabled app that uses <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/authentication/3id-did/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a> for authentication they will be prompted to migrate their account from 3Box to IDX and the data will be transferred in the background for them.</p><p>To make sure you are accurately pulling profiles for all users, we recommend upgrading to IDX ASAP. The 3Box API will keep working for the immediate future. However, if you do not upgrade you will only load outdated profiles from the 3Box API for users who have migrated. The IDX API solves this by returning an IDX profile for migrated users and falling back to 3Box profiles for users who have not yet migrated.</p>  How to query profiles with IDX <p>This tutorial will show you how to fetch profiles in order to display them in your application's UI. The code below allows your app to display an IDX profile if one exists, and if not, will fall back to displaying a legacy 3Box profile.</p><p>First, we need to install the Ceramic <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/installation/#js-http-client">JS HTTP Client</a> as well as the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/identity/idx/">IDX SDK</a>:</p> <code>npm install @ceramicnetwork/http-client @ceramicstudio/idx
</code> <p>Now let's import our dependencies:</p> <code>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { IDX, getLegacy3BoxProfileAsBasicProfile } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'
</code> <p>Now let's load a profile for a user. Notice below that we first try to load the profile using the <code>idx.get</code> function. This attempts to retrieve the user's <code>basicProfile</code> from IDX, however if one is not present because the user has not yet migrated to Ceramic/IDX, then we can fallback to use the <code>getLegacy3BoxProfileAsBasicProfile</code> function to get the user's profile from the 3Box API.</p> <code>const ceramic = new Ceramic('https://gateway.ceramic.network')
const idx = new IDX({ ceramic })

const ethAddress = '0xabc123...'
let profile = await idx.get('basicProfile', ethAddress + '@eip155:1')

if (!profile) {
  profile = await getLegacy3BoxProfileAsBasicProfile(ethAddress)
}
console.log(profile)
</code> <p>You may have noticed that the Ethereum address is concatenated with <code>@eip155:1</code>. This is because the <code>idx.get</code> methods can be used to lookup data for accounts on any blockchain. <code>eip155:1</code> is simply the blockchain namespace for ethereum mainnet.

<p>We are delighted to announce today that Brazilian privacy advocate, Danilo Doneda, has been named as the newest member of the <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> board of directors.</p><p>Doneda, a practicing attorney and professor, currently serves as director of CEDIS/IDP (Center for Law, Internet, and Society). He is also a member of the National Data Protection and Privacy Council, serving on behalf of Brazil’s House of Representatives; the Board of Directors of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP); and the advisory boards of the United Nations Global Pulse Privacy Group and the Project Children and Consumption (Instituto Alana).</p><p>“Identity and privacy are both fundamental and complementary aspects of citizenship and human rights in an increasingly digitized world,” said Doneda. “Identification frameworks can be as powerful and trustable as possible, as long as they accomplish to provide effective and meaningful privacy features and controls.”</p><p>“We are delighted to welcome Danilo to the ID2020 board of directors,” said board chair, Kim Gagné. “ID2020 has always been committed to the idea that individuals must be able to control how their personal data is collected, used, and shared. Privacy — and the trust that derives from it — is essential for digital identity to achieve its potential for empowering and protecting individuals, especially the most vulnerable members of society. Danilo’s extensive experience and commitment to digital privacy and data protection made him an obvious addition to the board and we are grateful for his commitment to our&nbsp;work.”</p><p>Prior to his current role, Doneda served as the General Coordinator at the Department of Consumer Protection and Defense at the Brazilian Ministry of Justice.

<p>Press Release<br>
London, UK,&nbsp; July 13, 2021</p>
<p>Not-for-profit champions of diversity in the identity sector, Women in Identity, have signed up a number of high profile sponsors including <a href="http://www.rbc.com">RBC</a> (Royal Bank of Canada), <a href="http://www.gbgplc.com">GBG</a> and the <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network </a>for the Code of Conduct research project that was announced earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct will provide a set of Guiding Principles and an Implementation Framework to organisations that are designing, developing and/or deploying digital identity systems within the financial services sector.</p>
<p>The first phase of work is now underway with a comprehensive review of existing research to provide evidence of non-diverse thinking across all aspects of the identity ecosystem. This will be followed up by interviews with citizens across different economic landscapes, as well as organisations that implement identity systems for financial services use cases.&nbsp; With a clear problem statement and evidence of the global social and economic impact of exclusion, there will be a clear focus for the detailed framework development that will follow later in the Autumn.</p>
<p>Women in Identity research lead, Dr Louise Maynard-Atem commented: “More than one billion people worldwide lack a basic, verifiable identity — they are not on the ‘identity grid’. And in the UK, it is estimated that nearly 1 in 4 people don’t have traditional identity documentation. Without a recognizable proof of identity, there can be no financial or health inclusion, citizen inclusion or digital inclusion. By focussing on building out inclusive product teams, we believe our Code of Conduct offers a unique opportunity to ensure that identity products of the future can genuinely work for everyone. Working with our research and sponsorship partners, we’re committed to designing a practical and pragmatic approach to becoming a truly inclusive sector.”</p>
<p>Savita Bailur of the project’s research partner, Caribou Digital, stated: “Around the world, people are often excluded from identity products or pathways which impact on their financial inclusion and independence.&nbsp; We’re excited to be working with Women in Identity on the Code of Conduct. Through our research across mature and emerging markets, and working with multiple stakeholders, we aim to design actionable guiding principles for building more inclusive identification for financial products.”</p>
<p>Mick Hegarty of sponsors, GBG, added: “We are in business to build trust in a digital world, so that everyone can transact online with confidence. That’s why we are delighted to work with Women in Identity and sponsor this Code of Conduct, which will help ensure that digital identity works for everyone.”</p>
<p>Women in Identity will be delivering this research in an iterative fashion and organisations wishing to participate in the research or sponsor further workstreams of the Code of Conduct project should <a href="mailto:louise@womeninidentity.org">contact Louise Maynard-Atem</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Women in Identity</p>
<p>We are a not-for-profit, volunteer-led network of predominantly (but not exclusively) women working in the identity sector. Through engagement and outreach we support nearly 2000 members worldwide to bring their own value to the world of identity.</p>
<p>It’s our belief that developers of identity systems must always consider how their products will work for people outside the majority group. We champion the inclusion of people of all races, genders, abilities cultures and ages within the teams responsible for designing, building and testing ID verification systems.</p>
<p>Diversity doesn’t happen by chance. Organisations – and their leaders – have to make a conscious effort to recruit and develop individuals who don’t look like them. Women in Identity offers events and support materials to promote best practice around hiring and developing diverse teams in our sector.</p>

	<p></p>
<p>Privacy&nbsp;has become&nbsp;one of the most&nbsp;prominent issues&nbsp;in the online world – just look&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data">Apple’s new App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;policy&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22547339/google-chrome-cookiepocalypse-delayed-2023">Google’s phasing out of 3rd party cookies</a>. This is new territory we are all navigating. The Me2B Alliance strives to do its part in shaping an effective, privacy-safe paradigm that works for both consumers (Me-s) and businesses (B-s). Every day we are figuring out pieces of this in our own marketing efforts. We want to share our learnings to help others succeed in the new world of respectful marketing.</p>
<p>Shifting to more respectful marketing is often not a simple, black and white change.&nbsp;There is a lot of grey area and&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/about/principles/">our principles</a> help guide us as a shining light. One key point is we look at digital relationships between Me-s and B-s as we would a real-life human relationship, with respect of boundaries and putting yourself in the other’s shoes to find the best mutual solution. We don’t aim to just extract maximum data – that is not how you treat someone&nbsp;&nbsp;respectfully. Consumer demand is waking up to this reality and it’s gradually becoming the norm. Businesses must adapt to keep their customers happy.</p>
<p>Our marketing objectives are like most other organizations – we want to educate our audience on the issues, mobilize support, and grow our donation base to fund more projects. Our challenges are in the myriad of status quo marketing tools and techniques that don’t align with the new model of respectful marketing. Can we use analytics to be more effective yet still respect our visitors? Can we ethically use tools provided by big tech companies if their principles don’t seem to align with ours? While this is challenging, it is also exciting to help pioneer this new inevitable model.</p>
<p>We have&nbsp;privacy and technology&nbsp;expertise on our staff that is crucial for resolving these questions.&nbsp;Most organizations do not have this in-house expertise, which is why we’re sharing ours with you. Our ultimate goal is for all to adopt respectful marketing. So let’s get into our first tips…</p>
<p>Identifying respectful marketing technology&nbsp;has been a big focus for us.&nbsp;For instance, until recently, we had no analytics enabled on our website. That is a bit extreme – we need some insight to better serve our audience.&nbsp;We&nbsp;recently&nbsp;deployed&nbsp;<a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo Analytics</a>, a privacy-safe alternative to Google Analytics. It provides a standard analytics dashboard with insights like which content is the most popular and which sources are sending people to our website. However, Matomo has many privacy settings that we have optimized such as masking IP addresses so there are no personal identifiers – our analytics are anonymous. Additionally, we have provided a clear opt-in notice on our website so that visitors must consent to analytics before they are activated.</p>
<p>This is a recurring process – find the most privacy-friendly platform and then make sure to fine-tune the platform’s settings for optimal privacy. Other examples are <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>&nbsp;for our email marketing and&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> for our video hosting. Our research determined they are the best solutions available for respectful marketing. Sometimes there are tricky decisions where the maximum privacy for a feature is too detrimental to user experience or too complicated for our organization – tradeoffs must be weighed to find the best solution for all parties. For example, we first tried self-hosting our videos but that became a significant burden on our website’s bandwidth and was complicated to manage so we decided to go with the most respectful video embed service available. We need to find solutions that are not overly cumbersome. We want to use practical solutions that can be widely adopted to effect the most positive change in the digital world.</p>
<p>There are many more lessons we will share as we continue charting the course to respectful marketing. Stay tuned for future installments of this series. We will go more in-depth on our decision-making process with step-by-step guides showing you how to optimize privacy settings across our marketing tools. In the meantime, we’d love to hear if you have any tips on how to do respectful marketing! Reach out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/me2b-alliance/">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/me2balliance">Twitter</a>&nbsp;and let us know about your experience.&nbsp;If you ever notice something we can improve on feel free to send us an email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:admin@me2ba.org">admin@me2ba.org</a>.</p>

 What is Digital Transformation and why it is essential to have a blockchain&nbsp; like Commercio.network&nbsp; to implement it. 
 What is digital transformation? 
<p>In 2014, the EU issued the eIDAS directives by regulating Trust Services to create electronic identities, sign and send electronic documents with legal value. This has made it possible to dematerialize all business processes in digital form. According to an EU estimate, digital transformation is expected to increase gross domestic product by 2.2 trillion euros over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why is it essential to be a blockchain ? 
<p>The blockchain is the technology made famous by Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s a network that allows you to exchange something that has value and must remain original to keep it. You can exchange copies of images on the internet, but you can’t transfer originals. If it were possible we could all send each other pictures of money via whatsapp and not exchange banknotes. The blockchain solves the problem of exchanging value by exchanging originals. That’s why the founders of Commerc.io thought of using it to exchange documents with legal value.</p>
<p>The Digital Transformation&nbsp; blockchain Commercio.network is an open-source PROJECT that gives companies the ability to sign and exchange documents using blockchain technology to guarantee:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Paternity: The document was created by the declared sender.&nbsp; 
  Non-repudiation: The sender cannot deny having&nbsp; signed the document&nbsp; 
  Integrity: The document has not been altered during transport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>There are two main groups of business documents:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Structured: Mostly XML (Invoices, orders, order confirmations, etc).&nbsp; 
  Unstructured: Mostly PDF (Contracts, forms, letters, etc).&nbsp; 
 
<p>The network is organized through an international network&nbsp; of 100 independent companies. Any company, especially yours, is welcome to join the consortium and take advantage of this next-generation technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commercio.network is called The Documents blockchain because it focuses on solving one core business problem: legally exchanging and signing business documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mission&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our mission is to spread blockchain technology to worldwide companies with a bold Go to market&nbsp; plan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  100 Node validators companies to onboard. 
  1000&nbsp; distributors companies to onboard. 
  10.000 IT companies to onboard…&nbsp; 
  100.000 end customers companies on the blockchain.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to provide every IT Company in the world a simple, fast, profitable way to create value for them and their end customers with:</p>
 
  the vision&nbsp; 
  the skills&nbsp; 
  the core technology&nbsp; 
  the network of validators&nbsp; 
  the developer tools&nbsp; 
 
<p>We have removed the underlying complexity of implementing a blockchain project by defining a three layer approach.&nbsp;</p>
 
  APPLICATION LAYER: where IT companies build apps for solving users’ problems.&nbsp; 
  NETWORKING LAYER: where the companies run the blockchain network nodes.&nbsp; 
  PROTOCOL LAYER: where the basic 8 Core Functions are implemented on the node.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 8 Core Functions Our blockchain core Node software has a group of “Smart Contracts” focused on the world of the document:&nbsp;</p>
 
 CommercioWallet (Done) : Enable users account and access&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioID (Done): Enable users self sovereign identity&nbsp; 
 CommercioDocs (Done): Enable users to exchange business documents&nbsp;

<p><a>3Box Labs</a> is about to open up a lot of new roles. As we grow into our next phase, we spent a lot of time last month digging into a critical question: how do we improve the diversity of our team?</p><p>Our current team is far from representative of the global population we aim to build for. Our team of 12 is 9 men and 3 women. 9 of us are white. We are geographically spread out - but only in North America and Europe. And our pipeline of incoming applicants is more homogenous than this.</p><p>Last month we had a series of full-team conversations about our approach to building a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable team. We had plenty of differing opinions and useful debates, and did not end with 100% agreement on everything. We did end with a deeper shared appreciation for how much this matters, an approach that we believe in, and some steps we are putting into action.</p><p>We'd love your support, input, and feedback as we put this into action and so are sharing thinking as well as our plans.</p> Why diversity is critical to us <p>Our team first dug into why it is important to us. There are many reasons building a diverse team matters. Bringing focus to those that hold the most meaning to our team helped us make sure we arrived at a plan of action that would resonate. It also let us get extremely specific about how this goal relates to our overall mission and the other goals — and other constraints — that we have as a team. This helped us ensure our plan of action would be practical.</p><p>After several iterations, we arrived at this summary of why this topic is so important to us, which now lives on our <a href="https://www.notion.so/About-3Box-Labs-7100eadf86624b1ba00793da29a08711">About Us page</a>.</p>  🤝🏽 Commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion <p>Building a diverse team is a top priority because nothing will impact our success more deeply. Our ambitions for change are global and our team must represent perspectives from across the world we aim to improve.</p>  The challenges we face are incredibly complex. We must tackle these with ideas and ingenuities from a wide variety of backgrounds and contexts.  Our technology impacts how information and identities are controlled online, with deeply personal and widespread effects. We each have blind spots and need many viewpoints to anticipate the consequences of our work.  We want to face the many unforeseen changes and challenges we have ahead with a balanced and robust team, drawing on a diversity of strengths to adapt and improve through adversity.  <p>We have work to do here, as a team and industry. It's our responsibility to model that only a diverse team working together can we succeed in building a more sustainable, fair and equitable web.</p> <p>One thing absent from this is anything about our role in helping close the opportunity gap for underrepresented groups in crypto, tech, and knowledge economy jobs. We debated this internally at length, as we do feel a responsibility to advance equity more generally in the greater ecosystem in which we operate. However, we feared diluting the messaging that building a diverse and inclusive team is central to our core mission. Aiming to impact social justice in tech felt like a big undertaking and adjacent to our core goals. We have a deep conviction that building a diverse team is critical to our success as an organization, so we decided to keep our statement focused on reinforcing that rather than adding additional diversity goals related to social justice more broadly.</p><p>We talked with several DEI advisors and heard mixed reactions. One felt it absurd to make a 'business case' for an equitable team; it's simply the right and necessary thing to do. Others felt that grounding our commitment to diversity deeply in our team's mission would help us feel the priority more concretely and urgently. We ended, for now, keeping our commitment tied explicitly to our mission. We do hope that through that commitment we will be able to model equity in a space where lack of representation is too much the norm.</p> Our approach to building a diverse team <p>To live up to our commitment, we need a principled approach to hiring that values and emphasizes diversity while still holding to other values, including evaluating every candidate as an individual. We established two particularly important principles:</p>  Invest heavily in proactively building a representative pipeline for every role  Out of that pipeline, hire the candidate who adds the most to our team's mission  <p>At the end of our hiring process, we always want to hire the person that will add the most value to our team. This is not purely about their ability to excel in the role; it also includes character that reinforces our values, and capacity to add new dimensions to our team. This step cannot function in isolation, though. If we hire the best candidates from a pipeline of white male candidates, we will always be hiring white males.</p><p>We must build a broad and representative pipeline of quality candidates for every role. As noted earlier, this does not happen organically right now. We have to put significant proactive effort towards it, then pair it with a thoughtful evaluation and offer process. &nbsp;This is an investment, and will take more time and will mean slower hires on some roles.</p><p>At a startup with limited resources and an urgent need to hire, this is hard. The two priorities of hiring fast and hiring deliberately - including to add diversity - are directly at odds. By explicitly tying our commitment to diversity and success in our mission together, and adding more concrete tactics, we hope to turn diversity into a top-of-mind priority for every hire.</p> Concrete changes we're making  Make it very clear that all candidates are welcomed on our team <p>Adapt our job descriptions, incorporating the knowledge that different candidates react differently to certain language and elements (e.g., men are more likely to apply to jobs where they don't meet all listed requirements). Three changes we've made:</p>  Replace "Requirements" with a section called "You're likely to succeed if," which focuses on capabilities and outcomes and avoids past experiences that would narrow the candidate pool  Explicitly encourage candidates from underrepresented groups to apply in every job description  Ensure inclusive language, using a tool to detect wording that may appeal more to men than women  <p>Share our commitment publicly. We added a commitment to diversity to our <a href="https://www.notion.so/About-3Box-Labs-7100eadf86624b1ba00793da29a08711">About Us</a> page. We will also begin sharing more from inside our team about this topic and related ones, starting with this post.</p> Invest in proactive sourcing <p>We will spend time, money and creativity to bring more candidates from a diverse set of backgrounds into our pipeline. A few actions we are taking towards this:</p><p>Tech talks: our team will start doing these far and wide in the tech world to build bridges in new communities (if you'd like to set one up, reach out!)</p><p>Be wary of opportunistic hires: these tend to be from similar backgrounds, and deprives us of an opportunity to build a more intentional pipeline. This is so hard because when a great candidate from our network emerges, it's likely a very high signal on a very strong candidate. We haven't ruled this out for certain specialized roles, but we cannot let it become a habit.</p> Refine our interview process to value difference and remove bias <p>A few changes we are making on this front: </p><p>Early rounds will focus on skills relevant to the role. Later rounds, with more of the team involved, will evaluate value alignment and teamwork so there are more perspectives to balance out potential biases.</p><p>Removed sources of bias from our scorecard. For example, we used to score candidates on if they "would bring energy to our team." The goal was to find people who would energize us to work with, but it ended up creating a tilt towards high-energy extroverts which was not the intent.</p><p>Add "Would bring a new dimension to the team" to our scorecard, to make sure we consider this for every candidate.</p> Ensure we operate as an inclusive team  <p>Most of our current efforts are focused on hiring. But equally essential is maintaining an inclusive team culture that is welcoming, inspiring, and comfortable to all. This is critical to retaining candidates and to make sure our outreach to new candidates is authentic. It also lets us all be happier and more productive, and comfortable being ourselves.</p> Seek help from groups and people doing great work in this arena <p>We have a lot to learn and a long way to go. There are great teams and individuals that we can learn from, support, and work with. We have a list of those we've already been inspired or educated by. Over time, we'll aim to partner with organizations driving diverse hiring in Web3, amplify the voices of those helping make Web3 a beacon of equity in tech, and make long-term commitments to support the most aligned communities.</p><p>We also continue to do more of this work in public. We hope this will allow others to learn from our experience and open opportunities to work together to improve the practices and norms throughout the ecosystem. We also hope it creates an opportunity for the community to provide feedback and advice back to us. We have a long ways to go and value any support, critiques, and help.</p> <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs Site</a> | <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord Community</a> </p><p></p>

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of ValidCert?</p>



<p>Our Mission is built on a foundation of Protection, Validation and Empowerment. The ValidCert Vision creates an Eco-System of Trust. Our Eco-System of Trust (1) Protects Digital Identity and Micro-Certificates (2) Provides Validation of Credentials by Government Approved Institutions (3) Empowers Life-Long Learning</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>There is a global need for upskilling and reskilling which is creating a focus on shorter courses and micro-credentials. The approach to education and learning is changing and the technology has to focus on protecting and providing a forum for Digital Identity and Credentials to help bridge the skills gap. If individuals, globally, can safely and efficiently claim who they are and share validated micro-credentials in a protected environment, this will have a positive impact on streamlining the hiring and recruiting process which directly adds economic value. Reducing fraud, protecting rights and increasing transparency can increase efficiency for existing and emerging markets.</p>
 



 
<a href="https://www.valid-cert.com/"></a>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>In order for Digital Identity to be successful, governments globally need to collaborate on creating interoperability to ensure individuals are protected when information is being shared. Risks need to be focused on, which include cybersecurity threats and data breaches. Digital Identity can be directly connected to economic value with increased use of financial services, increased access to employment opportunities all resulting in reduced costs and time savings for resources. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, a subset of key focus areas for Canada and governments globally include cost savings, reduced fraud, and improved labour productivity all impacting the economy. ValidCert addresses challenges associated with this transformation by focusing on the key focus areas. Our platform is low-cost focused on enhancing processes surrounding assigning micro-credentials, providing a platform for Students/Job Seekers that is supported by the Learning Institutions that 3rd parties, such as recruiters, are invited to review. We are protecting the identity of the Issuer, Assignee and the Viewer, who are all major players in our Trust Eco-System. This will assist in reducing fraud as well as ensure that individuals’ identities and credentials are validated to be a “fit” for the job they are seeking. This will save time and resources for hiring companies, whether private or public.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada has a very important role to play as a leader in digital identity and trust services. This includes developing, in collaboration with organizations and other countries, policies and frameworks to ensure acceptance of digital identities. Similar to a currency, Digital Identities need to have cross-border acceptance.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We joined DIACC because we have trust in the objectives and vision of DIACC and its’ members. DIACC is creating a collaborative community to share knowledge and information to create sustainable solutions for Canada and for other countries. As part of DIACC, we are fortunate to be a part of the SIG (special interest group) for Digital Credentials which is validating the ValidCert Mission and Vision. We are not only learning but sharing our technology, research and experiences in order to move the Digital ID Dial forward.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>We are utilizing the best of Private and Public Technology environments so institutions and individuals can decide what information they want to share. We are protecting the accomplishments of all existing and future users of the Valid-Cert Eco-System!</p>

     <p>Denver, CO (JULY 7, 2021) – Open banking is proving to be a game changer for financial services. Open banking is the structured sharing of data using application programming interfaces (APIs) between financial institutions and third-party providers. It helps financial institutions more efficiently partner with fintechs and it helps consumers more easily and securely leverage their data across solutions</p>
<p>CUFX, or the Credit Union Financial Exchange, has been the credit union industry’s open integration standard allowing credit unions to efficiently share data between banking systems, reduce redundancy, reduce technical complexity, drive down costs and improve speed to market. Since its inception, the credit union industry has greatly benefited from CUFX by supporting credit unions’ own API gateways or through easy integrations with third-party providers.</p>
<p>CUFX is expanding its support of open banking and interoperability by joining the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) consortium. FDX is a non-profit organization operating in the U.S. and Canada that is dedicated to unifying the financial industry around a common, interoperable and royalty-free standard for the secure access of user permissioned financial data, aptly named the FDX API. By collaborating with FDX, CUFX will enable credit unions and interested organizations to bridge both standards to leverage a broader, more interoperable transaction set and market reach.</p>
<p>“With CUFX as a protocol for the exchange of data, this membership will give credit unions a seat at the table with a best-in-class standards organization and help CUFX further evolve in support of digital identities, open banking and API exchanges,” says John Ainsworth, president/CEO of Bonifii.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to welcome CUFX to the Financial Data Exchange family,” said Don Cardinal, Managing Director of FDX. CUFX’s participation in our consortium will help FDX continue to connect credit unions of all sizes so that they can offer their customers API-based data sharing with third-party fintechs via a common industry standard,” added Cardinal.</p>
<p>With the pandemic causing credit unions to accelerate their digital strategies, now is the right time for credit unions to start to begin leveraging open banking to help them grow and compete as they serve their members.</p>

<p>MiCA WILL for sure try to maintain&nbsp; financial stability by&nbsp; keeping STABLE COINS under a STRICT regulation.</p>
 Will MiCA affect my project ? 
<p>MiCA imposes an obligation on issuers of crypto-assets to publish an information document (called whitepaper) with mandatory disclosure requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be exempted where the total consideration of the offering of crypto-assets is less than €1,000,000 over a period of 12 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issuers of ‘stablecoins’ will not be subject to authorisation by a national competent authority (NCA) if the outstanding amount of ’stablecoins’ is below €5,000,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MiCA is organized in eight&nbsp; titles (chapters):</p>
 
 Title I sets the subject matter, the scope and the definitions.&nbsp; 
 Title II regulates the CASP offerings and marketing of crypto-assets to the public.

 Creative workshop encourages hands-on experience to create questions about&nbsp;time Olivia Tai and Sarah Newman hosted the workshop.<p>by Grace&nbsp;McFadden</p><p>The philosophy of time can be introduced quite simply, according to Harvard Physicist Jacob Barandes: all it takes is a stack of pancakes.</p><p>Barandes was a guest speaker at “The Mysteries of Time in Physics and Philosophy,” the second in the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-05/2021-virtual-creative-spring-workshops">Creative Workshop series</a> that metaLAB is offering this summer designed and led by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/snewman">Sarah Newman</a>, Director of Art &amp; Education at <a href="https://metalabharvard.github.io/">metaLAB at Harvard</a>, and supported by Olivia Tai, a student at Harvard College and research assistant at metaLAB. The workshop brought together sixty attendees from seventeen different countries.</p><p>The event began with Barandes discussing presentism and eternalism, two different theories of how time works. This discussion formed the basis of a hands-on creative exercise led by Newman and Tai to explore the “mysteries of&nbsp;time.”</p><p>Barandes framed time as follows: “Think of each layer in the stack as a successive moment in time. Roughly speaking, if you’re standing still, you’re at the same place in each successive pancake. You’re at the same place in the bottom pancake, the next pancake, the next pancake.”</p><p>Presentism, explained Barandes, can be thought of as the idea that we all experience the same pancake at the same time. This universal present, which Barandes likened to a hot pancake, is the only one in which we exist. This also means that neither the future nor the past is&nbsp;real.</p><p>Barandes then explained how <a href="https://www.space.com/36273-theory-special-relativity.html">Einstein’s theory of special relativity</a> serves as a challenge to presentism, which he also referred to as the A Model of&nbsp;time.</p><p>“The special theory of relativity says we do not all experience pancakes the same way,” Barandes&nbsp;said.</p><p>As explained by Barandes, Einstein’s theory of special relativity says that because the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer, there are repercussions for how time happens to each person. He said that the familiar, everyday laws of physics dictate that if someone threw a baseball on an airplane, a person outside the airplane would perceive the baseball to be moving at the combined speed of the throw and the airplane.</p><p>“But if you shine a light with the flashlight on the airplane, what Einstein said was, you on the airplane will perceive light travelling at the speed of light. Someone on the ground looking up will also see light going at the same constant speed. Light doesn’t combine. This is a very weird thing, it means that somehow time and space have to change,” Barandes&nbsp;said.</p><p>Space and time being relative and interconnected serves as a challenge to the idea that the present is experienced universally.</p><p>“Maybe the most profound weirdness here is that if you’re moving relative to someone else, then your pancake slices are not horizontal. Your pancake slices are slightly diagonal. So you don’t slice the pancakes horizontally anymore. If you’re moving, you slice the pancakes a little bit diagonally,” Barandes said. “And if different observers in different states of motion slice the stack of pancakes differently, that’s a challenge to the notion that one pancake slice is the ‘hot’ one for everybody. So that’s a challenge to presentism.”</p><p>Eternalism, which, Barandes explained, is known as the B Model, holds that the past, present, and future are all equally&nbsp;real.</p><p>The talk by Barandes primed the audience to form questions about time. Newman then guided participants through exercises to explore their own questions about&nbsp;time.</p><p>Tai guided the audience through a short meditation. The object, explained Tai, was to experience time in a different way than we usually do in our busy&nbsp;lives.</p><p>“The experience of time can feel very different when you are turning your intention inwards rather than outwards,” Tai&nbsp;said.</p><p>As part of the pre-work to the event, participants were encouraged to spend 90 seconds creating a timeline of their lives, which they had the opportunity to share with others during the workshop. Newman then prompted the group to write down things they “knew”,“believed”, and “didn’t know”. Participants were then asked to do the same exercise, except focusing on their knowledge of&nbsp;time.</p><p>From there, participants used these thought experiments to generate two of their own questions about time, which formed the foundations of the final steps of the workshop: exploring these questions visually by drawing them, and then creating physical sculptures to represent their&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>In preparation for the event, participants had been asked to spend ten minutes gathering materials ranging from “something that changes in time” to “two things that rhyme with each other.” After choosing one of their questions about time, participants created a sculpture to represent their question using the objects they gathered prior to the&nbsp;event.</p>A sculpture created by participant <a href="https://twitter.com/dashiel_carrera/status/1403374002232610821">Dashiel&nbsp;Carrera</a>.<p>Sculptures created by participants sought to explore questions such as “Could we have a functioning society without a supposedly objective passage of time, measured by clocks?” and “What would it look like if we perceived space as time and vice versa?” The resulting prototypes from the event were made of materials including lichen, incense, dice, and a bedspring.</p><p>Newman’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/473445114">methodology</a> for her creative workshops emphasizes the importance of asking questions, the value of interdisciplinary perspectives on hard topics, and then using found materials to physically wrestle with these abstract ideas. This allows workshop attendees to free their thinking when it comes to concepts that can be difficult to conceptualize. The event received positive feedback from attendants, one of whom <a href="https://twitter.com/silviabauer/status/1403380086380892162">said</a> that “time passed at light-speed” during the workshop.</p><p>The final event in the Creative Workshop series, entitled “Telegrams to Telepathic Memos: The Future of Trust and Truth Online,” was held on June 25. The metaLAB team will be displaying the creations from this workshop series&nbsp;<a href="https://metaworkshops.cargo.site/">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/meditation-and-metaphorical-pancakes-exploring-the-philosophy-and-physics-of-time-with-metalab-4e24d7713062">Meditation and Metaphorical Pancakes: Exploring the philosophy and physics of time with metaLAB</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>Event Title: Evolving Disaster Recovery Strategy: From Physical Colocation to the Cloud</p>
<p>An effective disaster recovery (DR) strategy is essential to continuity of operations for Florida State University. Over the last several years, maximizing efficiency and performance while operating within budget has meant a move to cloud-based DR for essential systems. In this session, you’ll learn how FSU’s DR strategy has evolved over time, and how the shift to the cloud has provided benefits to both operational performance and budget.</p>
<p>Key takeaways include:</p>
 
 An understanding of the DR challenges facing FSU, and how they made the determination to shift to a cloud-based model 
 An understanding of the process of moving DR operations to the cloud from legacy colocation, from evaluation to execution 
 How and why FSU leveraged AWS CloudEndure to execute their new DR strategy, including a review of resources AWS makes available to institutions to facilitate success

<p>Conformance Testing for Measurable Goals</p><p>[Written in consultation with the Interoperability Working Group&nbsp;chairs]</p><p>A recurring topic in the Interoperability Working Group is that of defining short-, medium- and long-term goals or “targets” for interoperability. The topic comes up again every few months, and each time it does, the chairs try to tackle it head-on for a full meeting or two, some emails, and various off-line discussions, but doing so never seems to arrive at a satisfactory or definitive answer. Each time, what feels a Herculean outlay of effort only gets us a tentative resolution, as if we’d deflected a debt collector with a minimum payment. Dear reader, we would like to refinance, or at least restructure, this debt to our community!</p><p>In this two-part overview of our goals for 2021, we would like to survey the landscape of “provable,” testable interoperability targets and give some guidance on what we would like to see happen next in the testable interop world. Then, in a companion article, we will lay out clear proposal for parallel, distributed work on multiple fronts, such that progress can be distributed across various subcommunities and hubs of open cooperation, each reasonably confident that they are helping the big picture by “zooming in” on one set of problems.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christopherphigh">Christopher Paul&nbsp;High</a> A seemingly uncontroversial target&nbsp;state <p>Interoperation is a deceptively transparent etymology: any two things that perform a function are inter-operating if they can perform their operation together and mutually. Two fax machines interoperate if one sends a fax and the other receives it, which is a far more impressive feat if the two machines in question were designed and built by different companies on different continents, fifteen years apart. This is the kind of target state people usually have in mind when they imagine interoperability for an emerging technology.</p><p>This everyday example glosses over a lot of complexity and history, however. Standards bodies had already specified exact definitions of how the “handshake” is established between two unfamiliar fax machines before either model of fax machine was a twinkle in a design team’s eye. In addition to all the plodding, iterative standardization, there has also been a lot of economic trial and error and dead-ends we never heard about. Even acceptable margins of error and variance from the standards have been prototyped, refined, socialized, and normalized, such that generations of fax machines have taken them to heart, while entire factories have been set up to produce standard components like white-label fax chips and fax boards that can be used by many competing brands. On a software level, both design teams probably recycled some of the same libraries and low-level code, whether open-source or licensed.</p><p>Decomposing this example into its requirements at various levels shows how many interdependent and complex subsystems have to achieve internal maturity and sustainable relationships. A time-honored strategy is to treat each of these subsystems in a distinct, parallel maturation process and combine them gradually over time. The goal, after all, is not a working whole, but a working ecosystem. Architectural alternatives, for example, have to be debated carefully, particularly for disruptive and emerging technologies that redistribute power within business processes or ecosystems. Sharing (or better yet, responsibly open-sourcing and governing) common software libraries and low-level hardware specifications is often a “stitch in time” that saves nine later stitches, since it gives coordinators a stable baseline to work from,&nbsp;sooner.</p><p>Naturally, from even fifty or a hundred organizations committed to this target state, a thousand different (mostly sensible) strategies can arise. “How to proceed?” becomes a far-from-trivial question, even when all parties share many common goals and incentives. For instance, almost everyone:</p>  Wants to grow the pie of adoption and market&nbsp;interest  Holds privacy and decentralization as paramount commitments  Strives to avoid repeating the mistakes and assumptions of previous generations of internet technology  <p>And yet, all the same… both strategic and tactical differences arise, threatening to entrench themselves into camps or even schools of thought. How to achieve the same functional consensus on strategy as we have on principles? Our thesis here is that our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.</p> Today’s test suites and interoperability profiles <p>Perhaps the biggest differences turn out not to be about target state or principles, but about what exactly “conformance” means relative to what has already been specified and standardized. Namely, the core specifications for DIDs and VCs are both data models written in the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), which put protocols out of scope. This stems partly from the decisions of the groups convened in the W3C, and partly from a classic division of labor in the internet standards world between W3C, which traditionally governs the data models of web browser and servers, and a distinct group, the Internet Engineering Task Force&nbsp;(IETF).</p><p>VCs were specified first, with a preference (but not a requirement) for DIDs, with exact parameters for DIDs and DID systems deferred to a separate data model. Then, to accommodate entrenched and seemingly irreconcilable ideas about how DIDs could best be expressed, the DID data model was made less representationally-explicit and turned into an abstract data model. This shift to a representation-agnostic definition of DIDs, combined with the still-tentative and somewhat representation-specific communication and signing protocols defined to date, makes truly agnostic and cross-community data model conformance somewhat difficult to test. This holds back interoperability (and objective claims to conformance)!</p> W3C: Testing the core specifications <p>The only test suite associated with the core W3C specifications is the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/tree/main/packages/vc-http-api-test-server">VC-HTTP-API test suite </a>for VC data model conformance and the fledgling <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">DID-core test suite</a>, both worked on in the W3C-CCG. The former tests implementations of VC-handling systems against some pre-established sample data and test scripts through a deliberately generalized API interface that strives to be minimally opinionated with respect to context- and implementation-specific questions like API authentication. The latter is still taking shape, given that the DID spec has been very unstable in the home stretch of its editorial process arriving at CR this last&nbsp;week.</p><p>The VC-HTTP-API interface, specified collectively by the first <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">SVIP</a> funding cycle cohort for use in real-world VC systems, has been used in some contexts as a de facto general-purpose architecture profile, even if it is very open-ended on many architectural details traditionally specified in government or compliance profiles. Its authors and editors did not intend it to be the general-purpose profile for the VC data model generally, but in the absence of comparable alternatives, it is sometimes taken as one; it has perhaps taken on more of a definitive role than originally intended.</p><p>Following the second iteration of the SVIP program and the expansion of the cohort, the API and its test suite are poised to accrue features and coverage to make it more useful outside of its original context. Core participants have established a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/">weekly public call</a> at the CCG and a lively re-scoping/documentation process is currently underway to match the documentation and rationale documents to the diversity of contexts deploying the&nbsp;API.</p> Aries: End-to-end conformance testing <p>Other profiles, like the Aries interoperability profile, serve an important role, but it would be misleading to call it a VC data model test suite — it is more like an end-to-end test harness for showing successful implementation of the Aries protocols and architecture. Here “interoperability” means interoperability with other Aries systems, and conformance with the shared Aries interpretation of the standard VC data model and the protocols this community has defined on the basis of that interpretation.</p><p>Many matters specified by the W3C data model are abstracted out or addressed by shared libraries in Ursa, so its scope is not exactly coterminous with the W3C data model. Instead, the Aries interoperability profile has its own infrastructural focus, which focuses on scaling the privacy guarantees of blockchain-based ZKP systems. In many ways, this focus complements rather than supplants that of the W3C test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Many of the trickiest questions on which SSI systems differ are rooted in what the Aries and Trust-over-IP communities conceptualize as “<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack">layer 2</a>,” the connective infrastructural building-blocks connecting end-users to VCs and DIDs. As more and more features get added to be testable across language implementations, and as feature-parity is achieved with other systems (such as <a href="https://youtu.be/LC0OXAir3Qw">support for LD VCs</a>), the case for productive complementarity and deep interoperability gets easier and easier to&nbsp;make.</p> The first wave of local profiles and guidelines <p>Other specifications for decentralized-identity APIs and wallets, modelled on that W3C CCG and/or extending the work of Aries-based infrastructures, are starting to crop up around the world. So far these have all arisen out of ambitious government-funded programs to build infrastructure, often with an eye to local governance or healthy competition. Canada and the European Commission are the most high-profile ones to date, building on earlier work in Spain, the UK, and elsewhere; Germany and other countries funding next-generation trust frameworks may soon follow&nbsp;suit.</p><p>It is important, however, to avoid framing these tentative, sometimes cautious attempts at bridging status quo and new models as universal standards. If anything, these frameworks tend to come with major caveats and maturity disclaimers, on top of having carefully narrowed scopes. After all, they are generally the work of experienced regulators, inheriting decades of work exploring identity and infrastructural technologies through a patchwork of requirements and local profiles that tend to align over time. If they are designed with enough circumspection and dialogue, conformance with one should never make conformance with another impossible. (The authors would here like to extend heartfelt sympathy to all DIF members currently trying to conform to multiple of these at&nbsp;once!)</p><p>These profiles test concrete and specific interpretations of a shared data model that provide a testing benchmark for regulatory “green lighting” of specific implementations and perhaps even whole frameworks. Particularly when they specify best practices or requirements for security and API design, they create testable standardization by making explicit their opinions and assumptions about:</p>  approved cryptography,  auditing capabilities,  privacy requirements, and  API access/authentication  <p>These will probably always differ and make a universal abstraction impossible; and that’s not a bad thing! These requirements are always going to be specific to each regulatory context, and without them, innovation (and large-scale investment) are endangered by regulatory uncertainty. Navigating these multiple profiles is going to be a challenge in the coming years, as more of them come online and their differences come into relief as a stumbling block for widely-interoperable protocols with potentially global&nbsp;reach.</p><p>The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/setting-interoperability-targets-part-1-of-2-c6cbeaf82e98">Setting Interoperability Targets Part 1 of 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Medium-term interoperability challenges</p><p>[Written in consultation with the Interoperability Working Group chairs]</p><p>In our <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets/">last essay</a>, we explored the means and ends of interoperability targets and roadmapping across stacks and markets. “Interoperability,” like “standardization,” can be a general-purpose tool or an umbrella of concepts, but rarely works from the top-down. &nbsp;Instead, specific use-cases, consortia, contexts, and industries have to take the lead and prototype something more humble and specific like an “interoperability profile”-- over time, these propagate, get extended, get generalized, and congeal into a more universal and stable standard. Now, we’ll move on to some technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across stacks.</p><blockquote>What makes sense to start aligning now? What are some sensible scopes for interoperating today, or yesterday, to get our fledgling market to maturity and stability as soon as safely possible?</blockquote>Ponte Vecchio, Fiorenze, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/GHoX7zFRMMU">Ray Harrington</a> From testable goals to discrete scopes <p>The last few months have seen a shift in terminology and approach, as many groups turn their attention from broad “interoperability testing” to more focused “profiles” that test one subset of the optionalities and capabilities in a larger test suite or protocol definition. This decoupling of test suites from multiple profiles each suite can test helps any one profile from ossifying into a “universal” definition of decentralized identity’s core featureset. </p><p>As with any other emerging software field, every use case and context has its own interoperability priorities and constraints that narrow down the technological solution space into a manageable set of tradeoffs and decisions. &nbsp;For instance, end-user identification at various levels of assurance is often the most important implementation detail for, say, a retail bank, and DID-interoperability (which is not always the same thing!) might be a hardware manufacturer’s primary concern in being able to secure hardware supply chains. </p><p>Every industry has its unique set of minimum security guarantees, and VC-interoperability is obviously front-of-mind for credentialing use-cases. For example, in the medical data space, “Semantics” (data interpretation and metadata) might be a harder problem (or a more political one) than the mechanics of identity assurance, since high standards of end-user privacy and identity assurance have already made for a relatively interoperable starting points. &nbsp; Which exact subset of the many possible interoperability roadmaps is safest or most mission-critical for a given organization depends on many factors: the regulatory context, the culture of the relevant sectors, its incentive-structures, and its <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">business models</a>. </p><p>Cross-cutting industry verticals, however, are structural issues with how decentralized identity stacks and architecture vary, which can already been seen today. &nbsp;By applying “first principles,” (or in our case, the “<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">functions</a>” of a decentralized identity system and its many moving parts) across use-cases and industrial contexts, certain shared problems arise. As is our default approach in DIF Interop WG, we applied DIF’s in-house <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/interop-mapping-version-by-Hakan-Yildiz(TUB).pdf">mental model</a> of the “5 layers” of decentralized identity systems, sometimes called “the 4+1 layers”. (See also the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/raw/master/assets/crosscommunity-architecture-survey-oct-2020.pdf">more detailed version</a>).</p><p>We call these the “4+1” layers because our group agreed that a strict layering was not possible, and that all the architectures we compared for using verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers had to make major architectural decisions with consequences across all four of the more properly “layered” categories. This fifth category we named “transversal considerations,” since they traverse the layers and often come from architectural constraints imposed by regulation, industrial context, etc. Foremost among these are storage and authorization, the two most vexing and cross-cutting problems in software generally; these would justify an entirely separate article.</p><p>In a sense, none of the topics from this transversal category are good candidates for specification in the medium-term across verticals and communities-- they are simply too big as problems, rarely specific to identity issues, and being addressed elsewhere. These include “storage” (subject of our newest <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working group</a>), “authorization” (debatably the core problem of all computer science!), “cryptographic primitives”, and “compliance.” (These last two are each the subject of a new working group, <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/crypto.html">Applied Cryptography</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallet Security</a>!). These interoperability scopes are quite difficult to tackle quickly, or without a strong standards background. Indeed, these kinds of foundational changes require <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">incremental advances</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">broad cooperation</a> with large community organizations. This is slow, foundation work that needs to connect parallel work across data governance, authentication/authorization, and storage in software more generally.</p><p>Similarly, the fourth layer, where ecosystem-, platform-, and industry-specific considerations constrain application design and business models, is unlikely to crystallize into a problem space calling out for a single specification or prototype in the medium-term future. Here, markets are splintered and it is unclear what can be repurposed or recycled outside of its original context. Even if there were cases where specification at this later would be timely, DIF members might well choose to discuss those kinds of governance issues at our sister-organizations in the space that more centrally address data governance at industry-, ecosystem-, or national- scale: <a href="http://trustoverip.org">Trust over IP</a> was chartered to design large-scale governance processes, and older organizations like <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData.org</a> and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> also have working groups and publications on vertical-specific and jurisdiction-specific best practices for picking interoperable protocols and data formats.</p><p>That still leaves three “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is our contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community-- and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all three.</p> Scope #1: Verifiable Credential Exchange <p>The most clear and consensus-building, even urgent way forward is to bring clarity to Verifiable Credential exchange across stacks. &nbsp;This has been the primary focus of our WG for the last year. Given that most of the early ecosystem-scale interest in SSI revolves around <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#vc-infrastructure-layer-3">credentialing</a> (educational credentials, employment credentials, health records), it is highly strategic to get translation and unified protocols into place soon for the interoperable verification and cross-issuance of credentials. </p><p>In fact, there has actually been a lot of good progress made since Daniel Hardman wrote an <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">essay</a> on the Evernym blog making a pragmatic case for sidestepping differences in architecture and approach to exchange VCs sooner. This aligned with much of our group’s work in recent months, which has included a <a href="https://hackmd.io/t1cotiReTXCnkpDG8k2tVA#THE-MAIN-EVENT">survey of VC formats</a> among organizations producing “wallets” for verifiable credentials (be they “edge” wallets or otherwise). Our group has also sought to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8j6niRuFWTjVMIXqmw3zX-4KkLt-sli8">assist educational efforts</a> at the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>, in the Claims and Credentials <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">working group</a>, and elsewhere to make wallet-producing organizations aware of the relevant <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/vc-spec-map">specifications</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/dif/be6763341a014d248f655aea187d7890?v=c9ac48a07f3d411c9a1bea32b55f7e76">other references</a> needed to make their wallets multi-format sooner and less painfully. Much of this work was crystalized into an <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">article</a> by co-chair Kaliya Young and crowd-edited by the whole group; this work was a major guiding structure for the Good Health Pass work that sought to make a common health record format (exported from FHIR systems) equally holdable and presentable across all of today’s VC systems.</p><p>One outgrowth of this effort and other alignments that have taken place since Hardman’s and Young’s article is the work of prototyping a multi-community exchange protocol that allow a subset of each stack’s capabilities and modes to interoperate. This tentative, “minimum viable profile” is called <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">WACI-PEx</a> and is currently a work item of the Claims and Credentials working group. Work is ongoing on v0.1, and an ambitious, more fully-featured v1 is planned for after that. This profile acts as an “extension” of the broader Presentation Exchange protocol, giving a handy “cheat sheet” for cross-stack wallet-to-issuer/verifier handshakes so that developers not familiar with all the stacks and protocols being spanned have a starting point for VC exchanges. &nbsp;Crucially, the results of this collaborative prototype will be taken as inputs to future versions of the DIDComm protocols and the WACI specification for Presentation Exchange. </p><p>Note: There has been some discussion of a OIDC-Presentation Exchange profile at some point in the future, but given that the alignment of DIDComm and Presentation Exchange started over a year ago, the most likely outcome is that work on this would not start until after v1 has been released of the “WACI-PEx” profile for DIDComm has been released.</p> Scope #2: Anchoring layer <p>Of course, other forms of alignment are possible as well in the “bottom 3” layers of the traditional stack, while we wait on the ambitious transversal alignment specifications and the ongoing work to align and simplify cross-format support for VCs (and perhaps even multi-format VCs, as Hardman points out in the essay above). </p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery</a> WG at DIF has long housed many work items to align on the lowest level of stack, including general-purpose <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-common-java">common libraries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">recovery mechanisms</a>. It has also received many donations that contribute to method-level alignment, including a recent <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/trinsic-donates-did-key-rs-to-i-d-wg-8a278f37bcd0?source=friends_link&amp;sk=dbd175f5db9107ed1e9d953a386441a4">DID-Key implementation</a> and a linked-data <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-document-loader">document loader</a> donated by Transmute. The group has also served as a friendly gathering point for discussing calls for input from the DID-core working group at W3C and for proposing W3C-CCG work items.</p><p>One particularly noteworthy initiative of the group has been the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540?source=friends_link&amp;sk=306a37f289dcf61a89d19cd11f5be04e">Universal Resolver</a> project, which offers a kind of “trusted middleware” approach to DID resolution across methods. This prototype of a general-use server allows any SSI system (or non-SSI system) to submit a DID and get back a trustworthy DID Document, without needing any knowledge of or access to (much less current knowledge of or authenticated access to) the “black box” of the participating DID methods. While this project only extends “passive interoperability” to DIDs, i.e., only allowing DID document querying, a more ambitious sister project, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, strives to bring a core set of CRUD capabilities to DID documents for DID methods willing to contribute drivers. Both projects have dedicated weekly calls on the DIF calendar, for people looking to submit drivers or get otherwise involved.</p> Scope #3: “Agent”/Infrastructure Layer <p>There is another layer, however, in between DIDs and VCs, about which we haven’t spoken yet: the crucial “agent layer” in the ToIP/Aries mental model, which encompasses trusted infrastructure whether in or outside of conventional clouds. The Aries Project has scaled up an impressively mature ecosystem of companies and experimenters, largely thanks to the robust infrastructure layer it built (and abstracting away from application-layer developers and experimenters).</p><p>Until now, differences of strategy with respect to conventional clouds and infrastructures have prevented large-scale cooperation and standardization at this layer outside of Aries and the DID-Comm project. Partly, this has been a natural outgrowth of the drastically different infrastructural needs and assumptions of non-human, enterprise, and consumer-facing/individual use cases, which differ more at this level than above or below. Partly, this is a function of the economics of our sector’s short history, largely influenced by the infrastructure strategies of cloud providers and telecommunication concerns.</p><p>This is starting to change, however, now that agent frameworks inspired by the precedent set by the Aries frameworks have come into maturity. Mattr’s <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/verifiable-credentials-with-auth0-and-mattr/">VIII Platform</a>, the Affinidi framework SDK (including open-source <a href="https://docs.affinidi.com/interop">components by</a> DIF members Bloom, Transmute, and Jolocom), ConsenSys’ own modular, highly <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/veramo_agent/plugins">extensible</a> and interoperable <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> platform, and most recently Spruce ID’s very <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">DID-method-agnostic</a> <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a>/<a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">Credible</a> SDK all offer open-source, extensible, and scalable infrastructure layers that are driving the space towards greater modularity and alignment at this layer. </p><p>As these platforms and “end-to-end stacks” evolve into frameworks extensible and capacious enough to house ecosystems, DIF expects alignment and harmonization to develop. This could mean standardization of specific components at this layer, for example:</p>  The DIDComm protocol could expand into new <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-looker-jwm-01.html">envelopes</a> and transports  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">Control recovery</a> mechanisms could be specified across implementations or even standardized on a technical and/or UX level  Auditing or historical-query requirements could be specified to form a cross-framework protocol or primitive  Common usages of foreign function interfaces, remote procedure calls like gRPC and JSON-RPC, or other forms of “glue” allowing elements to be reused or mixed and matched across languages and architectures could be specified as a community<br>  <p>We are very much in early days, but some see on the horizon a day when frameworks that don’t cooperate with one another can’t compete with the ones that join forces. After all, adoption brings growing pains, particularly for the labor market-- aligning on architectures and frameworks makes onboarding developers and transferring experience that much easier to do!</p> Next Steps <p>I would encourage anyone who has read this far to pick at least one of the three scopes mentioned above and ask themselves how they are helping along this alignment process in their day-to-day work, and if they truly understand what major players at that level are doing. Often large for-profit companies pay the most attention to what their competitors are doing, but here it is important to think outside of competition and look instead at non-profit organizations, regulators, and coalitions of various kinds to really see where the puck is heading. Sometimes consensus on one level is blocking compromise somewhere else. &nbsp;It can be pretty hard to follow!</p><p>In recent articles, DIF has encouraged its members to think about an open-source strategy as comparably important to a business plan, a living document and guiding philosophy. I would like to suggest that the subset of DIF companies working with VCs and DIDs should also think of interoperability strategy and conformance testing as the most crucial pillar of that strategy-- if you cannot demonstrate interoperability, you might be asking people to take that strategy on faith!</p>

	<p>When is Independence Day for&nbsp;the Digital World?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m writing this on USA’s Independence Day 2021. I’ve been thinking a lot about freedom—especially in the digital world. Mainly because it doesn’t exist&nbsp;there (or&nbsp;here, since I’m posting this online).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some time, the Me2B Alliance has been working on easy-to-understand educational material to better convey the particular harms visited upon us through the “Invisible Parallel Dataverse”, which is mainly embodied through a vast network of entities artfully calling themselves a “media ecosystem” but which is in fact the massive infrastructure and industry of Digital Advertising.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The magnitude and complexity of the AdTech&nbsp;machine&nbsp;is a natural deterrent for most of us—“I can’t make sense of that; too complicated, too arcane, too opaque.” Turns out, it’s not at all opaque. The detailed underpinnings that have borne&nbsp;that&nbsp;vast ecosystem have been hiding in plain sight for years, in publicly available&nbsp;protocols and specifications at the IAB Tech Lab. I count myself among the many who didn’t turn their full gaze onto the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, with the help of incredibly talented people like our lead data flow tester, Zach Edwards, I’m&nbsp;slowly&nbsp;learning the full magnitude of the situation. And here’s&nbsp;my pithy summary:&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many things are “free” on the internet,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are anything but free in the digital world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me try to paint&nbsp;a picture of&nbsp;one piece of the problem here: we call it the Invisible Parallel&nbsp;Dataverse.&nbsp;We all&nbsp;careen&nbsp;around the web, driving our fancy browser-mobiles,&nbsp;opening websites,&nbsp;or&nbsp;downloading&nbsp;and installing&nbsp;apps. We are&nbsp;in control of&nbsp;things as we&nbsp;traverse the digital world.&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp;It may&nbsp;feel&nbsp;like that,&nbsp;but&nbsp;in reality, there&nbsp;is an Invisible Parallel&nbsp;Dataverse&nbsp;which is constantly watching us, talking about us behind our backs [like THOUSANDS of orgs], trying to get us to buy more, click this, do that, spend more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Invisible Parallel&nbsp;Dataverse&nbsp;is fueled by an equally invisible [to users] infrastructure that is ubiquitous—on every website, in every app—EVERYWHERE. It doesn’t matter what cookie settings you disable/enable.&nbsp; (In fact, I’m&nbsp;increasingly convinced that&nbsp;cookie settings are a trivial “bone” being thrown to us&nbsp;panting dogs, to pacify and provide a semblance of control.)&nbsp;In reality, advertising&nbsp;technology executes the moment the web page opens, and the minute you open an app—and sometimes the&nbsp;adtech&nbsp;code&nbsp;runs when no ad&nbsp;is&nbsp;presented to the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The browser you’re using constantly sends the latest reports on your behavior to this advertising ecosystem every time you open a new page—cookie,&nbsp;shmookie, data about you is shared externally no matter what.&nbsp; NOTE: not just&nbsp;when you open&nbsp;a new website&nbsp;or page, but even multiple times on the&nbsp;same page.&nbsp;The browser isn’t being a sneaky bastard here; it’s in many ways “dumb”,&nbsp;it’s blindly executing the HTML and&nbsp;Javascript&nbsp;code&nbsp;that define the contents of&nbsp;the&nbsp;page materializing before your eyes.&nbsp;One or more of the code snippets in that package of page-code is&nbsp;for an&nbsp;Ad, which will send an Ad Request containing&nbsp;some&nbsp;info about you off into the&nbsp;vast hinterland of the&nbsp;AdTech network. This innocuous single message results in:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Your latest browsing information being sent to literally thousands of entities within the&nbsp;adtech&nbsp;ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your browsing activity is one of the most intimate snapshots&nbsp;of&nbsp;who you are;&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;elaborately and specifically detailed&nbsp;by&nbsp;the things you look for online, how much time you spend looking at them, what you click on, what you buy—nevermind&nbsp;coupling that with other information the browser has access to—like&nbsp;on&nbsp;which sites you have accounts/login credentials&nbsp;[we call these “Me2B Marriages”]. 
 And while some of the data in the Ad Request may not seem “personal”, the real dark magic of the adtech ecosystem is that the vast network of THOUSANDS of entities who receive that first “Ad Request” at the start of the RealTime Bidding (RTB) system masterfully correlate whatever meager (or not so meager) crumbs of data from the Ad Request to you, specifically– your sweet little self, doggedly searching for an air conditioner repair person on a Sunday in August in the remote desert in Nevada even though you’re usually in church at this time–that you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, these profiles can be used for ANY purpose whatsoever, because the&nbsp;adtech&nbsp;technology is ungoverned and unmonitored.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>For now, that is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Johnny Ryan and a group of dedicated lawyers and researchers have been persistently working to expose the realities of AdTech, first at <a href="https://brave.com/rtb-updates/">Brave</a>,&nbsp;and now at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iccl.ie/rtb-june-2021/">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a>&nbsp;(ICCL).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>His latest effort&nbsp;at the ICCL&nbsp;will once again&nbsp;take to the courts&nbsp;–&nbsp;Hamburg, Germany&nbsp;this time&nbsp;–&nbsp;to convince the authorities that&nbsp;this&nbsp;RTB&nbsp;adtech&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;systematically and at vast scale&nbsp;violates&nbsp;GDPR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth&nbsp;is, this RTB machinery violates human freedom itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ICCL website has some excellent materials to&nbsp;explain the case, and it accurately describes RTB as the&nbsp;world’s&nbsp;biggest&nbsp;data breach. Well, nearly accurately–I offer this refinement:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The&nbsp;world’s biggest&nbsp;ongoing, ceaseless&nbsp;data breach.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this day of&nbsp;celebrating hard fought and won freedoms in the United States, the Me2B Alliance picks up the mantle to continue the fight for freedom in the Digital World. We assert our support of the ICCL and their&nbsp;pivotal&nbsp;case against RTB.&nbsp;&nbsp;How this&nbsp;intention&nbsp;will manifest remains to be&nbsp;defined, but&nbsp;watch this space. Or better yet, come&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/membership/">join us</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;help create that future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a Me Should Do&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn’t comprehensive, but&nbsp;first of all,&nbsp;we recommend&nbsp;using&nbsp;either an ad-blocking browser&nbsp;like&nbsp;Mozilla’s Firefox,&nbsp;and&nbsp;install an ad-blocking browser extension, like&nbsp;the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s&nbsp;<a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, enable all privacy settings on your mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;please consider supporting&nbsp;the work at the ICCL to make sure that this landmark GDPR case succeeds, paving the way for freedom in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Newark, NJ, July 1, 2021 – Edge, the region’s nonprofit research and education network and technology partner, has announced that two members of the organization’s leadership team have been elected to key volunteer roles on the New Jersey Big Data Alliance’s Executive Committee. Dr. Forough Ghahramani and Adam Scarzafava have been elected as Vice President, Research Collaborations Committee, and Vice President, Academic Members Committee, respectively.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Big Data Alliance (NJBDA) is a consortium of 18 higher education institutions and Edge, as well as industry and government members, that builds and leverages collaborations to increase competitiveness, generate a highly skilled workforce, drive innovation, and catalyze data-driven economic growth for New Jersey.</p>
<p>Dr. Forough Ghahramani is Edge’s Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs. As VP, Research Collaborations Committee for the NJBDA, Dr. Ghahramani will be responsible for creating opportunities for advancing the research mission of the NJBDA by engaging the research community, identifying collaborative research opportunities, as well as expanding the reach for the Journal of Big Data Theory and Practice (JBDTP). &nbsp;“I’m excited to have been elected by my peers in the NJBDA to serve as the VP, Research Collaborations Committee,” said Dr. Ghahramani. “The opportunity to lead NJBDA’s collaborative research efforts and work with researchers from such a diverse group of institutions to drive research and discovery and economic development in New Jersey is inspiring. I look forward to engaging the research community through focused events and activities to increase research collaboration opportunities and highlight New Jersey’s big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence research, and to promote NJBDA’s Journal of Big Data Theory and Practice as a premier open access peer-reviewed publication, through publication of high quality papers.“</p>
<p>Adam Scarzafava is Edge’s Associate Vice President for Marketing and Communications. Now in his second term as VP, Academic Members Committee for the NJBDA, he’ll engage with new prospective members to outline the benefits of participation in the organization, and use feedback from current academic members to continue to improve the benefits and services available to them through the group.</p>
<p>“I appreciate the opportunity to continue to serve the NJBDA in a second term as VP, Academic Members Committee. In the last several years, we’ve added new members and voices to the NJBDA committee. I look forward to the opportunity to further build the organization’s member base, and advocate for the needs of those members as they pursue collaboration and innovation in research and big data fields,” Scarzafava said.</p>

<p>By Guy Martin, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>So much is happening here at OASIS Open in June, but I’m especially excited that our <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/foundation-as-a-service/">Foundation-as-a-Service</a> (FaaS) program has expanded to include <a href="https://samvera.org/">Samvera</a>, a community widely respected for its work promoting best-in-class digital asset management solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OASIS designed our FaaS program with new groups in mind, because we wanted to make it easier for communities to get off the ground by giving them a place within our legal infrastructure where they could operate independently under their own governance rules if our Open Project structure wasn’t a good fit for their needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Samvera does not need help getting off the ground. The group was founded in 2008 as Hydra and has grown to more than 30 partners and more than 40 adopters around the world. Its focus, then and now, is on collaborative development of repository solutions for the digital collections held by libraries, archives, museums, and other organizations. ‘Samvera’ means ‘togetherness’ in Icelandic–a fitting name for a group committed to the belief that challenges are best solved through combined effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve come to know Samvera as a vibrant, welcoming group of information and technology professionals. Their software is free and open source, available under an Apache 2 license, and their suite of repository software tools offers flexible and rich user interfaces tailored to distinct content types on top of a robust back end.&nbsp;</p>

	 WHAT IS THE ME2B ALLIANCE: A Safety Standard for the Internet 
 
 
 
 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;June 21, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
The Me2B Alliance is a 501c3 nonprofit creating a safe and just digital world through standards development and independent technology testing. We are a new type of Standards Developing Organization (SDO) – involving everyday people in creating the standard for safe and respectful technology. We also perform independent testing and audits of connected technology, like websites and mobile apps.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	 
 
 
 
 What are standards and who develops them? 
<p>Standards are norms or requirements for various industries and their products. They are usually created by Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs), also known as Standards Setting Organizations (SSOs). From Wikipedia:</p>
 
 
 
 

	 
 

	 
 <p>[a Standards Developing Organization] is an organization whose primary function is…producing technical standards to address the needs of a group of affected adopters…Most standards are voluntary…without being mandated in law. Some standards become mandatory when they are adopted by regulators as legal requirements in particular domains, often for the purpose of safety or for consumer protection from deceitful practices.”</p>

 	 

 

	
	 
 
 
 
<p>Industry standards grow markets and consumer choices by establishinginteroperability, safety or performance norms for an existing or emerging industry. Standards take an average of three years to be developed and approved1, and typically another one to three years before the standard appears in commercial products.</p>
 What kind of standard is the Me2B Alliance developing? 
<p>The Me2B Alliance is creating a safety standard for the internet. The world is waking up to online harms related to unfettered data acquisition and the deliberate manipulation of end users in the digital world. We need a safety standard for internet connected products and services to ensure that they treat us with respect.</p>
<p>Our Respectful Tech Specification is designed to objectively measure the ethical behavior of connected technology. Version 1.0 (in development) covers websites and mobile apps and focuses on what we consider to be the bare minimum of respectful behavior. In its fullest realization, the specification will include tests for every possible digital harm that’s listed in our Digital Harms Dictionary, for every kind of connected technology.</p>
 What are some other safety standards? 
<p>Safety standards are often “invisible” to consumers. For example, ASTM International has over 12,000 standards ranging from from cribs, toys, and trampolines, to aircraft manufacturing. Other safety standards are better known such as Underwriters Labs (UL), which measures the safety of electrical products, visible through the sticker or tag on household appliances like toasters. The US government’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, which keep people safe in their workplaces, are also widely recognized.</p>
 How is the Me2B Alliance different from other SDOs? 
<p>There is increasing global attention on the social and ethical impacts of technology as an integral aspect of standards development.2 Nevertheless, SDO membership has traditionally been limited to industry representatives and experts in their fields – either independent participants or “delegates” from relevant companies. Everyday people – the “experiential experts” who use the technology regularly – are rarely involved.</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance approach is different – we encourage and invite everyday people to have a voice in the standards development process. We’re structured as an SDO, but we believe it is essential to bring everyday people actively into the process of creating an ethical and respectful standard for measuring technology. Interested people can become members and participate in the Respectful Technology Specifications Working Group or signing up for Me2B Research Panels and sharing opinions on critical issues through surveys and interviews that help us consistently validate our specifications.</p>
 Why does the Me2B Alliance perform independent testing? 
<p>Currently, internet technology is largely ungoverned (especially in the US), and presents many risks and potential harms to users. Safety risks are often unknowable at the introduction of new technology, but every new technology eventually gives rise to corresponding “safety standards” to ensure human safety – for instance, automobiles, televisions, telephony. The internet is overdue for a safety standard.</p>
<p>Our goal is to empower people—and businesses— with information about how safe and respectful a product or service is, so that people can make more informed choices about the technology they use, and businesses can know how to build respectful and safe products.</p>
 What kind of independent testing does the Me2B Alliance perform? 
<p>The Me2B Alliance performs independent testing of digital products and services, measuring risks and potential harms to people. Our current independent testing services include:</p>
 
 Analysis of public products and services, such as the work described in our Spotlight Report on data sharing in K-12 education “utility” apps. 
 Auditing services for developers of mobile apps and websites, based on the Me2B Respectful Tech Specification. Our auditing services help businesses know how to make their websites and mobile apps more respectful. Please contact us if you’re interested in having your site or app audited. 
 In the future, as the specification matures, we will introduce Me2B Certification, for websites and apps that pass our rigorous testing. 
 
 Why trust us? 
<p>The Me2B Alliance is proud to have some of the best privacy, legal, technology, business and digital interaction experts in the industry leading our efforts. Restoring respect and safety in digital interactions is our unwavering passion, and our standard reflects an uncompromisingly high bar—one which most products do not currently meet. Our standard is developed by the expert volunteers involved in the working group, and we conduct ongoing validation testing with everyday “Me-s” on key parts of the standard.</p>

This update will improve EWC performance and security, and keep the EWC aligned with the latest developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.  If you are running an EWC node, you must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update it to a Berlin-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+Berlin+Hardfork">update the chainspec</a> as soon as possible. EWC validators have already completed all the necessary updates.  If you are an EWC user or EWT holder, no action is required.  <p>In April 2021 the Ethereum mainnet implemented the Berlin upgrade, which introduced four improvement proposals (i.e., <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565">EIP-2565</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718">EIP-2718</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929">EIP-2929</a>, and <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930">EIP-2930</a>) that modified gas prices and created new transaction types. Combined, these updates improve the overall performance and security of EVM blockchains (including the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain).</p><p>In May 2021, after observing the successful Ethereum upgrade, <a href="https://validators.energyweb.org/">the EWC validators</a> voted to adopt Berlin on the EWC as well. Since then the EWC validators have successfully implemented the upgrade on the <a href="https://volta-explorer.energyweb.org/">Volta test network</a> and are now preparing for the upgrade to occur on the main&nbsp;EWC.</p><p>The EWC Berlin upgrade will occur at <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org">block 12,649,625</a>, which will occur on or around Tuesday, 6 July (the precise time will depend on block time variation). All full node operators must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update their node to a Berlin-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+Berlin+Hardfork">implement the Berlin chainspec</a> prior to the hard fork transition block. Due to subtle variations in the EWC block time, it is recommended to perform the update several days prior to the expected transition date.</p> FAQ <p>Who does this announcement impact?</p><blockquote>This announcement only impacts people or organizations that are operating a full node on the EWC. All EWC node operators should update the client and chainspec as soon as possible. As of the time of publication, all EWC validators have already completed the necessary updates to successfully implement the Berlin upgrades.</blockquote><p>If I’m an EWT holder but I’m not operating my own full node, is there anything I need to&nbsp;do?</p><blockquote>No, if you connect to the EWC via the public RPC and Metamask, an exchange (including Kucoin, Kraken, Liquid, Bitmart, or Hotbit), a web wallet (e.g., MyCrypto), or hardware wallet (e.g., Trezor, Ledger) then you do not need to take any&nbsp;action.</blockquote><p>Why is the Berlin upgrade happening on the&nbsp;EWC?</p><blockquote>The <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">EWC is a public, proof-of-authority EVM blockchain</a> and it benefits from adopting the latest upgrades and improvements from the wider Ethereum community. The EWC validators voted to adopt the upgrades contained in the Berlin fork in May&nbsp;2021.</blockquote><p>What will happen before, during, and after the&nbsp;upgrade?</p><p>As mentioned above, the decision to proceed with the upgrade is made by the EWC validators via the established governance process. After the decision is approved and before the upgrade occurs, all EWC validators and other node operators will update their node clients and chainspecs. During the upgrade (i.e., at the specified transition block), the new rules defined within the improvement proposals will take effect, creating a “new and improved” version of the EWC. There are no expected operational or performance impacts to the EWC during the upgrade. Following the upgrade, users and node operators can continue to interact with the EWC as&nbsp;normal.</p><p>If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please get in touch via our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/psraNwqGqp">Discord</a> channels.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/announcing-the-berlin-upgrade-on-the-energy-web-chain-98c8da76054b">Announcing the Berlin Upgrade on the Energy Web Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Still frame from The Intersection<p>By Julia Solano, Eshanthi Ranasinghe, and Nicole Allred, Exploration &amp; Future Sensing, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p> The Intersection, a short film in collaboration with Superflux, creates a hopeful future that reimagines extractive, hyperconnected technology to serve community, support nature, and value human relationships. Watch&nbsp;<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/569842501?badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479">here</a>. <p>My low balance of -$1.50 glows red above my wrist as I cross through the turnstile and enter the station. Options to top up via crypto or credit are greyed out on my digital wallet; those accounts are empty. Guess I’m watching the ads today, just like they’re watching&nbsp;me.</p><p>As I sit down on the train, images — shoes I’ve always wanted, modeled by my favorite influencers, with payment plans to shrug off my empty bank account — flash before my eyes. There’s no hiding from them — the algorithms track my eye-movement, my heartbeat, my temperature. They know what I want before I&nbsp;do…</p><p>Technology is causing our perception of reality — and of each other — to splinter. The same stories and facts can be twisted and contorted to fit a desired narrative depending on which slice of the web we are tuned into. Social media content is engineered for our reaction, “taking our hopes and fears, our pain and suffering and using it as content between ads” (The Intersection); pitting us against each other in a race to the bottom line. We live in fundamentally different worlds — each with its own set of facts — depending on the media we&nbsp;consume.</p><blockquote>The average person touches their phone 2,617 times every day, and cellphone addiction (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/nomophobia">nomophobia</a>: the fear of going without your phone) is rising. This begs the question: Are we driving technology, or is our technology driving&nbsp;us?</blockquote>Still frame from The Intersection What if this reality wasn’t limited to our&nbsp;screens? <p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/ingestibles-wearables-and-embeddables">Ingestibles, wearables, embeddables</a>; smart homes and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/02/ring-camera-fears/">peer-to-peer surveillance</a>; the Internet of Things (IoT) and <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/industrial-internet-of-things-iiot">Industrial IoT</a>; 5G; <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/smart-cities-digital-solutions-for-a-more-livable-future">smart cities</a>; facial recognition, temperature checking <a href="https://dronelife.com/2020/03/31/this-pandemic-drone-can-see-who-has-a-temperature-or-coughs/">pandemic drones</a>, and satellite imagery — a new layer of ambient (ever-present, always-on, hyper-connected) technology is seamlessly enveloping the world around us. Ambient data collection and algorithmic decision-making allow our physical environments, like our devices, to be infiltrated with information and metadata constantly gleaned from our search histories, our purchases, our locations, our sleep patterns, our menstrual cycles.</p><p>Our physical and digital worlds are developing to become almost indistinguishable. This web of ambient technology is shaping our new reality. Question is, is that what we&nbsp;want?</p><blockquote>With the encompassing and interconnected nature of ambient technology, we are barreling towards a society in which each interaction with the physical and digital world is fair game for extraction and exploitation.</blockquote><p>This world isn’t science fiction — its creation is in progress, atop a complex web of existing technologies and systems already leveraging the personal data of&nbsp;users.</p>Still frame from The Intersection<p>Omidyar Network’s Exploration and Future Sensing team has been tracking this evolving trend since 2018. Our initial investigations provoked many questions: What could this world look like with a new layer of ambient technology? What currently drives its development and the course it takes? What is the experience of those already commonly marginalized, excluded, and/or discriminated against in current tech and surveillance systems? What might be the experience of immigrants, minorities, elderly, special needs, rural, urban, etc in this world? How could our interaction with technology, government, companies, society, each other change? Will these technology developments only be extractive, or is there a world where they could be supportive, or even regenerative? Is it possible for this world to be designed from a place that acknowledges our interconnectedness and centers diverse perspectives?</p> Making of “The Intersection” <p>To provoke the possibilities of this hyper-connected world, we partnered with <a href="https://superflux.in/">Superflux</a>, a speculative design and foresight agency. We hoped to provoke imagination about futures that could evolve what we, collectively, would like our relationship with technology to be, as we build the infrastructure, protocols, norms, social structures, and policies, for a technology ecosystem that can be empowering for us&nbsp;all.</p><blockquote>“I don’t want the tech we build to consume the world, but to augment and support it. We’re starting to build something new. A new way of networking and connecting. The tech was built from the ground up. To support people, instead of mining them.” — The Intersection</blockquote><p>Together we produced “The Intersection”, a short film that explores the future of ambient technology through the lens of four protagonists whose lives have been shaped by the dissonance of extractive technology norms, misinformation, surveillance capitalism, and context collapse:</p>  Ericka, a young activist whose movement for justice is derailed by a never-ending feed of misinformation and conspiracies concocted to extract&nbsp;data.  Jake, a journalist whose work is diluted and corrupted by AI systems that helped him prioritize clicks over the truth, taking news out of context and pandering to readers’ “intensely monitored, precisely categorized fears.”  Amp, a hardware engineer who set out to change the world using technology, only to have her utopian dream shattered by the realization that the only problem she was solving was finding new ways for technology companies to make&nbsp;money.  Tammi, a climate migrant who became a refugee in her own country because her family refused to evacuate in the face of an impending storm, citing “fake news”&nbsp;reports.  Still frame from The Intersection<p>As the film begins, the future of ambient tech is all-encompassing and ever present in every aspect of life. Individually, then together, the protagonists find ways to re-evaluate their relationships with technology — to repurpose and redesign ambient tech to serve their communities, support nature, and value human relationships. They come together to reconcile their differences — illustrating how people can be united by a common purpose, regardless of how different their backgrounds and world views may be. The film ends at a new beginning, open to audiences to shape — where could we head from here? What would we do today, if we knew this is where we were&nbsp;heading?</p><blockquote>“We wanted to show in an experiential way, the interconnected nature of the issues present in our world. Whether environmental, social or technological, these domains don’t reside within neat categories, they overlap and intermingle, giving birth to new hybrid forms that are as tricky to define as they are to address”– Anab Jain &amp; Jon Ardern, Superflux.</blockquote><p>We hope this film makes the future of ambient technology more tangible, prompts us to investigate our relationship with technology, and encourages us to build towards a more just, pluralistic world that centers the experiences of those most marginalized among&nbsp;us.</p><p>Watch the Intersection <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/569842501?badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479">here</a>.

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce the availability of Financial-grade API (FAPI) OP and dynamic client registration (DCR) tests for open banking Brazil. Release notes can be found here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite/-/tags/release-v4.1.15">https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite/-/tags/release-v4.1.15</a></p>
<p><a href="https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#introducao">Brazil recently published their open banking technology stack</a> including the <a href="https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-financial-api-1_ID1.html">security and identity standards</a> that the&nbsp;financial services sector&nbsp;must adopt and implement in multiple phases in 2021.&nbsp;Building on the global and increasingly ubiquitous OpenID Foundation FAPI&nbsp;specification, the Brazilian open banking ecosystem is leveraging the work of the Foundation’s FAPI working group. This includes requirements to support standardized the decoupled authentication standard Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) that facilitates access to open banking services for user groups that are often underserved. These efforts help ensure that non-digital users can access services offered by third party providers (TPPs,) which is an important step forward for financial inclusion. The OpenID Foundation is currently developing RP/TPP tests specific to Brazil that will be released in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Brazil’s rapid adoption of open banking technical standards is evidenced by the hundreds of technologists attending the <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-fapi-outreach-workshops-for-open-banking-brazil-spring-2021/">series of OpenID Foundation workshops</a> that focused on the technical implementation of FAPI as well as FAPI conformance testing and self certification. Our Brazilian colleagues will utilize the OpenID Foundation’s <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">Certification Program</a> to ensure FAPI technical conformance needed to meet compliance requirements, which goes a long way towards the interoperability open banking relies upon.</p>
<p>We’re impressed by our new Brazilian colleagues who’ve become members of the OpenID Foundation and their contributions to the Foundation’s working groups that are evolving the OpenID standards. New Foundation members include seven of the 26 banking institutions required to be FAPI conformant and certified by July 15, 2021 under Phase 2 of the Brazilian open banking regulations, as well as a number of fintech service providers in Brazil. Special thanks to the GT Open Banking Information Security Working Group and all who have invested both the human and financial capital needed for secure and safe data sharing in Brazil!</p>

<p>What is MiCA?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MiCA is the Acronym of Markets in Crypto Assets</p>
<p>The EU will create a SINGLE regulation &nbsp; for ALL 28 members Countries regarding Crypto</p>
<p>A Regulation..&nbsp; Basically&nbsp; is a LAW IMPOSED upon all countries immediately that supersedes any national regulations.</p>
<p>MiCA Regulation therefore is a single set of rules , Immediately applicable, Throughout the Single Market.</p>
<p>Is MiCA good or bad?</p>
<p>To Answer this question let’s focus on why they are doing it. The EU is drafting new strategy on digital finance for the EU financial sector. The EU with MiCA aims to ensure that the EU embraces the Blockchain revolution and become leader with innovative European firms in the lead, On one side they want&nbsp; to be innovation-Friendly to make digital finance available to European consumers and businesses. On the other side wants to&nbsp; mitigate the risk to consumers (and banks).</p>
<p>MiCA Objectives</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 First objective give LEGAL CERTAINTY to&nbsp; crypto-asset markets. The EU thinks there is a need for a sound legal framework, clearly defining the regulatory treatment of all crypto-assets that are not covered by existing EU legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Second objective is to SUPPORT INNOVATION.&nbsp; The EU wants to&nbsp; Promote crypto-assets development and new user cases while putting in place a safe and proportionate framework to support innovation and fair competition. 
 Third objective is CONSUMER PROTECTION. The EU thinks crypto-assets present many of the same risks as traditional&nbsp; financial instruments.&nbsp; 
 Fourth objective is to ensure FINANCIAL STABILITY. The EU is literally&nbsp; terrified by ‘stablecoins’, because&nbsp; unlike cryptocurrencies have the potential to become widely accepted and potentially systemic disruptive for the status quo.&nbsp;

<p>Second public review ends July 18th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC are pleased to announce that Specification for JSON Abstract Data Notation Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the second public review for this specification.</p>



<p>JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is an information modeling language. It has several purposes including defining data structures, validating data instances, informing user interfaces working with structured data, and facilitating protocol internationalization. JADN specifications consist of two parts: abstract type definitions that are independent of data format, and serialization rules that define how to represent type instances using specific data formats. A JADN schema is itself a structured information object that can be serialized and transferred between applications, documented in multiple formats such as text-based interface definition languages, property tables or diagrams, and translated into concrete schemas used to validate specific data formats.</p>

<p>We were established to build a more diverse and inclusive community that will help shape the products and solutions developed by the identity industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Vision is to ensure that identity solutions intended FOR everyone are built BY everyone.&nbsp; And our Mission is to inspire, elevate and support a more diverse workforce across a variety of roles and sectors within the identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>Given the increasing importance that an individual’s identity plays in unlocking services that are essential for participation in the global economy, it is critical that identity solutions represent the needs of ALL communities.&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of our mission, we support grassroots development opportunities such as networking events, internships, educational research and personal development.

<p>By CV Madhukar, Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>In a world where digitization ubiquitous, we now have an opportunity to shape digital ID programs and other components of the digital public infrastructure in a direction that serves the <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-unpacks-good-id-update-our-point-view-digital-identity/">public interest</a> and powers the digital economy, rather than only serving private corporate interests.</p><p>Back in 2015, the UN Sustainable Development goals called for “legal identity for all” by 2030. At the time, the World Bank released data which revealed that 1.5 billion people in the world lacked formal identification. Those working on financial inclusion challenges were among the first to articulate the societal cost of this gap; if a person is unable to identify themself, then they will be unable to engage in for the formal financial system and economic growth will&nbsp;stall.</p><p>Yet conversations about digital identity innovation were mostly treated as a developing country issue, with ardent advocates in the West unwilling to acknowledge that digital identity could add value to developed economies. Now, as the world <a href="https://omidyar.com/a-decade-of-digital-public-goods-holding-up-the-digital-economy-preventing-monopolies-and-safeguarding-freedoms-for-all/">emerges from the pandemic</a>, attitudes seem to have taken a 180-degree turn.</p><p>The recognition that digital identification is increasingly central to the digital public infrastructure (that is, digital spaces for the public good) is gaining currency worldwide. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposed the creation of trusted and secure “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">Digital Identity for all Europeans</a>”. This is expected to go into effect in late 2022. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also spoke in February about the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0023">need for Digital IDs</a>, saying, “The same digital ID technology that protects against money laundering can also help us reach more people with&nbsp;relief.”</p><p>Every country will need to reimagine its technology infrastructure and make it fit-or-purpose for a digital century. While developing countries suffer from lack of technology infrastructure, developed economies have legacy systems that need urgent reimagining. The Clinton era effort of “Reinventing Government” will need a whole new makeover right now in the US with regard to reimagining technology infrastructure. But to really reimagine this, key stakeholders will need to overcome a deep chasm caused by the compartmentalization in thinking about the role of public sector and the private&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In her important work on the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/final_the_entrepreneurial_state_and_public_options.pdf">Entrepreneurial State</a>, noted economist Mariana Mazzucato argues that the state as a fixer of market failures offers a limited view. The state as a market shaper and market maker is less recognized in the US, even though the state (through DARPA, NIH, etc.) has had a deep impact on the course of innovation in the private sector over several&nbsp;decades.</p><p>The very nature of infrastructure is such that it is an enabler for private sector economic activity. In the digital era, such infrastructure also has the ability to ”see” every transaction that takes place in these digital spaces. That is why when a website that requires some form of identification asks offers the option to login in with Facebook or Gmail credentials, the big tech platforms get to see much of the activity that the individual does on this third-party website. Similarly, when a payment platform uses the infrastructure provided by Visa or Mastercard, these companies gain insights on financial activity of the individuals that use such a provider.</p><p>At a time where data will be a “factor of production” in the new digital economy, those providing such infrastructure will naturally become massive monopolies or oligopolies. Using antitrust laws to remedy this without recognizing what caused data monopolies in the first place, is like trying to pick up water with a sieve. We need viable and scalable public alternatives for the existing digital infrastructure to truly curb such monopolies. This will provide a level playing field for all private market players, create the basis for interoperability, prevent data monopolies, and make services more accessible for individuals.</p><p>This is, according to a recent <a href="https://www.journalismliberty.org/publications/what-is-digital-public-infrastructure">paper</a> by Ethan Zuckerman, the strongest case for policymakers to take urgent and concrete measures for the development and adoption of digital public infrastructure as a way of shaping the trajectory of the future digital&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We need governments to own this agenda so that any new conception of digital public infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of safeguards. Even as we think about such large-scale deployment of technology, we must deliberately think about unintended consequences of such efforts and mitigate them. Safeguards in the form of technology, law, and institutions must drive the norms and behavior of both the designers of technology and its users, and the government must guarantee these protections. The financial sector or the pharmaceutical industry can offer valuable lessons in this&nbsp;regard.</p><p>Reimagining digital public infrastructure could have a positive, transformative impact on the global economy and global development. But it’s going to be important for the US and Europe to install safe and inclusive, digital public infrastructure (like federated digital ID and payment platforms) to see real change. If they make this kind of investment, we can begin to build a world where gaps in technology won’t limit the development programs governments can implement, the progress they can make, or support they can give people to improve their own&nbsp;lives.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-digital-public-infrastructure-is-no-longer-just-a-development-agenda-6c3915d20598">Reimagining digital public infrastructure is no longer just a development agenda</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Most of us understand how fingerprinting works, where we compare a captured fingerprint, from a crime scene for example, to a live person’s fingerprint to determine if they match. We can also use a fingerprint to ensure that the true owner, and only the true owner, can unlock a smartphone or laptop. But could a fake fingerprint be used to fool the fingerprint sensor in the phone? The simplest answer is yes unless we can determine if the fingerprint actually came from a living and physically present person, who might be trying to unlock the phone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In biometrics, there are two important measurements, Biometric Matching and Biometric Liveness. Biometric matching is a process of identifying or authenticating a person, by comparing their physiological attributes to information that had already been collected. For example, when that fingerprint matches a fingerprint on file, that’s matching.&nbsp;Liveness Detection is a computerized process to determine if the computer is interfacing with a live human and not an impostor like a photo, a deep-fake video, or a replica. For example, one measure to determine Liveness includes determining whether the presentation occurred in real-time.&nbsp;Without Liveness, biometric matching would be increasingly vulnerable to fraud attacks that are continuously growing in their ability to fool biometric matching systems with imitation and fake biometric attributes. Attacks such as “Presentation Attack”,&nbsp; “spoof”, or “bypass” attempts&nbsp; would endanger a user without proper liveness detection. It is important to have strong Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) as well the ability to detect injection attacks (where imagery bypasses the camera) as these are ways to spoof the user’s biometrics. Liveness determines if it’s a real person while matching determines if it’s the correct, real person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
 
 

 



 
<p>With today’s increasingly powerful computer systems, have come increasingly sophisticated hacking strategies, such as Presentation and Bypass attacks.&nbsp;There are many varieties of Presentation attacks, including high-resolution paper &amp; digital photos, high-definition challenge/response videos, and paper masks. Commercially available lifelike dolls are available, human-worn resin, latex &amp; silicone 3D masks, as well as custom-made ultra-realistic 3D masks and wax heads. These methods might seem right out of a bank heist movie, but they are used in the real world, successfully too.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 


<p>There are other ways to defeat a biometric system, called Bypass attacks. These include intercepting, editing, and replacing legitimate biometric data with synthetic data, not collected from the persons biometric verification check. Other Bypass attacks might include intercepting and replacing legitimate camera feed data with previously captured video frames or with what’s known as a “deep-fake puppet”, a realistic-looking computer animation of the user. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sfhar1sGi7c">This video</a> is a simple but good example of biometric vulnerabilities, lacking any regard for Liveness.</p>



<p>The COVID19 Pandemic provides significant examples of Presentation and Bypass attacks and resulting frauds. Pandemic Stay-at-Home orders, along with&nbsp; economic hardships, have increased citizen dependence on the electronic distribution of government pandemic stimulus and unemployment assistance funds, creating easy targets for fraudsters.&nbsp;Cybercriminals frequently utilize Presentation and Bypass attacks to defeat government website citizen enrolee and user authentication systems, to <a href="https://abc7news.com/california-edd-unemployment-fraud-ca-scam-insurance/10011810/">steal from governments across the globe which amounts in the hundreds of billions of losses of taxpayer money</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Properly designed biometric liveness and matching could have mitigated much of the trouble Nevadans are experiencing.&nbsp;There are various forms of biometric liveness testing:</p>



  Active Liveness commands the user to successfully perform a movement or action like blinking, smiling, tilting the head, and track-following a bouncing image on the device screen. Importantly, instructions must be randomized and the camera/system must observe the user perform the required action.&nbsp;  Passive Liveness relies on involuntary user cues like pupil dilation, reducing user friction and session abandonment. Passive liveness can be undisclosed, randomizing attack vector approaches.&nbsp;Alone, it can determine if captured image data is first-generation and not a replica presentation attack. Significantly higher Liveness and biometric match confidence can be gained if device camera data is captured securely with a verified camera feed, and the image data is verified to be captured in real-time by a device Software Development Kit (SDK). Under these circumstances both Liveness and Match confidence can be determined concurrently from the same data, mitigating vulnerabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Multimodal Liveness utilizes numerous Liveness modalities, like 2 dimensional face matching in combination with instructions to blink on command, to establish user choice and increase the number of devices supported. This often requires the user to “jump through hoops” of numerous Active Liveness tests and increases friction.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Liveness and 3-dimensionality. A human must be 3D to be alive, while a mask-style artifact may be 3D without being alive. Thus, while 3D face depth measurements alone do not prove the subject is a live human, verifying 2-dimensionality proves the subject is not alive. Regardless of camera resolution or specialist hardware, 3-dimensionality provides substantially more usable and consistent data than 2D, dramatically increasing accuracy and highlights the importance of 3D depth detection as a component of stronger Liveness Detection.  



<p>Biometric Liveness is a critical component in any biometric authentication system.&nbsp;Properly designed systems require the use of liveness tests before moving on to biometric matching. After all, if it’s determined the subject is not alive, there’s little reason to perform biometric matching and further authentication procedures. A well-designed system that is easy to use allows only the right people access and denies anybody else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE FUTURE OF EQUITY CROWDFUNDING RUNS ON BLOCKCHAIN</p>
<p>(Milan 28 June ) 2Meet2Biz.com, equity crowdfunding and debt platform, is the first among the platforms authorized by Consob to use blockchain technology to manage all internal document processes, thanks to its presence, as a validator node, on the Commercio.network blockchain.</p>
<p>With equity crowdfunding Startups and SMEs can collect risk capital to finance the birth or the development of their business project.&nbsp; Italy has been among the first countries to regulate this kind of investment creating a real ecosystem and an official registry by Consob. In recent years the sector has evolved in terms of the number of platforms and capital raised, as well as the number of transactions managed, but from a technological point of view few steps have been taken.</p>
<p>The desire to use blockchain technology in 2meet2biz stems from a precise need: to apply the potential of a blockchain to the processes that normally characterize equity crowdfunding campaigns and that, by type, are essentially replicable and procedurizable for all bidding companies.</p>
<p>That’s why 2meet2biz, developed and managed by Migliora Srl, has embarked on an absolutely innovative path: to ensure to its corporate clients, as well as to all investors who join the campaigns, transparency, security and immutability of all processes related to the collection of capital, from the receipt of the initial documentation until the conclusion of the campaign, this thanks to a blockchain technology compliant, moreover, to the eIDAS directives.</p>
<p>For the same reason – to integrate with third party technologies with the aim of improving efficiency and security in economic and financial transactions – 2meet2biz has chosen to use an open banking software system, fully integrated into 2meet2biz, which through APIs securely guarantees financial flows, automating all phases of bank reconciliations and transactions.</p>
<p>2Meet2Biz.com is now part of Commercio.network, a blockchain that since 2018 has enabled all companies around the world to manage the three indispensable fiduciary processes of digital transformation: Creating a digital identity with eID, signing a document with eSignature and certifying the exchange of documents with eDelivery. Thanks to this the customer experience of the platform is ZERO PAPER and the processes from onboarding to eKYC (electronic know your customer) are totally digital.</p>
<p>2Meet2Biz.com has become the 45th of the 100 validator nodes of commercio.network joining the most important European players already present, such as Namirial, Infocert, VAR Group Zucchetti. Being a Validator Node means to participate in the most innovative, sustainable and advanced European project in the Blockchain field, also proposed as a technology for the EBSI call for proposals financed through PCP by the European Commission.</p>
<p>This step from one side is part of a very precise strategy, that is to integrate 2meet2biz with</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commerce Network</p>
<p>third party technologies that allow it to progressively improve the customer experience of all its customers, and on the other hand it is the first step of a wider project to exploit all the potentialities</p>
<p>that this business model intends to offer, from a procedural point of view and not only, ensuring a degree of transparency never seen in its sector in full compliance with EU MICA directives.</p>
<p>2meet2biz intends to guide the processes of crowd campaigns through the digital transformation, with the development and use of SAAS technologies able to make even the investment process innovative, both for principals and investors, maximizing the value chain of the campaigns presented, from their origin to the access to the target market. A new international strategic approach, with a path that will soon be applicable to all investors, involving partners with platforms that comply with the standards required by the European regulatory bodies.</p>

<p>Notice of Intent: DIACC is collaborating to develop and publish a Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) Assurance Maturity Model to set a baseline of public and private sector interoperability of identity services and solutions.</p>



<p>To learn more about the Pan-Canadian vision and benefits-for-all value proposition please review the<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf"> Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Overview</a>.</p>



<p>Document Status: This review document has been approved as a Draft Recommendation V1.0 by the DIACC’s<a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/"> </a><a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/">Trust Framework Expert Committee</a> (TFEC) that operates under the DIACC controlling policies.</p>



<p>Summary: It is essential that Participants in a digital ecosystem have a way to evaluate the robustness and trustworthiness of transactions within that ecosystem. In order to do so, Participants must share a common vocabulary that describes the level of confidence they can associate with an Entity or transaction, as well as a common way in which to determine that level of confidence.</p>



<p>In the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF), a Level of Assurance (LoA) represents the level of confidence an Entity may place in the processes and other conformance criteria defined in any given component of the PCTF.&nbsp; Levels of Assurance are elemental in creating networks of trust. Levels of Assurance models only work if all Participants in a digital ecosystem are able to interpret them consistently. It is therefore critical that all Participants in an ecosystem agree upon a minimum set of criteria for each Level of Assurance. Only then will a Relying Party in that ecosystem be able to properly evaluate the risks inherent in a relationship or transaction, and the Level of Assurance that can be placed in Participants, Credentials, and those transactions. The components of the PCTF describe the detailed conformance criteria that should be used to evaluate such Levels of Assurance in the context of a given PCTF component. This document provides guidance regarding how to use those criteria in order to properly classify Levels of Assurance.</p>



<p>Invitation: All interested parties are invited to comment.</p>



<p>Period: Opens: June 27, 2021 at 23:59 PT | Closes: July 28, 2021 at 23:59 PT</p>

<p>By: FIDO Alliance Staff</p>



<p>The digital security, privacy and authentication landscape is evolving quickly in the European Union with new regulations that could have a broad ranging impact for its citizens, as well as companies around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Focus on Europe, which was held on June 17, experts on the authentication market in Europe provided insight into the latest developments including PSD2 SCA (Payment Services Directive Strong Customer Authentication), delegated authentication, eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) and the EU Digital Wallet among other efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Kicking off the virtual summit, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance outlined how the FIDO specifications work and why strong authentication is essential for multiple use cases including ecommerce, Internet of Things (IoT) and identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“FIDO’s goal from day one was to certainly reduce reliance on passwords, but in some ways that was just a means to an end, really trying to address the data breach problem, as the vast majority of data breaches are caused by weak credentials,” Shikiar said.</p>



<p>As FIDO is moving forward, there has been a need to strengthen identity verification assurance to support better and safer account recovery. As part of that, Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance launched the Identity Verification &amp; Binding Working Group (IDWG) which is driving that work forward.</p>



<p>“We’re seeking to establish best practices for possession based identity verification,” Shikiar said. “That will not only enable safer, easier and stronger account recovery, but doing so will also stop hackers from using the account recovery process as an opening for social engineering account takeovers.”</p>



<p>Helping to Limit Cart Abandonment</p>



  



<p>There is a tangible connection between ecommerce success and strong authentication, according to Rolf Lindemann, VP products at NokNok.</p>



<p>Lindermann noted that during the pandemic, ecommerce grew faster than ever before. But with 13% of credit card online payments not being completed, it’s clear that cart abandonment is still impacting business in a significant manner.</p>



<p>“We learned that authentication friction in general is a major factor for card abandonment,” Lindermann said. “This becomes obvious given that online authentication is at the core of all online transactions. Authentication is the front door to digital services in general.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The path to reducing authentication friction involves the use of FIDO, which Lindermann said can help to enable strong customer authentication that can be implemented in a single convenient step.</p>



<p>Toward a Strongly Authenticated Digital Identity&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Europe and elsewhere around the world, there is a growing conversation about the need to enable and provide some form of digital identity. According to Steve Pannifer, COO of Consult Hyperion, digital identity consists of three things: identification, authentication and authorization.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Pannifer explained that identification is all about asking the question – is this person real, unique and identifiable? Authentication is the process of realizing that an identified person is coming in to use the service again, as the service provider wants to know if it is the same person that established the identity at some point in the past. Authorization ties it all together, which uses identity and authentication to access services.</p>



<p>“Digital identity is not a means in and of itself, it’s a means to an end,” Pannifer said. “The end that it is serving is all of those services that I’m trying to get access to.”</p>



<p>Fabian Eberle, co-founder and COO at <a href="https://keyless.io/">Keyless</a> is also a big believer in digital identity. In a session, Eberle outlined the need for a decentralized system for personal identity management. Such a system puts users in control of their own identity information, and lets them selectively disclose that identity data in a more private and secure way.</p>



<p>Eberle noted that at LUISS Guido Carli University, over 10,000 students are now benefiting from a digital identity system that helps to support remote education services. The Keyless approach benefits from FIDO standards that helps to authenticate a device and identify students in a frictionless approach.</p>



<p>Digital Identity in Europe: eIDAS</p>



<p>In the European Union, there is an effort known as <a href="https://www.eid.as/">eIDAS</a> which is a legal framework for mutual recognition of national digital identity schemes.</p>



<p>“The purpose of eIDAS is cross border access for citizens in any European country to gain access to any public service in the EU,”Sebastian Elfors, senior solutions architect at Yubico explained.</p>



  



  



<p>FIDO standards are being increasingly adopted by European governments to help support eIDAS efforts. Among those that Elfors highlighted is healthcare authentication in Norway, EduID for universities in Sweden and the National Health Service (NHS) in the U.K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO standards are also helping the Czech Republic with its CZ.NIC top level domain registry which also operates the mojedID (my ID in Czech) service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jaromi Talir, technical fellow at CZ.NIC and member of eIDAS Technical subgroup explained that the domain registry had a requirement to authenticate the identity of domain owners. That requirement led to the creation of mojeID, which has been using FIDO standards since 2019. Talir explained that CZ.NIC uses FIDO to support a multi-factor strong authentication based approach to help authentication user identity.</p>



<p>Using FIDO to Support Delegated Authentication</p>



<p>With the European Union’s Payment Services Directive Strong Customer Authentication (PSD2 SCA), that came into effect in 2021, there are very stringent requirements for merchants to authenticate consumers with payment providers.</p>



  



<p>In a panel discussion, Jonathan Grossar, VP, product development at Mastercard commented that within a few months of the introduction of PSD2 SCA there has been an increase in the number of transactions that have been abandoned by consumers.</p>



<p>“So a problem with PSD2 SCA is that consumers may have to authenticate twice,” Grossar siad. “First with the merchant to have access to the account or to the card that is stored on file and then a second time doing the transaction with the bank and potentially then with a different authentication mechanism.”</p>



<p>All those extra steps introduce additional friction and complexity for both merchants and consumers that can be alleviated with an approach known as delegated authentication. Grossar explained that with delegated authentication, the entire authentication piece is handled&nbsp; with a secure mechanism by merchants. Using FIDO standards in combination with EMVco’s <a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/">3-D Secure</a> standards to share authentication and risk data is the way forward in Grossar’s view.</p>



<p>“FIDO is interoperable across multiple devices and platforms,” Grossar said. “So in short, you have today billions of devices that are enabled with FIDO, and that potentially can be used for delegated authentication.”</p>



<p>Jason Muncey, principal, EU Payment Acceptance &amp; International Expansion, at Amazon is also optimistic about using FIDO for delegated authentication. Muncey commented that even before the PSD2 SCA requirements cart abandonment was just a pain that all merchants have had to live with. In his view, there is a real need to have some form of consistent approach.</p>



<p>Lee Goddard, product director, head of authentication at Worldpay also noted that – there will always be some amount of abandonment potential in that purchase process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the FIDO approach to delegated authentication will really take things a step further in removing evermore abandonment,” she said.</p>



<p>Remote Identity Verification in Europe</p>



<p>With the pandemic, the ability to do in-person identity verification became challenging, which led to a need for increased remote identity verification in Europe and other areas around the world.</p>



<p>In a panel discussion, Santosh Rajvaidya, senior director, product management at Jumio noted that to date, there is no consistent approach when it comes to remote ID verification in Europe. That situation could be changing with the new digital identity wallet approach from the European Commission that could be the first step in the right direction.</p>



  



<p>“What is happening with digital identity wallet is you do a one time verification of your ID and the identity is created in the digital identity wallet,” Rajvaidya said. “From there on the user can reuse it multiple times across different applications.”</p>



<p>There is now also an ID Verification and Binding Working Group IDWG within FIDO that is doing work that will also help with remote identity verification efforts. Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow, commented that when it comes to verification, user experience and convenience are key attributes.</p>



<p>“Most users aren’t concerned with their identity or the data privacy, they’ll tick the boxes and move on, they just want to get their service,” she said.</p>



<p>Wrapping up the virtual Authenticate Summit, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance emphasized that the FIDO Alliance is in a very good place today, in Europe and around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing more and more companies adopt FIDO authentication,” Shikiar said. “I personally firmly believe that virtually every consumer service online will be offering passwordless login options in the next few years and our hope is that the vast majority of these leverage FIDO.”</p>



<p>Looking forward to the next FIDO Authenticate virtual summits is in September with a focus on government services. Then in October, the FIDO Alliance will be hosting its first live event with the Authenticate Conference in Seattle.</p>

Similarly, users are forced to deal with data lock-in resulting in limited data in any single application or frustrating processes to manually export and connect data across multiple applications – usually with very limited success.</p><p>Oaksprout, one of the creators of Tiles along with his collaborator Izzy, has been trying to work around the patchwork data architecture that exists in Web2 for nearly a decade. He says:</p><blockquote>Services built on top of fragmented data are wildly limited because you can't aggregate information across them, which means that services in the Web2 world are just really, incredibly underpowered.</blockquote><p>Since Web2-powered products run on data stored in private database servers which are independently controlled and managed, there is no way for third parties or the general public to input or agree on the proper formats for certain types of data. Even in cases where a given data object is so common that it should conform to a standard — say, the format for a blog post or how to represent a step in a fitness tracker — each vendor will choose to implement their own model and schema for that data with no natural way to collaborate and coordinate with other vendors storing or consuming data for the same type of object.</p><p>In this paradigm every application exists only within its own silo, unable to connect with other applications or experiences that a user has on the web. Because of this, developers are forced to start cold or succumb to being locked into a specific platform, rather than being able to build on existing patterns that the ecosystem has aligned around and the data that has been created within other applications. If disparate, third-party applications and data sources were able to connect more easily, developers would be able to build richer and far more seamless user experiences, while dramatically accelerating development speed.</p> Consensus on data models <p>One great promise of the distributed web is data interoperability and composability: the ability to use the same content across different contexts, organizations, and applications. In practice, data interoperability requires more than just decentralized storage; it requires the ability for many different, unrelated parties to openly discover, interpret, and transform data formats and schemas - and eventually, over time, converge on them.</p><p>The Tiles team sees Ceramic as a promising solution for enabling distributed parties to come to consensus on data models for any use case. On Ceramic, data formats and schemas are published openly, where they can easily be discovered by others, and updated over time while maintaining a complete version history. &nbsp;This allows developers to examine the data models for popular applications and data sets, to discover standards being used widely, and to use them or extend them.</p><p>Ceramic offers an open-source approach to data, which can revolutionize how we interact with data on the web.</p>  Tiles v1: A stream browser <p>Tiles aims to provide an interface that makes it easy for developers to discover and make use of collaborative data models on Ceramic. The first version of Tiles is a simple streams explorer which lets users input a streamID to see the content it contains and the schema it uses. Users can inspect the content of a stream as well as the stream type, format, metadata, and history.</p>Using Tiles to examine a recently created Ceramic stream<p>Oaksprout believes that by presenting this information in such a simple and open way, Tiles will inspire developers to explore the possibilities of what Ceramic can enable.</p><blockquote>I think that when people can see what's on the network and the kind of streams that are being created, people will intuit what can be done.</blockquote> Unlocking UIs and customizable experiences <p>The value of discovering and building on shared data models starts with reusable, cross-application data – but to the Tiles team, this is only the beginning. In the future, they believe that a foundation of dependable, shared data models will give birth to user interfaces (UIs) that are much more customizable, dynamic, and flexible. When applications no longer need to define their own data models or spend time worrying about normalizing and integrating with data from other applications, they all can dedicate more time and resources to innovating much more freely on the UI and experience. Says Oaksprout:</p><blockquote>All the [related] data on Web3 will have a very similar structure. That means you can decouple the UI from the data layer and present in any way that you want to.</blockquote><p>For example, an application could be built that renders all Web3 blog posts in audio format since the application would be able to dependably ingest blog posts in text format, interpret the schema, and perform any required transformations (if necessary) before rendering the audio output. Everything would already be there to make this possible.</p><p>While it's difficult to predict exactly how this freedom will be deployed within applications and what innovations will emerge from it, the Tiles team is already seeing mounting evidence that end-users want the ability to program and customize their online experiences more than in the past. As one small example, Oaksprout believes that users' obsession with dark mode is only partly about the actual screen brightness, and equally about a desire to express their preferences in their own tools.</p><blockquote>People are tired of having one point of view, a Silicon Valley aesthetic, forced on them.</blockquote><p>The software of today is built rigidly and leaves very little ability for end-users or third-party applications to customize functionality, modify design, or adapt features to better fit their needs, preferences, and desires. The software of tomorrow will enable far more dynamic experiences by building on consensus-driven data models that lower the cost of standardization and reduce the risk of incompatibilities.</p>  Lenses for rendering data in apps at runtime <p>Currently, Tiles only lets users search and explore data streams on Ceramic. However, soon the product will expand into allowing users to view that data in new ways. For any stream, Tiles will allow users to choose a lens (format/view) through which to render and view that content. After a user selects their lens for a given stream, Tiles will transform the UI and display the content in the desired manner. This is all possible due to public schemas.</p><p>Eventually, Tiles aims to enable the dynamic rendering of data into various formats and UIs using a concept it calls "Lenses," which act as a way to view or transform data streams at runtime into the proper format for a given application.</p><blockquote>Tiles will give UIs the benefit of a very consistent consensus layer around data structures.</blockquote><p>At scale, lenses enable the same data to be leveraged across many different applications and experiences without requiring that all parties come to an explicit consensus on data schemas, or worry too much about maintaining version compatibility. Instead, with lenses, data can be transformed as needed between different versions, schemas, or formats directly inside an application's front-end at runtime. These lenses could be used directly in Tiles to examine data, but also deployed by developers to render data in different ways within their own applications. Oaksprout discusses the possibilities for lenses in this clip:</p>The future of apps with lenses Lens curation <p>As Tiles builds towards this ecosystem of open data models and runtime rendering options, they also envision helping the community curate the most useful lenses. For any given schema, the community could curate which lenses are most valuable and which defaults should be used.</p>Discovering and curating lenses<p>Beyond curating smart, global lens defaults for common data, lenses could also be specifically curated for different use cases, communities, or unique individuals. This combination of curating the best lenses globally and the best lenses for a given moment can make Tiles a key component of Web3's open source information flows.</p>  Tiles: Next Steps <p>Apart from further developing the concept of lenses, Tiles will continue to add functionality to their application as more projects onboard onto Ceramic mainnet and more streams are created. In the near future, the Tiles team aims to explore two additional areas of focus:</p>  Maturing their Ceramic indexing service in order to expose the interdependence and intersection of data that can be found on the network  Developing an open set of streams that can be used as data structure building blocks that will serve as frameworks for content on Ceramic  <p>If any of this piques your interest, please join the <a href="https://discord.gg/zgFSeRyWCb">Tiles project discord</a> and start contributing!</p> <p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Documentation</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

<p>The state of California recently <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">announced their Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record system</a>. It allows Californians to access a digital copy of their vaccine records, rather than having to depend entirely on their physical copy. The main entry point is a QR code containing a rudimentary Verifiable Claim (VC), which makes for great ease of use. However, Blockchain Commons has concerns over how the user experience (UX) design might negatively affect both privacy and security; we are working to address these with our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone, Blockchain Commons’ first Apple appstore release.</p>

<p>
For a while now, increasingly personal information has been getting encoded as QRs. During the pandemic, COVID tests were  often stored as QRs. There has also been extensive use of QR codes to transmit secure information across an airgap. Many people first saw this use of QRs when they read a QR code for a two-factor authentication seed into their phone’s Authenticator app. At Blockchain Commons, we similarly use QR codes as an encoding method to transmit seeds and keys.</p>

<p>Some possible architectural issues arise from using QR codes for confidential data, such as the fact that you’re actually transmitting the data (not a proof of the data), that the QRs tend to contain all of the data (not just a selection), and that there’s no way to rescind a QR or expire it. Those issues will have to be dealt with at a foundational level as we figure out what can safely be encoded as a QR — and more importantly how to offer restricted proofs rather than complete information.</p>

<p>However, there are also security &amp; privacy UX issues related to the storage of QR codes that need to be resolved no matter what is encoded. The state of California itself demonstrated the bad habits that we’re already developing when they said in <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">their official press release</a>: “individuals are encouraged to screenshot the information and save it to their phone files or camera roll”.</p>

<p>Now, storing QRs as photos on a phone does meet some minimal security requirements. Most phones are closely held and protected by  a PIN, a thumbprint, or a faceprint. They’re often backed up to a cloud service and that cloud data is mostly secured as well. Still, there are numerous opportunities for problems.</p>

<p>That’s in large part due to the fact that photos are built to be shared. It’s very easy to send a photo to a friend or a social network, which is great for photos, but less so for your QR codes. In addition, photos are built to be synced. Though your data might be relatively safe if it’s synced to the cloud, it’s not that secure when synced to your desktop computer, which is vulnerable to malware and other attacks.</p>

<p>Photos also aren’t built to be searched and their categorization systems are usually rudimentary. Even if your QR code was safe, you might not be able to easily find it.</p>

<p>
That’s where Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone comes in. Though we can only make sure that our own uses of QR codes are architecturally secure, we can definitely provide better ways to store QR codes, and that’s what QR Tool does.</p>

<p>QR Tool lets you scan any QR code into an encrypted vault. It then protects your code with two-factor authentication: you initilally log in with your Apple login and password, and then anytime you want to view your codes, you additionally must use a biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint. Unlike your semi-porous camera roll, QR Tool was built to keep confidential information secure.</p>

<p>QR Tool also provides proof that your codes weren’t changed. Using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash">Lifehash</a> technology, QR Tool links each code to a unique, evocative, and unchanging graphical color representation. This will prove particularly useful when the Lifehash specification is adopted by other companies, so that you can transfer a QR code between applications and verify immediately that it’s the same — something that’s difficult with the QR code alone.</p>

<p>Finally, QR Tool resolves the problem of categorization by automatically recognizing a wide variety of QR codes and giving you the opportunity to change those categorizations as you see fit.</p>

<p>If the future we hope to see more fully featured <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, but there’s no doubt that QRs are with us for the moment, and we need to make sure that they remain secure and easy to use. This is why we released QR Tool. It’s a reference implementation for the Gordian Principles, demonstrating how to store confidential data in a way that’s independent, private, resilient, and open: QR Tool ensures that you hold your own QRs, that they’re safe, and that you can easily transmit them to other services.</p>

<p>If you’ve got QRs of your own to secure, you can purchase QR Tool from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple Store</a> or you can compile it directly from the source code found at the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and Chief Marketing Officer, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication has seen remarkable acceptance over the past few years, thanks in large part to standardization by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the subsequent adoption into leading device platforms and browsers. All told, we estimate over 4 billion devices (inclusive of Windows 10 PCs as well as every modern Apple and Android device) now support FIDO Authentication, as do over <a href="https://caniuse.com/webauthn">88% of web browsers</a>. Couple that addressable market with the ability for developers to write to the public FIDO2 WebAuthn API and you can see why so many enterprises are featuring FIDO support in request for proposals (RFPs) and accelerating related development plans.</p>



<p>However, while FIDO definitely does provide a simpler, stronger approach to user authentication, there is still a need to get users more accustomed to the user experience – and to optimize these flows as much as possible.&nbsp; In short, “if you build it they will come” isn’t always sufficient for paradigm-changing technologies. We’ve heard from more and more relying parties that they would benefit from tips on how to most effectively implement FIDO in a way that resonates with consumers and works across major browsers and platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past five years, the Alliance has conducted research that has consistently found consumers want to use FIDO authentication once they understand what it is and to have common “FIDO-enabled” signals to show where to obtain it. This illustrates the need for FIDO to be introduced to consumers in a user-friendly and consistent way in order for our protocols to be adopted at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this requirement, FIDO’s Board of Directors last year launched a User Experience (UX) Task Force (UXTF), drawing on world-class UX experts from many of our member companies, including Bank of America, eBay, Facebook, Google, HYPR, IBM, Intuit, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Microsoft, Trusona, Visa, and Wells Fargo. The UXTF was tasked with creating recommendations and best practices for how to deploy FIDO, factoring in utilization of FIDO messaging, logos and other visual cues. We partnered with consulting firm <a href="https://blinkux.com/">Blink UX</a> to conduct the first formal usability research of FIDO user journeys, including registration and authentication steps and various use cases – all feeding into our Desktop Authenticator UX Guidelines.</p>



<p>To complement this effort, we constructed a strawman banking user journey that could be used to test various assumptions and to better examine the authentication steps actually employed by users. With IBM’s assistance, a <a href="https://digitalbank-test.com/">website</a> was created to reflect this use case and was utilized during our testing and analyses.&nbsp; The site will remain live as a reference implementation of our UX Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We divided the typical FIDO journey into a series of four major steps:</p>



  Promote awareness of the availability of various biometric sign-ins, then perform the actual sign-in and determine if a user has a FIDO-eligible device that can be used in the authentication process.  Invite users to register via FIDO, especially if they are using Windows Hello or Apple TouchID.  The actual FIDO registration of the user’s desktop authenticator, along with messages showing success or failure.  Making FIDO the primary sign-in path, and issue appropriate confirmation messages.  



<p>The UX tests were done in three different rounds. First was a qualitative series where we walked participants through a mock-up of the site and test. This allowed us to get feedback on some of our initial messaging and visual assumptions, which fed into the final site design. Next, we ran 100 subjects through independent quantitative testing – where they were assigned and had to complete a mock banking task, which included a prompt to enroll for FIDO login. Our last round of testing were qualitative video interviews, which provided an invaluable human element and insights on the FIDO value proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collectively, these tests are what helped define and focus our messaging, logos and various other iconography and logic flows that were useful in developing UX guidelines and other best practices for FIDO implementations.</p>



<p>Our preliminary recommendations from these tests are:</p>



  Use a simple biometric image (such as a fingerprint icon) to trigger the initial user registration, then have FIDO logos at each touchpoint to confirm that a user is following the right sequence of steps.  Make sure developers optimize for each type of environment (operating system and device form factors such as laptop or phone) for each FIDO-capable device. For example, Windows and MacOS have different icons that are used to designate fingerprint usage, as shown in the below screencaps.  



  



  Use one of two suggested messaging styles: we tested and validated one style that is simple and one that is to “add an option.” For example, a simple message might say: “You’re eligible for a simpler sign-in! Learn how you can skip your password the next time you sign in. Register now.” And the optional message might say:&nbsp; “Add an easy and safe way to access your account. Register now.”  Take steps to educate consumers and customer support staff on FIDO. Promote FIDO awareness across multiple touch points and marketing channels such as email and direct postal mail campaigns and social media. This should include information about FIDO-capable device availability and <a href="https://loginwithfido.com/">how to use FIDO on Windows 10 Hello and Apple smartphones.</a>&nbsp; This also will help address potential user reluctance around using biometric sign-ins. Although many users view biometric sign-in as desirable, convenient, and secure, some users initially express hesitancy to share biometric or other computer sign-in information with their bank or with FIDO – and hence need to be educated that their biometrics stay safely on their device.  Have a special “problem resolution” path for those customers who run into problems.  



<p>FIDO Alliance’s ultimate goal is to see as many service providers moving their customers away from password-based authentication as soon as possible – and we hope that these UX guidelines can help accelerate this movement.&nbsp; As this is our first foray into usability guidance we’re also open to and appreciative of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/UX-Guidelines">feedback</a> from deploying organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By David Turner, Director of Standards Development, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Today we are announcing enhancements to two of the core FIDO protocols, the Client To Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) v2.1 and WebAuthn Level 2 – which collectively comprise FIDO2. Both are significant advances in extending FIDO’s capabilities specifically for enterprise users and supporting more complex application use cases. These enhancements come at an appropriate time, given the increased demand and rate of adoption for FIDO methods as the pandemic and remote work continues throughout the world.</p>



<p>The FIDO2 WebAuthn protocol is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that describe how to enable authentications inside browser sessions. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Level 2 is the latest version of the standard</a>, which is maintained by the W3C organization and was released in April. This standard makes it easier to write web applications that use FIDO Authentication, which is now supported across the five major endpoint operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, ChromeOS, and iOS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are six major improvements that we are announcing today:</p>



<p>Enterprise attestation</p>



<p>Today’s announcements increase support for enterprise management of devices and users. The CTAP and WebAuthn protocols have added features that make it easier for enterprises to add specific user identity data during the registration process, so corporate administrators can more easily track key distribution and usage. Because these features can reveal some private user information – information that they would have divulged anyway to their employer – this feature is not available directly to consumers’ authenticators. Instead, authenticators must be pre-programmed (before credential registration) with these enterprise attestations by the enterprises themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cross-origin iFrame support</p>



<p>This feature allows web-based ecommerce transactions to be completed within pop-up windows on a browser, something that was forbidden in earlier FIDO versions as a way to protect potential man-in-the-middle and man-in-the-browser attack scenarios. The new standards make a very safe, secure and encrypted way to accomplish these transactions, without revealing data pulled from multiple domains such as the originating vendor, the user’s bank account, a credit card issuer, and so forth. It also helps in situations when users are connecting via bandwidth-limited circumstances (such as via Bluetooth or poor Wifi signals) to keep the authentication workflow moving without a lot of back-and-forth network traffic and latency delays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support for Apple Attestations</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance has been pleased to have Apple as a contributing member for the past 18 months.&nbsp;This feature adds support for Apple’s method of doing attestation on their devices using the WebAuthn protocols.</p>



<p>Better biometric management</p>



<p>The CTAP v2.1 additions include better biometric enrollment and management features, so that users can register multiple fingerprints and other bio-markers. Additionally, enterprises can set minimum PIN lengths. As more mobile devices include facial and fingerprint recognition, this keeps FIDO current with the latest authentication technologies.</p>



<p>Large blob support</p>



<p>An alternative to running a centralized authentication service, this feature includes a way to store things like certificates that may be necessary for other authentication scenarios, such as using encrypted SSH connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Resident credential improvements&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now called discoverable credentials, this enables passwordless workflows to re-authenticate a user. The authentication dialog automatically finds and applies an existing credential and asks for user confirmation, thus making FIDO easier to use.</p>



<p>Always Require User Verification</p>



<p>This feature allows a user to protect the credentials on their authenticator with some form of user verification independent of the Relying Party. Platform authenticators and other authenticators with the feature enabled will always perform user verification. Some certification programs such as US FIPS 140-3 prohibit the authenticator performing signing operations without authentication.</p>

 Women in Identity member and Technology Strategist, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-sarnek-4a260321/">Anna Sarnek</a>, shares her thoughts on working in the “new normal” 
<p>Remote and flexible work environments had become a point of interest and the new buzzword before the forced shift during the COVID pandemic. Flexibility gradually gained traction among the tech sector, particularly in the startup culture that started associating flexibility with work-life balance, accrediting it as fundamental to innovation, happier employees and better work culture. While there are companies like Auth0, Bug Crowd and GitHub (now part of Microsoft) that have been fully remote from their founding, perhaps the most notable pre-COVID flexibility came from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-4-day-work-week-boosts-productivity-2019-11">Microsoft’s announcement of a 4-day work week</a> and the productivity increase that the company noted.</p>
<p>For those of us who were office bees, the shift to a fully remote work environment gradually repositioned remote working as the “new normal”. This was further amplified by companies like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlypage/2020/10/09/microsoft-will-let-employees-work-from-home-permanently/?sh=2c245272172a">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/technology/facebook-remote-work-coronavirus.html">Facebook</a> as they announced their intent to allow employees to remain fully remote. Yet I’ve had several conversations with team leaders at a number of these companies over the last 16 months which highlighted that they fully expect their teams to be both home- and office-located. I started scratching my head at this mixed messaging. It seemed misaligned with the corporate message. I realzed that corporate intent does not always translate down to a specific team leader’s intent. This, in turn, led me to ask: “Are you actually ready to be remote?”.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I know that there are specific job functions that flourish from an in-person working environment, particularly in product development where innovation often spins out of coffee chats. I’m also not about to minimize the significance that the office environment brings to company culture – my teams and colleagues were part of what made my own career so enjoyable. I also recognize that my newest friends in the industry are those who I’ve met once in person and who reside in South Africa, California, Texas, and Washington State. What I question is whether organisations may have untapped pools of talent that they are missing by not exploring these remote options. And is there&nbsp; and another layer to diversity and inclusion that we’re not addressing by dismissing the benefit of remote work.</p>
<p>It is no secret that we’ve made strides in closing the gender gap in employment <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/05/10/469739/breadwinning-mothers-continue-u-s-norm/">as women in America have become the breadwinners of the family</a>. It is easy to measure diversity and inclusion through data like headcount, demographic data and income statistics. (Although, I would point out that while US companies gather disability data, disability seems to be an often forgotten criterion in diversity and inclusion.) I wonder whether the next transformative step towards increased diversity and inclusion resides in cementing a work environment where location and commute are no longer a factor. At the end of the day, what makes us unique doesn’t just stop at human characteristics. It extends to our day-to-day environments – often the ones where we can best foster unique ideas and diverse perspectives. It is easy to claim successes in diversity by normalizing the entire employee base, stripping away the fact that environment is a substantial factor. There are unique characteristics as to how each family unit will operate, or how each individual will fit into society. These should be am important consideration when redesigning the “new normal” of workplace management.</p>
<p>At a personal level, I’m not currently constrained by a need to put my family first. Nor do I have a physical or hidden disability that affects my ability to work from an office. But as a partner of someone in the US military, I am all too aware of the tension that exists between juggling career and family life. So I ask you to think, is your team really ready to be remote?</p>
 Why not join the Women in Identity team to develop this theme at our interactive discussion on “Recruiting for Diversity”?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tuesday 29th June at 16:30 BST

<p>One of the most frequent questions we get asked is about the technology choice of Cosmos. Why do you use Cosmos technology ? why didn’t you choose Bitcoin or Ethereum ?</p>
<blockquote><p>The answer is simple : Horizontal scalability.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of computing history there were only a few few computers called Mainframes. &nbsp; The first (Bitcoin) and second generation (Ethereum) blockchains are like Mainframes: a single large computer where everyone shares the same computing resources and writes code with Cobol-like languages. Vertical scalability on these blockchains is limited, and horizontal scalability is impossible.</p>
<p>Vertical Scalability:&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes methods to scale the blockchain itself. Moving away from Proof-of-Work and optimizing its components, Tendermint BFT can reach thousands of transactions per second. The bottleneck factor is the application itself. For example, an application such as a virtual machine (e.g., the Ethereum virtual machine) will impose a much lower limit on transaction throughput than an application where transaction types and state transition functions are directly embedded in it (e.g., standard Cosmos SDK application).</p>
<p>This is one reason why application-specific blockchains make sense.</p>
<p>Horizontal scalability:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if the consensus engine and application are highly optimized, at some point the transaction volume of a single blockchain inevitably hits a wall that it cannot cross. This is the limitation of vertical scaling. To overcome it, the solution is to move to multi-chain architectures. The idea is to have multiple parallel chains running the same application managed by a common set of validators, making blockchains theoretically infinitely scalable. The details of horizontal scalability are quite complex and beyond the scope of this introduction.</p>
<p>We need the Internet. A network of networks where everyone runs their own server. We need the Internet of blockchains.</p>
<p>Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by the same consensus mechanism: <a href="http://www.tendermint.com">Tendermint.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is a Cosmos blockchain?</p>
<p>A Cosmos blockchain is a digital ledger maintained by a set of validators that remains correct even if some validators (less than a third) are malicious. Each validator stores a copy of the ledger on their computer and updates it according to the rules defined by the protocol protocol when they receive transaction blocks.</p>
<p>Cosmos technology makes sure that the ledger is properly replicated, which means that every honest party sees the same version of the ledger at all times. A Cosmos-based blockchain has the ability for actors to share a ledger without having to rely on a central authority.</p>
<p>Achieving 15,000 transactions per second, was one of the goals of commerce.network and the only technology that can do this with 100 validator nodes is Cosmos.</p>
<p>For this reason in 2018 we chose <a href="http://www.cosmos.network">Cosmos.</a></p>

<p>The UK’s Department for International Trade (DIT) is seeking tech companies from Australia and New Zealand who are considering the UK for international expansion. The selected group will join the official hybrid mission to&nbsp;<a href="https://londontechweek.com/">London Tech Week</a>&nbsp;in September 2021.</p>



<p>LTW&nbsp;is Europe’s largest technology festival. The annual event brings together the world’s most inspirational founders, global leaders, senior investors and rising talent. In 2020 the festival was held as a virtual event for the first time, attracting over 20,000 attendees from across the globe. The festival hosted over 700 sessions across 11 days, featuring upwards of 750 leading speakers and innovators.</p>



<p>Australian and Kiwi scale-ups who are considering expansion to the UK can apply to one of the following streams:</p>



  creative technology (AR/VR/MR, gamification, adtech, media, eCommerce, sportstech, marketing tech)  digital health and wellness  edtech  future technology (AI, cyber, blockchain/distributed ledger, IoT, robotics, big data, space)  impact technology (companies making a positive social or environmental impact)  



<p>The successful applicants will be invited to join a pre-mission in-person networking event in early September. They will then participate in a series of virtual evening sessions from 20 to 29 September 2021.</p>



<p>Those selected will join a programme curated for&nbsp;ANZ&nbsp;scale-ups. This will include sessions from key players in the UK tech ecosystem, who will provide exclusive insights on market opportunities and guidance on capital raising, R&amp;D and support to set up.</p>



<p>British Consul General and Deputy Trade Commissioner Asia Pacific (Australia and New Zealand), Louise Cantillon said:</p>



<blockquote><p>The UK tech sector has reached new heights and is the first country in Europe to reach 100 unicorns [tech companies valued at US$1 billion]. This means the UK now has the largest number of tech unicorns in Europe. With a fantastic track record for supporting tech companies and innovation, the UK is the ideal location for Australian and Kiwi tech companies who are ready to expand internationally.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The UK’s Department for International Trade team is delighted to be running this mission again. Despite physical restrictions, this is a great platform for the tech community to come together and for Australian and&nbsp;NZ&nbsp;companies to explore the opportunities the UK market has on offer. Good luck to everyone applying.</p></blockquote>



<p>DIT’s delegation last year was the largest ever from Australia and New Zealand. 130 tech founders and industry representatives joined the mission.</p>



<p>LTW&nbsp;is part of a broader programme of initiatives to increase digital trade and investment opportunities between the UK and&nbsp;ANZ&nbsp;tech sectors. Earlier this year the UK launched the Digital Trade Network (DTN) for Asia Pacific. The network will support UK-ANZ&nbsp;tech collaboration and support UK tech scale-ups in the region.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;LTW&nbsp;application process is open to Australian and New Zealand companies only. Victorian companies need to apply via the Global Victoria application.</p>



<p>Applications to join the mission will close on Friday 30 July 2021.</p>

<p>How to scale your Blockchain project using the Agile Method</p>
<p>The Agile Method is a particular project management approach that is used in software development. This method helps teams respond to the unpredictability of building software through the use of incremental and iterative work sequences, commonly known as sprints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The general principles of the Agile method</p>
<p>Our top priority is to satisfy the customer by releasing valuable software, right out of the box and continuously.<br>
We embrace changes in requirements, even at advanced stages of development.<br>
Agile processes leverage change for the customer’s competitive advantage.<br>
We frequently deliver working software, ranging from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, preferring short periods.<br>
Clients and developers must work together on a daily basis for the duration of the project.<br>
We base projects on motivated individuals.<br>
We give them the environment and support they need and trust in their ability to get the job done.<br>
A face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective way to communicate with and within the team.<br>
Working software is the primary measure of progress. – Agile processes promote sustainable development.<br>
Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to indefinitely maintain a steady pace.<br>
Continued focus on technical excellence and good design enhances agility.<br>
Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.<br>
The best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams.<br>
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, after which it adjusts and adapts its behavior accordingly.</p>
<p>History of the Agile Method&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the Agile ideas emerged in the 1970s. Studies and reviews were conducted on the Agile Method explaining its birth as a reaction against traditional approaches to project development. In 1970, Dr. William Royce published a paper discussing the management and development of large software systems. The paper outlined his specific ideas about sequential development. Specifically, his presentation stated that a project could be developed like a product on an assembly line: each phase of development had to be completed before the next phase could begin. The idea required that developers had to first put together all the requirements for a project. The next step was to complete its architecture. Code writing followed, and the development sequences continued in increments aimed at closing integral parts of the project. When these steps are completed, there is little or no contact between the specialized groups completing each phase of the project. The pioneers of the Agile Method believed that if developers studied the process, they would find the most logical and useful solution for software development.</p>
<p>Companies that use the Agile Method</p>
<p>Although there is no official list of companies that use the Agile Method for their projects, IBM is one of the companies that openly uses this method to develop software. In fact, many companies adopt it within their development structure, but they are not always open about their choice to use it. According to IBM, the use of the Agile Method generates significant organizational changes. IBM believes that many Agile software development teams will increase their chances of success by collaborating with reliable guidance. That company also helps clients implement their own Agile software development strategies for their projects and provides critical guidance that will help Agile software development teams avoid common pitfalls of adoption, expansion and implementation.</p>

<p>Blockchain Model Canvas (BMC)</p>
<p>Alex Osterwalder in his famous book explains a fantastic method to describe any business idea: the Business Model Canvas. With nine blocks in a grid drawn with a marker on a whiteboard and post-it notes he manages to explain any business in the universe.&nbsp; No wonder that because of the clarity of the information and the ease of use of the Business Model Canvas, Osterwalder was so successful. Next, we created our own model called BMC, more based on Ash Mayura’s work, which is fast, concise and in a single page represents the entire business model of a Blockchain project</p>
<p>What is the Business Model Canvas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a nine-block model called the Blockchain Model Canvas (BMC) (based on the work of Ash Mayura and Alexander Osterwalder) to describe your vision and a method called Lean Startup (based on the work of Eric Ries) to test validity.</p>
<p>The problem and the customers</p>
<p>Having found these first two elements, everything else in the BMC is easier to complete. It is for this reason that it always pays to analyze them together. Writing three main problems for the customer segment you have in mind, describe the three main problems that need to be solved.</p>
<p>The Value Proposition (VP)</p>
<p>At the heart of the BMC is the most important element of the entire model, and incidentally also the hardest to hit on the first shot. The VP must contain why the product is different, and that difference must matter. People who visit a site for the first time spend an average of eight seconds there. The Value Proposition is their first interaction with the product.</p>
<p>The Solution</p>
<p>Now you are ready to tackle the various solution scenarios. Understand that since everything we write about BMC is just an untested hypothesis, it is not advisable to convince yourself that you have found a definitive solution to your customers’ problems. At this stage, it is best to simply sketch out the salient features of the product alongside each problem. Ideally, you should strive to associate a solution to the client’s problem as late as possible, at least after you’ve spoken to the client once…</p>
<p>The Metrics</p>
<p>There are only five key metrics that drive a Blockchain project</p>
<p>Acquisition How users arrive and from what channels they arrive at your service<br>
Activation How users first register with your service<br>
Retention How users come back to your service again and again<br>
Referral How users like your service enough to suggest it to others<br>
Revenue How users buy your service</p>
<p>Channels</p>
<p>How to distribute our Value Proposition to the customer? In addition to defining the right product to build, it’s just as critical to start finding, building and testing a path to your customers from day one. There are a variety of distribution channels: some may be inapplicable in the early stages of your startup, while others may be feasible during the later stages of your startup.</p>
<p>The Relationship</p>
<p>In the first phase, you need to find potential clients (prospects) to talk to. You need to remember that you are looking for people who are suffering from a problem and who, as a result, should be willing to pay to have your solution. How do you find and reach prospects? There is no right answer, no magic formula. It depends on the resources available.</p>
<p>Revenues and Costs</p>
<p>Many companies postpone the “pricing question” because they don’t think their product is ready. Time and time again, you hear the phrase, “how do we charge for an MVP?” MVPs are supposed to solve big problems for the identified customer segment and so, by definition, the MVP must offer enough value to justify the expense.</p>

  <p>According to a recent global study from McKinsey &amp; Company, Covid-19 has accelerated business’ digital initiatives by, on average, seven years.</p>
<p>In acknowledgement of this monumental leap forward, GLEIF has launched several strategic initiatives over the past year designed to broaden the value of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in the fields of digital identity, digitized counterparty verification and their related use-cases. </p>
<p>As Germany celebrates Digital Day on June 18, GLEIF looks back at these milestones and considers what the future holds for the LEI and the global digital economy.  </p>
<p>The Validation Agent: Opening the door to business ID services for legal entities</p>
<p>In September, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-defines-new-validation-agent-role-for-banks-financial-institutions-to-simplify-and-accelerate-client-lifecycle-management">GLEIF introduced a new role into the Global LEI System called the Validation Agent</a>. The role is designed to help financial institutions and other supervised organizations make immediate gains in client lifecycle management and begin to develop innovative business identity services for their clients.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agents</a> leverage their know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulated ‘business-as-usual’ onboarding processes to obtain LEIs for their customers. By equipping their business client base with LEIs, Validation Agents can promote financial inclusion and create new value by pioneering revenue generating digital services in corporate identity management and cross-border supply chain relationships. </p>
<p>Validation Agents can also utilize the LEI to accelerate their internal digital transformation, in areas such as customer onboarding, payments and other transactions, and contract signing.</p>
<p>Since its launch at the end of 2020, the Validation Agent framework has gained significant traction around the world. Two significant institutions, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-confirms-j-p-morgan-as-first-validation-agent-in-the-global-lei-system">J.P. Morgan</a> and the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">China Financial Certification Authority (CFCA)</a>, have already completed the qualification process, with many more to follow. </p>
<p>The vLEI: Enabling instant, automated verification of business identity</p>
<p>Until now, the absence of an independent governance authority capable of establishing universal digitized trust between legal entities has presented an industry-wide barrier to innovation. To overcome this obstacle, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-advances-digital-trust-and-identity-for-legal-entities-globally">GLEIF launched a cross-industry development program</a> in 2020 to create a digitally verifiable LEI (vLEI).  When complete, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">the vLEI</a> will extend the Global LEI System to create a fully digitized LEI service that can enable instant and automated identity verification between counterparties operating across all industry sectors, globally. </p>
<p>With GLEIF acting as the ‘root of trust’, the vLEI service creates a cryptographically secure chain of trust that can replace the manual processes required to access and confirm an entity’s LEI data. This will give organizations worldwide the capacity to use their LEI’s non-repudiable identification data relating to their legal status, ownership structure and authorized representatives in a huge number of digital activities, many of them automated, enabling them to participate in the global digital economy for years to come. </p>
<p>As a result, the vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world; it will be the hallmark of authenticity for all legal entities everywhere.</p>
<p>In February 2021, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-unveils-issuance-and-infrastructure-models-for-verifiable-lei">GLEIF unveiled the official issuance and technical infrastructure models</a> which will support the development of the vLEI and now invites software developers to engage with the program’s stakeholders to explore how the vLEI can be leveraged in future applications. </p>
<p>Digital Certificates: Embedding the LEI to uphold trust in the system</p>
<p>As legal entities’ use of digital certificates continues to grow in both number and use-case application, so too does the time and cost required to maintain them. The increasing complexity of this task is already <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/the-lei-the-missing-ingredient-in-digital-certificate-management">undermining the trust system that digital certificates were designed to create</a>. </p>
<p>To address this problem GLEIF has worked closely with the International Standards Organization (ISO) to <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/iso-standardizes-the-process-of-embedding-leis-in-digital-certificates">standardize the process of embedding LEIs into digital certificates</a> at the point of issuance, which will make certificates easier to manage, aggregate and maintain, as well as increasing transparency across the digital identity ecosystem. <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/the-lei-in-digital-certificates">By becoming the common link between digital certificates</a>, the LEI will provide certainty of identity in any online interaction, making it easier for everyone to participate with confidence in the global digital marketplace. </p>
<p>GLEIF is actively engaged with Certification Authorities (CAs) and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) to support and encourage LEI adoption in digital certificates as part of its new CA Stakeholder Group, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-launches-new-stakeholder-group-to-accelerate-the-integration-of-leis-in-digital-certificates">announced in March 2021</a>. This group aims to facilitate the transfer of mutually beneficial information between stakeholders in a joint effort to develop best practice guidelines and case studies for LEI integration. Following this, GLEIF <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">welcomed the first commercial demonstration of an LEI embedded within a digital certificate</a> with the launch of the China Financial Certification Authority’s (CFCA) TrustSign® software in March 2021. </p>
<p>LEI Search 2.0: Enriching and automating access to LEI data</p>
<p>GLEIF has also been hard at work to ensure the LEI’s own tools stay ahead of the digitalization curve. </p>
<p>In 2020, in line with its vision to enable broader, automated use of the LEI, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-answers-industry-demand-for-customized-automated-access-to-rich-lei-data-with-lei-search-2-0-and-companion-api">GLEIF completed its migration to LEI Search 2.0</a>, a new LEI search engine with rich data functionality, and published a companion API enabling third-parties to set up fast, customized and automated searches and retrieve open, higher quality LEI data from within their application environments.</p>
<p>By expanding the number of search parameters available, <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/search/">LEI Search 2.0</a> delivers a new level of transparency over how legal entities have evolved over time, enabling faster and more sophisticated counterparty due diligence, heightened granularity in regulatory oversight procedures and richer reporting potential for market data aggregators. </p>
<p>What’s next? </p>
<p>In the coming months GLEIF will continue working hard to advance these strategic initiatives. </p>
<p>The Validation Agent Framework is maturing and GLEIF’s focus is now on championing the roles benefits and encourage take-up from financial institutions and other supervised organizations around the world. </p>
<p>The vLEI continues to evolve at pace as stakeholders across healthcare, pharmaceutical, telecom, automotive and financial services begin to build out sector-specific applications. </p>
<p>In collaboration with members of the CA Stakeholder Group, GLEIF continues to combat complexity and advance trust and transparency across the digital certificate ecosystem around the world.</p>
<p>The LEI’s legacy is proudly rooted in financial services and regulation. Its future, however, undeniably points beyond to broader, digitized adoption and utilization across public and private sectors around the world. The Global LEI System is the only open, commercially neutral, and regulatory endorsed system capable of establishing digitized trust between all legal entities everywhere. It was established as a public good, and GLEIF remains committed to ensuring that every last drop of value is wrung from the system, and used to the benefit of all.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has given many consumers their first taste of virtual content tied to physical locations, with restaurants around the world replacing menus with QR codes for customers to scan. This trend is accelerating, with augmented reality (AR) and integrated digital/physical experiences becoming more commonplace. But the merging of our physical and digital worlds can't really take off while we rely on QR codes posted everywhere or siloed smartphone apps for each use case.</p><p><a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">Geo Web</a> is creating a set of open protocols to anchor digital content in the physical world on a shared, fair, decentralized network. By using NFTs and a creative system of property rights, Geo Web hopes to create the virtual land layer that can be overlaid on the offline "meatspace" for any use case.</p> Decentralizing ownership of the web's AR platform <p>As augmented reality (AR) technology matures and it becomes easier to layer digital content into physical spaces, a key question becomes "who controls the platform?" &nbsp;With a purely open, unconstrained platform there will be competing content that drowns out high-value data with noise and spam. And with closed, proprietary platforms, one dominant gatekeeper could exert massive power.</p><p>Geo Web co-founder Graven Prest first started thinking about geospatial AR after seeing one such platform in 2014:</p><blockquote>I realized that whoever created that platform would control a global virtual real estate market.</blockquote><p>Unlike with virtual reality (VR) and "other metaverses," with AR it's likely important that we all share a single platform so that we can interact with it together. As Prest puts it, "We have one Earth we all share, and I don't want to be walking down the street and be in a different metaverse than you are. We need to coordinate our collective attention, and the only way we're going to do that is by being fair and legitimate."</p><p>In pursuit of this vision, Geo Web combines decentralized AR content stored on Ceramic with a system of digital property rights tied to physical land which keeps the content of every land parcel productive, while enabling open participation and community ownership of an augmented, shared reality.</p> NFTs for digital land parcels <p>Geo Web accomplishes this by representing each parcel of physical land as an NFT in a <a href="https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/core-contracts">registry smart contract</a>. The owner of that NFT has exclusive rights to control the digital content associated with that parcel of land, which is stored in streams on Ceramic.</p>Claiming a Geo Web land parcel NFT in Times Square with the <a href="https://cadastre.geoweb.eth.link/">Geo Web Cadastre</a><p>The parcel owner can anchor any kind of digital content to that land on the <a href="https://cadastre.geoweb.eth.link/">Geo Web Cadastre</a>. For example, a restaurant can purchase the parcel it resides on and show its menu to guests or today's specials to people walking down the street. Sports teams can purchase parcels near their stadium or in their hometown to show highlights and news. Governments can rent space to display public service announcements (PSAs). Collectors can display their digital art, or museums could add digital information to their physical exhibits.</p><p>Geo Web uses a unique property rights system called <a href="https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/partial-common-ownership">partial common ownership (aka Harberger Taxes)</a> that works as follows:</p>  Parcel owners pay a license fee to the network (similar to a property tax). This fee goes to fund public goods on the network.  The fee is based on the owner's self-assessed value of the land.  At any time, anyone else can purchase the parcel at that self-assessed value.  <p>This ensures fair market pricing over time, and that valuable virtual land is being used productively. If a digital real estate mogul is squatting on valuable property and self-assessing a below-market rate to avoid paying fair fees, this model incentivizes a new virtual property developer to come in and purchase that land to put it to more productive use.</p><p>Each parcel owner can choose how they wish to use their digital airspace, and can change it freely over time. Individual consumers, standalone businesses, or broader efforts like gaming studios or media platforms can all participate on the same network and AR metaverse. This means users don't need to constantly switch applications, but instead can benefit from AR technology on a single easy, fair, and collectively-owned network that resembles the open web. Geo Web can become a shelling point for augmented reality tied to physical geography.</p> Managing dynamic, decentralized content at scale <p>To tie virtual content to specific parcels, Geo Web needed a way to store and manage that content such that:</p>  The content can be anything - from text to digital art to videos  Only the current parcel owner is able to control it  The content can change often at a reasonable cost  <p>Essentially, Geo Web needed a way to manage dynamic, ever-changing IPFS content, with access control permissions limited to the current NFT holder. They considered using an end-to-end smart contract solution for storing the CIDs of static IPFS files, but the team ultimately decided that this model would be prohibitively expensive and cumbersome since it would have required a smart contract interaction for every content update.</p> Ceramic streams for decentralized content storage <p>In their search for the best way to anchor digital content to NFTs, Geo Web discovered Ceramic's mutable data streams. Says Prest:</p><blockquote>Ceramic is the best, easiest way to manage mutable information peer-to-peer</blockquote><p>Ceramic provides a completely trustless way to save and update content that can operate at the scale they needed, without requiring blockchain transactions. In their design, each NFT points to a Ceramic stream where the NFT's owner is the only one able to publish, select, and update the digital content they want displayed for that physical location.</p>A simple Geo Web browsing experience seen as if you were in Antarctica<p>When any user navigates to a parcel's corresponding real-world location, they will be able to see and interact with this content through <a href="https://browse.geoweb.eth.link/">Geo Web's geospatial browser</a> or any other browser that supports the Geo Web protocol.</p> Decentralized identity for personalized experiences <p>Geo Web is also using <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, Ceramic's identity protocol, for user identity. In addition to basic profiles, this lets Geo Web store the keys for all Ceramic streams a user has control over. As Geo Web matures, they will also store settings and preferences with IDX, giving Geo Web the ability to implement user-centric controls, reputation systems, and filters for the content that users prefer or would like to avoid, for a more personalized and fine-tuned user experience. This lets Geo Web stay neutral and open at the base protocol layer while enabling each user to create their own customized experience.</p> DID:NFT for NFT-based access control <p>In the future, Geo Web plans to add <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-94/CIP-94.md">DID:NFT</a> - a standard that turns any NFT into a decentralized identity (DID) that can control content on Ceramic - to give the current owner of each land parcel exclusive access to update the Ceramic stream that contains the parcel's entire content history.</p><blockquote>With DID:NFT, because the content that is anchored to a Geo Web parcel can actually be owned by the parcel itself, when someone buys the land they're also getting the infrastructure that's been built up on that land.</blockquote><p>Without DID:NFT, each time a parcel is sold a new stream must be created. This means that every ownership transfer wipes the previous content from the land. However, tying content ownership and rights directly to the land NFT opens up new and exciting use cases – both for Geo Web's property model, but also for NFT use cases in general.</p><p>Geo Web envisions an ecosystem of "digital real-estate developers" building infrastructure, tooling, applications, and marketplaces around NFT land parcels. We may see virtual fixer-uppers and physics-defying architecture in the AR metaverse before too long.</p> What's next for Geo Web? <p>Geo Web is actively researching and testing Ethereum L2 roll-up solutions for a mainnet fair launch later this year. The team will also be adding to the network's open publishing and browsing infrastructure, including integrating DID:NFT and releasing native browser apps for more immersive augmented reality experiences.

 ENGIE Energy Access and Energy Web Announce DeFi Crowdfunding Platform to Help Scale Solar, Mini Grids in Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/zf9_yiAekJs">Seth Doyle</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/zf9_yiAekJs">Unsplash</a><p>Zug, Switzerland and Berlin, Germany — 17 June 2021 — Today nonprofit Energy Web and<a href="https://www.engie-energyaccess.com/"> ENGIE Energy Access</a> — one of the leading off-grid, Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) solar and mini-grid solutions providers in Africa — announced a partnership to accelerate energy access in sub-Saharan Africa through a decentralized finance (DeFi) crowdfunding platform. The DeFi application will be built on the open-source Energy Web tech stack and enable investors to provide microloans that support clean energy deployment.</p><p>In 2019, an estimated <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity">580 million people</a> in sub-Saharan Africa remained off grid and in the dark, accounting for three-quarters of the global population without electricity access. After years of steady declines since 2013, that number has risen in 2020 due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Thus rapid deployment of solar home systems (SHSs) and clean energy mini-grids is a crucial humanitarian cause that supports health, quality of life, and economic growth in off-grid regions of the subcontinent.</p><p>ENGIE Energy Access integrates and unites ENGIE’s solar home system companies, Fenix International and ENGIE Mobisol, as well as its mini-grids provider, ENGIE PowerCorner, under one entity and one name. “To date, ENGIE Energy Access has served over 1 million customers and 6 million people in 9 countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The new DeFi platform in partnership with Energy Web will help ENGIE Energy Access deploy more solar faster, by directly tackling a key challenge: access to low-cost financing,” commented Gillian-Alexandre Huart, CEO of ENGIE Energy&nbsp;access.”</p><p>“We’re excited to bring crypto-based decentralized finance to rural electrification in Africa,” said Stefan Zelazny, Head of Software and IT at ENGIE Energy Access and previously CIO at ENGIE Mobisol. “We believe this can accelerate much-needed clean energy deployment throughout the region by connecting impact-oriented investors with unbanked rural customers. Combining the technology that remotely connects and controls our Solar-Home-Systems with the Energy Web Chain will result in the first smart asset-backed NFT where asset use can be controlled via the&nbsp;chain.”</p><p>The first phase of this initiative will focus on integrating the Energy Web software tech stack with ENGIE’s platform to further promote rural electrification in Africa. The crowdfunding platform to be developed by Energy Web will allow micro-investors to finance the installation of clean energy assets by staking Energy Web Tokens (EWT), the native token of the Energy Web Chain, in exchange for a fixed interest rate. This setup will unlock capital from the global cryptocurrency market, bringing a significant new source of capital to clean energy deployment in Africa. To help mitigate the risk for everybody involved, the Community Fund of Energy Web will back this first phase of the platform. Giving people in Africa access to new green electricity solutions utilizing the Energy Web DOS is a great first use case for the Community Fund.</p><p>In the second phase, Energy Web will work together with ENGIE Energy Access to give a unique decentralized identifier (DID) to each one of the home appliances and rooftop solar deployed by ENGIE. This way, one can directly add credits to the appliances owned by locals to support their access to electricity and its services.</p><p>“Creating positive impact in people’s lives is one of our core principles at Energy Web. But the global energy transition must also reach those who don’t yet have access to electricity,” explained Energy Web’s Walter Kok. “We are happy that ENGIE — one of the biggest energy players in the world and one of the founding members of the Energy Web Chain — has embraced the Energy Web technology stack to support such an important mission.”</p><p>About ENGIE Energy Access<br>ENGIE Energy Access is the leading Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGo) and mini-grids solutions provider in Africa, with a mission to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy solutions and life-changing services with exceptional customer experience. The company is a result of the integration of Fenix International, ENGIE Mobisol and ENGIE PowerCorner; and develops innovative, off-grid solar solutions for homes, public services and businesses, enabling customers and distribution partners access to clean, affordable energy. The PAYGo solar home systems are financed through affordable installments from $0.14 per day and the mini-grids foster economic development by enabling electrical productive use and triggering business opportunities for entrepreneurs in rural communities. With over 1,700 employees, operations in nine countries across Africa (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), over 1 million customers and 6 million lives impacted so far, ENGIE Energy Access aims to remain the leading clean energy company, serving millions of customers across Africa by&nbsp;2025.</p><p>For more, please visit<a href="https://engie-energyaccess.com/"> https://engie-energyaccess.com/</a></p><p>Contact&nbsp;: <a href="mailto:stefan.zelazny@engie.com">stefan.zelazny@engie.com</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

 Energy Web Names Chief Commercial Officer Jesse Morris as Energy Web CEO, Outgoing CEO Walter Kok will lead Lab.EnergyWeb <p>Zug, Switzerland — 16 June 2021 — Today we’re excited to introduce <a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">The Lab (Lab.EnergyWeb)</a>, a new R&amp;D initiative housed within Energy Web to build out cutting-edge functionality, services, SDKs, and other enhancements on the Energy Web stack. Initial projects under development within our new Lab unit include a DeFi application for crowdfunding energy-sector projects in emerging economies via Energy Web Tokens, additional staking models on the Energy Web stack, migrating non-energy crypto applications to the Energy Web Chain, and launching the development of Energy Web Chain 2.0. The announcement comes as we celebrate the second anniversary of the launch of the Energy Web Chain later this week. Walter Kok will lead this new initiative whilst he steps down as&nbsp;CEO.</p><p>In tandem, we’re pleased to announce that Jesse Morris, our longtime chief commercial officer, has been named Energy Web’s new CEO. Since our founding in 2017, Morris’ leadership has been fundamental to the growth of Energy Web into the world’s largest ecosystem of energy companies focused on accelerating the energy transition with open source digital technology.</p><p>“This is an exciting moment for Energy Web, as we move into the next phase of the organization’s evolution,” explained Jules Kortenhorst, EW Foundation Council member and CEO of Energy Web co-founder RMI. “Walter came to Energy Web to launch the world’s first public blockchain tailored to the energy sector. Under his leadership the Energy Web community experienced very rapid growth while adoption of the EW tech stack has scaled in a growing list of major projects around the world — especially impressive against the backdrop of a global pandemic. The next era of Energy Web with Jesse’s leadership promises to be just as revolutionary. Jesse has been instrumental to the success of Energy Web since its incubation and together with Walter leading the Lab we will continue to accelerate the energy transition through digital&nbsp;tech.”</p><p>In a similar move of promoting from within, Kok was Energy Web’s chief operating officer before being named its second CEO in August 2019. He came to Energy Web from a 30+ year career spanning ING Bank, Vodafone Global Enterprise, and NEC Corporation and several startups. Prior to joining the co-founding team of Energy Web, Morris was a principal in the electricity practice at RMI, where he partnered with utilities, technology providers, developers, and regulatory stakeholders to help distributed energy resources become an integral, widely-accessible part of the global electricity system.</p><p>“Walter and I have been working closely together for years now and we’re both excited about our new roles and responsibilities,” reflected Morris. “Me taking the reins as CEO will free up Walter to incubate a series of bleeding-edge crypto and digital projects under the new Lab. This move will make it easier for not just Energy Web as an organization but for our entire community to continue innovating well ahead of the energy&nbsp;market.”</p><p>“Coming from major enterprises like ING Bank and Vodafone, it’s been an incredible experience to lead the Energy Web team. There are so many talents at Energy Web and Jesse stepping into the CEO role is a great example of how we develop the new breed of leaders.” added Kok. “We are growing fast around the world, and I’m thrilled to continue informing our strategy as we forge ahead with The Lab. We will kick-off additional bleeding edge projects to demonstrate the level of innovation that is possible with our EW-DOS today. We are going to speed up the pace and will bring other sectors to our carbon-neutral Energy Web Chain too. Acting our way into new thinking”</p><p>Energy Web’s core team has grown rapidly under Kok’s watch — scaling alongside our ambition and work with the global energy and crypto sectors — almost tripling since the EW Chain’s one-year anniversary in 2020. In less than two years, the EW Chain’s validator network has grown to 44 companies spanning four continents. Some 45,000 wallet addresses have already generated 28 million transactions. Yet the biggest gains are&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Morris concluded by saying, “The two industries we straddle — crypto and grid digitization — are still in their infancy. For as much as we’ve collectively accomplished until now, we’re just getting started.”</p><p><a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">Learn more about The Lab at lab.energy.org</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>Over the last couple of weeks I’ve been thinking quite a lot about the concept of the Trust Economy.&nbsp; What is it? And why should we care about it?</p>



<p>My interest was first piqued when I came across two videos on YouTube from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vbPXbm8eTw">Rachel Botsman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNog-xrc_YA">Philipp Kristian Diekhöner.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trust has always been at the centre of society overall and commerce in particular.&nbsp; There’s a reason why during the first industrial revolution banks always built the most impressive, secure looking buildings in town – so you trusted them to deposit you money there!</p>



<p>Now with the 4th industrial (digital) revolution the old vertical, siloed trust models are breaking down and we are moving to a more horizontal, distributed environment.&nbsp; The decline in trust in the media (fake news) and the lack of trust we are all now feeling with the way big tech is monetising our personal data is creating ever increasing demands from people to significantly improve trust models for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have a strong sense that Aotearoa New Zealand has always projected a reasonably trusted persona globally;&nbsp; good people, good morals, good global citizens etc… and now our Covid-19 response would appear to have bolstered the level of trust people have in us across the planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example of this is the <a href="https://brandirectory.com/globalsoftpower/">Global Soft Power Index</a> which for its 2021 ranking had Aotearoa New Zealand as the fastest improving nation in the Index, claiming 16th place in the ranking (up from 22 last year), citing “perceptions of New Zealand have no doubt been bolstered as nations such as the UK and the US cede their usual place as leaders in public health, with both battling repeated waves of the COVID-19 virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There would now appear to be a real opportunity for us to focus on really enhancing our trust position globally.&nbsp; 100% Pure New Zealand was a really strong brand position.&nbsp; Might something like 100% Trusted New Zealand be a branding idea for our future?</p>



<p>And in the context of the digital economy, digital identity and trust go hand in hand as cornerstones of the Trust Economy.</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>When Energy Web <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/press-release-energy-web-foundation-launch/">launched in early 2017</a>, we did so with the support of two key cofounders: RMI, a leading global think-and-do tank focused on the energy transition, and Grid Singularity, an award-winning energy blockchain developer.</p><p>Two years later in June 2019 we <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-launches-worlds-first-public-open-source-enterprise-grade-blockchain-3a67fc457341">launched the Energy Web Chain</a> in partnership with a global community of energy companies, grid operators, and other enterprises that had grown into the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-surpasses-100-affiliates-en-route-to-becoming-largest-energy-blockchain-4823616b1579">world’s largest energy blockchain ecosystem</a>. Within the first year of the EW Chain’s operation, solutions and transactions on the network grew quickly, while the validator network <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-chain-celebrates-tripling-of-validator-network-9cdfd830e044'">more than&nbsp;tripled</a>.</p><p>As we now look ahead to the third year of the Energy Web Chain’s growing prominence in the energy and crypto spaces, the cofounders remain as committed as ever to the Energy Web mission of accelerating the energy transition by unleashing the potential of blockchain and other digital technologies.</p><p>For example, RMI partnered with Energy Web and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) earlier this year to launch the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord</a>. Meanwhile, Grid Singularity has continued to focus on <a href="https://gridsingularity.com/d3a/">building energy market exchanges</a> on top of the Energy Web tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Thus on this EW Chain anniversary, we are pleased to share these statements from our cofounders, who are re-affirming their commitment to supporting the Energy Web Chain, the Energy Web Community, and the greater Energy Web ecosystem moving&nbsp;forward:</p> Statement from&nbsp;RMI <p>“RMI will continue to strongly support the value created by the Energy Web Foundation and the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. As a steward of EWF’s mission and a broader champion of the energy transition, RMI commits to employ its EWT only where necessary to build new business models, engage in bonding and chain-related activities, and more broadly stimulate the advance of critical decentralized digital markets that support a rapid transition to a zero-carbon economy. We recognize that building a successful utility token platform will take time and know that EWF is well on its way to creating a world-changing model that fuses decentralized, low carbon generation with distributed ledgers and computing.”</p> Statement from Grid Singularity <p>“Grid Singularity will continue to strongly support the value created by the Energy Web Foundation and the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. Grid Singularity intends to use held EWT to scale the development of the Grid Singularity energy exchange for peer-to-peer and community trading, to invest in community applications and to contribute to the next growth stage of EWF 2.0, leveraging Polkadot technology, such as by staking, bonding for parachains, and advancing on-chain governance.”</p><p>Their statements are a testament to their continued trust and investment in the potential of blockchain and other decentralized, digital technology—including the evolving Energy Web tech stack—to accelerate the energy transition.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-cofounders-rmi-and-grid-singularity-reaffirm-their-commitment-to-the-mission-81ef02df81bb">Energy Web Cofounders RMI and Grid Singularity Reaffirm Their Commitment to the Mission</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

     <p>Denver, CO (JUNE 14, 2021) – Bonifii, an industry leader in privacy- and security-enhanced solutions, announces the release of CUFX versions 4.5 and 5.0.  More than just a recent update, the two versions are a milestone in the evolution of CUFX (Credit Union Financial Exchange).  Credit unions can share data between banking systems by leveraging CUFX, the open integration standard designed to make products and services available to their members more quickly, while reducing implementation costs. </p>
<p>CUFX was created by and continues to be a community of thought and technology leaders to advance a financial services ecosystem standard that reduces technical complexity, drives down costs, and improves speed to market.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://bonifii.com/2021/02/credit-union-financial-exchange-cufx-to-be-acquired-by-culedger/">With the acquisition by Bonifii earlier this year</a>, CUFX is a protocol for the exchange of data supported by a systems integration standard that will allow credit unions the ability to increase the speed to become more digital,” says John Ainsworth, president/CEO of Bonifii.  “We’re very pleased these new updates will enable greater security and privacy of information transmitted between credit union systems.”</p>
<p>Key Feature of CUFX Version 4.5</p>
 
 CUFX, Version 4.5, has been published and will expand the capability to accept verified credentials, establish secure connection protocols, and pass decentralized identifiers for verification in the credential group message. These new capabilities will enable CUFX to utilize cutting-edge technologies for superior security in communications, identity, and fraud prevention that will benefit not only credit unions and their members but the providers that service this industry.  
 
<p>Key Features of CUFX Version 5.0</p>
 
 Open API 3 upgrade so that users can now show the override and properly show the examples in Swaggerhub. This will allow architects to pass content in the message body where it is more secure and encrypted.  
 New data elements have been expanded for all account types to ensure their availability and consistent use for all account types—deposits, loans, and investments. 
 For remote deposit, the update improves the organization of data for images and image validation for better results.

<p>Diplomas and Certificates no more falsifiable, thanks to the APP DIPLOMI on blockchain by T.S.C. srl on Commercio.network.</p>
<p>18 students of the Re-Europe training path for young graduates , will receive in Herculaneum their certificates with electronic delivery (eDelivery) on blockchain.</p>
<p>Ercolano, June 14th, 2021 ,</p>
<p>18 students of the Re Europe training path, to enhance the skills necessary to support the management of European and regional funds, will receive their certificates that will be certified on blockchain.</p>
<p>The benefits of using this innovative technology in the school environment and consequently also for the working context are many.</p>
<p>The first is certainly to allow all parties involved, such as students, colleges, universities and companies, to easily and immediately verify if the digital diploma in possession is the original one and does not present alterations from the one produced by the Institute or by the ‘Issuing Body.</p>
<p>Thanks to the solution developed by T.S.C Technology srl and to the use of the blockchain technology of Commercio.network the students will be able to guarantee the authenticity and the integrity of their electronic diplomas and certificates to potential employers all over the world, in a simple and immediate way.</p>
<p>In fact, this innovative solution allows students to generate an electronic diploma or certificate. Each digital document has a unique and unchangeable fingerprint. This fingerprint is recorded in an unchangeable way on the blockchain, through a special transaction called ShareDOC. This transaction certifies the electronic delivery (eDelivery) of the diploma from the Issuing Institution to a student’s personal wallet (ewallet) that can in the future contain all of the student’s educational and biographical information while maintaining the highest degree of privacy currently possible.</p>
<p>The electronic certificate visually looks like a classic paper diploma, where all the identifying information is present: school year, name of the student, name of the school or institution, type of course attended, date and place.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not simply a matter of having a digitized copy of a paper certificate.&nbsp; Due to its decentralized nature, blockchain technology cannot be tampered with, and the certification of graduation remains forever.</p>
<p>The blockchain record contains encrypted information without any personal data, and therefore cannot be directly traced to the student at all.</p>
<p>The adoption of blockchain in schools is already law in Malta and is used on an experimental basis in several prestigious universities abroad such as MIT in Boston, Holberton School in San Francisco and Imperial College in London. In Italy, a few institutions have launched similar initiatives, waiting for the school system to massively adopt these solutions.</p>

		<p>In short, the way to [advancement], if you desire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words: industry and frugality.</p>
<p>–Benjamin Franklin<br>
‘The Way to Wealth” (1758)</p>
<p>Technology investment is regarded by many leaders as the single most strategic investment that institutions of higher learning can make to accelerate their mission and achieve their business strategy in a timely and effective manner. Yet, all too often institution senior leadership bemoan the fact that technology investment continues to increase as a share of annual operational expense while returning little return on that investment. This dilemma begs a few questions. First, why is this the case ? What can/should leadership do to extract maximum value from their escalating technology costs?</p>
<p>Ideally, technology should be an accelerator for higher education, yet many institutions suffer chronically from overpriced and under utilized technology assets.&nbsp; Over time these assets become expenses that do&nbsp; little more than keep the lights on for an institution, constraining IT leaders from emerging as thought leaders in support of the overall institutional mission and vision.&nbsp; The effort required to maintain legacy systems often prevents IT from emerging as a strategic asset that is able to meet the wants and needs of faculty, students, and staff.&nbsp; The unwise investments lead to the law of diminishing returns as these technology investments chip away at the institution’s balance of technology expense versus value.&nbsp; This is evinced annually through the escalating price of licensing and maintenance fees for hardware, software, and technical services which in reality produces very little improvement to automation, workflow, or true cloud hosting and cloud management. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding to key functional officer and executive stakeholder frustration, these same technologies often accrue increasing indirect expenses in the form of time spent by the resident-based functional office and technical office labor resources, namely people, and the good people&nbsp; always seem to bear the brunt of the burden.&nbsp; Shadow IT organizations emerge, that is, functional office staff self-modifying or sometimes by management decree perform more and more duties aligned with that of technical professionals as a result of underutilized technology, slow and poor upgrades and configurations.&nbsp; Shadow IT also emerges because actual IT spend increases the amount of knowledge, skill, and effort required to maintain information systems as opposed to maturing them. This lack of technical professional unity results in haphazard cybersecurity protocols whenever new tools are supplied by functional offices to authenticate behind the firewall, whereas they ought to be demanded by functional offices and supplied by a centralized IT authority, or at a minimum, a decentralized IT community that is centralized on standard operating procedures, practices, and policies through formal and executive sponsored governance.&nbsp; I’m fine with shadow IT, so long as it stands in the shadow of my department.&nbsp; In the worst of these scenarios, and unfortunately all too common, technology is refreshed as an annual budget surprise to the CIO and the CFO because of poor planning in IT management ranks, and the lack of coordination with functional office managers, resulting in sudden death (i.e., premature-obsolescence) of the technology system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The opportunity cost couldn’t be more clear; the same functional and technical staff would best serve each other, the faculty, students, and the institutional mission if they could afford sufficient time to evolve and mature their knowledge, skill, and effort so as to keep up with the latest trends, reduce costs through improved efficiency, and add value through increased output, in other words; accelerate.&nbsp; Some accelerators include, but are not limited to; cabinet leadership enterprise thinking regarding information systems and data governance, reorganizing IT into its various IT reference disciplines (e.g., network, security, cloud, user support, emerging technologies etc.) and empowering its staff to achieve excellence in their specialization.&nbsp; Lackluster and legacy IT departments, staff, and tools cause presidents, CFOs, Deans, faculty, and more, to assert technology as an expensive cost center, as opposed to a valuable investment, to evoke cliches for technology resources and IT leadership such as “the gift that keeps on giving.”</p>
<p>Begs The Question – Savings, Capital, and Technology<br>
Okay Mr. Smart guy, then what’s the silver bullet?&nbsp; Well, none exists, but the application of business and social science to assist information technology/information systems management is an option.&nbsp; Economists in this space have been gathering and synthesizing data into useful information and wisdom for over a century, Nobel prizes have been awarded for theoretical proofs leading to practical benefits and heuristics, and application of these by microeconomic entrepreneurs have evinced their real value.&nbsp; Classical and neoclassical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Ludwig Von Mises asserted institutions would best serve themselves, their constituency, and the overall economy through frugality and savings.&nbsp; Others, such as John Maynard Keynes and new keynesian economists Stanley Fischer and Gregory Mankiw, assert that while this may work for individuals and firms, there may be antithetical results at higher levels of aggregation in economic policy, hence the paradox of thrift. Still, both major schools of economic thought agree that the best microeconomic policy for individual decision makers and collective wills of the institution (the firm), in public, private, and non-profit sectors is one that incorporates frugality in expenses and a strong focus on savings in both purchasing power as well capital planning and services.</p>
<p>Technical Progress<br>
Economist Robert Solow, Nobel Prize winner, Harvard graduate, and professor of technology and growth economics at MIT, discovered something of significance for the world of enterprise as well as key decision makers of public and non-profit institutions that he refers to as the Solow Growth Model.&nbsp; First, he concluded that savings and frugality has a positive impact on growth, but that savings, frugality, and capital planning are subject to the law of diminishing returns just like anything.&nbsp; Second, Solow calculated that about four fifths (⅘ths) of growth in output per worker was attributable to technological progress and entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Technology seems to be more important to institutional economic growth, when acquired and adopted correctly, than savings, frugality, labor, research and development, and natural resources.&nbsp; According to Solow, increasing saving and capital investment, even with aid, isn’t enough to stimulate growth; the adoption of technology is essential.</p>
<p>Finally, entrepreneurship and technology subject matter expertise are in short supply and high demand, especially in our volatile time due to the pandemic.&nbsp; Because of the constant change in technology and business process, exasperated by the recent pandemic, it is of paramount importance that higher education institutions partner for success with the right experts and innovators.&nbsp; Subject matter experts, leaders, and innovators who possess the knowledge, skill, and ability as well the solutions and services to truly add value and accelerate the mission of higher education.&nbsp; Expertise and knowledge alone are not enough. Partners who have deliberately defined, designed, and applied this expertise and knowledge for the benefit of institutions by way of a defined ecosystem of solutions and services are necessary for real value to be rendered.&nbsp; As a non-profit minded organization, given birth by to by a highly esteemed council of university and college presidents, Edge represents the quintessential technology solutions and services organization as it has proven itself to be a maturely formed ecosystem of technology solutions, services, experts, and innovators who have aligned with every aspect of the student lifecycle to render real value to the higher education community.&nbsp; Our approach is an economic advancement one, it is a results based approach that leverages the collective and collaborative power of a fully mature technological economy that is at the ready and forefront always to serve the mission of higher education.</p>

 If we accept the premise that on the Internet “if you’re not paying, you’re the product”, in the Metaverse you will become a walking — talking billboard. The Metaverse, art by the author of this post <a href="https://www.picmonkey.com/legal/tos">under license by PicMonkey</a>. Intro: Video games&nbsp;now <p>Amongst the changes that “lockdowns” and “new normality” have brought, there is a revalorization of digital interactions as valuable and meaningful. Ironically, what was once regarded as isolationist or a poor substitute for “real life” (an expression used as an interchangeable semantic proxy for “in-person”) experiences, has become the glue that holds the social fabric together.</p><p>Connecting in and through digital spaces has been a staple of 2020: from work or formal education moving to online alternatives, to recreational uses of video platforms. In these virtual spaces, human ingenuity has found new testing grounds to deal with the challenges presented by the pandemic. It can be a thoughtful provocation to say that since lockdowns started, we might have been living in a proto-version of the Metaverse.</p><p>The silver lining is an accelerated digital transformation, even for those areas traditionally reluctant to innovate or that deemed remoteness incompatible with organizational culture (like small businesses adopting digital payments as opposed to inveterate cash-only business practices, or governmental bureaucracies offering online alternatives to otherwise mandatory in-person procedures).</p><p>Amidst this burgeoning digital life, video games have experienced an influx of new players, <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/game-engagement-during-covid-pandemic-adds-15-billion-to-global-games-market-revenue-forecast/">growing revenue</a>, and newfound mainstream respect. One year after designating video game addiction as a <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder">mental health disorder</a>, the OMS has taken a more nuanced position, acknowledging their positive value for socialization.</p><p>Beyond their collective value, in times of uncertainty video games constitute a space to regain some sense of control and security, as well as a place to <a href="https://anormallostphone.com/">exercise empathy</a>. By design, challenges in gaming are presented to the player with the implicit promise that they can be solved with the tools provided beforehand, and the skills gained along the way. Good game design will equip players with prerequisite skills and knowledge to arrive at that stage with a chance of success, and never confront them with a challenge that is impossible to win. With the unspoken pact that there is always -at least- one guaranteed possibility of triumph, losing just becomes a matter of trying but not a failure. With the reassurance of success looming ahead, losing becomes just another moving part of the game, a rehearsal in the path to&nbsp;winning.</p><p>Considering games as a narrative medium that separates itself from others by its interactivity, gaming presents unprecedented potential as a rehearsal space for empathy. When we play, we are able to try a different skin and participate in a story from a privileged insider perspective that no other medium can&nbsp;match.</p><p>Video games are consumed not only by playing but also by communal activities like engaging in watching others play. Streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube are popular amongst youth due to the added value of interpersonal interaction, a sense of belonging, and community building.</p><p>The Metaverse, defined as an encompassing, persistent, virtual world, can be seen as the newest iteration of the Internet, both an evolutionary step and a fusion of social networks and online gaming. As gaming becomes more ubiquitous and social media platforms resort to gamification mechanics to promote interaction between users, the frontiers between these two worlds tend to blur: platforms become games and games take the place of social media spaces. Twitch, which started as a platform to watch other people play games, has evolved into a community-building space where games are also played with the audience, by using overlays and gamified mechanics of interaction.</p><p>Fortnite has been a pioneer in this space, not only with its “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lJlaP-2HY">Party Royale</a>” mode and providing concerts and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/fortnite-is-screening-an-entire-christopher-nolan-movie-for-free/">movie screenings</a> (separated from the core gameplay but organically integrated as a whole) but also by creating a gaming experience that incentivizes socialization. Gaming platforms have become the new town square, where bonds, friendships, and rivalries are forged over voice&nbsp;chat.</p><p>Besides social aspects of play, in a receding economy for industries related to in-person activities (affected by the pandemic through overstressed supply chains and reduced demand), the video game industry and its ecosystem have been one of the few to increment growth. With changes in consumer behavior driven by stay-at-home routines, it is no surprise that fashion, movies, and other related domains are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gucci-roblox-76339d10f139e9b0d39761bd8426c11e">moving into digital spaces</a> and seeking to create digital doppelgangers of the goods and services they provide in the tangible world. Marketing and advertising are <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/01/the-metaverse-needs-responsible-stewardship-not-greedy-predators/">increasingly interested in the Metaverse</a>, as the next frontier for expanding their brand’s business and targeting prospective new audiences.</p><p>The recent explosion of the NFTs market is a closely related phenomenon, and its rise is partly attributable to their ability to create artificial scarcity. Through maiming their essentially infinitely replicable with near-zero marginal cost attribute, NFTs provide to digital goods the non-fungibility characteristic of analog goods. Decentralized blockchain applications and NFT’s based business models allow the creation of secondary markets for digital goods, providing a foundational economic backbone for the Metaverse.</p><p>Paired with advancements in VR/XR and AR technology, investment and <a href="https://epicgames.com/site/th/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse">funding</a> attracting new <a href="https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/">players</a>, all of these factors converge into creating a critical juncture for the pursuit of the Metaverse.</p> “Metaverse/s” and virtual&nbsp;worlds <p>The term Metaverse is attributed to Neal Stephenson and his book Snow Crash, a novel about a protagonist (actually, a Hiro Protagonist) interacting in a persistent, immersive, shared, virtual&nbsp;world.</p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/30455994@N03/4955876395">“Neal Stephenson — Snow Crash”</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/30455994@N03">RA.AZ</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>The concept, which both echoes and modifies the idea of “cyberspace,” a term popularized by the 1984 William Gibson novel “Neuromancer,” has been revisited in other sci-fi works like Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Both movie and book portray OASIS (which stands for Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), as a massively multiplayer online simulation accessible via haptic devices, that hosts entertainment, commercial and educative hubs.</p><p>People will participate in these spaces through a digital representation of themselves, as avatars or skins, that could assume any possible shape or form. Restrictions will probably come from the terms of service, community standards or policies, intellectual property infringements, or licensing requirements.</p><p>The Metaverse is different from virtual worlds in the sense that it aspires to contain all or several of these virtual worlds, or at least, to create interoperable gateways to connect them, functioning as an all-encompassing, unified portal and hub. That poses an interesting tension between the pretended decentralization where blockchain advocates see an intersection with the Metaverse, against its own monopolistic proposition. One friction that only can be solved by creating a pipeline of true interoperability, both technical and legal, that enables the flow and uniform treatment of data (by uniform data protection laws) and content (likewise, for intellectual property regulations).</p><p>The architecture of the Metaverse can be fragmented into several attributes that should be checked by those aspiring candidates:</p>  ubiquity: the Metaverse will need to encompass different aspects of human experience, from leisure to education, finances, political expression, etc. <a href="https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/cybersex-second-life/Content?oid=80223585">Adult clubs</a> have a prominent role in Second&nbsp;Life.  synchronicity; with events happening in real-time or a shared time-scale  interconnection: allowing the transition between several virtual worlds (relevant questions here will be about the portability of digital goods from one world to another, and if they will remain functional)  persistent, implying that events will take place at its pace no matter whether the person remains or not logged; and that they can`t probably be reset or modified (as in loading a saved&nbsp;game)  virtual/ immersive; being a digital representation that sets the Metaverse apart from AR interfaces that add layers of extended meanings and content to the physical&nbsp;world.  collective and shared; as in virtual worlds populated by other beings ( question remains if human,<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8410872"> artificial,</a> or&nbsp;both)  <p>Necessarily, it should provide a self-representation construct (in the form of skins, avatars, or any sort of digital manifestation able to interact within the virtual world), and arguably, building tools that enable creative outlets for the expansion of these worlds through a <a href="https://blog.siggraph.org/2019/10/siggraph-spotlight-episode-30-tim-sweeney-and-the-metaverse.html/">creator-centric </a>approach.</p><p>Questions remain on how those spaces will be adjudicated and governed. The answers to that will shape further attributes, such as: openness, decentralization, portability, artificial scarcity, and interoperability (allowing to interface with other applications, not just to create with the building tools provided as in user-generated content).</p><p>The core idea behind the Metaverse proposition is to create an immersive digital place that duplicates reality without physical constraints. Nevertheless, that doesn’t necessarily imply that real-world rules don’t apply in the Metaverse. Paraphrasing an iconic Morpheus quote from The Matrix, “some rules can be bent, others can be broken”, and even when the laws of physics may not apply, that most certainly won’t be the case of intellectual property rules and other regulatory frameworks. Governance challenges arise in similar ways to those already existing around the Internet, only to be enhanced by the invasive and intimate nature of this immersive technology with sensors and devices connected close to the body and extracting biometric sensitive data, -like eye-tracking devices-, that is ripe for abuse. Digital wellbeing and the <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/mm/2013/fox-chb-sexualized-virtual-selves.pdf">effects of virtual embodiment representations</a> should be carefully considered.</p>The Matrix, one of the cornerstones of simulation narratives.<p>Adding to that, the fact that it will be a privatized playground, with the potential to construct inferences by statistical mining; and the use of generative artificial intelligence paired with biometric data raises high privacy and self-determination concerns, in an ecosystem that could further lead to reinforcing tech- solipsism tendencies.</p><p>Even with strong contenders like <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/680139/minecraft-active-players-worldwide/">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>, or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/04/17/fortnite-metaverse-new-internet/">Fortnite</a>, that already have a huge player base and infrastructure to become aspiring Metaverses, the fact remains that there is still none that can claim the title. In the meanwhile, digital rights communities, academics, and policymakers should remain vigilant, and engage in this brave, new, virtual&nbsp;world.</p><p>(Note: This article is an excerpt of a forthcoming paper on the Metaverse and its governance).</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-metaverse-a-brave-new-virtual-world-2f040cbae7d4">The Metaverse: A brave, new (virtual) world</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Welcome to the Challenge</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance is pleased to announce our first global FIDO Developer Challenge, where participating developer teams will create and demonstrate compelling and innovative applications leveraging FIDO standards and technologies.  Prior challenges based in&nbsp;Korea over the past two years proved to be very successful and&nbsp; we are now pleased to expand this program globally.</p>



<p>FIDO has come a long way since the Alliance’s inception in 2012, going from a whiteboard concept to a core technology supported by billions of consumer devices worldwide.&nbsp; With over 85% of browsers now supporting FIDO Authentication, now is the time for web developers to ditch password-based logins in favor of FIDO’s approach, which provides a superior user experience and prevents phishing and other computer&nbsp;hacks.  We are looking forward to seeing the selection&nbsp; of implementations the developer community comes up with this year, leveraging the public FIDO2 WebAuthn API to bring FIDO Authentications to websites and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Projects we are looking for&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are looking for projects that address a technical or social challenge in today’s world. There is no limit on the development ideas, but we expect implementation of FIDO Authentication to take place in various fields such as Fintech, eCommerce, IoT, retail, blockchain, gaming and education. Samples from the previous regional challenge include projects like FIDO-based IoT storage services for low-income families, FIDO-based drone platforms, FIDO-based smart home security systems, FIDO- and DID-based smart health insurance card services and a FIDO-based passwordless WiFi router control system. We are happy to expand this year’s program globally to attract even more innovative ideas to solve technical and social challenges.</p>



<p>The process</p>



<p>The FIDO Developer Challenge takes place in a virtual format and focuses on implementation of the FIDO2 WebAuthn API. The Challenge is open to students, individual developers, and pre-seed stage venture companies only.</p>



<p>Our website contains all the details on how to participate in the FIDO Developer Challenge. Here are a few milestones we are looking forward to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  We will be accepting applications until July 9. Upon receiving applications from all over the world, we will do the initial screenings and announce the top 20 teams within two weeks of the application submission deadline.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, we will invite 20 teams to implement the FIDO2 WebAuthn API in their inventions, online services or products.  The teams that successfully implement FIDO2 will be invited to the final evaluation step, where they will give an online presentation and demo. They will also&nbsp; participate in a Q&amp;A with our judges.  The judges will select the top three teams, all of which will be featured in a session at our Authenticate conference (Oct 18-20 in Seattle, WA; USA), with the winner being offered the opportunity to attend with all their expenses paid by the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Prizes and opportunities</p>



<p>In addition to exposure at Authenticate, the top three teams will receive prizes from FIDO members, awarded public recognition, and the unique opportunity to share their business vision with panels of early-stage investors. More details can be found on the Challenge website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We encourage you to think outside the box, considering new experiences and benefits that FIDO can bring to users and developers alike. Best of luck to you all. We cannot wait to see your submissions!</p>

<p>Me2B Alliance’s&nbsp;Head of Validation Research,&nbsp;Noreen Whysel,&nbsp;recently presented&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theiaconference.com/session/shedding-light-on-dark-patterns-a-case-study-on-digital-harms/">“Shedding Light on Dark Patterns: A Case Study in Digital Harms,”</a>&nbsp;at the 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theiaconference.com/">Information Architecture Conference</a>.&nbsp;Whysel’s presentation was aimed at the digital creators&nbsp;in attendance. These&nbsp;designers, developers and product managers&nbsp;are responsible for developing&nbsp;technology products, and thus&nbsp;may&nbsp;perpetuate harmful or&nbsp;disrespectful patterns.&nbsp;Social media companies designing addictive apps – on purpose – is an extreme example of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whysel&nbsp;began&nbsp;the talk&nbsp;by&nbsp;describing the&nbsp;Me2B&nbsp;Alliance’s approach to&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/about/principles/">respectful technology behavior</a> and her contribution to our standards development and independent testing work.&nbsp;&nbsp;She then introduced the product integrity framework based on the Me2B Alliance’s Respectful Technology Specification, currently in development. The Specification incorporates routine information architecture heuristics and prioritizes clear communication with users – especially regarding their control over what they do and share, as well as what data may be collected from them. Whysel’s presentation included examples of <a href="https://me2ba.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Marketing/EeYWAV1wqqNNj77iE86ijZUBBPtlpg2uHQwQ22vzDfXSgA?e=uvwcRt">digital harms</a>&nbsp;known as&nbsp;“dark patterns.”&nbsp;She also&nbsp;encouraged the audience to rethink&nbsp;the&nbsp;labels&nbsp;themselves, asking,&nbsp;“is&nbsp;calling it a ‘Dark Pattern’ itself a dark pattern?”&nbsp;—&nbsp;pointing out the <a href="https://exygy.com/blog/racist-language-in-software/">inherent racism</a> of describing negative things as dark.&nbsp;She closed with advice on how to&nbsp;work with&nbsp;digital creators&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid harmful patterns&nbsp;and&nbsp;create a path toward&nbsp;healthy&nbsp;technology&nbsp;relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>June 10, 2021, Geneva Switzerland: After more than a year of pandemic restrictions, resulting in a greater than 70% decline in travel and tourism activity, health status exchange will enable economies and borders to reopen. On February 9th, 2021, the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC) was launched to build an interoperable bridge blueprint to accommodate varying standards-based health credential formats, driven by disparate governing authorities to serve the complex travel industry.</p><p>To implement a subset of its recommendations, on June 8th, 2021, <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) announced the facilitation of the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN), a network of expert collaborators to facilitate trust building and interoperable exchange of COVID certificates for safe reopening of borders globally by operationalizing the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p><blockquote><p>“The first wave of apps for proving one’s COVID status did not allow that proof to be shown beyond a single state or nation, did not avoid vendor lock-in, and did not distinguish between rich health data and simple passes. The Blueprint gives this industry a way to solve those issues while meeting a high bar for privacy and integrity, and GCCN turns those plans into action.”</p></blockquote><p>Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


&nbsp;<p>Good Health Pass Collaborative (GHPC) Releases Draft Blueprint for Digital Health Passes in Advance of G7 Summit </p><p>[Official GHPC press release <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GHPC-Blueprint-Announcement.pdf">here</a>]</p><p>As a global multi-sector initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes while streamlining the standards development process, GHPC grew from 25 partners to more than 125 companies and organizations from across the health, travel, and technology sectors within weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Initiated by leaders from the <a href="https://id2020.org/overview">ID2020 Alliance</a>, a collaborative effort was launched to produce the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint. The Blueprint addresses – in considerable depth and detail – nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be reached:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Consistent User Experience</p>  <p>Security, Privacy, and Data Protection</p>  <p>Identity Binding</p>  <p>Standard Data Models and Elements</p>  <p>Credential Formats, Signatures, and Protocols&nbsp;</p>  <p>Paper Credentials</p>  <p>Rules Engines</p>  <p>Trust Registries</p>  <p>Governance and Trust Frameworks</p>  <p>The nine drafting groups brought together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors, managed through a partnership with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> – a <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects">Linux Foundation project</a>.</p><p>On June 7th, 2021, GHPC announced the release of their eagerly-anticipated Blueprint in draft form [download <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/download/attachments/76241/GHPC%20Interoperability%20Blueprint_v1.0.0_June%207%202021.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1623073365535&amp;api=v2&amp;download=true">here</a>] for three weeks of stakeholder consultations and public comments. The primary intention of the announcement was to stimulate discussion at the <a href="https://www.g7uk.org/">G7 Summit</a>, which opens on Friday, June 11th, in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p><p>Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council at the Human Colossus Foundation, co-led the Standard Data Models and Elements drafting group, one of the nine interconnected GHPC drafting groups, to spearhead group recommendations on data elements, common models for data exchange, and semantic harmonization. The recommendations of that drafting group will help to enable data interoperability without putting any undue burden on existing health systems and workflows.&nbsp;</p><p>Key recommendations from the Standard Data Models and Elements drafting group include:</p>  <p>Data elements. The drafting group specified standard data elements for three COVID-19 credentials —vaccination, test, and recovery— based on the European Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/policy/network_en">eHealth Network</a> recommendations. The group also defined data elements for a standard travel pass consisting of name, date of birth, and an event-specific status indicator;&nbsp;</p>  <p>A common model for data exchange. To standardize and facilitate the exchange, sharing, and storing of data from multiple sources, the drafting group specified <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/">HL7 FHIR (release 4)</a> as a common data model for COVID-19 credentialing initiatives to promote interoperability between systems that encode healthcare data in different ways.; and</p>  <p>Semantic harmonization. The final group recommendation was <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/cjzegoi58xgpfzwxyrqlroy48dihwz">Overlays Capture Architecture</a> (OCA) as a solution for semantic harmonization between data models and data representation formats, devised explicitly for data object interoperability, acting as a catalyst for standardized credential issuance in multiple languages.</p>  <blockquote><p>“Digital health passes offer our best hope to safely, confidently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy – but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies. The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travellers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</p></blockquote><p>Dakota Gruener, Executive Director, ID2020</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


 <blockquote><p>“To allow international travel to resume safely, we must take every possible step to limit the spread of new Covid-19 variants. We urgently need an internationally-recognised system of health passes so that travellers can quickly and easily prove their health status, in a way that is secure and privacy-preserving. The Good Health Pass Collaborative is doing critical work to develop the standards we need to support this. Now political leaders need to lend their weight to this effort. The G7 group of nations should commit to establish a network of globally interoperable health passes, and set up the necessary working groups to deliver it.”</p></blockquote><p>Tony Blair, Executive Chairman of Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and Former UK Prime Minister</p>

GCCN will include a global directory of trust registries to enable cross-border certificate verification, and be a home for toolkits and community-managed support for those building and managing COVID certificate systems. This next phase of implementation will help governments and public health authorities (PHAs) to build interoperable solutions respecting privacy with the aim to reopen international borders.</p><p>GCCN will implement a technological framework in a bid to enable citizens to move safely and freely across borders during the global COVID pandemic. The defined infrastructure hopes to allow interoperable and trustworthy exchanges of COVID certificates between countries for safe travel.</p><p>To knit together all of the necessary components and gain sufficient momentum behind the launch of GCCN, the network partners have focused on alignment with the EU Member States and other key organizations implementing COVID systems for governments and industry alliances.</p><blockquote><p>“We are interested to learn about how LFPH is taking bold steps in creating the Global COVID Certificate Network in order to facilitate trust building and interoperability for safe borders reopening, since it still seems that there are many challenges and barriers to overcome, for example the need for a European eID agreement. The Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) Panel of the European Parliament (EP) is looking into the challenges that the pandemic has introduced, and also we explore potential technological solutions and their impact based on scientific data, credible sources of information and the respect of the European values. I look forward to the next steps of the LFPH that could provide us with more ideas and insights on strategies that enhance the use of a certificate in a safe way, and also to provide further technical options for the EU that could be adopted and could help and enable our system to work in a harmonised way. As soon as we achieve that, then we could immediately share the methodology to connect with the rest of the world and move to the new normal of our post COVID digital era, always in respect of the European charter for human rights and the regulation for privacy and personal data.”</p></blockquote><p>Eva Kaili, MEP and Chair of the STOA Panel of the European Parliament</p>

<p>Each year, Corporate members of the OpenID Foundation elect a member to represent them on the board. <a href="https://openid.net/2021/02/09/2021-openid-foundation-board-update/">Ashish Jain was elected by Corporate members during the 2021 elections</a> that were conducted in January 2021. Ashish was at eBay at the time of his nomination and being elected but soon after left eBay and joined Arkose Labs at Chief Product Officer. Arkose Labs then joined the Foundation.</p>
<p>The Foundation’s bylaws Section 5.4(e) provides that&nbsp;vacancies&nbsp;in the Board of Directors “(e)&nbsp;of a corporate director&nbsp;due to the resignation&nbsp;… of such director,&nbsp;shall be filled in an election by the corporate members&nbsp;…”</p>
<p>Per the bylaws, the Foundation conducted a new election with a request for nominations. All Corporate members were eligible to nominate and vote for candidates with Ashish Jain and Dale Olds with VMware nominating themselves for this new election.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to welcome Ashish Jain, Chief Product Officer at Arkose Labs, to the Board as Corporate Member Representative. Ashish served on the Foundation board in the past and has been a contributor over the years.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Dale Olds of VMware, for his continued support of the Foundation and participating in this most recent election. Dale served as the Corporate Member Representative for the last few years and like so many in our community, I appreciate his contributions to the Foundation and the community at large.</p>
<p>I want to thank all Foundation board of directors for their service and contributions to the OpenID Foundation.</p>

 Good Health Pass Collaborative Releases Draft Blueprint for Digital Health Passes in Advance of G7&nbsp;Summit <p>In an effort to restore global travel and restart the global economy, the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> today announced the release of the eagerly-anticipated <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint</a>.</p><p>The Blueprint — released today in draft form for a three-week period of stakeholder consultations and public comment — is intended to stimulate discussion at the G7 Summit, which will open Friday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p><p>This announcement follows on the heels of a May 18 letter, sent by the Good Health Pass Collaborative to G7 leaders, urging them to adopt a statement of principles for digital health passes. The letter also called for the formation of a working group — composed of senior ministerial staff from G7, G20, and European Union health and transport ministries — with the task of reaching an international consensus on standards by July&nbsp;16.</p><p>Unprecedented global collaboration — between governments, nonprofits, universities, and the private sector — propelled the rapid development and distribution of highly effective COVID vaccines. A similar level of collaboration is urgently needed to ensure that verifiable digital health passes for international travel can be issued and universally accepted worldwide by airlines, border control agencies, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Most governments already require proof of travelers’ COVID status — either through a recent negative test or, increasingly, proof of vaccination– as a precondition of entry. While dozens of solutions have been rushed to market to meet this growing demand, they vary greatly in the extent to which they protect user privacy and security and enable individuals to control access to their personal health information.</p><p>The absence of internationally recognized, consensus-based open standards — to which all solutions adhere — could leave individuals uncertain about the security and privacy of their data and even unsure of whether their health pass will be accepted for&nbsp;travel.</p><blockquote>“Digital health passes offer our best hope to safely, confidently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy — but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies,” said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travelers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</blockquote><p>Restoring international travel is vital to restarting the global economy. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that 61.6 million tourism-related jobs worldwide have been lost as a result of the pandemic. In 2020, travel and tourism contributions to global GDP decreased by 49.1%, a loss of $4.5 trillion (USD), nearly 18 times the impact experienced during the 2009 global financial crisis.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, it would take years to develop standards for digital health&nbsp;passes.</p><p>In February, <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> launched the Good Health Pass Collaborative, a multi-sector, global initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes and dramatically streamline the standards development process. Within weeks, the Collaborative grew from 25 partners to <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">more than 125 companies and organizations</a> from across the health, travel, and technology sectors.</p><p>Nine “drafting groups”, bringing together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors were managed through a partnership with the Trust Over IP Foundation the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative and Linux Foundation Public Health — all projects of the Linux Foundation.</p><p>The resulting Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint addresses — in considerable depth and detail — nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be&nbsp;reached:</p>  Design principles  Creating a consistent user experience  Standard data models and&nbsp;elements  Credential formats, signatures, and exchange protocols  Security, privacy, and data protection  Trust registries  Rules engines  Identity binding (ensuring the authenticity of the&nbsp;holder)  Governance  <blockquote>“This draft blueprint is historic, both in its depth and breadth of proposed standards, as well as the number of expert volunteers who contributed their time to its development,’’ said Gruener. “When we partnered with the Trust Over IP Foundation, we committed to an open and inclusive process. Releasing the draft for public comment today takes that commitment a step further. We felt this was incredibly important, given the range of public and private entities expected to play a role in the issuance and acceptance of digital health passes and the need to build public trust and support their adoption.”</blockquote><p>The UK government — in its capacity as president of the G7 — has identified “leading the global recovery from coronavirus, while strengthening our resilience against further pandemic” as the highest policy priority for this 47th G7 Summit. International agreement on principles and standards for digital health passes is critical to achieving this policy priority.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org">www.id2020.org</a></p>

The letter also called for the formation of a working group – composed of senior ministerial staﬀ from G7, G20, and European Union health and transport ministries – with the task of reaching international consensus on standards by July 16.</p>
<p>Unprecedented global collaboration – between governments, nonproﬁts, universities, and the private sector – propelled the rapid development and distribution of highly eﬀective COVID vaccines. A similar level of collaboration is urgently needed to ensure that veriﬁable digital health passes for international travel can be issued and universally accepted worldwide by airlines, border control agencies, and others.</p>
<p>Most governments already require proof of travelers’ COVID status – either through a recent negative test or, increasingly, proof of vaccination– as a precondition of entry. While dozens of solutions have been rushed to market to meet this growing demand, they vary greatly in the extent to which they protect user privacy and security and enable individuals to control access to their personal health information.</p>
<p>The absence of internationally recognized, consensus-based open standards – to which all solutions adhere – could leave individuals uncertain about the security and privacy of their data and even unsure of whether their health pass will be accepted for travel.</p>
<p>“Digital health passes oﬀer our best hope to safely, conﬁdently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy – but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies,” said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travelers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</p>
<p>Restoring international travel is vital to restarting the global economy. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that 61.6 million tourism-related jobs worldwide have been lost as a result of the pandemic. In 2020, travel and tourism contributions to global GDP decreased by 49.1%, a loss of $4.5 trillion (USD), nearly 18 times the impact experienced during the 2009 global ﬁnancial crisis.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it would take years to develop standards for digital health passes.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020 </a>launched the Good Health Pass Collaborative, a multi-sector, global initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes and dramatically streamline the standards development process. Within weeks, the Collaborative grew from 25 partners to <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">more</a> <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">than 125 companies and organizations </a>from across the health, travel, and technology sectors.</p>
<p>Nine “drafting groups”, bringing together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors were managed through a partnership with the Trust Over IP Foundation the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative and Linux Foundation Public Health – all projects of the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>The resulting Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint addresses – in considerable depth and detail – nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be reached:</p>
 
 Design principles 
 Creating a consistent user experience 
 Standard data models and elements 
 Credential formats, signatures, and exchange protocols 
 Security, privacy, and data protection 
 Trust registries 
 Rules engines 
 Identity binding (ensuring the authenticity of the holder) 
 Governance 
 
<p>“This draft blueprint is historic, both in its depth and breadth of proposed standards, as well as the number of expert volunteers who contributed their time to its development,” said Gruener. “When we partnered with the Trust Over IP Foundation, we committed to an open and inclusive process. Releasing the draft for public comment today takes that commitment a step further. We felt this was incredibly important, given the range of public and private entities expected to play a role in the issuance and acceptance of digital health passes and the need to build public trust and support their adoption.”</p>
<p>The UK government – in its capacity as president of the G7 – has identiﬁed “leading the global recovery from coronavirus, while strengthening our resilience against further pandemic” as the highest policy priority for this 47th G7 Summit. International agreement on principles and standards for digital health passes are critical to achieving this policy priority.</p>
<p>About ID2020</p>
<p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonproﬁts, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting and portable digital ID solutions.</p>
<p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights, while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual. <a href="http://www.id2020.org/">www.id2020.org</a></p>

 Wallet Security WG begins its work 
<p>After a long process of finding leadership, hammering out a charter, and defining an optimistic scope, the new transatlantic leadership is hammering out a tentative work plan and scope reductions to line up all the ducks.  Public meetings have begun this week to include the whole working group in this discussion about deliverables and timelines. Stay tuned and register for the <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/wallet-security">mailing list</a>.</p>
 First public meeting of the Cryptography WG approaches 
<p>A younger group with a narrower scope has, in parallel, also been forming around cryptographic primitives and dependency analysis. Leadership has already been selected by consensus and the charter is being fine-tuned-- a charter DocuSign and a scheduling doodle might be ready for interested parties as soon as time of press for the next newsletter. Join the mailing <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/crypto-wg">list</a> in the meantime if specifying cryptographic primitives across different tooling stacks sounds like a priority for your organization.</p>

 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">UNIVERSAL REGISTRAR</a> - An Overview
 
 Issue: Onboarding/getting access to a DID registry is usually DID-registry-specific. 
 Proposals:
 
 Consider the most frequent flows:
 
 Redirect to a webpage (authentication or other operations are performed outside the wallet) 
 Authentication via API (some existing Universal Registrar drivers support this) 
 
 
 Proposal should work for most DID methods (e.g., did:web, Sovrin, sidetree). 
 A more detailed compatibility analysis is required. 
 
 
 Outcomes: Proposals will be further analysed and discussed in the Universal Registration call. Issues will be opened in the Universal Registration repository 
 Discussions about:
 
 <a href="https://github.com/gataca-io/gataca-did-method">Gataca's DID method</a>.

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>A headline theme for building Scotland into a world leading digital nation is the development of it’s ‘cryptocurrency ecosystem’. 
 This refers not only to the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but also the development of the new ventures and products that build upon it to achieve innovative new business models. 
<p>The basic concept is eloquently explained by Anthony Pompliano.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wigz8z6Vm3U">this discussion</a>, from 9m:50s, he describes a tiered financial system that builds upon gold as the foundation asset at level one, the issuing of cash money based on its value at level two, and then an increasing sophistication of electronic use of money at levels three and above.</p>
<p>He states that the cryptocurrency world is in the process of creating an equivalent system, where Bitcoin functions as the level one asset, aka “digital gold”, and we’ll see a comparable services ecosystem build upon it through layers two and above.</p>
<p>Vendor technologies like <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/introducing-the-hiro-platform">Hiro</a> demonstrate a great example of this effect, providing the tools to build upon this layer with new applications, with major market innovations like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-plans-to-explore-applications-it-can-build-on-top-of-cbdcs">Mastercard planning</a> to build upon CBDCs, like launching like a&nbsp;<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/mastercard-gemini-winklevoss-launch-crypto-bitcoin-rewards-card-digital-summer-2021-4-1030353514">crypto rewards card</a>, a great example of a level three service.</p>
<p>In China they are already active and the competitive repercussions are becoming evident. As the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-chinese-banks-promote-cbdc-over-local-payment-firms-for-shopping-festival">Cointelegraph reports</a> the banks are promoting the CBDC, the ‘digital yuan’, over the incumbent payment providers like Alipay and WeChat Pay. JD.com has started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/jd-pays-staff-digital-yuan/">paying staff</a> in the digital yuan.</p>
 Open Banking 
<p>As we consider the dynamics of building a Scottish crypto ecosystem a key industry trend to factor in is Open Banking. This is a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/open-banking-scotlands-global-opportunity/">global market opportunity</a> for Scotland.</p>
<p>Matthew Enubuje <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-hidden-war-for-fintech-millennials-open-banking-vs-crypto-928a86273f4a">provides a helpful overview</a> of where the two sectors overlap, and the potential for their synergy.</p>
<p>He makes the key point that reflects the insights described by Anthony Pompliano, that where the Blockchain industry has excelled at the level one core digital asset infrastructure, they haven’t been as progressive in terms of developing the higher layer of interconnecting, value adding apps. Open Banking has.</p>
<p>The advantages of crypto over Open Banking are mainly those to do with circumventing the banking system and the technological features of the Blockchain – The decentralized control of assets by users themselves not banks, and the transparent integrity of the transactions.</p>
<p>He describes the opportunity for the crypto industry being to basically expand to the higher levels of the ecosystem introduced in this article, citing examples such as <a href="https://nexo.io/">Nexo</a>, a crypto lending platform with&nbsp;no credit checks and instant credit lines, and where their revenue comes from their 5.9% interest on loans.</p>
<p>This adds equity to their crypto as it can be used to get a loan and by users holding it for long periods, they receive 30% dividends and this offsets the demand to supply ratio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Matthew suggests a few other examples of this ecosystem, such as <a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a>, a crypto company distributing hotspot devices and people earn their crypto when they use it, and the mobile app&nbsp;<a href="https://emma-app.com/">Emma&nbsp;</a>— it lets you connect to your bank accounts and crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>The killer innovation central to both trends is interoperability. Open Banking is achieved through API-based data flow between banks and apps, and for crypto cross-chain integration is the holy grail of its next major phase of evolution. The CoinTelegraph explores this in detail <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-interoperability-evolves-from-blockchain-bridges-to-defi-transfers">here</a>, with major innovations setting out to address the challenge including <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cosmos-set-to-take-lead-in-blockchain-interoperability-with-februarys-stargate-release">Cosmos</a>.</p>
 Building Back Better – Digitizing Scotland’s SMEs 
<p>So in practical terms what does this mean for Scotland, how should we act to exploit their trend and opportunity?</p>
<p>To answer this question we can consider other strategic objectives, with the most notable being to ‘Digitize Scotland’s SMEs’ – To better enable Scotland’s small businesses to make use of technology to grow their business, especially so after the pandemic.</p>
<p>This provides a very practical lens to view the above market insights; in short the ecosystem will be most effective when it produces these types of tools. For example early adopters of crypto payments in Scotland include the Aberdeen <a href="https://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2021/05/04/first-scottish-craft-beer-company-to-accept-cryptocurrency-payments-food-and-drink-news-scotland/">Taproom</a>, an Edinburgh <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/scottish-music-school-now-supports-crypto-payments-for-tuition/">School of Music</a> and a <a href="https://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/business/consumer/falkirk-cafe-among-first-in-scotland-to-accept-cryptocurrency-payments-3192051">Falkirk cafe</a>.</p>
<p>Scotland’s startups making possible this type of service are thus the essential foundation, highlighting ventures like Zumo, who have launched innovations like a <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/edinburgh-fintech-launches-pay-crypto-24090015">virtual payment card</a>.</p>
<p>To the point of this article what’s really key is&nbsp;their <a href="https://developers.zumo.money/">Developers SDK</a>. Accepting payments is just the building block, as highlighted above the real secret sauce for what will be of great value to SMEs is the increasingly sophisticated functionality that builds upon this, in a way that truly supports and enables the growth of their business, such as a loyalty rewards scheme for example. Zumo’s SDK would enable other digital entrepreneurs to create these types of solutions.</p>
<p>With this type of functionality in mind other Scottish startups to highlight include <a href="https://stampede.ai/">Stampede</a>. While not a crypto company they are a great example of a provider of technology to Scottish SMEs, in the hospitality sector, to help them grow their business, via functionality such as a <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/wifi/#portal">Wifi portal</a>, <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/automations/#campaigns">email and SMS marketing</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/gifting/#gifting">digital gift cards</a>.</p>
<p>Given their type of client would include the Aberdeen Taproom mentioned, the most powerful accelerant of Scotland’s ecosystem is the integration of these capabilities, one that combines crypto payments with these digital marketing services, so that Scotland’s SMEs have access to a one stop shop for easily adopting the full suite.</p>
<p>This is the most effective route to achieving the goal of Scotland becoming a world leading digital nation – Scotland’s SMEs are the backbone of its economy, and empowering them to adopt the latest technologies that can grow their business, via utilizing local Scottish tech startups, creates a rising tide that floats all boats multiplying effect.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The number one topic at the heart of the Scottish Independence debate is what currency would be used. 
 This <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/snp-must-rethink-its-economic-model-independent-scotland/">OpenDemocracy article</a> sets the scene through a critical analysis of the SNP’s Growth Commission plans, being especially harsh of their currency strategy. 
<p>Thought leaders pioneering alternative ideas in Scotland include Tim Rideout, heading up the <a href="https://www.reservebank.scot/">ReserveBank.scot initiative</a>, Common Weal who have published <a href="https://commonweal.scot/policy-library/how-make-currency-practical-guide">this paper</a> on how to make a Scottish currency, <a href="https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2020/12/04/why-is-scotland-still-debating-whether-it-will-need-its-own-currency-when-independent-when-the-answer-is-so-glaringly-obviously-that-it-will/">Richard Murphy</a> and <a href="https://www.modernmoney.scot/">Modern Money Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>See all of them together discussing the topic on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lzxjVs810Y">this panel discussion webinar</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Pioneering the Future of Money 
<p>Rather than this being a weak point for the Independence argument, the smart move is to seize it as the moment for global technology leadership it represents, an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone – One being the need for a currency, the second being the aspiration to become a world leading digital nation.</p>
<p>A key trend to highlight are “CBDCs” –&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a>, the full blown digitization of national currencies, which is the grand prize of this space and given Scotland’s history of pioneering financial innovations including founding banks et al, presents us with a unique window to lead the trend globally.</p>
<p>It’s a behemoth of a worldwide opportunity now taking shape – In the USA former CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/35528/digital-dollar-project-names-advisory-group">set up a not-for-profit</a>&nbsp;called the Digital Dollar Foundation, to pioneer the creation of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC).&nbsp;In his presidency campaign Michael Bloomberg&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-presidential-contender-michael-bloomberg-proposes-clear-regulatory-framework-for-crypto">proposed creating a regulatory framework</a>&nbsp;for cryptocurrencies in a new financial regulation plan.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum says it’s time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/why-its-time-to-take-central-banks-digital-currencies-seriously/">take them seriously</a>, CNBC explores&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/central-banks-lay-out-a-framework-for-digital-currencies.html">what they would look like</a>, the US Federal Reserve published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/central-bank-digital-currency-a-literature-review-20201109.htm">a literature review</a>, the IMF a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/11/20/Legal-Aspects-of-Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-Central-Bank-and-Monetary-Law-Considerations-49827">set of considerations</a>&nbsp;for their use and Brookings a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/23/design-choices-for-central-bank-digital-currency/">set of design options</a>. The Bank of England offers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2020/central-bank-digital-currency-opportunities-challenges-and-design-discussion-paper">this discussion paper</a>&nbsp;to explore the topic in detail and HSBC comments on them&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hsbc.com/insight/topics/central-banks-develop-digital-currencies">here</a>.</p>
<p>Early pioneers include&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-swiss-snb-currency-digital/swiss-central-bank-says-wholesale-digital-currency-trial-a-success-idUKKBN28D1N5">Switzerland</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ghanas-central-bank-confirms-its-still-looking-to-pilot-a-digital-currency">Ghana</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/marshall-islands-seeks-to-establish-a-self-sovereign-identity-with-new-blockchain-based-currency">Marshall Islands</a>&nbsp;seeking to blaze the trail, and China has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-12-01/in-depth-chinas-digital-currency-ambitions-lead-the-world-101634550.html">ambitions to lead the world</a>&nbsp;in this field.</p>
<p>There are concerns and critics of course. Coin Telegraph writes that they have the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-have-the-power-to-upend-global-finance">potential to upend global finance</a>, and also that they are&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-are-dead-in-the-water">dead in the water</a>, and the Economist asks if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/05/will-central-bank-digital-currencies-break-the-banking-system">they will break the banking system</a>.</p>
 “Programmable Money” 
<p>Furthermore the real magic lies in the concept of ‘Smart Money’ aka Programmable Money.&nbsp;This is not just about the straight digitization of money as we understand it, but an entire transformation of how money ‘works’.</p>
<p>As the term suggests it refers to creating an intrinsic intelligence for money.&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/09/16/programmable-money-crypto-tokens">Reporting on IBM</a>&nbsp;being awarded a patent for a “bespoke programmable crypto token,” Cointelegraph explores how specific functionality can be programmed into the behaviour of digital monies.</p>
<p>The LSE explores the idea, asking ‘<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2020/09/14/do-we-need-programmable-money/">Do we need programmable money</a>?’, where they define it in terms of both Open Banking and crypto:</p>
<p>“In non-crypto fintech, ‘programmable money’ seems to refer to leveraging open banking APIs to build new, automated use-cases over legacy bank payment infrastructure but in our crypto world, the ‘programmable money’ refers to digital cash hosted on a blockchain, where cash can be placed under the control of a smart contract.”</p>
<p>A key standard that could make it possible is ‘DAML’, a programming language for creating Blockchain smart contracts that run across multiple infrastructure options. DigitalAsset is the world’s expert on this and explore the trend in more detail in <a href="https://daml.com/daml-driven/why-daml-is-great-to-represent-digital-currency/">this series of blogs</a>.</p>
<p>Not only does this provide the technology to digitally enable currencies as they behave now, but to make possible a future of Programmable Money, where a variety of behaviours and actions can be coded into the flow of money not possible with physical currency.</p>
<p>A Canadian visionary in this field is Alex Tapscott.&nbsp;Indeed he defines it as the wholesale reinvention of capital, a journey he foresees in his 2016 presentation ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=WnEYakUxsHU">Blockchain is Eating Wall Street</a>‘.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Digital assets are smart and programmable. Let’s say you’re sending money to your kid studying in college. You can now program the money to only work at certain retailers like Walmart and Whole Foods, rather than the Ontario Cannabis Store or LCBO.</p>
<p>By rethinking capital, we can reimagine markets, money and finance. Entire swaths of the financial services industry currently worth trillions of dollars — banking, payments and even money itself — will be questioned, challenged and upended in the years to come.”</p>
</blockquote>

Our economy depends on it,” stated David Nikolejsin, Chair of the DIACC Board.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to welcome this new cohort of public and private sector members to the DIACC,” said Joni Brennan, DIACC President. “With over 100 members including the government of Canada, provincial governments, municipal governments, financial institutions, telcos, technology companies, consulting companies, SMEs, academic partners, international organizations, and nonprofits, the DIACC is Canada’s largest and most inclusive community of digital ID leaders.”</p>



<p>“When the DIACC began nearly a decade ago, it was a small group of passionate public and private sector organizations committed to unlocking economic opportunities for Canadian consumers and businesses while protecting and promoting Canadian values and perspectives in the digital economy,” said Eros Spadotto, EVP, Telus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Building on the vision of the founding members, the non-profit DIACC coalition has grown to over 100 private and public sector leaders who are working together towards establishing an interoperable ecosystem that Canadians can use with confidence,” added Robert Devries, Assistant Deputy Minister Platforms, Ontario Digital Service.</p>



<p>In 2020 the DIACC&nbsp; delivered on that vision with the launch of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/2020/09/15/newly-launched-digital-id-framework-to-begin-testing-in-canada/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>™, a robust, privacy-enhancing trust framework shaped by Canadian values that permits trusted digital identity and provides clear guidelines on digital interoperability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recent research by the DIACC underlines Canadians’ desire for, and expectation of secure, trusted and convenient digital transactions – a desire that has increased as a result of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From receiving emergency pandemic benefits to ensuring health records are correct and helping children and youth with online education, there are many ways in which a secure digital ID is essential to the functioning of daily life during a pandemic – and beyond,” added CJ Ritchie, CIO of the Government of British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/2021/02/16/covid-has-accelerated-canadians-demand-for-digital-id/">DIACC research</a>, the majority of Canadians believe it is important for federal and provincial governments to move quickly on enabling digital ID in a safe and secure manner, according to the survey. It also shows that collaboration between governments and the private sector continues to be considered the best approach to create a pan-Canadian digital ID framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the addition of these new members and increasing demand from Canadians, it is clear that there is no better time for governments and businesses to invest in making digital ID a national public policy priority.</p>



<p>ABOUT THE DIACC</p>



<p>The DIACC is a non-profit coalition of public and private sector leaders committed to developing a Canadian digital identification and authentication framework to enable Canada’s full and secure participation in the global digital economy. The DIACC was created as a result of the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review and members include representatives from both the federal and provincial levels of government as well as private sector leaders.</p>

<p>As Canada’s economy reopens and talk of requiring vaccination proof heats up, it is essential to remember that security and privacy are paramount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proof of vaccination, sometimes called “vaccine passports,” may provide a tool for accelerating economic recovery, and the validity of these proofs requires a safe and secure relationship to an identity behind it. Solving digital ID challenges with priority&nbsp; in a meaningful way is the most impactful way to empower people, prevent fraud, and privacy breaches as Canadians return to attending school in person, going to concerts, travelling, eating indoors in restaurants and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can no longer wait — it’s time for Canada to take leadership and get serious about solving digital identity or someone else outside of our country will.</p>



<p>As privacy commissioners across Canada have <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2021/nr-c_210519/">said</a>, “Privacy should be front and centre as governments and businesses consider COVID-19 vaccine passports as a tool to help Canadians return to normal life.”</p>



<p>Data minimization must be the standard, where TWO things are essential for a secure and smooth transition to our digital economy:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1) only share the necessary information to prove a user’s identity, and&nbsp;</p>



<p>2) only share the data needed to fulfill the transaction at hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why, for 10 years, the DIACC has built up the important digital ID sector as the trusted voice for driving the public and private sector development of a Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, industry standards, policy advisory, and proof of concept initiatives that support the establishment and adoption of a fully digital, and privacy-respecting country that benefits Canadians.</p>



<p>Canadians and businesses need clarity and leadership from governments on implementing a safe and secure digital ID so that society and the economy can reopen more safely. A cohesive public and private sector approach&nbsp; is needed. And governments must make solving digital identity, with privacy and security, a stated priority now. Our country cannot afford to address digital identity as siloed and individual projects. Canada needs to take the lead by establishing Canadian principled solutions that will work at home and export our values around the world.</p>



<p>Implementing a digital identity ecosystem now will allow for a more effective transition to secure Canada’s full and beneficial participation in the digital economy, whether it’s introducing digital vaccine proofs, receiving government benefits, updating an immigration status, entering the workforce and more.</p>



<p>As Canada’s trusted voice on digital ID, the DIACC’s 100-plus members from both the private and public sectors have the business, legal, technical and deep real-world experience to continue spearheading the establishment of a digital identity ecosystem that is designed to benefit people.</p>



<p>While technologies for creating digital proofs of identity and vaccination (passports) are here now, residents and businesses need provincial and federal governments to take leadership by establishing clear policy and guidance for usage to ensure that no Canadians are left behind.</p>



<p>If Canadian governments prioritize the establishment&nbsp; of digital ID that works for people, governments, and the economy, then vaccine proofs (passports) and myriad&nbsp; other uses can be implemented with security and privacy embedded by design.</p>



<p>Digital ID is not about surveillance, tracking Canadians’ online activity, or data collection. It’s about empowering Canadians with the choice to safely share their existing credentials (eg: passports, driver’s licenses, health cards, citizenship cards) for digital transactions.</p>



<p>With digital identity done right, a vaccine proof (passport) would allow Canadians to securely prove who they are, verify that they were vaccinated, and have a digital credential to use in any instance that requires it — all in a safe and secure way that does not divulge any other private health record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our digital future and economic recovery rests on getting digital ID right.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The objective of our <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-nation/">Digital Nation Action Plan</a> is to identify the individual entrepreneurs visions for how to achieve a world leading Scottish digital nation, and aggregate these into one overall action plan. 
<p>On <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L5Nf6ipWAAID1hdwOVoc5">The Crypto Standard podcast</a> they interview Nick Jones of <a href="https://www.zumo.money/">Zumo</a>, exploring the details of their exciting venture pioneering a cryptocurrency payments app.</p>
<p>Concluding the interview Jordan highlights how Wyoming is becoming a crypto and blockchain global hub, and asks if Scotland could replicate a similar success.</p>
<p>Nick believes this is entirely doable, given how Scotland is a small, relatively cash rich country with highly educated people, and with many pressing social inequality issues to address could act as an incredible ‘sandbox’ for cultivating innovative applications of the technology that leverage Scotland’s <a href="https://www.zumo.money/blog/how-scotland-liberated-smart-money">deep legacy of financial expertise</a>.</p>
<p>To crystallize a strategy to unify Scotland’s many different initiatives and assets around a single vision of making Scotland the Blockchain Capital of Europe, Nick quantifies the end result through stating key metrics such as having 10 of the top 50 startups, three relevant university courses and a £500m venture fund for supporting the ecosystem.</p>
 “Weak on Blockchain” 
<p>The nature of the challenge is very succinctly captured by Andrew Noble of Par Equity in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/6-investors-and-founders-forecast-hockey-stick-growth-for-edinburghs-startup-scene/">this TechCrunch artlcle</a>. While reporting on the general success of Scotland’s startup scene in his analysis he comments that Scotland is “weak on Blockchain”.</p>
<p>He’s not wrong. Scotland has a handful of great Blockchain startups like Zumo, Siccar and Appii, but to Nick’s point we’re well short of how many there should be, there’s no real funding initiatives to address this and adoption in key ‘big lever’ sectors like Government is non existent.&nbsp;Therefore the essence of our Action Plan should be to address exactly this.</p>
<p>A keystone foundation is regulation and legislation, the right approach could either inhibit innovation or unlock an unparalleled scale of economic growth. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/proposed-legislation-in-germany-could-allow-425b-to-flow-into-crypto-report">Coindesk reports</a>&nbsp;a new German law could theoretically bring as much as €350 billion (~$425 billion) of institutional investment into their cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://billatnapier.medium.com/we-need-a-blockchain-act-for-every-country-7ae10f36b3c4">this blog</a> Bill Buchanan describes how countries should legislate a Blockchain Act, emulating pioneers like <a href="https://www.regierung.li/en/press-releases/212310">Liechtenstein</a>, providing the legal framework to truly achieve a wholly digital nation.</p>
 The Tokenization of Everything 
<p>Legislation is a slow moving process outwith our control, so the second, more important foundation is simply to drive large scale adoption, an effect that can be characterized as “The Tokenization of Everything”.</p>
<p>Despite our claims of living in a digital society the reality is that so much of our economy is still paper-based, from mortgages to opening a bank account requiring the endless shuffling of paper and the centuries old practice of ‘wet’ signatures or what Bill describes as ‘fake digital’, the practice of visually emulating these via tools like Docusign.&nbsp;Instead he defines that:</p>
<p>“We need to move into a world which properly replaces paper, and moves towards crypto-assets and digital signing with private keys.”</p>
<p>The digitization of all documents and processes via the Blockchain would give rise to what Bill describes as ‘The Token Economy’:</p>
<p>“But some countries are now defining the required legal infrastructure around blockchain, and finding ways to integrate into their existing legal frameworks, and also provided increased trust in the new economy — the token economy.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p>“The key requirement is for national regulation infrastructure and which builds on a total anonymous distributed ledger infrastructure, as well as mapping trusted identities into a regulation infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Demonstrating the potential Scotland has to not only adopt but also pioneer this massive trend is local startup <a href="https://digitalscot.net/directory/listing/blockchain-technology-partners/">Blockchain Technology Partners</a>, who specializes in the ‘smart contracts’ that Bill defines as the linchpin to this new digital universe. They also envisage the complete digitization of all facets of our economy, describing ‘<a href="https://interwork.org/towards-the-tokenization-of-everything/">The Tokenization of Everything</a>‘.</p>
<p>As the title suggests this refers to an evolution where every asset with inherent value will eventually be represented by a cryptographic token on a Blockchain.</p>
 Scaling Scotland’s Blockchain Ecosystem 
<p>Nick offers an ideal starting point for a Digital Nation Action Plan – A big audacious ambition and clear metrics for quantifying when it is achieved.</p>
<p>By incorporating the equivalent views from other Scottish tech entrepreneurs we can refine a detailed strategy and set of steps for truly realizing the goal of building a world leading Scottish digital nation.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalgovernment.scot"></a>The core principle of Government as a Platform is that a common foundation makes possible multiple different services that share this capability, to avoid reinventing the wheel for repeated functions like authentication and data sharing. 
<p>With these building blocks in place developers are then freed to concentrate on building the apps that more quickly deliver real business value.</p>
 Vaccination Passports 
<p>A great example of the need for this rapid approach is ‘Covid Vaccination Passports’. Clearly there has been a requirement for a quick response to critical public health needs, and one that utilizes existing government systems so that there is a complete integrity of the data produced.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/21/1015353/covid-vaccine-passport-digital-immunity-record/">MIT asks</a> if you will have to carry this on your phone, where it might function like an actual passport, being shown as you arrive at airports, and could also act like a work authorization at your job, or a pass to get into restaurants, bars, and shopping malls.</p>
<p>Highlighting the type of issues that need addressed such as a <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/travelers-using-counterfeit-covid-test-results">booming black market</a> in fake test results that is diminishing trust in printed records and driving demand for cheat-proof digital documents, they define the medical and technology challenges and nature of this opportunity:</p>
<p>“There are a lot of players in the field, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson-health/health-pass-puts-privacy-first/">IBM</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">the Commons Project</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a>. </p>
<p>They’re coming at the problem from different angles but are ultimately chasing the same goal: let people share required information about their health, while protecting other private information. Yet it’s still too early to rely on any of these for a fast and widespread solution.”</p>
<p>Many governments, as well as airlines and other businesses are trialing or in talks to build “health pass” apps, which let users ask participating labs and health systems to send authenticated test results and other data straight to the app, bypassing verification concerns.</p>
 Scotland’s Opportunity – A Digital Healthcare Ecosystem 
<p>To begin zeroing in on the specific opportunity for Scotland, we can first identify the core technology challenge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Connecting any systems across borders means navigating a patchwork of languages, databases, and privacy laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights the work of Scotland’s <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/about/">NDS team</a>, who are building the ‘<a href="https://digitalscot.net/nes-digital-service-platform/">National Digital Platform</a>‘, the technical architecture which ensures that key things are only done in one way across Scotland such as how people are identified and where clinical data is stored.</p>
<p>As they explain <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/blog/the-national-clinical-data-store/">here</a>, their National Clinical Data Store (NCDS) is storing vaccinations data and being made accessible to healthcare staff, via their <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/42708/turas-vaccination-management-tool">VMT app</a>.</p>
<p>“Under the bonnet, the VMT sends copies of the records of immunisations to the&nbsp;NCDS. For those that may be interested, this is achieved using a “FHIR API” based on the&nbsp;<a title="Opens new window" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core">UK FHIR Core</a>&nbsp;Immunisation Profile. A FHIR API is essentially an industry standard way of sharing digital health data.&nbsp;The&nbsp;NCDS can then&nbsp;securely share citizens’ immunisation history records to other services, again using a FHIR API.”</p>
<p>As we’ll explore in the upcoming and future webinars, Scotland’s opportunity is to build upon this core innovation through a collaborating community, a Digital Healthcare Ecosystem, to flesh it out in multiple directions including ways to expand user uptake and to enable new scenarios for how users interact with and update data.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant when we consider the broader context of Scotland’s overall digital agenda. In their just released digital strategy, the Scottish Government describes a key objective of:</p>
<p>“Adopt a common approach to online identity where personal data is controlled by the individual.”</p>
<p>This highlights a couple of key vendor solutions:</p>
 
 Appii – Appii has developed their <a href="https://appii.io/health-passport/">Health Passport</a>, a service that verifies your identify through a selfie photo, is populated through recording your test result at one of their partner sites (eg. Lloyds Pharmacy) and provides a digital certification. 
 Digi.me – Digi.me is a specialist in general data sharing services and have developed a number of apps that build on this capability, including a <a href="https://digi.me/covid19/">Covid-19 solution</a>. 
 
<p>What all of this highlights is the importance of the platform approach. A Covid certification service is just one of the many apps governments need to deploy, and each and every one will feature repeated requirements to verify the identity of users and share data across multiple systems.</p>
<p>Furthermore this should feed an innovation ecosystem, where for example the NDS National Clinical Data Store is a data set securely exposed to third party developers so that they can create new apps that leverage the data in new ways, for scenarios like Covid 19 as just one of many that will be required on an ongoing basis. Vendors like Appii and Digi.me would be ideal for this type of accelerated app innovation.</p>

  <p>By March 31, 2022, the Global LEI System will have implemented three new Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) policies to further increase the level of open, standardized, and high-quality legal entity reference data available to users.</p>
<p>From March 1, 2022, all GLEIF services will accept and display data in new Common Data File (CDF) formats in line with the new policies. Public users of the Global LEI System will therefore need to be able to process data in the new format from this date onwards. The month of March will be used as a transition period during which all LEI issuing organizations will migrate to the new formats and perform testing to ensure smooth operations. During this month, therefore, public users of Global LEI System should prepare to support both formats when performing LEI data analysis. This blog outlines the preparatory steps public users are required to take and provides links to more detailed reference information.</p>
<p>Details of the new policies</p>
<p>The new policies apply to:</p>
 
 Legal Entity Events: Specifies events that alter the entity, the relationship data of a legal entity, or result in the retirement and/or creation of LEIs.  
 Fund Relationships: Introduces three new distinct relationship types that can be collected for funds.  
 General Government Entities: Allows certain legal entities to be classified as Government Entities or International Organizations.  
 
<p>How to prepare for the new policies</p>
<p>The following users must take action to implement the updated file formats to ensure uninterrupted access to LEI data beyond March 1, 2022:</p>
 
 All users of the GLEIF Concatenated files 
 All users of the Golden Copy and Delta files 
 All users who access the content of the Golden Copy files via the GLEIF API 
 
<p>GLEIF has published further technical details, example files and additional documentation specifying the transition steps and the impact on associated data <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/common-data-file-format/upcoming-versions">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additional support</p>
<p>Following March 31, 2022, GLEIF anticipates a period of up to one year before the Global LEI System will be fully populated with information on Legal Entity Events, Fund Relationships and Government Entities. Data is generally collected at the time of new LEI issuance or existing LEI renewal.</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional support ahead of the March 1 deadline, please email GLEIF: <a href="mailto:info@gleif.org">info@gleif.org</a>.</p>

<p>Razia joined the Women in Identity team early in 2021, helping to co-ordinate our sponsorship programme.</p>
<p></p>
 Tell us about your job and what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>My journey originally started with a degree in Cognitive Science and I wanted to incorporate ‘diverse thinking’ in my daily working life. In 2019 I decided to take a step back from corporate life. After a year travelling across the USA and Asia and I took the decision to retrain decided as a life coach.</p>
<p>With my new-found skillset, I learned how to tap into my blind spots, focussing on understanding the difference between means goals and end goals.</p>
<p>I worked hard.</p>
<p>But I spent little time with family and friends.</p>
<p>My work-life balance wasn’t particularly healthy – even though I was accomplishing the goals I had set for myself.</p>
<p>I was not showing up in the best version of myself.</p>
<p>I realised I needed to be a part of something more meaningful. Something that meant I was contributing towards the bigger things in life.</p>
<p>I had given over years of my life in trying to attain fulfilment by having money in my bank account. I could buy what I wanted, had great job titles so I was generally seen as successful. I realised I was pursuing a need to be recognized – for my work on this project or that initiative. These are the values I grew up with; the values I thought I needed in order to be viewed as “successful”.</p>
<p>During my travels, I took time to understand what I really wanted – namely to show up with unique ideas that would really contribute to making a difference – not just having a smart job title. I wanted to travel more and spend genuine, quality, time getting to know my friends and family again. &nbsp;I decided to start connecting with people who have really inspired me and in late 2019 launched my first podcast.</p>
<p>I now work with non-profit organizations that are passionate about making a real difference. I feel like I work within several communities, each one driving change around the diversity and inclusion agenda. It’s why I wanted to get involved with Women in Identity and I joined the volunteer team earlier this year.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I always worked very hard, putting in the hours, but later in my career I realized that hard work has very little to do with success.</p>
<p>I recognized the importance of learning to slow down. I have worked with FTSE 100 companies to Silicon Valley start-up and – honestly – I now realise how important it is to never stop learning. I have volunteered with many different organizations, simply because it taught me so many things outside my experience.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>To tell myself every day that I have a unique combination of infinite potential and divine possibilities. There is no one else exactly like me so if I don’t show up for myself, I can’t expect others to do so.</p>
<p>The second biggest lesson for me was outgrowing the things I originally wanted and learning the art of “surrender”.&nbsp; I believe we need to have goals but also to keep a sense of what it means to keep learning, keep growing. &nbsp;an entrepreneurial vision. If your business or you fail in a particular role, the real question to ask yourself is: “did I grow?” The jobs I do are simply a means to me achieving my bigger goal: to keep on growing.</p>
 What would be your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>&nbsp;People have been treated badly throughout history due to organizations having policies and practices that have disadvantaged people. I would like our leaders to make self-reflection a fundamental part of management and leadership training.</p>
<p>If organisations within the Identity space want to create environments that are truly free of racism and sexism, they need to look to hire people from different genders, faiths and races, different educational and economic backgrounds. This will help eliminate the stereotyping that we all fall foul of – and stop us building computer programs that perpetuate them.</p>
<p>Many organisations understand that having women in leadership groups increases productivity by 40%. We need to continue this momentum so we can finally stop having to find statistics to justify what should be a no-brainer!</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity means accepting an individual’s differences, creating a judgement-free environment where EVERYONE is comfortable talking about things, sharing opinions openly. For me, diversity is about having diverse thinking.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>I would like to recommend <a href="https://www.vishen.com/">Vishen Lakhiani’s</a> work at Mindvalley. I love listening to his podcast and all the speakers he brings from different backgrounds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reading-wise, I would recommend Rebel Ideas by Matthew Syed. It’s a great read for anyone looking to understand more about diverse thinking.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>&nbsp;Read more, take off the pressure and have fun!</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people who bring out the best in you or inspire you.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that “entrepreneurs don’t confront the world; they create and change the world. When you have real conviction, you have the power, literally, to change the world.’</p>
<p>I now take this with me into every aspect of my life.</p>

<p>Developers building on the NEAR blockchain now have a powerful way to manage user identities and dynamic off-chain data in their applications. <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, the decentralized network for data stream processing, now supports NEAR wallets.</p><p>NEAR is currently hosting an Open Web Community <a href="https://createbase.community/hackathon/">hackathon</a> with a prize for integrating <a>IDX</a> profiles on Ceramic with a NEAR Sputnik DAO. </p><a href="https://gov.near.org/t/near-ceramic-sputnik-dao-bounty/2391">  NEAR + Ceramic: Sputnik DAO Bounty  NEAR + Ceramic: Sputnik DAO Bounty We are so excited to partner with Ceramic Network! Developers building on NEAR Protocol have powerful ways to manage user identities and dynamic off-chain data in their applications. Ceramic, the decentralized network for data stream processing, now supports NEA…  NEAR Forumjlwaugh    </a> Blockchain, Data &amp; Identity: a full stack for Web3 developers <p>NEAR Protocol offers developers the most scalable and dev-friendly infrastructure for building decentralized apps and services. Great Web3 and DeFi apps require more than a smart contract platform. They also need sophisticated, scalable and dependable data management infrastructure. Ceramic provides advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. It is also the foundation for <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, Web3's first cross-chain identity model.</p><p>Now that NEAR and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem   Ceramic now supports NEAR wallets <p>Starting today, developers building applications on NEAR can easily add support for Ceramic and IDX in their application with a seamless user experience. NEAR key pairs have been added as a supported signing and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains">authentication method</a> for Ceramic's data streams, so users can now perform transactions on Ceramic with their existing NEAR wallets.</p><p>Developers have already begun to combine these two networks to create applications like NEAR Personas:</p> NEAR: Easy to build on &amp; easy to use <p><a href="https://near.org">NEAR Protocol</a> is a Proof-of-Stake, climate-neutral, layer one blockchain protocol and smart contract platform. Developer experience and end-user accessibility are the top priorities for NEAR, all the way down to the protocol level. Developers can use familiar tools, such as Rust or AssemblyScript, to build on NEAR’s WASM-based runtime, and the application build/test/deploy cycle is much faster and simpler than on most networks––with fast finality and very low transaction fees (usually less than one cent).</p><p>NEAR’s unique contract-based account model provides the flexibility to onboard users to an application who either don’t hold NEAR tokens or have never interacted with a blockchain, a process that can take dozens of steps and fiat onramps with most other networks. Human-readable, named account addresses (i.e. ceramic.near) replace long, clunky hex strings and can support multiple names within a single public key. With progressive onboarding, the crypto elements of using decentralized apps on NEAR can be 100% abstracted away from the user and the complexities of gas fees, storage costs, seed phrases, and keys are obscured from their experience until they are ready to claim their wallet and hold their own tokens.</p> Ceramic: Decentralized data streams <p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">Ceramic's unique stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data model. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information. <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables. By making it easy to structure and associate data to user's personal index, IDX lets applications save, discover and route to users' data.</p><p>The IDX SDK makes it simple to manage users and deliver great data-driven experiences using the same NEAR keys and wallets as developers and users are already relying on. Users can also link multiple keys, from any wallet and multiple blockchains, to the same identity. This is essential to developers who want to serve users over time, as it enables key rotation, data interoperability across accounts, and rich cross-chain profiles, reputations and experiences (including 50,000+ profiles on Ethereum today).</p> Getting started with Ceramic on NEAR <p>NEAR is currently hosting an Open Web Community <a href="https://createbase.community/hackathon/">hackathon</a>! There is a prize for integrating Ceramic profiles with a NEAR Sputnik DAO.</p>  To install NEAR, follow their <a href="https://docs.near.org">documentation</a>.  To add IDX to your project, follow this <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">installation guide</a>.  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/">installation guide</a>.  Regardless of which option you choose, you should also select 3ID Connect as your DID wallet during the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/">authentication</a> process which handles the integration with NEAR wallets.

  <p>This blog post summarizes the key highlights of the Digital Immunization Passport (DIP) project. We implemented and evaluated an end-to-end workflow for handling immunization information in a human-centric way, and we provided the necessary infrastructure for all participating stakeholders to demonstrated the functionality in real-world use cases: Yellow Fever and Tick-borne encephalitis vaccination.<br>
The project has received funding from <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">NGI_DAPSI</a> (DAPSI 1st open call), the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 871498.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus of this project is on Data Interoperability &amp; Compatibility through establishing interfaces between health industry and individuals as well as pushing forward on standardized interfaces for data stores. Additionally, we address Data Transparency (Usage Policies and Data Provenance in Semantic Containers) and Security &amp; Privacy (by applying blockchain technology and digital watermarking on data sharing). A key challenge in making institutional data available to individuals is authentication. In this project we demonstrated the use of biometric features to identify individuals and generate a unique identifier that can either be managed as a decentralized identifier (DID) or via a national Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p>
<p>The project team consisted of the partners OwnYourData (OYD) and the Human Colossus Foundation (HCF), who shared conceptual and development work. As a result the following deliverables were made available:</p>

 Rory Torres shares her experience as part of Berkman Klein’s latest global research&nbsp;sprint <p>In an increasingly digital world, our experiences online are shaped by data gathered and wielded to tailor experiences. But what control do users have over that data, where it goes, and how it is&nbsp;used?</p><p>Questions of control over personal data were a cross-cutting theme throughout a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-03/research-sprint-examines-digital-self-determination-increasingly-interconnected-world">Research Sprint</a> co-hosted by the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalasiahub.org/">Digital Asia Hub</a>. The Sprint also examined other important dimensions of self-determination in the digitally networked world, for instance, self-expression and participation in civic life and the digital economy, or relationship-building and well-being, to name just a few application areas.</p><p>The three-month program for graduate students focused on digital self-determination spanning a range of geographies, backgrounds, and contexts. The cohort, who came from 21 countries across the globe, convened regularly to participate in critical discussions and create accessible educational resources — including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia page</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Digital_self-determination">Wikiversity Living Syllabus</a> — on the&nbsp;topic.</p>Mary Rhauline “Rory” Torres, Harvard Law LL.M. ’21 was a participant in a recent Research Sprint from the Berkman Klein Center. Courtesy&nbsp;image.<p>One participant, Mary Rhauline “Rory” Torres, Harvard Law LL.M. ’21, joined the sprint from Mangaldan, Pangasinan, in the Philippines. We spoke with Torres about her experience in the program, what she learned, and how it informed her&nbsp;work.</p> What motivated you to join the Research Sprint and explore digital self-determination? <p>I learned about the Research Sprint when Professor <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a> posted it in his Comparative Digital Privacy course. The call to participate resonated with me because there was a huge surge of new Internet participants in South East Asia when the pandemic hit. That’s 40 million new users of the Internet who are basically opening up their lives to the digital world. It’s an exciting place, but also has threats and harms. Even those of us who have been connected for a while are still scrambling to find our place in the digital space. I thought learning about digital self-determination can help all of us make sense of our role in the Internet as individuals and as a community, and thrive in&nbsp;it.</p> How has your understanding of the concept changed or evolved over the past few&nbsp;months? <p>Prior to the Research Sprint, my understanding of digital self-determination was limited to empowering an individual to participate in a digital environment and being equipped to do so responsibly, much like digital citizenship. I didn’t realize how digital self-determination is a labyrinth until we started to talk about it with related concepts like digital rights, digital colonialism, informational self-determination; to situate it in various contexts like digital health, digital economy, digital information; and to ground it in principles that would realize self-determination, such as trustworthy data spaces. It’s all very interesting and&nbsp;complex!</p> The Research Sprint is interdisciplinary and international by design. What was that experience like working with graduate students around the world to explore digital self-determination? <p>The Sprint is composed of an amazing group of people from all over the world with so many diverse backgrounds. There are students studying psychology, communication, political science, social science, and culture. The diversity of language, culture, and studies makes the task of understanding digital self-determination challenging because we all have different contexts. But there’s also beauty in it because it allows us to find connections, confront ourselves with different, sometimes opposing perspectives, and accept and respect&nbsp;that.</p> Your cohort is coming together to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia entry</a> on digital self-determination. Could you explain the processes behind that task, and what you hope the impact is of the&nbsp;entry? <p>We started with gathering a bibliography of articles that relate to digital self-determination. Building on that bibliography, the group created an outline in a shared Google document. We’ve since then expanded that outline by communicating through Slack, gathered volunteers to write sections that are of interest to them, and some have met through Zoom or smaller chat groups to get feedback, do peer review, and make&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia entry</a> is divided into three parts: first, an overview of the history of self-determination in philosophy, psychology, and its legal adaptations, and defining self-determination in the digital sphere; second, identifying practical elements that support the realization of digital self-determination, such as digital infrastructure, equal access, privacy protections; and third, current issues relevant to digital self-determination, including a discussion on regulation and legal frameworks, which I am contributing to.</p><p>Having a Wiki entry on digital self-determination is a big first step to bringing the principle out into the digital space, making it more accessible and understandable, and keeping in mind that the concept is a work in progress.</p> What was the most interesting topic you explored during the&nbsp;program? <p>The session on Information Diet was extremely interesting because it relates so well to our daily lives: living at a place and time where information seems to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. One of the first things I do in the morning is open my phone, read the “recommended stories” of the New York Times on my account, open the Telegram information group on the situation of COVID-19 in the Philippines, check my emails and I’m bombarded by the newsletters that I’ve subscribed to, and then there’s Facebook. There’s just so much information, so there’s this burden of having no excuse not to know about an important issue. And there’s so much disinformation, that filtering out reliable from unreliable content has become so overwhelming.</p><p>So I really loved Professor <a href="https://sarah.genner.cc/">Sarah Genner</a>’s presentation on Information Diet and what it means to be in the driver’s seat in the digital age and not the other way around and having an overview of how to disconnect, do a digital detox, and avoid digital distractions. While studying for my exams, I used the Pomodoro Technique and the amount of studying I was able to clock in was almost cathartic.</p> Was there a particular speaker that stood out to you, or sparked a new interest? <p>I was fascinated by Professor <a href="https://nishantshah.online/">Nishant Shah</a>’s talk on the formation of our identities in the digital age. He provoked a lot of questions on how an individual defines one’s identity through digital artifacts — that one may or may not have created or uploaded for oneself; how digital spaces may constrain our definition of ourselves in and out of cyberspace; and how do we preserve these identities — or do we even want&nbsp;to?</p> You host a blog about parenting. From your perspective, how should adults address digital self-determination with children? <p>In the same talk, Professor Shah’s example of his nephew’s thousands of photos in the cloud uploaded for him by his relatives resonated with me as a parent. As a mother of a four-year-old, it’s so difficult to restrain me from uploading pictures of my child — what Professor <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11018/Plunkett">Leah Plunkett</a> calls “Sharenthood.” Parents create digital footprints of our children and so much of their private moments are in the digital space already. But beyond the dangers of violating the privacy of children, the creation of this catalog of children’s lives online may limit their ability to define who they are, to reflect on their experiences, to associate objects to their memories, because so much has already been documented for&nbsp;them.</p><p>So when is digitization too much that it harms children’s self-determination — is a topic I want to explore further. It goes hand-in-hand with other parenting issues in the digital era, like safety. Parents should educate themselves about technology and how our children interact with it because it’s not going away and it plays a large role in how they define themselves and their realities. I personally recommend Professor Urs Gasser’s book “<a href="https://today.law.harvard.edu/the-connected-parent-offers-guidance-insight-into-digital-parenting/">The Connected Parent</a>” as a starting&nbsp;point.</p>Rory Torres with her daughter. Courtesy&nbsp;image. How did your studies as an LL.M. student at Harvard Law School — and your interests in tech and the law — inform or shape your perception of the&nbsp;program? <p>When we talk about law and technology, there’s always a discussion of seemingly competing but often interacting concepts: the individual and the collective, the private and the public, the offline and the online. As an LL.M. student, what I have realized in studying these concepts as they relate to technology is that technology is highly contextual and it is fast-changing, such that, as a student of the law, it is difficult to create a single universal approach to encourage innovation that would provide a positive impact to the world or to address the harms or threats that technology can bring. This is the attitude that I have brought with me to the Research Sprint, and it has helped me broaden my perspective and try to see self-determination from the lens of participants and speakers with various backgrounds and expertise.</p> How did participating in the Research Sprint inform your time at HLS and your future trajectory? <p>Finding my trajectory after HLS is an exercise of self-determination! At HLS, I curated my law and technology courses for business and technology, and Internet and society, because there’s always that tension between commercial interests and social issues. The Research Sprint in particular expanded my thinking beyond legal frameworks and allowed me to explore the field of social science and the Internet, and was especially inspired by Professor Lokman Tsui’s work on free expression, digital rights, and Internet policy in Asia. In relation to that, I’m also keen on exploring Privacy-by-Design and studying how to integrate digital self-determination into its principles, beyond respect for user privacy, and experimenting with startups on how to integrate Privacy-by-Design and digital self-determination as they develop their platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/a-deep-dive-on-digital-self-determination-368c48d87705">A Deep-Dive on Digital Self-Determination</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of Sterling Backcheck?</p>



<p>Sterling Backcheck’s mission is to provide the foundation of trust and safety for our clients so they can create great environments for their most essential resource, people. Sterling Backcheck’s vision is the world where verified identity information should be owned and accessible easily by the individual.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>So much of our lives is now in a digital format, both personally and professionally. We rely on technology to handle sensitive information, which, if not done correctly, can put us in jeopardy. Digital Identity is a crucial safeguard to preventing identity fraud, which could result in a significant damage to people’s life. Digital Identity is a key enabler to unlocking the next frontier of the digital economy. Through trustworthy Digital Identity, we can enable a safe digital future.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>The World Bank estimates that roughly 1 billion people lack an official foundational identification. Millions have forms of identification that cannot be reliably verified or authenticated, resulting in exclusion from economic opportunities. Our parent company, Sterling, has been working on the creation of a digital identity wallet to help address the challenges worldwide. By joining DIACC, Sterling Backcheck hopes to help bridge that gap and offer a platform for trustworthy ID verification.</p>



 <a href="https://www.sterlingbackcheck.ca/"></a> 



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada has always been the pioneer on the identity front. For example, unlike many other countries, ID verification is required before starting a background check in Canada. In addition, Canada has always emphasized the importance of data privacy and storage. Building on those principles, Canada is well positioned to lead the conversation on digital identity services.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>At Sterling Backcheck, we aspire to a vision that Digital identity verification should only have to occur once and personal identity verification should only be shared, when necessary and proportional to the need. Individuals and organizations should mutually benefit from digital identity innovation. While technology has created opportunities to enhance digital identity, we’ve also noticed examples of some migration away from sound identity verification practices. We see DIACC as an important vehicle to bolster and promulgate sound digital identity practices. We joined to help forward the mission of DIACC towards that goal.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Sterling Backcheck is a pioneer in background screening, having revolutionized the industry with eConsent, a fully online platform for collecting candidate consent prior to starting their check. Through our proactive and collaborative approach working with the federal authorities that govern our industry, we have continuously offered a safe and secure way for organizations to conduct background screening. We conduct over a million criminal record checks on behalf of thousands of employers annually. There is no question that our processes have been refined over the years. We’re always looking for ways to innovate and continue to offer best in class service to our clients.</p>

<p>MIT Technology Review Insights explores, in a new <a href="https://bit.ly/3u4ZbIj">report</a> released today, how a growing number of voices — including economists, lawyers, civil rights groups, and Omidyar Network — are constructing a new social contract between the tech industry and citizens. <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar_team/sushant-kumar/">Sushant Kumar</a>, a principal of responsible technology, reflects on the need and pathway for this paradigm shift in the forward of “Data fairness: A new social contact for the 21st century economy.”</p><p>Incentives drive behavior. Currently, tech giants are incentivized to collect as much data as possible so they can narrowly target advertising to consumers, which in turn, increases their earnings. Big tech does everything it can to increase users’ screen-time and engagement, all in service of data collection. And it’s working quite well for them. Facebook’s profits in the first quarter of 2021 nearly doubled and advertising revenue rose by 46% compared to last&nbsp;year.</p><p>But while these platforms are seeing record profits, it’s coming at the expense of other stakeholders in the system: government, communities, gig workers, and the users themselves. Government is losing out because these companies don’t pay their fair share of taxes in countries of operation, thereby constraining public investments. These platforms use extractive and intrusive ways to collect data, stripping communities and individuals of privacy and control. And Big Tech uses data to control their employees, especially gig workers, which leads to suppressed wages and deteriorating work conditions for people working in the gig&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Omidyar Network, a social change venture, believes we must learn how to <a href="https://omidyarnetwork.medium.com/why-we-invested-in-building-an-equitable-data-economy-98e8968b0dc6">balance the data economy</a> so that it is equitable for all stakeholders, not just serving the interests of the big tech giants. That’s why we’ve partnered with MIT Technology Review Insights. We wanted to have a better understanding of potential pathways to reimagine the data economy that is rife with systemic flaws. This <a href="https://bit.ly/3u4ZbIj">paper</a> is intended to share emerging ideas, spark debate, and solicit feedback.</p><p>This paper is informed by early scholarship from individuals and institutions that are investigating this issue. They have found three emerging pathways to reimagine the data economy. First, the essential infrastructure that enables a global, open internet must focus on generating public value rather than private profits. Second, governments will need a holistic approach to regulating the data economy. Traditional antitrust and privacy measures need to be complemented by data governance that creates necessary safeguards and room for innovative applications for data. Finally, the data economy needs mechanisms for participatory governance and practice-based intermediation approaches. This report provides examples from Estonia and Taiwan and shares the progress made by entrepreneurs in the field of data trusts and data collaboratives. These approaches can be strengthened with regulatory support and public&nbsp;funding.</p><p>We hope these pathways provoke a much needed reckoning of the data economy. As we continue our journey to reimagine the data economy, we invite you to join&nbsp;us.</p><p>We are grateful for our partnership with MIT Technology Review Insights for its in-depth exploration into the data economy, and our many partners, including The Rockefeller Foundation, that share our commitment to building a more equitable data&nbsp;economy.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-push-for-fairness-equity-and-safeguards-in-the-data-economy-2dfa58dc0e48">The push for fairness, equity, and safeguards in the data economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>MIT Technology Review Insights explores, in a new <a href="https://bit.ly/3u4ZbIj">report</a> released today, how a growing number of voices — including economists, lawyers, civil rights groups, and Omidyar Network — are constructing a new social contract between the tech industry and citizens. <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar_team/sushant-kumar/">Sushant Kumar</a>, a principal of responsible technology, reflects on the need and pathway for this paradigm shift in the forward of “Data fairness: A new social contact for the 21st century economy.”</p><p>Incentives drive behavior. Currently, tech giants are incentivized to collect as much data as possible so they can narrowly target advertising to consumers, which in turn, increases their earnings. Big tech does everything it can to increase users’ screen-time and engagement, all in service of data collection. And it’s working quite well for them. Facebook’s profits in the first quarter of 2021 nearly doubled and advertising revenue rose by 46% compared to last&nbsp;year.</p><p>But while these platforms are seeing record profits, it’s coming at the expense of other stakeholders in the system: government, communities, gig workers, and the users themselves. Government is losing out because these companies don’t pay their fair share of taxes in countries of operation, thereby constraining public investments. These platforms use extractive and intrusive ways to collect data, stripping communities and individuals of privacy and control. And Big Tech uses data to control their employees, especially gig workers, which leads to suppressed wages and deteriorating work conditions for people working in the gig&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Omidyar Network, a social change venture, believes we must learn how to <a href="https://omidyarnetwork.medium.com/why-we-invested-in-building-an-equitable-data-economy-98e8968b0dc6">balance the data economy</a> so that it is equitable for all stakeholders, not just serving the interests of the big tech giants. That’s why we’ve partnered with MIT Technology Review Insights. We wanted to have a better understanding of potential pathways to reimagine the data economy that is rife with systemic flaws. This <a href="https://bit.ly/3u4ZbIj">paper</a> is intended to share emerging ideas, spark debate, and solicit feedback.</p><p>This paper is informed by early scholarship from individuals and institutions that are investigating this issue. They have found three emerging pathways to reimagine the data economy. First, the essential infrastructure that enables a global, open internet must focus on generating public value rather than private profits. Second, governments will need a holistic approach to regulating the data economy. Traditional antitrust and privacy measures need to be complemented by data governance that creates necessary safeguards and room for innovative applications for data. Finally, the data economy needs mechanisms for participatory governance and practice-based intermediation approaches. This report provides examples from Estonia and Taiwan and shares the progress made by entrepreneurs in the field of data trusts and data collaboratives. These approaches can be strengthened with regulatory support and public&nbsp;funding.</p><p>We hope these pathways provoke a much needed reckoning of the data economy. As we continue our journey to reimagine the data economy, we invite you to join&nbsp;us.</p><p>We are grateful for our partnership with MIT Technology Review Insights for its in-depth exploration into the data economy, and our many partners, including The Rockefeller Foundation, that share our commitment to building a more equitable data&nbsp;economy.</p>

<p></p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell us about your day – what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;I am the Head of Financial Crime for a credit card company. I am also studying for a PhD in Criminal Justice Studies, looking at the role of insider fraudsters within business.</p>
<p>In my spare time I run STUC (Stammerers Through University Consultancy), an initiative which collaborates with universities nationwide offering better support for students and staff who stammer.</p>
<p>I’m really fascinated by the world of financial crime and how to prevent it. No two days are ever the same because the fraud landscape is continually changing.</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Employment-wise, I graduated with a French degree from the University of Warwick in 2014 and landed a job at Amazon working as a bilingual fraud investigations specialist. They hired me for my language skills and trained me in fraud detection and prevention on the job. From that point, I was hooked. I subsequently worked in the financial crime sector at Cifas, World First and, currently, Jaja Finance. I also completed a MSc in Counter Fraud &amp; Counter Corruption Studies before starting on my PhD. I wanted to have a combination of both professional and academic background in my line of work.</p>
<blockquote>
 Allow everyone to be themselves and work in a way that suits them. Your teams will feel more valued and much more loyal 
</blockquote>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;I’d say it is that the person I was when I started my first graduate job in 2014 is completely different to who I am now. I used to be shy, naïve, desperate to please and anxious of making the tiniest of mistakes. Now I am so much more confident, much less anxious. I understand that you can’t please everyone and that making mistakes is part of how you learn.</p>
<p>I’ve also learned that whilst having a great manager is invaluable to aid your personal and professional development, having not-so-great managers will teach you just as much.</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What would you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity and inclusion should be at the forefront of everything you do, as well as instilling a culture that promotes acceptance and versatility. Trying to mould people to fit a certain type of employee will only deter them and staff turnover will be high. If you allow everyone to be themselves and work in a way that suits them, they will feel more valued and will show loyalty.WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you?</p>
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity is a necessity for the progression, learning and development of both individuals and businesses.</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members and why? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;I always used to try too hard to people-please. I’d obsess over what people thought of me, and regularly put myself in uncomfortable situations under the belief that it would help me be liked. So my recommendation would be The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k by Sarah Knight!</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Your stammer doesn’t define your success. One day you’ll decide that you can’t substitute words anymore and that if you stammer, so what? People may not understand it, they may not react in a way you like, but you’ll rise above it and will be able to live the life you want – because you’ll learn that your words are just as important as everyone else’s.</p>

<blockquote>
 I’d much rather keep tabs on pastoralists use of SMS or small business owners workarounds for digital payments than reading the latest news onTechCrunch. 
</blockquote>
 Tell us about your role and what gets you out of bed in the morning 
<p>Functionally, I support when / where / why / how to integrate digital technologies (and partners, service providers) into resource constrained contexts, primarily for purposes of humanitarian response. Most recently, I’ve been focused on supporting large-scale humanitarian cash transfer programmes, as well as supporting essential work in mobile health, agriculture, nutrition and supply chain programs.</p>
<p>I love helping others to make informed decisions around what will be the most impactful technologies, partnerships etc. and I typically serve as a bridge between technologists and non-technologists. I suppose I’m a kind of trusted broker and often my role is hidden.&nbsp; Slowly, I think people are starting to realize this can be integral to the success of a large scale tech project and I love the feeling that my role is so connected to the success of projects that have such an impact on fellow human beings.</p>
<p>I also love learning how people are bending simple technologies for their own needs, in seemingly “less developed” locations or within “complex crises.” I’d much rather keep tabs on pastoralists use of SMS or small business owners workarounds for digital payments than reading the latest news on TechCrunch.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Luck, curiosity and cautiously stumbling along unexpected pathways. I’m fairly up front about what I know and what I don’t know. This results in a lot of leaning in on others to help develop the situational awareness we need to piece together the best outcomes re digital integrations.</p>
<p>More specifically, my interest in the world of “impactful tech” was sparked when I spent a very brief time in Haiti a few days after the 2010 earthquake. Basic ICT and mobile technology was accessible to many and I was fascinated how it became an invaluable tool, updating (OpenStreet) maps to allow for better co-ordination of logistics etc.. I’ve basically followed that curiosity ever since.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
 
 Trust is key. 
 Technology / ICT is an industry. Regardless of goodwill intent, this should never be forgotten. 
 “Being an expert” is very relative. It’s been quite fascinating to observe the quick ascent of experts in “emerging technologies” (e.g. AI, ML, blockchain / digital ID) and how they will “most definitely” impact “the unbanked” or other demographics in the developing world. All I can say is it seems there are a lot of experts who understand technology and its potential. But I believe there are far fewer who can navigate how to make it all work sustainably in a new context, with new populations. 
 
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
 
 START educating people on what actually makes a recognized identity. What are the fundamental building blocks? Which public policies and stakeholders / authorities should be involved? 
 STOP selling pipe dreams based solely on product designs. No ID app or platform will hold meaning unless the right stakeholders (and regulators) are engaged and on board. Thankfully we are seeing a reduction in Marketing campaign that promote “digital ID for all refugees” or the like. 
 CONTINUE promoting standards that uphold interoperability. Continue to educate governments on what makes a good public technology / societal platform, as well as share successes of large-scale (and govt led) technology initiatives. Digital ID is the backbone of a new age of digital governance. Ot needs to be treated as more than just a pilot project, dependent on archaic RFP / tender processes. 
 
 What does diversity mean to you?&nbsp;&nbsp;* 
<blockquote>
 Without diversity, my perspectives on life would be much less interesting (or balanced) !! 
</blockquote>
 What book, film or piece of art would you recommend to fellow WiD members? 
<p>My book would be: Fake Like Me, by Barbara Bourland.&nbsp; Full disclosure ….. the author is a friend! But it’s a fun read for summer that’s ostensibly a murder mystery based in an artists’ colony. Ultimately, it’s also a witty introspection into identity and how easy it is to create (and destroy) it.</p>
<p>Art – <a href="https://artscoops.com/">https://artscoops.com/ </a>&nbsp;I know it’s not a single piece, I know, but it’s a great place to keep revisiting you’re wanting to support artists from the Middle East.</p>
 
 Finally, what advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“You won’t end up in Law School. Though maybe don’t tell Mom just yet!!”</p>

<p>Developers building multi-chain applications have a powerful new combination to work with, as Ceramic now supports Moonbeam applications. &nbsp;Moonbeam offers developers an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot, providing an easy path to a multi-chain implementation. Ceramic adds support for advanced data management and cross-chain identity. Together, this enables developers and users to depend on the same accounts and wallets to manage transactions, identities, and data across Ethereum and Polkadot applications. </p> A full stack for cross-chain applications <p>Since Moonbeam uses the same keypairs and wallets as Ethereum, signing and<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains"> </a>authentication for Ceramic's data streams is also supported out of the box. Now that Moonbeam and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem  <p>"Moonbeam devs and users will now be able to easily implement Ceramic's streaming data and cross-chain identity protocols due to the same keys and wallets being utilized that developers and users are already familiar with," says Nate Hamilton, Director of Business Development at Moonbeam. </p><blockquote>The Ceramic and Moonbeam teams look towards the same goal: proving the best-in-class user experience</blockquote><p>Currently, Moonbase Alpha, the Moonbeam TestNet, has been added as a supported chain. Users can now perform transactions on Ceramic and Moonbase Alpha with their existing wallets. Currently, Moonbeam is compatible with MetaMask and MathWallet.</p> About Moonbeam:  <p>Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network that makes it easy to build natively interoperable applications. This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam will benefit from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. Currently, in active development by PureStake, Moonbeam is expected to reach MainNet by mid-2021. </p><p>Learn more: <a href="https://moonbeam.network/?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=announcement&amp;utm_content=subscan">https://moonbeam.network/</a>.</p> About Ceramic <p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/#streams">Ceramic's stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information. <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables. By making it easy to structure and associate data to a user's personal index, IDX lets applications save, discover and route to users' data.</p><p>The IDX SDK makes it simple to manage users and deliver great data-driven experiences using the same keys and wallets as developers and users are already relying on. Users can also link multiple keys, from any wallet and multiple blockchains, to the same identity. This is essential to developers who want to serve users over time, as it enables key rotation, data interoperability across accounts, and rich cross-chain profiles, reputations and experiences (including 50,000+ profiles on Ethereum today).</p> Getting started with Ceramic and Moonbeam   To get started on Moonbeam visit their <a href="https://docs.moonbeam.network/">documentation site</a>  To add IDX to your project, follow this<a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>.

<p>By Rae Rivera, Ph.D., Director of Certification, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance today&nbsp; introduced a significant update to its Metadata Service (MDS). The service provides information about the certification status of authenticators, authenticator capabilities, and any known security issues. The FIDO MDS provides organizations deploying FIDO servers with a centralized and trusted source of information about FIDO authenticators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MDS is a web-based repository where vendors can publish metadata about their certified FIDO authenticators. Relying parties use this information&nbsp; to validate authenticator attestation and prove the authenticity of the device model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With over 100 authenticator products on the market today, and demand for strong authentication on the rise, the need for an easy-to-use repository to load and view FIDO Certified authenticators has grown in importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just last week, the Biden administration mandated multi-factor authentication for all government agencies to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover.&nbsp; Governments and other regulated industries such as banking and healthcare especially need to know that authenticators being used to access their systems are genuine and meet certain requirements, including FIDO Certification status, compliance and other organizational requirements. The new features in the FIDO MDS allow organizations to more quickly and easily verify the attributes of the FIDO Authenticators being used to log in to their web services and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s news is significant in several areas:</p>



  The new MDS has a more efficient and effective user interface that greatly simplifies the uploading and publishing of metadata.&nbsp;  There is a simplified API for relying parties to download metadata.  Metadata updates are now available daily instead of monthly, which ensures relying parties have access to the most up-to-date information.  The new MDS data format is now a single JSON structure, making it more compatible with standard web development tools. The new MDS format uses human-readable strings instead of numerical values, making it easier to read and understand.  The MDS data is now linked to the FIDO Certification program, which will ensure the reliability of the validity of metadata of FIDO Certified products.&nbsp;  The service now uses cloud caching to provide high availability and download performance.&nbsp;

  Being able to prove one’s identity is critical in modern society. This is 
no less the case for people being served by humanitarian organizations. 
Indeed, those without official identification are among the most 
vulnerable. While previous solutions to this challenge have relied on 
traditional means, these are not ideal, especially in the context of the 
current COVID-19 pandemic.

            <p>Oldoniyro, Kenya 2018: In a field pilot utilizing cash assistance and blockchain technology conducted by the Kenya Red Cross and IFRC, it was recognized that lack of official ID was a hindrance to receiving assistance. In the published <a href="https://preparecenter.org/resource/blockchain-open-loop-cash-transfer-pilot-project/">learning review</a> it was noted that 25% of the Kenya Red Cross’ caseload have no official IDs, highlighting the need to address the issue of identities. </p><p>Photo credit: Kenya Red Cross</p>
          
        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>In disaster and crisis situations, members of affected communities who do not have an officially recognized form of identification (ID) <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22297">can face barriers to receiving aid</a>. Without ID, people made vulnerable by their situations cannot prove who they are, making it impossible for aid agencies to “know their customer” – often a pre-requisite for delivering services in an accountable way. While these challenges can sometimes be overcome, for instance through trusted proxies who do have an ID, such analogue solutions are not ideal.</p><p>Through a series of expert interviews and case studies of existing projects, a new report written by <a href="http://www.octd.co.uk">Oxford Centre for Technology and Development</a>, commissioned by IFRC, and supported by the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">DIGID </a>consortium (Norwegian Red Cross, Norwegian Refugee Council, Norwegian Church Aid, Save the Children Norway), <a href="https://hiplatform.org/s/Digital-IdentityAn-Analysis-for-the-Humanitarian-Sector-Final.pdf">Digital Identity: An Analysis for the Humanitarian Sector</a> looks at the opportunities offered by digital identity technologies in humanitarian contexts, but also the risks. The report lists technical, ethical and sustainability aspects of digital ID solutions for organizations looking to explore, learn, and invest in such solutions. </p><p>For affected communities, obtaining a digital ID issued by humanitarian organizations can make it much easier (or indeed possible in the first place) to access services, including cash and voucher assistance, in multiple ways. First, they can use the digital ID to prove their identity where this was not previously possible due to a lack of official ID. Second, they can store certain attributes or credentials digitally, allowing them to have portable access to information such as training or education certificates, health records or legal records that might otherwise be left behind or destroyed when a disaster hits. Third, they can choose to reveal only relevant pieces of information instead of all their digital wallet’s contents.</p>


  <blockquote>
    “Without ID, people made vulnerable by their situations cannot prove who they are, making it impossible for aid agencies to “know their customer” – often a pre-requisite for delivering services in an accountable way.”
  </blockquote>
  

<p>The report points out that in an ideal world, digital ID technology would be “interoperable” throughout the sector whereby different humanitarian organizations would be able to recognize digital ID credentials, check the issuer, and extract only the data that is being shared by the owner of the digital ID. In this way, members of affected communities could avoid having to register repeatedly (and potentially having to relive trauma as they recount their story), better preserving their dignity.</p><p>Meanwhile, the report finds that aid organizations would also benefit from avoiding such repeat registration as their process could be made more time- and cost-efficient by deploying digital ID systems. Another advantage of an interoperable solution would be that trust and collaboration between aid organizations would be enhanced. The DIGID consortium was established for this very purpose: to see how different agencies can work together to best deliver services instead of developing siloed systems.</p><p>But the report also discusses challenges to the successful implementation of digital IDs and makes recommendations to address these: </p>  <p>Developing and rolling out a solution has a considerable cost, in terms of both money and time, including the need to upskill staff and volunteers. </p>  <p>Concerns around data privacy must also be addressed to maintain trust between organizations and the communities they serve. </p>  <p>Digital ID solutions depend on certain levels of literacy and access to technology and devices that can be variable and limited in crisis-affected communities.</p>  <p>Despite these difficulties, the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/s/Digital-IdentityAn-Analysis-for-the-Humanitarian-Sector-Final.pdf">report </a>offers hope that digital IDs will come to form an integral part of delivering humanitarian services, including cash and voucher assistance. In a rapidly evolving ecosystem of assistance and technology, humanitarian actors must involve themselves in the process from the outset, or risk having to play catch-up in an environment over which they have little or no control. </p><p>The DIGID consortium also held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjL1MOv7_Rc">webinar</a> introducing this report, as part of <a href="https://solferinoacademy.com/ifrc-data-digital-week-2021/">Data and Digital Week in April 2021</a>.</p><p><a href="https://hiplatform.org/blog/2021/5/19/digital-ids-in-the-humanitarian-sector-whats-the-big-deal">Permalink</a></p><p></p>

 Energy Web and Energy Peace Partners Announce Peace Renewable Energy Credit (P-REC) Digital Marketplace Platform <p>Zug, Switzerland and Sausalito, Calif. — 19 May 2021 — Today, Energy Web and <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/mission">Energy Peace Partners</a> (EPP) announced a new partnership to develop a digital marketplace platform to accelerate the development of renewable energy projects in fragile, energy-poor countries. EPP leverages climate finance solutions to promote peace and development by extending the renewable energy revolution to some of the planet’s most vulnerable populations. EPP developed the <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/prec">Peace Renewable Energy Credit</a> (P-REC), which certifies the social co-benefits of renewable energy in addition to renewables’ traditional environmental benefits.</p><p>An energy attribute certificate (EAC) — including renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the United States and guarantees of origin (GOs) in the EU — is an internationally-traded virtual commodity that represents 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable energy generated. P-RECs are issued under the I-REC Standard, the EAC standard in 40+ developing countries, and are issued as I-RECs with additional social co-benefits from new projects in fragile, energy-poor regions. To date, EPP has been authorized as the country issuer of P-RECs and I-RECs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan. The first-ever P-REC transaction occurred in the DRC in 2020 through a <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/blog/announcing-the-first-sale-of-p-recs">groundbreaking collaboration</a> between Microsoft, Nuru, 3Degrees (an Energy Web member), and&nbsp;EPP.</p><p>The digital marketplace platform will leverage the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a> open-source software development toolkit, harmonize with <a href="https://www.irecstandard.org/">The IREC Standard</a>, and be prepared to integrate with <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, an application to find and digitally source verified, emissions-free renewable energy globally. Simply put, the platform will lead to the development of a digital P-REC purchase option for renewable energy buyers, including individuals, that want to support the development of high-impact renewable energy projects for communities where these projects are installed.</p><p>The platform will help EPP market P-REC projects, increase demand among a wider set of corporate and individual buyers, scale up the global P-REC market, and facilitate P-REC transactions in a streamlined way. For Energy Web, this partnership will generate new open-source functionality for EW Origin to support digitized EAC “forward agreements” that enable buyers to easily commit to supporting additional renewable energy facilities, which in turn helps reduce the upfront costs of new facilities and improve financing terms.</p><p>“This is an incredibly exciting partnership and project,” said Sherwin Das, Managing Director of EPP. “Together we’re bringing a cutting-edge, digital solution that will contribute to scaling up the market for P-RECs and, in doing so, unlock more renewable energy investment in high-impact projects around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>“We’re proud to partner with EPP on this renewables marketplace,” added Doug Miller, global markets lead for Energy Web. “This partnership represents Energy Web’s first engagement with projects in Africa and a breakthrough opportunity to introduce digital tools that make it easy for local communities to attract renewable energy buyers who can help expand clean energy access and related social co-benefits in a frictionless way. This partnership will also result in a new standardized digital approach to renewable energy forward agreements that we think will serve as an attractive product for renewable energy buyers that want to support additional products outside of Africa, yet are simpler to implement than power purchase agreements, especially in regulated markets like most I-REC markets.”</p><p>Both EPP and I-REC Standard are also advisors to EW Zero, which in December <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-awarded-good-energies-foundation-grant-for-new-global-renewables-marketplace-794eaa7e14e0">received a grant</a> from the Good Energies Foundation to commercialize the platform. For the EPP P-REC marketplace, the joint team expects to complete an initial proof of concept (POC) by the end of&nbsp;2021.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

				 <p>Over the past years, the question of how we can protect our identity in the world of online has been getting more heated. The Self-Sovereign Identity paradigm stepped in with the idea itself, that everyone should be in charge of their own digital personal information, and that it is the data owner who should decide on how this data is being used and by whom.</p>
<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) promises to empower European citizens with new means to manage privacy, to eliminate logins, and to enjoy much faster and safer electronic transactions via the internet as well as in real life.</p>
<p>Strengthening internet trustworthiness with electronic identities is also the aim of eSSIF-Lab, which has just launched its Second Business-oriented Open Call on 7 May 2021.</p>
<p></p> 
			   
				
				
				  2nd Business-oriented Open Call 
<p>This call is open&nbsp;for proposals to develop and demonstrate SSI working solutions for a real-world, domain-oriented problem or opportunity, in prioritized eSSIF-Lab areas (Health Tech, e-Government and Education), or in the Open Disruptive Innovation track (which is covering innovative bottom-up projects out of these verticals).</p>
<p>Proposed solutions must be commercial, competitive and sector-specific SSI applications for products and services. They are expected to leverage on the added value that previously developed functionalities within the eSSIF-Lab, to include the issuing, exchange and consumption of SSI credentials as a core element and to have high technology and investment readiness levels.</p>
<p>The proposals selected in the Second Business-oriented Call will be invited to join an 8-month acceleration programme, including business and technical support to integrate eSSIF-Lab and other SSI technology with market propositions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Who can apply? 
					  
 
 
<p>This call targets SMEs (including startups), not-for-profit entities (such as foundations or associations), or collaborative initiatives (as micro-consortia of these entities), registered in a Member State of the EU or in a H2020 associated country.</p>
<p>Deadline: 7th of July 2021, at 17:00 (Brussels Local Time).</p>
<p>Funding: up to 106,000 € per project (for those best in class).</p>
 
 
  
				 
				 <a href="https://essif-lab-second-business-oriented.fundingbox.com/">APPLY NOW!</a> 
			  
				
				
				  Infrastructure-oriented Open Call 
<p>Remember that also the Infrastructure-oriented Open Call of eSSIF-Lab is still ongoing and that the deadline to submit applications has been extended. This call looks for&nbsp;open source technical enhancements and extensions for eSSIF-Lab Framework which fall within the SSI concept (i.e. technologies which allow individuals to control their electronic identities and guard their privacy).</p>
<p>Open source SSI components developed as a result of this open call will be applied by other participants in eSSIF-Lab and, hence, applicants shall be willing and able to work in an agile way with lots of communication and interaction with other participants in the eSSIF-Lab ecosystem.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Who can apply?

<p>This month I’d like to focus on an important announcement regarding New Zealand’s Digital Identity Trust Framework that the Minister David Clark, who is both the Minister for Commerce and Consumer Affairs as well as Digital Economy and Communications, made at the last DINZ event held in Wellington.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firstly, Minister Clark, who also chairs the the new Digital Ministers’ Group, talked to us about the Digital Strategy for Aotearoa and it’s three pillars:Mahi tika (trust)Mahi tahi (inclusion)Mahi ake (growth).Mahi Tika is viewed as being critical for government and businesses as we build confidence in new processes and technology. With Mahi Tahi there is a need to make sure we bring everyone along on this digital journey. And Mahi Ake is about ensuring that New Zealand is well positioned to reap the rewards of being a digital nation and securing a bigger piece of the global pie.</p>



<p>Minister Clark&nbsp; went on to talk about the Government’s work on digital identity and he articulated how it is a crucial enabler to these three strategic pillars. He then announced that the Government has approved proposals to establish a Digital Identity Trust Framework in law.</p>



<p>He stated that the Government is committed to enhancing trust and confidence in how organisations handle personal and business identity information, that the legislation will ensure that everyone is clear on their rights and obligations and that the framework will give the tech sector a solid reference for how they can innovate and grow.</p>



<p>He also made it clear that there is a commitment to ensuring that the digital identity system reflects Māori perspectives, and that officials are engaging extensively with iwi to deliver this framework in a way that supports tikanga Māori.</p>



<p>He concluded by stating that a trusted modern digital identity system will help grow our digital economy, transform government services and ensure all New Zealanders can take part in the digital world. Here’s some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/688093/govt-ploughs-ahead-digital-identity-trust-framework-legislation/">press coverage</a>&nbsp;on Minister Clark’s announcement.</p>



<p>The announcement was followed by a lively Q&amp;A session during which Ann-Marie Cavanagh who has dual hats as Deputy Chief Executive Digital Public Service, and Deputy Government Chief Digital Officer, and Alan Bell, the Executive Director, Digital Identity took a range of questions from the floor.</p>



<p>For me there were a few key takeaways:&nbsp;The government seems to be taking development of the digital sector seriously as a key element in making New Zealand a more secure and prosperous place.&nbsp;There is an emerging strategy to assist and hopefully accelerate that developmentDigital identity is a central component of both the government’s digital strategy and in the development of our digital sector overall.&nbsp;DINZ and its members can play a pivotal role in achieving these goalsThere’s a shed load of work to do to get there!We had hoped to repeat the event on 5th of May in Auckland, but for a number of reasons that is now happening on 3rd June. Whilst there is quite a gap between the two events, both Ann-Marie Cavanagh and Alan Bell will be at the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/new-zealands-digital-identity-trust-framework-department-of-internal-affairs/">Auckland event</a>&nbsp;and this presents an awesome opportunity for those working in the digital identity space to spend some time with a couple of people who will be central to the role government plays in this space. We look forward to seeing many of you there,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/new-zealands-digital-identity-trust-framework-department-of-internal-affairs/">ensure you register</a>&nbsp;to secure your place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>In the last year, Blockchain Commons has produced a large collection of specifications, reference libraries, architectures, and reference utilities meant to improve blockchain infrastructure by enabling interoperability among Bitcoin wallets — and in the future, other cryptocurrency applications, such as Ethereum wallets, and other cryptography programs, such as chat systems, key management programs, and more.</p>

<p>So, what do Blockchain Commons’ technologies do? We’ve just released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">a Technology Overview video</a> that discuses the concepts and foundations underlying our work and also highlights many of our most important technological releases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY"></a></p>

<p>As the video notes, our work is built on a considerable volume of existing literature. We work with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m56s">entropy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m39s">seeds</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m45s">keys</a> and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=6m34s">airgaps</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=5m12s">multisigs</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m6s">secure storage</a> to ensure robust key creation, safe key usage, and responsible key management. We also build on crucial technological foundations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m13s">CBOR</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m37s">CRC-32</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=14m53s">Fountain Codes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=8m15s">QRs</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=12m55s">SHA-256</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=13m36s">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a>.</p>

<p>This results in a number of core Blockchain Commons technologies:
</p>
 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=16m21s">Bytewords</a> are a text-encoding method for binary data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=19m58s">Uniform Resources</a> support self-describing data that can be used interoperably. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=24m55s">LifeHash</a> allows for graphical recognition of seeds, keys, and other data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=26m52s">SSKR</a> provides new libraries and methodologies for sharding secrets. 
   The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=28m46s">Torgap</a> architecture creates security by partitioning blockchain services. 
 

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">Technology Overview video</a> discusses all of this and more.</p>

<p>We are also continuing to produce documents of use for the entire blockchain community, with our newest tutorials offering more depth on how to use the technologies highlighted in this video. That begins with some just-published developer-focused documents that expand on the overview of Uniform Resources (URs) found in the video. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources: An Overview</a> explains how URs are put together, and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-2-keys.md">A Guide to Using URs for Key Material</a> looks at <code>ur:crypto-seed</code>, <code>ur:crypto-bip39</code>, and <code>ur:crypto-hdkey</code> as three different ways to transmit key material in a standardized, typed format. (We have more UR docs planned on SSKRs, PSBTs, and our new request and response system.)</p>

<p>The specifications, architectures, references, and documents that we’re creating at Blockchain Commons are all meant to improve interoperability among many different vendors, to support the creation of wallets (and future cryptography applications) that enable independence, security, and resilience for their users. We’ve been working with an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> to create these various technologies. If you’re designing blockchain applications of your own, we hope you’ll view the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">video</a> to see how some of our technologies can help you.</p>

<p>You can also support the continued development of technologies like these, meant to support the entire community by becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor at GitHub</a> or by making a one-time donation <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">at our BTCPay</a>.</p>

<p>Federal agencies should choose FIDO as they seek to comply with the new Executive Order that requires the implementation of multi-factor authentication within the next 180 days.</p>



<p>By: Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and Chief Marketing Officer, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>In the face of recent attacks that have exposed areas of weakness in critical U.S. infrastructure assets, President Biden signed a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order Wednesday to help bolster the nation’s cybersecurity</a>.</p>



<p>There have been a number of high profile attacks against critical American infrastructure in recent months, including the Solarwinds supply chain attack that exposed much of the government to potential risk. Top of mind in recent days is the ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline, which significantly impacted the flow of refined oil across America. These attacks expose the vulnerability of critical infrastructure in the United States, and the Biden Administration is issuing federal directives that will minimize or eliminate risk.</p>



<p>A key part of the Executive Order is a requirement that agencies adopt multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent possible. Federal Civilian Branch Agencies will have 180 days to comply with the Executive Order and will need to report on progress every 60 days until adoption is complete. If for some reason agencies cannot fully adopt MFA and encryption within 180 days, they must report to Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director of CISA, the Director of OMB, and the APNSA with a rationale for not meeting the deadline.</p>



<p>At the FIDO Alliance, we welcome today’s directive from the Biden Administration and applaud its focus on the importance of multi-factor authentication. What’s notable about this Executive Order is that the White House is prioritizing MFA everywhere, rather than limiting MFA to the PIV/PKI platform that agencies have depended on for more than 15 years. Today’s Executive Order marks an important step forward, in that it makes clear the priority is protecting every account with MFA — without mandating any specific technology. This is a notable shift, because we know that the weakest forms of MFA can still stop some attacks where passwords are the attack vector. We also know that FIDO Authentication is the only standards-based alternative to PIV for those applications that need protection against phishing attacks. This Executive Order opens the door for agencies to deploy FIDO Authentication — something we’ve heard they’ve wanted to do but have held back as use of any non-PIV authentication has not been permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time the U.S Government has advocated for the use of MFA and strong encryption. In an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights_Actions_to_Counter_Email-Based_Attacks_on_Election-Related_S508C.pdf">advisory</a> issued by CISA in September 2020 on election security, the government agency noted that the majority of cyber-espionage incidents are enabled by phishing, and FIDO security keys are the only form of MFA that offer protection from phishing attacks 100% of the time.</p>



<p>In fact, the U.S. Government hasn’t just been advocating for the use of strong authentication with FIDO, it has actually already been implementing it since at least 2018 on the <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> portal. With <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> the U.S. Government is already offering a secure approach to help citizens and agencies to securely access Federal resources. In June 2019, the FIDO Alliance hosted a <a href="http://www.apple.com">webinar</a> detailing the deployment case study for login.gov, which is now even more timely with the need for agencies to adopt strong authentication in the next 180 days.</p>



<p>Since its inception, the FIDO Alliance has been bringing industry partners together, including every major operating system vendor as well as technology and consumer service providers across all industry verticals including financial services, ecommerce and government. All those diverse groups have been working together in common purpose to standardize strong authentication. Billions of devices around the world today can support FIDO Authentication and are ready to play their part in ensuring a strong authentication future. The fact that most major cloud providers, device manufacturers and browser vendors all ship with support for FIDO means that agencies can easily leverage MFA that is built in, rather than other products that need to be “bolted on.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there is one thing that the recent spate of attacks has served to once again remind us, it’s that the private sector and public sector need strong security measures to protect critical infrastructure — and the FIDO Alliance believes this begins with authentication.</p>



<p>We urge government agencies to adopt only the strongest forms of MFA when complying with this directive. The FIDO Alliance and its members stand ready to serve and help agencies with the education, resources and tools to implement strong authentication to help reduce risk and improve the cybersecurity posture of the U.S. Government.</p>

Headlines such as "<a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-deprecate-the-structured-data-testing-tool-29737.html">Google Structured Data Testing Tool Going Away; SEOs Are Not Happy</a>" captured something of the mood.  <br>  Schema.org started out written only in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">Microdata</a>, before embracing&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/11/using-rdfa-11-lite-with-schemaorg.html">RDFa 1.1 Lite</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2013/06/schemaorg-and-json-ld.html">JSON-LD 1.0</a>. There are now huge amounts of Schema.org data in all of these formats and more (see&nbsp;<a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/#results-2020-1">webdatacommons</a>&nbsp;report). Schema.org endorsed these multiple encodings, because they can each meet different needs and constraints experienced by publishers. The new validator will check all of these formats.  <br>   Amongst all this complexity, it is important to remind ourselves of the importance of simplicity and usability of Schema.org markup for its founding purpose: machine-readable summaries of ordinary web page content. Markup that - when well-formed - helps real people find jobs, educational opportunities, images they can <a href="https://iptc.org/news/schema-org-update-for-better-mapping-to-iptc-photo-metadata/">re-use</a>, learn from fact checkers or find a recipe to cook for dinner.  <br>  This is the focus of the new Schema Markup Validator (SMV). It is simpler than its predecessor SDTT because it is dedicated to checking that you're using JSON-LD, RDFa and Microdata in widely understood ways, and to warning you if you are using Schema.org types and properties in unusual combinations. It does not try to check your content against the information needs of specific services, tools or products (a topic deserving its own blog post). But it will help you understand whether or not your data expresses what you hope it expresses, and to reflect the essence of your structured data back in an intuitive way that reflects its underlying meaning.   <br>  The <a href="http://validator.schema.org">validator.schema.org</a>&nbsp;service&nbsp;is powered by Google's general infrastructure for working with structured data, and is provided to the Schema.org project as a Google-hosted tool. We are also happy to note that many other schema.org-oriented validators are available, both commercial (e.g. <a href="https://yandex.com/support/webmaster/yandex-indexing/validator.html">Yandex's</a>) and opensource. For example, the <a href="http://linter.structured-data.org/">Structured Data Linter,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/playground/">JSON-LD Playground</a>, <a href="https://github.com/semantifyit/sdo-check/">SDO-Check</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/schemarama/">Schemarama</a>&nbsp;tools. We hope that the new Schema Markup Validator will stimulate collaboration among tool makers to improve consistency and developer experience for all those working on systems that consume Schema.org data.&nbsp;  <br>  Please share any feedback with the Schema.org community via <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2790">Github</a>, Twitter (#schemasmv), or the Schema.org W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">community group</a>.

<p>The Sovrin Foundation (“Sovrin”) Board of Trustees and Trust over IP Foundation (“ToIP”) Steering Committee are pleased to announce that they have signed a Letter Agreement (dated March 18, 2021). This agreement signifies the commitment of both organizations to mutual cooperation and recognition for each other’s mandates. Sovrin and ToIP intend to work together toward advancing the infrastructure and governance required for digital trust and digital identity ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By signing this Letter Agreement, Sovrin and ToIP are excited to take a step further to support the need and importance of our separate but interrelated mandates to benefit people and organizations across all social and economic sectors through secure digital identity ecosystems based on verifiable credentials and SSI,” said Chris Raczkowski, Chairman of Board of Trustees, Sovrin Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the agreement, each organization will assign one member to act as a liaison to coordinate and maintain lines of communication, attend plenary sessions, and provide periodic updates to the Sovrin Board of Trustees and ToIP Steering Committee. They will also seek opportunities proactively to exchange information, participate in discussions of shared interest, promote the value of each other’s work through joint announcements and media products, as well as collaborate to achieve their respective mandates.</p>



<p>Sovrin and ToIP both operate in a manner that respects open licensing, open source code and open standards. The organizations agree that their open, public materials will be available for reference (with attribution) by the other.</p>



<p>“ToIP and Sovrin each offer something unique to the market. Our members already collaborate together informally on many topics. Signing this agreement makes our work together more visible and open. It will create new opportunities to collaborate on challenges that affect every layer of our trust model,”&nbsp; said John Jordan, Executive Director of Trust over IP Foundation. “By working together, we want to help solve interoperability problems more quickly and support the adoption of digital trust ecosystems more widely.””&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> Alliance could not be happier to welcome <a href="http://okta.com">Okta</a> to our rapidly growing community of public and private sector organizations that share our commitment to realizing the benefits – and mitigating the risks – of digital ID at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Okta provides a secure, trusted platform for managing the identity of customers and employees. Founded in 2009, Okta currently provides technology to more than 9,400 organizations. Their commitment to the “good ID” agenda and prominent position in the identity and access management sector will make them an invaluable partner for the ID2020 Alliance.</p><p>At Okta’s core is the belief that social impact is foundational to its business and long-term success. <a href="https://www.okta.com/okta-for-good/">Okta for Good</a>, the company’s social impact arm, works to strengthen the links between people, technology, and community. By providing technical solutions for nonprofits, expanding economic opportunities and access to the tech sector, and empowering employees as changemakers, Okta for Good works to ensure that the company lives up to its long-term commitment to maximize benefits to society, the environment, and all of its stakeholders.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to welcome Okta to the ID2020 Alliance,” said executive director, Dakota Gruener. “If properly designed and ethically implemented, digital ID can be the key that unlocks previously inaccessible rights and opportunities for hundreds of millions of people globally. ID2020 and Okta share a common vision; to ensure that those keys are available to everyone.”</blockquote><blockquote>“According to USAID, ‘There may be no single factor that affects a person’s ability to share in the gains of global development as much as having an official identity. That’s why Okta is proud to have recently joined the ID2020 Alliance, a cross-sector effort of global organizations committed to an ethical approach to digital ID,” said Adam Rosenzweig, Senior Manager, Product Impact, “ID2020 plays a critical role in the evolving digital ID ecosystem by convening a diverse set of stakeholders to develop standards for the design and evaluation of digital identity implementations.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Alliance continues to grow, welcoming organizations from the public and private sectors that share our commitment to user-managed privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID. As an Alliance, we are only as strong as our members and we are excited to add Okta to the partnership as we move — together — towards providing good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p>

 A Deep Dive into Five&nbsp;Laws <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/44595d5b-5150-4b26-9c39-be4361d73c7a">Photo</a> by: Mike Licht. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>In March 2021 Russia used the latest in a series of newly passed Internet laws for the <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news73464.htm">first time</a>. The ‘sovereign’ 2019 law was used to throttle Twitter’s speed by 50% on desktops and by 100% on mobile phones. This move was triggered by Twitter’s <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/10/russia-slows-twitter-over-failure-to-remove-content-they-say-is-illegal">non-action</a> in deleting content considered illegal by the Roskomnadzor (RKN), Russia’s federal authority overseeing online and media content. This illegal content included the Twitter accounts of several government critics, such as Mihkail Khodorkovsky. This government action was legitimized through the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50259597">Sovereign Internet law of 2019</a>, which empowers the RKN to respond through appropriate measures to “security threats to the Internet’s functioning inside Russia” such as “changing the configuration/routes of communications/telecommunications.”</p><p>Over the past few years, the Russian Parliament has passed <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/11/01/russias-sovereign-internet-law-comes-into-force-a68002">over fifty pieces of legislation</a> in an attempt to further control and hegemonize the Russian Internet infrastructure, both internally and externally. While the official justification for these laws is to create a more ‘reliable’ internet, in actuality, some of these laws have provided nearly unfettered freedom to the government to preemptively block and filter content and independently — without relying on Internet intermediaries, or on securing prior judicial sanctions.</p><p>This article hopes to shed light on the top five most important of these laws or combination of laws and their consequential effect in crippling Russian democracy, freedom of speech, and privacy&nbsp;rights.</p> Number 1: Laws mandating identification and de-anonymization <p>A <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/addwork/scans.nsf/ID/B6DD5C7F">2017 law</a> and the following <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201811060001?index=2&amp;rangeSize=1?index=2&amp;rangeSize=1">government regulation in 2018</a>, have effectively eliminated any means for Russian citizens to raise their concerns with the government anonymously without the fear of facing backlash. The law has mandated that every user of an online application which can be used for “receiving, transferring, delivering or processing users’ electronic messages on the internet” has to link their account with a registered mobile number so that they can be identified and tracked if need be. Non-compliance by platforms leads to an imposition of a fine amounting to USD 82 for individuals, USD 800 for officials, and USD 16,500 for companies. Per the law, non-compliance may also lead to the blocking of the platform in Russian territory. It is a small respite that at the moment, these laws are only applicable to online messaging platforms, relieving other OSPs from the compulsory linking of accounts for the time&nbsp;being.</p><p>Further, the 2018 regulation, which is yet to be implemented, requires such online messaging applications have to partner with mobile operators to ensure that the latter are willing to confirm the identity of any of its users within twenty minutes of such information being sought. As with most other laws discussed in this article, the penalty for non-compliance is the blocking of the online&nbsp;service.</p><p>This law hits at the heart of an important way in which online communication can foster open dialogue — the ability to stay anonymous, especially when showing dissent. It would also have a major impact on citizens’ ability to express their <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_148270/3d0cac60971a511280cbba229d9b6329c07731f7/">religion</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/09/russia-escalating-persecution-jehovahs-witnesses">faith</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/russian-constitution-change-ends-hopes-gay-marriage-n1233639">sexuality</a>, which have long been penalized by the Russian government.</p> Number 2: The double-edged sword of content moderation laws <p>In 2013, the <a href="https://wilmap.law.stanford.edu/entries/federal-law-no-398-fz-amending-federal-law-information-information-technologies-and">Logovoy Law</a> was passed, which empowered government officials to block content ‘calling for unsanctioned public events that disturb public order’ within 24 hours and without a court order. In 2019, another <a href="https://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/1058572-7">draft law</a>, yet to be passed, would give Russian authorities the ability to block websites that censor Russian state media content. Ironically, the reason that the bill provides for this is that such websites violate Russian citizens’ right to access information.</p><p>In 2019, <a href="https://wilmap.law.stanford.edu/entries/federal-law-no-31-fz-amending-article-153-federal-law-information-information-technologies">four sets of laws</a> were passed that have had the cumulative effect of prohibiting the dissemination of “fake news” and news that is deemed “disrespectful” to the state and government officials. The RKN has the authority to delete such information with immediate effect. The stipulated fine for non-removal amounts to USD 6,400 for individuals and up to USD 24,000 for companies. Repeat offenders “disrespecting” the state could also be imprisoned for up to fifteen days. As a brief aside, the term “disrespectful” being used as a measure for potential jail time brings to mind a 2014 <a href="https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/">judgment</a> of the Indian Supreme Court that held the word “annoyance”, in the same context and for similar penalties, as vague and overbroad.</p><p>In 2020, the <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_372647/">Federal law N482-FZ</a> was passed, which was a sophisticated version of the 2019 draft law discussed above. It essentially penalized OSPs such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter for censoring Russian state media content. For context, there has been substantial research to show that Russian state media spreads disinformation among its citizens and globally. For instance, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/70/5/623/5912109">this</a> paper highlights how RT (formerly, Russia Today) is an “opportunistic channel that is used as an instrument of state defense policy to meddle in the politics of other states”. However, if any of the tech giants censor content like RT’s, they can now be fined or potentially blocked.</p><p>Finally, in January 2021, the Russian parliament has started <a href="https://ria.ru/20210125/blokirovka-1594461448.html">working on a draft law</a> to fine social media for “illegally blocking users”. This move seems to be a consequence of the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">ban</a> on USA former President Donald Trump’s Twitter&nbsp;account.</p> Number 3: Surveillance through laws on forced Data Retention and Data Localisation <p>The 2016 “Yarovaya amendments”, which have been named after their primary author and member of the State Duma (Russian Parliament’s legislative wing), Irina Yarovaya, provides for compulsory retention of all communications for six months. This includes text messages, voice messages, images, and videos. In addition, it also provides that the metadata that marks the location, timestamp, sender, and receiver of the messages, be retained for three years. The amendments also mandate that this data be stored on Russian territory and that the government be given unfettered access to this data without any prior judicial sanction. Since 2016, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook have been penalized for non-compliance. While Twitter and Facebook were <a href="https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/02/13/russian-court-fines-twitter-62-840-dollars-for-refusing-to-localize-user-data">fined</a> approximately USD 50,000 each, the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/17/russia-blocks-access-to-linkedin-over-foreign-held-data">blocked</a> LinkedIn from the Russian territory entirely. Further, in 2019, the fines for non-compliance with data storage requirements have been <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/09/02/fsb-prikaz432-site-dok.html">increased to USD&nbsp;78,000</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the amendments <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/09/02/fsb-prikaz432-site-dok.html">make way</a> for ‘back door’ access to all such data by requiring companies to provide the government with ‘any information necessary’ to decode electronic messages. This drastically weakens the security of such information and weakens encryption measures.</p><p>The Yarovaya amendments requirement to provide a direct and unrestricted back door to access data, coupled with the compulsion to not only localize data but also to retain it for long periods of time effectively means that every conversation/post/discussion can potentially be served on a platter to the Russian government. This is a sticky situation for all involved, but especially for human rights activists, political rights activists, and journalists, such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/30/kremlin-may-be-slowly-killing-alexei-navalny-prison-world-must-not-let-it-happen/">Alexei Navalny</a>, who will be acutely aware that their conversations and metadata, oftentimes confidential, are exposed to the domestic intelligence agencies. This hampers their ability to work and engage in very important and democratic dialogue&nbsp;freely.</p><p>The full implications of such a law were on display in April last year, when the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/13/telegram-loses-free-expression-battle-russian-authorities">RKN blocked Telegram</a>, a messaging app with over 10 million Russian users, for refusing to provide encryption keys to the government. RKN also ordered the <a href="https://usher2.club/en/">blocking of over 18 million IP addresses</a>, used by Telegram to operate in Russia. This led to chaos and affected many legitimate online services including maps, airline booking, and online shopping, among&nbsp;others.</p> Number 4: Laws Banning IP addresses and regulating VPNs and&nbsp;Proxys <p>The various pieces of legislation discussed in this article have been further bolstered by a <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2018/06/05/gosduma-vvela-shtrafy-za-narushenie-zakona-ob-anonimayzerah">2017 law</a> that imposes fines on Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for allowing users access to content banned by Russian authorities or for providing guidance to access such content. In a<a href="https://rg.ru/2017/07/30/fz276-site-dok.html"> bill introduced in 2018</a>, a fine of USD 9,000 was stipulated for non-compliance. This 2018 bill was a result of the above-mentioned ‘Telegram blocking’ incident, after which many <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/39035/">Russians turned to VPNs</a> to be able to continue&nbsp;business</p><p>Further, a <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2019/03/28/roskomnadzor-vpervye-potreboval-ot-vpn-servisov-podklyuchitsya-k-reestru-zapreschennyh-saytov">2019 regulation</a> now requires that VPNs and search engine platforms stay updated with a list of blocked websites maintained by the federal government and on the basis of this list, block access to those websites on their platform.</p> Number 5: Law creating an independent Russian Internet Infrastructure <p>The crown for the most restrictive law proposed by the Russian parliament arguably goes to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50259597">Sovereign Internet Law of 2019</a>. It seems that the Russian government fully understands and fears the extent to which online foreign threats are able to impact domestic outcomes (wonder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/russian-election-hacking">why</a>!). Under the garb of ensuring cybersecurity and preventing the Russian territory from such threats, the Sovereign Internet Law has the effect of putting the entire Russian internet infrastructure in a bubble of sorts. The law legitimizes the ‘<a href="https://medium.com/enrique-dans/understanding-the-splinternet-can-the-world-ever-be-truly-global-97262a60678c">splinternet</a>’ within Russian territory — it provides that at any time that the Russian government sees the need to cut off Russia from the rest of the world, it can take control of this bubble and isolate it from the rest of the world wide web and the global Internet infrastructure.</p><p>While on paper, such a national Internet infrastructure is a reasonable backup plan for “emergencies” to combat any foreign threats, it is left entirely up to the officials to decide what would qualify as such a threat. Hence, the effect of this law will be a complete transfer of control to the Russian government over all aspects of the internet, both content and infrastructure, including, of course, the power to trigger internet shutdowns and removing any content that is deemed undesirable, without any prior judicial authorization.</p><p>This is the first global attempt of its kind. Even China has a firewall that filters parts of the Internet but does not create a separate infrastructure of a ‘national’ Internet. Moreover, China’s introduction to the Internet from the very beginning had been controlled, unlike Russia, which has freely provided Internet access to its citizens over the past few decades. This is an additional reason why the ‘internet bubble’ that the Russian government seeks to create may be a problematic endeavor.</p><p>Even though the law imposes compulsory installation of certain technical equipment and procedures for all OSPs, including deep packet inspections, to enable the “Russian Bubble” infrastructure, technologists also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775366588/russian-law-takes-effect-that-gives-government-sweeping-power-over-internet">argue that this may be technically impossible</a>, somewhat like a situation where one expects the first floor of a building to be filled up with water without the ground floor receiving any water influx at&nbsp;all.</p> Taking stock of this cautionary tale <p>Russia has some of the most disproportionate laws for Internet regulation in the world and maybe that helps explain why it continues to remain ‘<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores">not free</a>’ as per Freedom House’s World Freedom Index 2021. In the same vein, in June 2020, the European Court of Human Rights <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B">found</a> in four separate cases brought against Russia by local media outlets and OSPs that blocking entire websites violates the owners’ right to impart information and the public’s right to receive it. Despite this, Russia has, yet again, threatened to ban Twitter in March&nbsp;2021.</p><p>For Russian citizens, Russia’s web of Internet laws is broken and continues to be one of the most disproportionately restrictive in the world. Moving forward, it is imperative that laws restricting a citizens’ right to freedom of speech and/or their right to privacy be weighed against the important and age-old principles carved under human rights instruments such as the <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights </a>and the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>. It is not hard to guess what would become of the five-set of laws discussed above if this measure was truly upheld in each of them — they would, without a doubt, either cease to exist or become a lot less restrictive.</p><p>Finally, a fact and a thought — Of the three national broadcasting channels in Russia, the government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17840134">holds over 51% share</a> in one and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17840134">directly runs </a>the parent companies of the other two. It has also recently introduced <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_169740/3d0cac60971a511280cbba229d9b6329c07731f7/#dst100009">a law</a> reducing the permissible percentage of foreign ownership in print media from 50% to 20%. This makes the state’s objective very clear — complete control over public narrative along with unfettered surveillance abilities.</p><p>It is worth thinking if this could be a cautionary tale that is potentially paving a misguided path for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21273191/trump-twitter-social-media-censorship-executive-order-analysis-bias">other countries</a> and for other world leaders, whose objective is abject control over the narrative in their country, both online and&nbsp;offline.</p><p>_____________________________</p><p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

 Until AI has completely eliminated human biases, can its results be considered any more trustworthy than a&nbsp;human’s? <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59202267@N08/39225139155">Photo</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59202267@N08">Electronic_Frontier_Foundation</a>: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>Facial recognition technology is becoming more powerful and more ubiquitous seemingly every day. In January 2021, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79310-1">study</a> found that a facial recognition algorithm could be better at deducing a person’s political orientation than a human judgment or a personality test. Similarly, earlier this week, the Dubai airport rolled out technology through which an <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/middle-east/the-future-is-coming-at-dubai-airport-passengers-identity-confirmed-by-iris-scans-20210308-p578mx.html">iris-scanner would verify one’s identity</a> and eliminate the need for any human interaction when entering or exiting the&nbsp;country.</p><p>The use of facial recognition by law enforcement agencies has become common practice, despite increasing reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html">false arrests</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html">jail time</a>. While there are various downsides to facial recognition technology being used at all, including fears of mass surveillance and invasion of privacy, there are flaws within facial recognition technologies themselves that lead to inaccurate results. One such major challenge for this still-burgeoning technology is gender-based inaccuracies.</p><p>Research has indicated that women are 18% more likely to be misidentified through facial recognition than men. One line of <a href="https://medium.com/@Joy.Buolamwini/response-racial-and-gender-bias-in-amazon-rekognition-commercial-ai-system-for-analyzing-faces-a289222eeced">research found that</a> while Amazon’s Rekognition software’s ability to recognize white women’s faces was down to 92.9%, a darker-skinned woman’s recognition would only be 68.9% accurate. Similarly, a study conducted at the University of Washington revealed that a facial recognition tool was <a href="http://markyatskar.com//publications/bias.pdf">68% more likely to predict that an image of a person cooking in the kitchen is that of a woman</a>. These are clear patterns exhibiting sexism in AI and the use of such technologies for law enforcement is likely to disproportionately affect marginalized groups of people, including genders other than male and&nbsp;female.</p><p>It is true that once a leap in technology has been made, hoping to be able to wipe it off the face of the earth may be a little like trying to put a genie back in a bottle. A more probable step in the right direction could be to first, feed representative and better data sets to AIs, and second, deploy the technology only with substantial democratic oversight.</p><p>Data scientists at the MIT Media Lab have <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212">noted</a> that in the instances where they have trained AI with more diverse data, the accuracy of the results has been less discriminatory and accurate. Hence, presenting AI with a diverse representation of datasets for it to learn from would be a great start in reversing the prevalent biases. Additionally, these technologies would also benefit if the providers of the facial recognition software are transparent about its underlying workings.</p><p>This transparency, if accompanied with democratic oversight regarding the application, could potentially aim at striking a better balance as to when, where, how and to what end facial recognition may be used. For example, such oversight could be in the form of regulations that set an industry standard that an AI must meet before its commercial application. However, regardless of how many leaps facial recognition takes in the coming years, a serious, deliberate discussion is necessary for determining whether facial recognition should be used by law enforcement at all. This is because the consequences of error are so grave. The European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/artificial-intelligence">will release </a>its first legislative proposal later this year and it will be interesting to see how the proposal will attempt to regulate AI application.</p><p>Former UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye’s <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/un-special-rapporteur-report-artificial-intelligence-impact-human-rights/">warning</a> that AI will enforce bias is more pertinent now than ever before. However, until the day that AI has completely eliminated human biases, can its results be considered any more trustworthy than a&nbsp;human’s?</p><p>About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

In short, if you are a DIF member and have someone in mind who should help DIF's governing board send their name and email to <a href="mailto:nominations@identity.foundation">nominations@identity.foundation</a></p>
 DIF Grants 
<p>The DIF has officially launched a lightweight mini-grant program so that members (or the Steering Committee itself) can directly and transparently incentivize community contributions like editorship of a spec or implementations of specs. For more information, see our <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/introducing-dif-grants/">new blog</a>.</p>
 Killer Whale Jello Bowl Death Match Redux: The Reckoning 
<p>At #IIW32, a mammoth and consequential conversation spanned 4 intense, jam-packed sessions and set new highs for IIW session-name silliness culminating in a massive interoperability watershed and widespread buy-in from many communities! The details of what gets built are being worked out in a <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">new work item</a> of the Claims &amp; Credentials WG, building on the recent donation to DIF of the Bloom WACI extension to Presentation Exchange. The goal is both a minimum viable implementable spec for cross-stack credential exchange ("v0.1 scope"), and a longer-term commitment to a more fully-featured iteration of the same spec ("v1 scope"). Stay tuned!</p>

 Breaking changes in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/pull/277">DID Core JSON-LD</a> context
 
 Strictly speaking, all UR DID method implementations are now broken. 
 Discussion around changing JSON-LD contexts, caching, versioning, hashlinks 
 UR could implement a "fixing layer" for a transitional period, and simultaneously try to motivate implementers to fix their drivers. 
 
 
 Universal Resolver policy questions about <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/issues/186">driver submission and maintenance</a>
 
 UR currently supports several DID methods that are not in the DID spec registries. 
 Probably DIF should have stricter policies going forward (e.g. only accept drivers for DID methods in the W3C method registry)

Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>The current&nbsp;context</p><p>Last summer, the protests and demonstrations that erupted across the country in response to the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and too many others prompted many funders, including Omidyar Network, to think more critically about our role within a system that perpetuates racial injustice. We wanted to determine ways in which we could use our power and privilege to contribute to dismantling white supremacy (you can read more about our commitments <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/an-investment-in-justice-bad462284f27">here</a>).</p><p>While criminal justice and policing reform is not one of our focus areas at Omidyar Network, there is a close link between economic injustice and racial violence, which is why we called out the need to build an explicitly anti-racist and inclusive economy as the second pillar upholding our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">reimagined vision for capitalism.</a> It is impossible to build a more just and equitable economy without directly addressing the ways in which our existing economy was intentionally designed to uphold white supremacy by excluding people from opportunities to participate fully in markets based on their race — not to mention gender, class, nationality, disability, and other forms of human diversity.</p><p>Our conviction in the necessity of this pillar has only been compounded by the evidence of the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>In the six weeks that it has taken to write and edit this piece, there have been two mass shootings in Atlanta and Indianapolis that targeted Asian Americans. Police officers killed 20-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/daunte-wright-death-minnesota.html">Daunte Wright</a> in Minnesota, 13-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/us/adam-toledo-chicago-police-shooting.html">Adam Toledo</a> in Chicago, and 16-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/us/makhia-bryant.html">Ma’Khia Bryant</a> in Ohio. A ceaseless drumbeat of violence and trauma continue unabated, with only a glimmer of accountability in the trial and <a href="https://omidyar.com/statement-from-omidyar-network-on-derek-chauvin-verdict-the-first-step-to-justice/">conviction of Derek Chauvin</a> for the murder of George&nbsp;Floyd.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pandemic has exposed the extent to which the prejudices of the past remain embedded in the institutions and systems that we rely on today — to disastrous effect.</p><p>During the initial wave of the pandemic, many spoke of COVID as a great equalizer — a universal threat indifferent to our race, nationality, or class. Yet it quickly became clear that, although the virus itself cannot discriminate, our healthcare and economic structures certainly can and do. Every aspect of the pandemic and our healthcare response was impacted by race. The virus itself spread more quickly in communities of color, and took a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/racial-ethnic-disparities/disparities-illness.html">greater toll</a> on welfare and lives. Meanwhile, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-neighborhoods-access-covid-19-testing-sites-analysis/story?id=71884719">COVID tests</a> and <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200716.620294/full/">lifesaving PPE</a> were more readily available in white neighborhoods at the beginning of the pandemic — and many of these inequities persist.</p><p>The effects of the economic recession are similarly shaped by race. As new data from our recent <a href="https://www.gallup.com/education/267590/great-jobs-report.aspx">Great Jobs survey with Gallup confirms</a>, Black, Latinx, and Asian-American and Pacific Islander workers are <a href="https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-Frontline-Workers.pdf">over-represented in essential, frontline industries</a> such as health care, transportation, and retail, causing them to face greater risk of COVID exposure. Even as our economy has inched toward recovery, Black and Latinx workers, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/black-and-hispanic-women-arent-sharing-in-the-job-market-recovery.html">and especially women</a>, are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-unemployment-race/gap-in-u-s-black-and-white-unemployment-rates-is-widest-in-five-years-idUSKBN2431X7">regaining their jobs much more slowly than their white counterparts</a>. Meanwhile, women, <a href="https://nwlc.org/resources/all-of-the-jobs-lost-in-december-were-womens-jobs/">and especially women of color</a>, were both more likely to lose their job or find it necessary to dedicate their time exclusively to unpaid care work, <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/covid-19-widens-gender-gap-labor-force-participation">erasing decades of gains in women’s labor force participation</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/10/30/492582/covid-19-sent-womens-workforce-progress-backward/">wages</a>.</p><p>These inequalities were not inevitable. Rather, this uneven toll stands as a physical manifestation of our history, etched into our society with every job, home, and life lost. An enduring lesson from this pandemic must be that, even when we face a threat like a virus that cannot intentionally discriminate between us, the institutional and cultural legacies that we have inherited from past efforts to purposefully divide us will ensure that our experiences are unequal and&nbsp;unjust.</p><p>A long legacy of exclusion</p><p>This persistence of social disparities should surprise no one, since intentional exclusion has long been the norm in the United States. For centuries, the power to shape our laws, government, markets, culture, and biases has been restricted by race, gender, and class. Varied forms of exclusion — from slavery and disenfranchisement to imprisonment, institutionalization, and deportation — have been justified by those in power (predominantly white men) in order to concentrate the benefits of American prosperity into their own hands. Acts — and threats — of physical violence against people of color have played a central role in upholding this dynamic, echoes of which we have seen play out in the violent snapshots of police brutality across the country&nbsp;today.</p><p>America’s history of racial exclusion has been integral to shaping our economy, denying people of color the opportunity to profit and accumulate wealth from their own contributions to our economy. The earliest form of American capitalism was one that enriched white Americans who stole land from Native Americans and labor from enslaved Black people. Later iterations of our economy not only permitted racial discrimination, but also exempted employers in sectors with a majority Black or Latinx labor force (namely agriculture, hospitality, and domestic services) from legal requirements to provide a minimum wage, workplace protections, and benefits. Meanwhile, developers, city planners, and the real estate industry redlined Black families into homes and communities with limited job opportunities, few financial service providers, and failing infrastructure. All of these systems were created with the intent of perpetuating white economic supremacy, and, in many cases, remain the foundation of the economy we experience today.</p><p>These patterns of economic marginalization and exploitation are crucial to maintaining power imbalances. Robbing people of the ability to accumulate wealth is tantamount to robbing them of the ability to accumulate power. After all, people without savings find it more difficult to change jobs, to choose where or with whom to live, or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/01/08/the-politics-of-financial-insecurity-a-democratic-tilt-undercut-by-low-participation/">to contribute time and money to politics.</a> And those robbed of their wealth have less to pass on to their children, thereby perpetuating this theft of opportunity across generations.</p><p>In recent decades, efforts to intentionally exclude people of color, and especially Black Americans, from participating in the markets and accumulating wealth and power may have been less overt, but not less effective. For the past fifty years, we have relied on markets to solve our social problems, even though markets are mechanisms in which people with existing wealth and assets use investments to gain even more wealth and assets. Superimposed over an unequal society, free markets can only exacerbate those inequalities. Meanwhile, many of those in power have worked to weaken the very institutions — government, labor unions, our social safety net — that could mitigate these market imbalances.</p><p>Supporting organizations working to build an anti-racist economy</p><p>Omidyar Network is committed to building an economy that is explicitly anti-racist and inclusive. An economy which simultaneously rejects the justifications for racism and consciously works to remove the structures of our society that perpetuate racial injustice. We are working toward a society where everyone has the power and ability to live the life of their choosing — free to choose their job, choose where they will live, choose how to invest their time and resources, and choose who represents them in government.</p><p>A first step toward achieving this vision is to correct the power imbalances that prevent people of color from have a voice in how the economy impacts them. That’s why we support <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/">Action Center on Race and the Economy (ACRE)</a>, an organization that provides support to groups on the ground campaigning for structural change of, and increased accountability from, the financial sector. ACRE helps grassroots organizations identify the ways in which the financial sector contributes to such challenges as <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/issues/health-care/">healthcare</a>, housing, the <a href="https://fuelingthefire.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PWF_fossilfuelreport_WEB.pdf">environment</a>, and <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/issues/policing-and-incarceration/">policing and incarceration</a>. During the pandemic, ACRE was part of a coalition that supported the <a href="https://westriketogether.org/">We Strike Together campaign</a>, using rent and mortgage strikes to secure relief for renters during the&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://communitychange.org/">Community Change</a>, represents networks of local organizations building power with people of color so they have a say in policies that impact their lives. Its <a href="https://communitychange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CC_Path-to-Power-2019-doc.pdf">strategy</a> includes efforts to strengthen organizing infrastructure in communities of color, and to increase their influence and develop new models of sustainable, volunteer-led community organizations.</p><p>A second task is to address the ways that existing economic rules perpetuate exclusion, either by changing policies or finding innovative ways to work around an unjust system. One of our partners, <a href="https://www.domesticworkers.org/">National Domestic Workers Alliance</a>(NDWA), advocates on behalf of the 2.5 million nannies, house cleaners, and care workers across the country, most of whom are women, especially Black, Latinx, Native, and Asian American Pacific Island women. During the pandemic, NDWA <a href="https://domesticworkers.org/coronavirus-care-fund">distributed $400 in emergency support</a> to more than 40,000 domestic workers who had lost their jobs during the lockdowns, and helped successfully advocate for the American Jobs Plan to include a $400 billion dollar investment in care&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>Finally, we must weed out and uproot all remaining vestiges of the ideas used to justify exclusion and division, and help new ideas take root. That’s why we support the work of academics, researchers, and other movement and thought leaders who study the stratifications of our economy and propose pathways forward. Most notably, we have worked closely with Professor <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/milano/faculty/darrick-hamilton/">Darrick Hamilton</a> of The New School, a leading economist whose work explores the ways that existing systems perpetuate racial inequality and offers proposals — such as baby bonds or a federal job guarantee — to make the future economy more equitable. We also support the work of <a href="https://www.demos.org/">Demos</a>, a think tank for race-forward progressive policy ideas and an advocacy network that aims to increase the power that communities of color have over economic decisions. It has, for example, designed a platform of policies for <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/economic-justice/climate-equity">equitably addressing the climate crisis</a> and expanding the availability of <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/economic-justice/debt-free-college">debt-free college</a>. Demos is also releasing a number of <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/covid-19-racial-justice">policy proposals to ensure that our pandemic recovery brings us closer to a more democratic and inclusive economy</a>. We believe it is imperative that these ideas are not cordoned off in think tanks or academic institutions, but rather shaped in partnership with those communities that are most impacted — building a ladder from the grassroots all the way up the ivory&nbsp;tower.</p><p>Far from being a time of solidarity and common endurance, this past year exposed a whole host of enduring racial injustices. Our institutions, built on foundations of intentional exclusion, deepened and perpetuated divisions built on old biases and hatreds, that have been nourished for centuries. However, even as the country witnessed the devastation of the pandemic — layered over the continued translation of hate into outright violence against people of color — many responded by joining the movement for racial&nbsp;justice.</p><p>The incredible work of our Reimagining Capitalism grantees is setting a course to build power with communities of color, rewrite the rules that have privileged white and wealthy people for so long, and reshape our ideas of racial justice and&nbsp;equity.</p><p>As America rebuilds, it is the mutual responsibility of funders to be anti-racist in rectifying the consequences of centuries of systemic racism that have robbed communities of color of their wealth, power, and rights, and to ensure that the economic system that is rebuilt supports an inclusive society in which everyone can live with dignity and&nbsp;thrive.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-an-anti-racist-and-inclusive-economy-36fc79ab5cbc">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Building an Anti-Racist and Inclusive Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Conformance Testing for Measurable Goals</p><p>[Written in consultation with the Interoperability Working Group chairs]</p><p>A recurring topic in the Interoperability Working Group is that of defining short-, medium- and long-term goals or “targets” for interoperability. The topic comes up again every few months, and each time it does, the chairs try to tackle it head-on for a full meeting or two, some emails, and various off-line discussions, but doing so never seems to arrive at a satisfactory or definitive answer. Each time, what feels a Herculean outlay of effort only gets us a tentative resolution, as if we’d deflected a debt collector with a minimum payment. Dear reader, we would like to refinance, or at least restructure, this debt to our community!</p><p>In this <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets-2/">two-part</a> overview of our goals for 2021, we would like to survey the landscape of “provable,” testable interoperability targets and give some guidance on what we would like to see happen next in the testable interop world. Then, in a companion article, we will lay out clear proposal for parallel, distributed work on multiple fronts, such that progress can be distributed across various subcommunities and hubs of open cooperation, each reasonably confident that they are helping the big picture by “zooming in” on one set of problems. &nbsp;</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christopherphigh">Christopher Paul High</a> A seemingly uncontroversial target state <p>Interoperation is a deceptively transparent etymology: any two things that perform a function are inter-operating if they can perform their operation together and mutually. Two fax machines interoperate if one sends a fax and the other receives it, which is a far more impressive feat if the two machines in question were designed and built by different companies on different continents, fifteen years apart. This is the kind of target state people usually have in mind when they imagine interoperability for an emerging technology.</p><p>This everyday example glosses over a lot of complexity and history, however. Standards bodies had already specified exact definitions of how the “handshake” is established between two unfamiliar fax machines before either model of fax machine was a twinkle in a design team’s eye. In addition to all the plodding, iterative standardization, there has also been a lot of economic trial and error and dead-ends we never heard about. &nbsp;Even acceptable margins of error and variance from the standards have been prototyped, refined, socialized, and normalized, such that generations of fax machines have taken them to heart, while entire factories have been set up to produce standard components like white-label fax chips and fax boards that can be used by many competing brands. On a software level, both design teams probably recycled some of the same libraries and low-level code, whether open-source or licensed.</p><p>Decomposing this example into its requirements at various levels shows how many interdependent and complex subsystems have to achieve internal maturity and sustainable relationships. A time-honored strategy is to treat each of these subsystems in a distinct, parallel maturation process and combine them gradually over time. The goal, after all, is not a working whole, but a working ecosystem. &nbsp;Architectural alternatives, for example, have to be debated carefully, particularly for disruptive and emerging technologies that redistribute power within business processes or ecosystems. Sharing (or better yet, responsibly open-sourcing and governing) common software libraries and low-level hardware specifications is often a “stitch in time” that saves nine later stitches, since it gives coordinators a stable baseline to work from, sooner.</p><p>Naturally, from even fifty or a hundred organizations committed to this target state, a thousand different (mostly sensible) strategies can arise. “How to proceed?” becomes a far-from-trivial question, even when all parties share many common goals and incentives. For instance, almost everyone:</p>  Wants to grow the pie of adoption and market interest  Holds privacy and decentralization as paramount commitments  Strives to avoid repeating the mistakes and assumptions of previous generations of internet technology  <p>And yet, all the same… both strategic and tactical differences arise, threatening to entrench themselves into camps or even schools of thought. How to achieve the same functional consensus on strategy as we have on principles? Our thesis here is that our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.</p> Today’s test suites and interoperability profiles <p>Perhaps the biggest differences turn out not to be about target state or principles, but about what exactly “conformance” means relative to what has already been specified and standardized. Namely, the core specifications for DIDs and VCs are both data models written in the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), which put protocols out of scope. This stems partly from the decisions of the groups convened in the W3C, and partly from a classic division of labor in the internet standards world between W3C, which traditionally governs the data models of web browser and servers, &nbsp;and a distinct group, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p><p>VCs were specified first, with a preference (but not a requirement) for DIDs, with exact parameters for DIDs and DID systems deferred to a separate data model. &nbsp;Then, to accommodate entrenched and seemingly irreconcilable ideas about how DIDs could best be expressed, the DID data model was made less representationally-explicit and turned into an abstract data model. This shift to a representation-agnostic definition of DIDs, combined with the still-tentative and somewhat representation-specific communication and signing protocols defined to date, makes truly agnostic and cross-community data model conformance somewhat difficult to test. This holds back interoperability (and objective claims to conformance)!</p> W3C: Testing the core specifications <p>The only test suite associated with the core W3C specifications is the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/tree/main/packages/vc-http-api-test-server">VC-HTTP-API test suite </a>for VC data model conformance and the fledgling <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">DID-core test suite</a>, both worked on in the W3C-CCG. The former tests implementations of VC-handling systems against some pre-established sample data and test scripts through a deliberately generalized API interface that strives to be minimally opinionated with respect to context- and implementation-specific questions like API authentication. The latter is still taking shape, given that the DID spec has been very unstable in the home stretch of its editorial process arriving at CR this last week.</p><p>The VC-HTTP-API interface, specified collectively by the first <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">SVIP</a> funding cycle cohort for use in real-world VC systems, has been used in some contexts as a de facto general-purpose architecture profile, even if it is very open-ended on many architectural details traditionally specified in government or compliance profiles. &nbsp;Its authors and editors did not intend it to be the general-purpose profile for the VC data model generally, but in the absence of comparable alternatives, it is sometimes taken as one; it has perhaps taken on more of a definitive role than originally intended. </p><p>Following the second iteration of the SVIP program and the expansion of the cohort, the API and its test suite are poised to accrue features and coverage to make it more useful outside of its original context. Core participants have established a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/">weekly public call</a> at the CCG and a lively re-scoping/documentation process is currently underway to match the documentation and rationale documents to the diversity of contexts deploying the API.</p> Aries: End-to-end conformance testing <p>Other profiles, like the Aries interoperability profile, serve an important role, but it would be misleading to call it a VC data model test suite-- it is more like an end-to-end test harness for showing successful implementation of the Aries protocols and architecture. Here “interoperability” means interoperability with other Aries systems, and conformance with the shared Aries interpretation of the standard VC data model and the protocols this community has defined on the basis of that interpretation. </p><p>Many matters specified by the W3C data model are abstracted out or addressed by shared libraries in Ursa, so its scope is not exactly coterminous with the W3C data model. Instead, the Aries interoperability profile has its own infrastructural focus, which focuses on scaling the privacy guarantees of blockchain-based ZKP systems. In many ways, this focus complements rather than supplants that of the W3C test suites. </p><p>Many of the trickiest questions on which SSI systems differ are rooted in what the Aries and Trust-over-IP communities conceptualize as “<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack">layer 2</a>,” the connective infrastructural building-blocks connecting end-users to VCs and DIDs. As more and more features get added to be testable across language implementations, and as feature-parity is achieved with other systems (such as <a href="https://youtu.be/LC0OXAir3Qw">support for LD VCs</a>), the case for productive complementarity and deep interoperability gets easier and easier to make.</p> The first wave of local profiles and guidelines <p>Other specifications for decentralized-identity APIs and wallets, modelled on that W3C CCG and/or extending the work of Aries-based infrastructures, are starting to crop up around the world. &nbsp;So far these have all arisen out of ambitious government-funded programs to build infrastructure, often with an eye to local governance or healthy competition. Canada and the European Commission are the most high-profile ones to date, building on earlier work in Spain, the UK, and elsewhere; Germany and other countries funding next-generation trust frameworks may soon follow suit. </p><p>It is important, however, to avoid framing these tentative, sometimes cautious attempts at bridging status quo and new models as universal standards. If anything, these frameworks tend to come with major caveats and maturity disclaimers, on top of having carefully narrowed scopes. &nbsp;After all, they are generally the work of experienced regulators, inheriting decades of work exploring identity and infrastructural technologies through a patchwork of requirements and local profiles that tend to align over time. If they are designed with enough circumspection and dialogue, conformance with one should never make conformance with another impossible. (The authors would here like to extend heartfelt sympathy to all DIF members currently trying to conform to multiple of these at once!) </p><p>These profiles test concrete and specific interpretations of a shared data model that provide a testing benchmark for regulatory “green lighting” of specific implementations and perhaps even whole frameworks. Particularly when they specify best practices or requirements for security and API design, they create testable standardization by making explicit their opinions and assumptions about:</p>  approved cryptography,  auditing capabilities,  privacy requirements, and  API access/authentication   <p>These will probably always differ and make a universal abstraction impossible; and that’s not a bad thing! These requirements are always going to be specific to each regulatory context, and without them, innovation (and large-scale investment) are endangered by regulatory uncertainty. Navigating these multiple profiles is going to be a challenge in the coming years, as more of them come online and their differences come into relief as a stumbling block for widely-interoperable protocols with potentially global reach. </p><p>The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details. </p>

 A progress update on implementing decentralized SLAs and the EWT Escrow&nbsp;Model <p>At the end of February our CEO Walter Kok laid out the concept of a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">decentralized SLA </a>and how it will form the basis of a new type of service-level agreement (SLA) for enterprises and vendors alike. Unlike a traditional, bilateral SLA, a DSLA approach is inherently distributed and establishes multilateral trust that the services will be delivered according to the agreement. This new type of business and technical architecture will enable very transparent reporting on the actual, real-world service&nbsp;quality.</p><p>We see the DSLA as an important aspect of the Utility Layer of the Energy Web tech stack. The Utility Layer comprises a variety of ‘digital machinery’ (i.e., services) that power the dApps running on the Energy Web Chain. That’s why we unveiled the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/the-energy-transition-is-at-stake-ec9f4ececd85">EWT Escrow Model</a>, as a way to unlock the full potential of the Energy Web tech stack to achieve the delivery of a decentralized service operation and its objectives. The EWT Escrow Model allows for both Providers (i.e., vendors providing Utility Layer services) and Patrons (e.g., community members who may stake some amount of EWT in support).</p><p>The entire process leverages <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">EW Switchboard</a> to manage DIDs and roles for Customers, Providers, and&nbsp;Patrons.</p><p>Our goal is to launch the first Utility Layer services, complete with escrow and subscriptions, in production by Q3 2021. Between then and now, we’re aiming for a several key milestones, including: a) an alpha release on our testnet, Volta (this is when Patrons will be able to test an early version of the Escrow Model); b) a beta release on the Energy Web Chain; and c) scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.</p><p>If you’ve watched our pipeline of major announcements and initiatives in recent weeks and months, you know that the Energy Web team and the broader ecosystem have been incredibly busy. But we’ve also been making progress on the EWT Escrow Model, and are excited to share this update with&nbsp;you.</p><p>SPOILER ALERT: DEAR PATRONS AND PROVIDERS, STAKING IS STILL COMING AND Q3 IS STILL A REALISTIC TARGET.</p> We finalized the architecture, designed the UI, and got the resources (almost) in&nbsp;place… <p>The picture below lays out the architecture of the decentralized service operations. It breaks down into four important blocks: 1) Customer Tasks (consuming the service, in green), 2) Provider Tasks (delivering the service, in yellow), 3) The Watchtower (monitoring and reporting on the service operations, in red), and 4) Governance Tasks (smart contracts executing the DSLAs, in&nbsp;blue).</p><p>And yes, there at the top are the Patrons, who can stake together with their service provider of choice. Let’s get into a little bit more&nbsp;detail.</p> THE SERVICE PROVIDER AND THE&nbsp;PATRON <p>Service Providers (“Providers”) are organizations that operate Utility Layer service nodes. In order to become a qualified Provider, an organization must pass a basic KYC check and deposit a minimum balance of EWT into an escrow smart contract for a multi-year period. Once qualified, Providers can launch service nodes by depositing an incremental amount of EWT in escrow and claim they are ready to deliver the service. The Watchtower will validate the claim (more on the Watchtower below). The following animation shows the User Interface we have developed so far to onboard Service Providers and&nbsp;Patrons:</p><p>To meet the minimum escrow balance requirement, Providers can either acquire the necessary EWT themselves or accept EWT from external Patrons in the wider community. As long as Providers deliver services in accordance with the prescribed rules, they will earn a stable income on their deposited EWT.</p> THE CUSTOMER <p>Customers follow an onboarding process similar to that of Providers. We want the system to be trustless, so the Providers (and Patrons) need to be assured that the Customer will pay for the service once it has been delivered. So basically, they put their pre-payments into escrow, too. Once the Customer claims that they are ready to consume services, the Watchtower will also validate this claim. The following animation shows the user interface we have developed so far to onboard customers and how they can choose the services and SLAs they want to&nbsp;consume:</p> THE WATCHTOWER AND GOVERNANCE TASKS <p>The Watchtower will be a similar decentralized architecture as the one we deploy for the validators of the Energy Web Chain. Watchtower nodes will also follow the Proof-of-Authority consensus algorithm. They are trusted entities, similar to our validators (we expect a subset of our validators to also run a Watchtower node).</p><p>Each Watchtower will validate the claim of readiness from both Provider and Customer and individually report on it. The smart contract (part of the governance tasks) will move both to the operational status when there is consensus amongst the Watchtowers. The services are now ready to be delivered and consumed and all the Watchtowers will start to monitor the actual performance. When it is their turn, they will measure and publish their results individually. Again, the consensus algorithm will ensure a decision of the actual performance for the interval, taking all scores into&nbsp;account.</p><p>We expect that these intervals will aggregate to a daily / weekly Service Level Score. Then depending on the Service Level Agreement, the payment / slashing logic will kick in. The necessary evidence will be stored on the Energy Web Chain so that at any time it can be accessed (taking into account privacy preserving requirements, etc.).</p> So what can you expect&nbsp;next.. <p>Looking ahead at the coming months, we’re forging ahead with the schedule we laid out in the original EWT Escrow Model&nbsp;article:</p>  In May 2021, we will conduct an alpha release of escrow and subscription tools on our testnet Volta. This is when our Patrons will be able to early test the staking&nbsp;feature.  In June and July 2021, we will conduct a beta release of escrow and service components on the Energy Web Chain (EWC), with an initial cohort of Service Providers from the EWC validator community.  Throughout the remainder of the year, we will focus on scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.  <p>Expect to continue to hear from Energy Web over the coming months. If you have questions or ideas, drop us a note in the comments below! To stay up to date with the latest information, follow us on Twitter or join our Telegram community.</p><p>The EWT Escrow Model is closer than ever to becoming a reality — including the 10–20% return on deposited EWT we mentioned when we first announced the Escrow Model. We are now seeing a convergence of positive developments: major projects deploying on the Energy Web tech stack in partnership with our members, a robust community around EWT, and a stronger-than-ever appetite for digital solutions that address the urgent climate challenge. We continue to act our way into new thinking&nbsp;indeed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/acting-our-way-into-new-thinking-85fb79b1970a">Acting our way into new thinking…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland—29 April 2021 — Today Energy Web announced that the <a href="https://shareandcharge.com/">Share&amp;Charge Foundation</a> has become a part of the global nonprofit. In March 2020, Share&amp;Charge <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/share-charge-foundation-launches-open-charging-network-on-energy-web-chain-84af7f6f5b3c">launched its Open Charging Network</a> (OCN) on the Energy Web Chain. Share&amp;Charge’s OCN is a decentralized e-roaming solution for seamless electric vehicle (EV) charging across different charge point networks. Today’s announcement makes the Share&amp;Charge team an extension of Energy Web’s core team, while the OCN becomes more tightly integrated with the EW tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>“In the global energy transition, EVs are one of the fastest-growing segments, with customers investing trillions in all-electric cars and trucks, while automakers, charge point operators, and utilities are investing heavily in charging infrastructure,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “EVs sit at the intersection of several major use cases for open-source digital technology like the Energy Web tech stack. Giving EVs self-sovereign identities enables them to easily and efficiently register in energy markets to provide services to grid operators. They’re a major new source of demand for renewable energy. And it will become increasingly important to track their batteries throughout their lifecycle, in alignment with regulations around the world. Bringing Share&amp;Charge into the Energy Web family better prepares us to support the coming e-mobility future.”</p><p>Share&amp;Charge will continue to operate as an independent brand, although it will now do so in closer alignment with the Energy Web team and strategy. “This is an exciting transition for Share&amp;Charge and we are happy to be joining forces with EW,” said Dietrich Sümmermann, chair of the Share&amp;Charge Foundation board. “As more and more companies join Energy Web and its global ecosystem, we stand ready to support seamless e-roaming as EVs become the dominant form of mobility in the decades&nbsp;ahead.”</p><p>Energy Web is working together with the OCN community through already-established channels — both supporting the current OCN and the development of a DID-based OCN 2.0. Stay tuned for more on this&nbsp;front.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/share-charge-becomes-a-part-of-energy-web-33fbffc5f3a4">Share&amp;Charge Becomes a Part of Energy Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Lightweight micro-grants to further the DIF mission <br></p><p>DIF is kicking off a program to administer narrowly-scoped financial support for community initiatives, ranging in format from grants to more competitive implementation bounties, hackathon-style open collaborations, and security reviews. Although the complexity and number of stakeholders involved will naturally vary, all of these bounties will all be structured around public “challenges” that directly reward efforts helpful to the community as a whole. </p><p>Each of these challenges will culminate in a library-, repository-, or narrow specification-sized donation that closes interoperability gaps, generates usable documentation, or solving other tooling and data problems that move the decentralized identity needle. These could be signature suites, libraries, toolkits, or even detailed tutorials and implementation guides. </p><p>Prompts for whitepapers or non-normative implementation guides are harder to define in testable terms, but still welcome; one way of defining them is by listing a significant, finite set of input documents (such as specifications and regulatory profiles) and defining success as simple, useful documentation incorporates all their prescriptions and limitations.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jchatelain">Julien Chatelain</a><p>To make the awarding of these grants as objective and non-controversial as possible, we will be administering them in the form of technically-specified “challenges” that break down into specific, testable criteria. Submissions will be defined as donations to DIF that meet some or all of the criteria of a given challenge; the Technical Steering Committee will administer the adjudication of testing submissions against challenges.</p><p>Grant money can be offered directly from DIF’s budget by decision of the DIF’s governing board (the Steering Committee) and/or offered by a member company and approved by the SC. The donator of the grant funds can choose a specific WG or combination of WGs to specify and fine-tune the challenge. These WGs work with the Technical Steering Committee to ratify successful completion and authorize release of funds once a conforming donation has been received.</p> FAQ for DIF Grants:  Who can offer a Grant?<br>
Any DIF member and/or the DIF Steering Committee can offer a grant (or matching funds) as long as the scope of the challenge benefits the entire DIF community. DIF SC will review grant requests before the challenge is prepared and published. 
Who writes the challenge?<br>
Grants challenges are written by the chairs and/or the members of the WG chosen by the donors to administer the grant. The WG is responsible for writing a challenge acceptable to the SC and the grantor. WG chairs should submit the challenge at least one week before the deadline for Grantor approval (aka “go/no go decision”), to allow for fine-tuning or negotiation of terms.
What makes a good challenge?<br>
A good challenge is testable to make the decision about its success objective rather than subjective, and it should include its own testable definition of success and, where appropriate, usable test fixtures.<br><br>
<p>A good challenge also serves the broader community equally (for instance, not just JWT-, LD-, or Aries-based systems). A challenge should not favor any given commercial product (or infrastructure such as specific blockchains) substantially over others, and care should be taken to think through what the “equivalences” or counterparties are if a challenge comes from a specific community, credential format, etc.</p>
 Who can submit and who reviews it?<br>
Participation is open for the broad community (no prior DIF membership is required), but submissions will only be considered upon donation to the challenge-owning DIF WG. The donation should be “clean IP,” i.e. comprised entirely of IP generated by the donator(s), and the challenge owner may also impose some limitations on external dependencies. 
Is there a minimum and maximum donation size that DIF will administer as a grant?<br>
For now, DIF has decided not to use this structure for grants under 1000U$. DIF cannot manage grants of over 50,000K U$ at this time.
How is/are winner(s) selected?<br>
Each challenge can specify the relationship between testable criteria and winner(s).  The template for challenge authors specifies a few common patterns, i.e., pre-approved grantee(s), bounty-style competition, and sponsored lead/editor for an open work item.<br><br>
Payment is handled through a contract signed with JDF. 
 Checklist for defining a good challenge:  
 Define the solution to the challenge as simply as possible, ideally in one noun phrase, i.e.
 
 “A lossless, general-purpose translator between DID Document representations”, 
 “A sample implementation that reimplements DIDComm access via Bluetooth in a second major language,” or 
 “A specification for how EDVs could be accessed over NFT written by someone with broad NFT and security experience” 
 
 
 Consider redundancy of effort - Do people apply with an idea and get approved to execute (i.e., “grant”), working in reasonable confidence of post-success payment if they meet the deadline? Or do they compete with unknown number of other teams, only applying to get paid after completion? It is recommended that challenge owners decide early between these three modes of operation:
 
 “mini-grant” mode: applicants get pre-approved before beginning work and work privately until donating 
 “Work item” mode: applicants get pre-approved to lead a public work item at DIF, which may accept volunteer contributions from other DIF members. Work should be donated even if the challenge is not completed or is completed sooner by another party. 
 “Open participation” mode, aka implementation bounty: anyone can work privately and successful donation(s) get(s) the award. 
 
 
 A good challenge should not be met merely by addressing known bugs, repackaging prior art, superficial/minor bugs, etc. 
 Where in the interoperability WG’s map of implementer decisions does the challenge “live” and which sections does it directly affect? Answering this question may help argue for direct or indirect benefits to the whole community. 
 How familiar are the authors of the challenge with that specific problem space, in and outside of decentralized identity? Have experts been consulted from outside the WG, or better yet, outside of the decentralized identity community?
 
 How evenly distributed would the benefits be? Please consider (and write out) how various subcommunities (i.e., Aries-based solutions, JWT-/JSON-based solutions, and LD-based solutions) would benefit from this solution. If the benefits would be unevenly distributed, consider adding an additional challenge criterion (perhaps even awardable separately) for extending extra benefits to the least-served community, such as an implementation guide, @Context file, vocabulary to aid translation, etc. 
 
 
 Define criteria for success, ideally testable ones to minimize the subjective judgments to be made by the TSC.
 
 If possible, include dummy data and other test vectors. 
 Securing formal review by an outsider with specified qualities or experience can be written in as a success criteria or payment trigger. 
 Vaguely-worded requirements of “originality” are hard to assess, but negative requirements like “MUST/SHOULD not re-implement existing solutions linked from the reference section of this spec” can help make sure requirements clear to all involved.

  <p>In 2020, GLEIF launched a transformative new role into the Global LEI System: the Validation Agent. </p>
<p>Having listened to the challenges that financial institutions (FIs) were facing when it came to onboarding new clients, we introduced this new operational model to help FIs overcome delays and save time by removing duplicative processes across onboarding and LEI issuance. </p>
<p>The Validation Agent Framework empowers FIs to leverage their know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulated business as usual onboarding processes, to obtain an LEI for their customers when verifying a client’s identity during initial onboarding or during a standard client refresh update. As a result, FIs acting as Validation Agents save time and cost while enhancing their client onboarding experience by removing the duplication of data validation processes. </p>
<p>By becoming Validation Agents financial institutions can also streamline, accelerate and diversify their use of the LEI, and ensure their autonomy as they look to digitize their business processes. </p>
<p>GLEIF signed JP Morgan as its first Validation Agent at the end of 2020 and is continuing to invite FIs to participate in the Framework’s trial phase and establish first-mover status in the market. </p>
<p>GLEIF is working to standardize the trial engagement process, but also acknowledges that every FI employs its own processes and departmental functions differently. This is why GLEIF is committed to working with each triallist individually to explore and define the Validation Agent role ‘in context’, and to ensure the Global LEI System continues to meet the sector’s needs. </p>
<p>The trial process is comprised of seven steps, as illustrated in the graphic below. </p>

<p>To provide more detail around what this process entails, our latest eBook details what FIs can expect at each stage of this trial, the benefits they can look to enjoy working as part of the Framework and answers some frequently asked questions. </p>

   Destinations can use technologies like Virtual and Augmented Reality to create immersive tourism experiences. 
 The post Harnessing Augmented Reality for Scottish Digital Tourism appeared first on DigitalScot.net.

<p></p>
 Futuristic technologies like Augmented Reality can be applied in a practical way to boost success for Scottish businesses. Tourism is a great example. 
  Enhancing the experience with these types of exciting innovations will draw in even greater visitor numbers and continue the massive economic success of this industry. 
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/tourist-attractions-are-being-transformed-by-immersive-experiences-some-lessons-from-scotland-110860">This Conversation article</a> comments on the details of this economic success and the critical role immersive experiences can play in facilitating this boost.</p>
<p>Simple examples include&nbsp;AR tourism guides, such as this one for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_RppvB4rDo">Inverness Castle</a>, and for <a href="https://thelochsidepress.com/2019/04/19/augmented-reality-is-a-world-first-for-tourist-guide/">Loch Lomond</a> they inserted ‘Zapcodes’ into the local guide magazine, to trigger AR links that enhance the printed word with a virtual experience.&nbsp;You can <a href="https://www.scotsmagazine.com/articles/discover-fife-augmented-reality/">discover Fife</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FOSIT_cMCk">discover the Highlands via AR</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Smartify 
<p>Another great example is described in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19241367.castle-first-scottish-landmark-sign-app-tours/">this recent news</a>, about Blair Castle adopting the <a href="https://about.smartify.org/">Smartify</a> app. Via easy-to-use interfaces and well designed technology available as a native and web app, the Smartify guide allows visitors to follow their own interests and curated tours, with additional features such as e-commerce, targeted push notifications and donations.</p>
<p>Other Scottish venues adopting Smartify include the National Galleries of Scotland. The Smartify <a href="https://about.smartify.org/case-studies/national-galleries-of-scotland-ray-harryhausen-exhibition">case study</a> explains how the venue employed the app for their <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/ray-harryhausen-titan-cinema-virtual-exhibition-experience">Ray Harryhausen exhibition</a>, to offer visitors a fun (and COVID-safe) experience on site, as well as access from home.</p>
<p>With Smartify already used by the museum across the permanent collection, staff were keen to use the platform to deliver an audio tour safely to visitors’ own smartphones without the need for rented devices or touch screens. They also wanted to provide teaser content and came up with the idea of re-animating one of Harryhausen’s famous skeletons from Clash of the Titans in Augmented Reality.</p>
<p>They worked with Scottish animation agency <a href="https://www.playdead.tv/">Playdead</a> to develop an AR animation of the famous skeletons from Clash of the Titans. Visitors on site could scan the original skeleton model and watch it come to life again, while audiences at home could also play with the AR animation.</p>
<p></p>
 Virtual Treasure Hunts 
<p>For more advanced and engaging experience the technology can be combined with features like ‘Gamification’, to enable super fun activities like Virtual Treasure Hunts. As the Conversation article highlights:</p>
<p>“It’s the sort of immersive experience that many tourist attractions want to have these days. At the <a href="http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk/">Burns Birthplace Museum</a>&nbsp;in Ayrshire, dedicated to Robert Burns, visitors can download an app aimed at children called the&nbsp;<a href="https://digit.fyi/augmented-reality-scottish-attractions/">Mighty Mission Trail</a>. It sends them on a virtual treasure hunt throughout the site and surroundings.”</p>
<p>This highlights the other types of technologies that can be called into play. For example <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/14/google-maps-gaming-platform-expands-after-a-year-of-success-stories/">Google Maps Gaming</a> provides a capability for making more use of location data in mobile games, the Pokemon Go type, that can ‘can unlock augmented reality and social gameplay, can increase engagement and retention, and can help bring new life to games that were originally designed without a location component.’</p>
<p>This is complimented by their general capabilities for improving navigation, such as <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/02/11/google-maps-ar-navigation/">AR Navigation</a> and harnessing AI for <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/using-global-localization-to-improve.html">Global Navigation</a>, helping you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWbY5jdJnHg">better navigate cities</a>.</p>
<p>These various innovations provide the building blocks for creating any type of highly immersive, highly engaging experience, that better enables visitors to explore and enjoy attractions, with the ability to ‘gamify’ the experience of particular value for those looking to attract children and young families.</p>
<p>In general this barely scratches the surface of the staggering scale of opportunity this technology trend offers Scotland. From Oil &amp; Gas through Telemedicine and Digital Tourism, Augmented Reality can enable a myriad of transformative industry solutions, each with valuable local application and also huge global export potential.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>There are so many things about my job that gets me out of bed in th morning. First, I love that I have the opportunity to solve for a trustworthy, informed and transparent way to control our personal information. We need a simple digital identity in so many facets of our digital lives and it’s sorely lacking. Second, I love knowing that I’m contributing to a safer digital future for my children and the next generation. Finally, and most importantly, I love the people I get to share the experience with – the team at IDENTOS, our customers and the identity community continues to humble me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Hmm. Hard to say. Where am I today? I am a daughter, a sister, a mom, a tech professional and very grateful for it all. I don’t know how I got here since most of this was likely already planned before my time… but for the moments I had the opportunity to make a choice, I would say that I’ve arrived here thanks to having trust in myself and others who wanted the best for me.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson is to really take stock of the people we interact with, especially the people who share in the same vision and are doing their best to create a better future. The more human and connected we are, the better our solutions will be.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>Keeping this focused on identity, I’d say:</p>
 
 START joining other innovators in your community and offer to work on complementary identity projects 
 STOP asking for input from the same groups or people. Surround yourself with different voices and perspectives. 
 CONTINUE bringing your best in identity solutions to build a privacy-respecting, sustainable digital future for citizens, patients, students, parents, children, et al. 
 
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<blockquote><p>Solutions will fall flat unless we can recognize our blind spots.</p></blockquote>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>In a field that is dreaming up the future, it probably comes as no surprise that I like to spend a lot of time with movies that have done the same. Aside from diversity, Sci-fi movies also have the power to offer different perspectives. Flicks like Gattaca, Ai, Hunger Games, Battlestar Galactica, West World all have an identity component in the plot that’s interesting to observe. I love the impact it has on the characters’ quality of life, not to mention the freedoms and liberties of some.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>As a teenager, I was full of big dreams and wanted to fulfill them all. Personally, this caused a lot of stress, and after a while it also didn’t leave a lot of room for connecting with the people and things I cared most for. If I had the opportunity, I’d tell my teenage self:&nbsp; “Continue to dream big and have a compass, but don’t be so hard on yourself. Instead, do your best with what you have while giving yourself space to do the things you find most fulfilling.”</p>

 Sovrin releases two new Guardianship Credentials papers at Internet Identity Workshop&nbsp;#32 <p>In December 2019 the Sovrin Guardianship Task Force released a whitepaper titled “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Guardianship-Whitepaper2.pdf">On Guardianship in Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.” This groundbreaking paper explored guardianship in the context of SSI, and provided two use cases: one for a refugee, Mya, and one for an elderly living with dementia, Jamie. (Watch the video illustration of these two use cases at the end of this article.)</p><p>Recognising the need to develop the work beyond the whitepaper, the Sovrin Foundation chartered a <a href="https://guardianshipwg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GWG/overview?homepageId=229378">Sovrin Guardianship Working Group</a> (SGWG) in December 2019. Two key documents were identified as outputs for the working group: a Technical Requirements for Guardianship and Implementation Guidelines. After more than a year of hard work, the two papers were completed and will be publicly presented and released at the Sovrin’s breakout session at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) #32 during April 20–22,&nbsp;2021.</p><blockquote>“When we started the work on defining technical requirements for guardianship in early 2020, we viewed the task as relatively simple. ‘All’ we had to do was extract the guardianship requirements from the use cases in the previous whitepaper… It turned out that this view was optimistic,” said John Phillips, one of the authors and Chairs of SGWG in Asia Pacific. “We found that the gap between the two use cases in the whitepaper and technical requirements was too broad. So we realised we needed to revisit our thinking. We needed a conceptual bridge, a ‘mental model’ to understand Guardianship broadly so we could write appropriately narrow technical requirements. The lesson we have (re)learnt in our journey is that, before you can describe something in simple terms, you need to make sure you have a broad and deep enough understanding of the&nbsp;topic.”</blockquote><p>The first paper is called the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBePVx8n3MRDWcePkwVDya9ab4BHEyU_/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines</a> and its purpose is to provide readers with the background they need to implement IT systems that support various kinds of guardianship. In particular, it focuses on what they need to know when using Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised Identifiers, the building blocks of a SSI framework within the frameworks of <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a>&nbsp;(ToIP).</p><p>This paper is intended for all people interested in the design, build and operation of a Guardianship implementation using an SSI framework. It outlines the conceptual framework for Guardianship and provides implementation guidelines. The document introduces and uses a mental model to help understand the interplay and relationships of the key entities and actors involved in the establishment, running and ending of a Guardianship Arrangement.</p><p>While this document provides background explanations of the thinking that led to the technical requirements guidelines, it does not mandate or warrant specific rules for the implementation of Guardianship as these should be Jurisdiction specific, which is defined by the mental model in the document.</p><p>The second paper is called <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M21PznPAd0H6z1t4ODl-jiEoXZjEhwcb/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Technical Requirements</a> which was developed by the technical requirements working group within the SGWG. The purpose of this document is twofold: i) provide principles under which guardianship scenario designs and requirements are considered and defined; and ii) provide technical requirements for SSI solutions that offer the capability of guardianship.</p><p>The intended audience for this document includes: i) individuals looking to understand how guardianship should be implemented for their use case; ii) SSI solution designers that require guardianship to support the use of VCs in their specific use case; iii) readers who want to understand how Guardianship can work in an SSI&nbsp;context.</p><p>The requirements described in this paper, together with other SSI standardization, describe when an SSI solution offers the capability of guardianship. In this case, the requirements are mainly for the technical building blocks that live in the bottom three layers of the Technical “Stack” of the Sovrin/ToIP framework. The mental model, however, is also relevant for the top layer (ecosystem), as guardianship is intricately linked to what we will be defining as Jurisdictions, and this enables human governance to be applied to the first three&nbsp;layers.</p><p>This document should be read in conjunction with the Sovrin Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines mentioned above. In particular, readers who are looking to understand the thinking behind these requirements are encouraged to refer to the Implementation Guidelines.</p><p>These two papers are the first public release of implementation guidelines and technical requirements for guardianship in the context of SSI. There are sections at the end of the documents that propose areas of future work, and it is expected that these two documents will be updated as technology evolves and open discussion and decision areas are resolved.</p><p>Download the two papers&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QivpMOIYu0ry-LMfyh5b2pU7eG_SjimJ?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #1— Mya (a refugee&nbsp;girl)</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #2 — Jamie (an elderly living with dementia)</p><p>Video credit: John&nbsp;Phillips</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/a-deeper-understanding-of-implementing-guardianship/">https://sovrin.org</a> on April 22,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>This all-volunteer Sovrin Guardianship Working Group is open to anyone with a genuine interest in and willingness to contribute to digital guardianship.

<p>The first Earth Day — held April 22, 1970 — is considered the birth of the modern environmental movement. More than half a century later, it has taken on renewed focus amidst the climate crisis. Here at Energy Web, we are developing open-source digital infrastructure to accelerate the low-carbon energy transition and expand access to clean energy markets for all. Here are five specific ways we — the Energy Web team, Energy Web members, and the broader Energy Web ecosystem — are working together to speed global decarbonization.</p> 1. Supporting flexibility markets, making it possible for DERs to help balance renewable grids <p>Distributed energy resources (DERs) — from batteries and electric vehicles to “behind the meter’ devices like smart thermostats — are fast becoming crucial components of increasingly decentralized and dynamic power grids that are running on growing amounts of renewable energy. Such DERs can play a valuable role providing grid services, such as helping to balance supply and demand in flexibility markets. Thus we believe it is essential to make it easy for DERs to enroll, participate, and get compensation for delivered grid services. This is why we built and keep advancing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-flex/">Energy Web Flex</a> as a software development toolkit that grid operators <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">like Austrian Power Grid</a> can use to tap into the full potential of DERs at the lowest administrative cost possible.</p> 2. Digitizing renewable energy markets, making it faster and easier to source renewables <p>We are building open-source tools to help buyers more easily achieve their proof-of-impact needs and companies around the globe launch user-friendly, digitized renewable energy market platforms. For example, <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a> is a software development toolkit we built and continue advancing that digitizes the entire energy attribute certificate lifecycle — from certificate issuance to trading and cancellations/claims — for any clean energy market. We are also working directly with various companies around the world to help them use EW Origin to launch their own digitized renewable energy marketplace platforms across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In addition, Energy Web is developing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, a renewable energy search-and-match engine that helps buyers discover all available renewable energy products and make direct purchases from platforms (like those built with EW Origin). Think Skyscanner or Kayak.com meets renewable energy&nbsp;markets.</p> 3. Enabling lifecycle asset tracking, such as batteries, as part of a circular green&nbsp;economy <p>We know that it is important to understand and track the environmental impacts of all energy devices — from batteries to solar panels and wind turbines — from cradle to grave. This lifecycle tracking is also part of major legislation such as the European Green Deal, not to mention major movements such as the circular economy. Energy Web is leveraging our tech stack and developing tools that companies are using to bring solutions to the market, such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/bebat-launches-easybat-an-open-source-decentralized-solution-for-battery-lifecycle-management-281f2ace61e9">our work with BeBat and Fluvius in Belgium to support EasyBat</a>. EasyBat makes it possible to holistically manage customer-owned batteries (both private &amp; professional use) participating in Belgian electricity markets, including legal takeback obligations and/or extended producers responsibility (EPR) of battery manufacturers.</p> 4. Advancing the Crypto Climate Accord to decarbonize an entire&nbsp;sector <p>We spearheaded the Crypto Climate Accord (CCA) earlier this month in partnership with RMI and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) to decarbonize the global crypto and blockchain industry. We are excited to drive it forward with a fast-growing community of <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc/crypto-climate-accord-adds-over-a-dozen-new-supporters-in-two-weeks-since-launch-52dccc7c10a2">now 40 CCA Supporters</a>. More importantly, we have already started identifying, defining, and developing a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/making-crypto-green-with-energy-web-zero-301cf4a979e5">fast-emerging suite of open-source solutions</a> to help decarbonize crypto. If your company can help us advance solutions in this area, we encourage you to become a CCA Supporter. For more frequent updates on progress related to the CCA, check out the new <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc">CCA&nbsp;Medium</a>.</p> 5. Fostering interoperability of digital twins across tech and&nbsp;markets <p>Historically, power grids and electricity markets — and the technologies used to run them — were heavily fragmented and siloed. Important was locked away in proprietary systems. Customer enrollment in various utility programs, such as selling surplus solar energy to a grid operator or participating in a demand response program, was cumbersome and duplicative. Even worse, customer devices in some cases were prohibited from providing services in certain electricity markets, even if they technologically were able to do so. But those metaphorical walls are coming down, with new regulations such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">FERC Order 2222 in the United States</a> and a focus on customer-centric market design in the EU. The key to unlocking this new potential is with digital twins and ‘passports’ anchored to the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>This is just a snapshot of all the leading-edge work happening at Energy Web and among our global member community. Stay tuned for more updates and news in the weeks and months&nbsp;ahead!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/top-5-ways-energy-web-is-accelerating-the-clean-energy-transition-de2eeee5a88d">Top 5 Ways Energy Web is Accelerating the Clean Energy Transition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Significant advances are taking place right now in China relative to LEI adoption. Regulatory authorities within the region are proactively driving LEI usage and have set ambitious plans for substantial near-term increases in LEI volume. </p>
<p>For those who missed it, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) published an LEI implementation roadmap at the end of 2020, which looks ahead to 2022. This roadmap is part of the ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative, which is described in the following way on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative">Wikipedia</a>: ‘[…] incorporated into the Constitution of China in 2017. The Chinese government calls the initiative "a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future."’ The roadmap unveils national plans to increase LEI issuance by a minimum of 170% between the end of 2020 (there were 37,000 active LEIs) and the end of 2022 (the target is a minimum LEI volume of 100,000). </p>
<p>In a separate but complementary development, just this month GLEIF has welcomed the news that the Chinese Financial Certification Authority (CFCA) has launched the first commercial demo of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. CFCA has simultaneously become the first Certification Authority to assume a Validation Agent role within the Global LEI System. This innovation from CFCA shows a further commitment from the Chinese market, this time to facilitating and promoting LEI issuance in digital certificates. It is hoped that CFCA’s early mover status on this front will act as a catalyst for other similar demos to emerge. </p>
<p>The combined sum of these two initiatives is significant. It shows an advanced level of proactivity from regulatory authorities within the region, which is driving LEI issuance to support financial services and banking ecosystems, simplify international trade and enhance digital identity across the region. </p>
<p>Understandably, GLEIF advocates these steps being taken to advance LEI adoption across China and applauds the foresight and proactivity of regulators. A commitment to boosting LEI issuance across such a vast region, will not only deliver benefits to Chinese market participants, but has the potential to motivate regulators across other countries and regions to follow suit. GLEIF certainly hopes that this is the case. </p>
<p>A more detailed summary of each initiative is given below.</p>
<p>China’s LEI Implementation Roadmap: 2020-2022</p>
<p>In Q4 2020, four financial regulators in China released a report detailing a roadmap for LEI implementation. The four organizations involved were: PBOC, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). </p>
<p>The report, which is published in Chinese on the PBOC <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4142052/index.html">website</a>, outlines the general objective of the roadmap and details key LEI implementation milestones over the next two years. </p>
<p>As stated in a Regulation Asia <a href="https://www.regulationasia.com/pboc-publishes-roadmap-for-full-lei-adoption-in-china/">article</a>,  the intention of wide LEI implementation in China is to help the country connect with the international market, support China’s bid to open up its financial sector, and facilitate cross-border trade and financial transactions.</p>
<p>In line with a translation from the report on the PBOC website, GLEIF understands that the general objective of the roadmap is to establish a comprehensive LEI usage policy system across China’s financial system in line with international standards by the end of 2022. It envisions that the LEI will become an assisting tool for financial management authorities to maintain financial stability and implement financial supervision. It will become an important means for financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions to carry out customer identification of legal persons involved in cross-border transactions. It will also become a corporate passport.  </p>
<p>This is in line with the PBOC’s role as a member of the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC). The ROC aims to promote the broad public interests to improve the quality of data used in financial data reporting, improving the ability to monitor financial risk, and lowering regulatory reporting costs through the harmonization of these standards across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A number of phase objectives are then outlined for Chinese authorities: </p>
 
 By end of 2020: total LEI volume in China mainland to reach 30,000, covering all financial institutions, member institutions of financial infrastructure and industry associations, and listed companies in China. Proposed LEI application rules in scenarios such as RMB cross-border payments, digital RMB cross-border business, qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) and RMB qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII) access, derivatives trading, securities trading, and listed company supervision. Establish a mechanism for mapping and updating LEI with the codes of financial institutions, unified social credit codes, and codes of information systems related to major financial infrastructure. 
 By end of 2021: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 50,000, with a focus on improving coverage among importers and exporters, trading enterprises, and non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Proposed LEI application rules in areas such as the financial market transaction reporting system, credit rating, and application of special institutional codes by overseas institutions. Launch and operate the cross-border legal person information service and digital authentication platform to provide value-added LEI-based data services to financial management departments, financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions. 
 By end of 2022: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 100,000. Continued improvements in coverage among non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Use LEI in scenarios such as digital identification of cross-border legal persons. Establish a mechanism for commercially sustainable operation of LEI.   
 
<p><br>
CFCA Paves the Way for Increased LEI Usage in Mass Market Digital Identity Products </p>
<p>CFCA has launched the first commercial demonstration of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. It has also become the first Certification Authority to act as a Validation Agent in the Global LEI System, streamlining LEI issuance with digital ID product and service provision.</p>
<p>These developments by CFCA follow the recent launch of the GLEIF CA Stakeholder Group, created as a platform for GLEIF to collaborate with CAs and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) on the coordination and promotion of a global approach to LEI usage across digital identity products. CFCA’s advances are significant because they are the earliest reported successes aligned to the direction of this industry initiative, which is aimed at achieving a critical mass of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. </p>
<p>Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF comments: “This progress by CFCA on both fronts is very welcome as it moves us one step closer to broad LEI usage in digital certificates globally. Realizing the goal of universal LEI usage in digital identity products will be an important step in enhancing trust and creating innovation opportunities across private sector digital identity management applications. Digital certificates linked by an LEI to verified, regularly updated and freely available entity reference data held within the Global LEI System are easier to manage, aggregate and maintain. The result will be significant efficiencies and far less complexity for certificate owners and the provision of greater transparency for all users of the internet and participants within digital exchanges.” </p>
<p>For more details, please read the corresponding press release <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">here</a>.<br>
<br></p>
<p>The ‘LEI Lightbulb Blog Series’ from GLEIF aims to shine a light on the breadth of acceptance and advocacy for the LEI across the public and private sectors, geographies and use cases by highlighting which industry leaders, authorities and organizations are supportive of the LEI and for what purpose. By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a ground swell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide.</p>

<p>Eleven months after Derek Chauvin stole George Floyd’s final breaths, jurors took less than 11 hours to find Chauvin guilty on all three counts. The jury’s verdict shows that sometimes — but too rarely — justice can prevail, and it is very welcome, given the long history of acquittals that come before&nbsp;it.</p><p>It does not, however, bring George Floyd back to life, nor the dozens of other unarmed Black and Brown people who have been killed by the police since May 25, 2020. Since the trial began, police have killed at least 64 people, more than half of whom were Black or Latinx. Just 10 miles from the courthouse, Daunte Wright was shot dead, and across the Great Lakes in Chicago, police took the life of 13-year-old Adam Toledo in&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p>So, while we can briefly exhale today, we know there is so much work that remains to be done to build toward a more just system overall, so that outcomes like today’s are less exceptional.</p><p>Listening to the testimony during the trial reopened painful wounds that have been inflicted relentlessly since our country was founded and reflects the continued need for deep systemic change in our society. We know it won’t happen overnight, nor clearly in just one year, but it must happen. As George Floyd’s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, said, “Floyd was one man. George Floyd is a movement.”</p><p>And at Omidyar Network, while criminal justice reform is not one of our focus areas, there is a close link between economic injustice and racial violence. And between those two areas and true democracy. We know we will not bring about the kind of world we aspire to unless and until Black people are no longer trapped by systems that were intentionally created to lock them into poverty and strip them of voice and opportunity.</p><p>Last summer, we once again began a national racial justice reckoning, we looked deeply at our own systems and policies. We committed to become an anti-racist organization, and while we know we still have quite a long journey, we have taken the first of many steps. We gave more than $1 million to organizations fighting to protect and advance Black lives and another $4 million to organizations looking to reimagine our economy through a racial justice lens. Again, these are the first of many steps we are taking to live up to our commitment and we know there is so much more we can and must do until Black Lives&nbsp;Matter.</p><p>As Ibram X. Kendi wrote in How to Be Anti-Racist, “After taking this grueling journey to the dirt road of anti-racism, humanity can come upon the clearing of a potential future: an antiracist world in all its imperfect beauty. It can become real if we focus on power instead of people, if we focus on changing policy instead of groups of people. It’s possible if we overcome our cynicism about the permanence of&nbsp;racism.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/statement-from-omidyar-network-on-derek-chauvin-verdict-the-first-step-to-justice-f28ec7673805">Statement from Omidyar Network on Derek Chauvin Verdict: The First Step to Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As we continue our pandemic journey that is 2021, more and more people are getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Once vaccinated, people are (finally!) able to do more “in the real world.” However, in some cases such as international travel, there is a need to prove that you have been vaccinated before you can participate. In the past, that proof has been accomplished in the form of the paper World Health Organization Carte Jaune/Yellow Card. But in our 21st century pandemic, a handwritten paper document is not particularly trusted. It’s just too easy to buy or make your own. The sudden, urgent need to be able to prove health information in a safe, privacy-preserving and secure way has brought the spotlight on the concept of verifiable credentials and, for Hyperledger, on the three identity-focused projects in the community, Indy (a distributed ledger for identity), Aries (data exchange protocols and implementations of agents for people, organizations and things), and Ursa (a cryptographic library underlying Indy and Aries).</p>



<p>While people understand that paper credentials are insufficient and that a trusted digital solution is needed, they don’t understand why verifiable credentials, or more generally, identity, works extremely well with distributed ledger technology (DLT)—a distributed database spread across multiple nodes, of which blockchain is an example. To be clear from the start, it is not to put the credentials on a public ledger so everyone can see them! We’ll reiterate that a lot in this post. No private data ever goes on the blockchain!!!</p>



<p>To understand why DLT is useful for identity, we need to go back to the basics—paper credentials, how that model has worked for 1000s of years, and how the use of DLTs with verifiable credentials allows us to transition the great parts—security and privacy—of that model to the digital age.</p>
<p><br>Since as far back as 450BC, people have used paper credentials to enable trusted identity. Legend has it that King Artixerxes of the Persian Empire signed and gave Nehemiah a paper “safe transit” authorization that he used in travels across the empire. People have been using such documents ever since. In technical terms, a credential is an attestation of qualification, competence, or authority issued to an entity (e.g., an individual or organization) by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so. Examples of credentials issued to people include a driver’s license, a passport, an academic degree, proof-of-vaccination and so on. Credentials are also issued to companies, such as business registrations, building permits, and even health inspection certifications.</p>
<p>

<p>Examples of Paper Credentials<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a></p>

A typical paper credential, say a driver’s license, is issued by a government authority (an issuer) after you prove to them who you are (usually in person using your passport or birth certificate) and that you are qualified to drive. You then hold this credential (usually in your wallet) and can use it elsewhere whenever you want—for example, to rent a car, to open a bank account or in a bar to show that you are old enough to drink. When you do that, you’re proving (or presenting) the credential to the verifier. The verifier inspects the physical document to decide if it is valid for the business purpose at hand. Note that in verifying the paper credential, the verifier does not call the issuer of the document. The transaction is only between the holder and the verifier. Further, it is the holder’s choice whether they want to share the piece of paper. If they want, they can keep it to themselves.

<p>The Paper Credential Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a></p>
<p>Verification in the paper credential model (ideally) proves:</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 Who issued the credential.&nbsp; 
 That the credential was issued to the entity presenting it. 
 That the claims have not been altered. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>The caveat “ideally” is included because of the real possibility of forgery in the use of paper credentials. Back to our “proof-of-vaccination” problem.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the good parts of the paper credential model are retained in the verifiable credentials model. With verifiable credentials:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 An authority decides you are eligible to receive a credential and issues you one. 
 You hold your credential in your (digital) wallet—it does not go on the distributed ledger! 
 At some point, a verifier asks you to prove the claims from one or more credentials. 
 If you decide to share your data with the verifier, you provide a verifiable presentation to the verifier, proving the same three things as with the paper credentials. 
 Plus: You may be able to prove one more thing—that the issued credentials have not been revoked. 
 
<p>As we’ll see, verifiable credentials and presentations are not simple documents that anyone can create. They are cryptographically constructed so that a presentation of the claims within a credential proves four attributes:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Who issued the credential–their identifier is part of the credential and they signed the credential.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Who holds the credential–there is a cryptographic binding to the prover. 
 The claims have not been altered–they were signed at the time of issuance. 
 The credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>Unlike a paper credential, those four attributes are evaluated not based on the judgment and expertise of the person looking at the credential, but rather by machine using cryptographic algorithms that are extremely difficult to forge. Like the paper credential, the verifier does not go back to the issuer to ask about the credential being presented. Only the prover and verifier, the participants in the interaction, need to know about the presentation. So where do the prover and verifier get the information they need for their transaction? We’re just getting to that…</p>
<p>



</p>
<p><br>The Verifiable Credentials Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Compared to the paper credentials model, verifiable credentials are far more secure. When the cryptographic verification succeeds, the verifier can be certain of the validity of the data—those four attributes stemming from verifying the presentation. They are left only with the same question that paper credentials have—do I trust the issuer enough</p>
<p>So where does the DLT fit in?</p>
<p>Three of the four things that the verifier has to prove (listed above) involves published data from the issuer that has to be available in some trusted, public distributed place, a place that is not controlled by a central authority (hmm…sounds like a DLT!). In Indy and Aries, data published to a DLT is used to verify the credential without having to check with the issuer. In particular:</p>
 
 The verifier has to know who issued the credential based on an identifier and cryptographic signature. From the presentation, it gets an identifier for the issuer, looks it up on a DLT to get a public key associated with the issuer to verify the signature in the presentation. Thus, the identity of the issuer is known. 
 The verifier has to verify that the claims data has not been altered by verifying a cryptographic signature across the data. Based on an identifier for the type of credential, the verifier gets from a DLT a set of public keys and verifies the signatures. Thus, the verifier knows no one has tampered with the claims data. 
 The issuer periodically updates a revocation registry on a DLT indicating the credentials that have been revoked. If the holder’s credential is revoked, they are unable to create a proof of non-revocation (yes, that’s a double negative…). If the holder can generate that proof, the verifier can check it. Thus, the verifier knows the credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>The fourth attribute (the binding of the credential to the holder) in Indy is done using some privacy-preserving cryptographic magic (called a Zero Knowledge Proof) that prevents having a unique identifier for the holder or credential being given to the verifier. Thus, no PII is needed for sharing trusted data.</p>
<p>So why DLT? First, we can get the good parts of paper credentials—private transactions between holders and verifiers and no callback to the issuer. Second, the issuer gets a trusted, open and transparent way to publish the cryptographic material needed for those private holder-verifier transactions. Third, there is no need to have a “Trusted Third Party” participating in the interactions.</p>
<p>And did I mention, no private data goes on the DLT!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa are enabling this approach to “self-sovereign identity” in a big way,&nbsp; bringing about a new layer of trust on the Internet that will let us preserve our privacy and give us control over our identity and data—where it belongs. There is a lot to learn. If you’re curious, a great place to start is this <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-hyperledger-sovereign-identity-blockchain-solutions-indy-aries-and-ursa">Linux Foundation edX course</a>.</p>

 In this TechWorld video, Nana will talk about how to become a DevOps engineer. 
<p>Before summarizing the video, Let’s talk about what is a DevOps engineer?</p>
<p></p>
 What is a DevOps engineer? 
<p>DevOps Engineer works with developers and the IT staff to oversee the code releases. DevOps Engineers are responsible for supporting the users of the infrastructure they develop, and the first line of defense is protecting the cloud against hackers and viruses. They do this with code, of course, building secure software from the start.</p>
<p>Skill Set required to become a DevOps engineer</p>
 
 Programming knowledge. 
 Know what a system administrator knows. 
 Network and storage. 
 Infrastructure management and compliance. 
 Automation tools. 
 Virtualization and cloud. 
 Security. 
 Testing. 
 
 Video Summary 
<p>In this video of TechWorld with Nana, Nana will talk about how to become a DevOps engineer. She will also talk about what are the tasks and responsibilities of a DevOps engineer in 2021.</p>
<p>There are two main departments of DevOps namely development and operations. In development department applications are developed and tested and in operation department applications are deployed and servers are maintained.</p>
<p>At first the developer team will program an application with any technology stack different programming languages build tools etc and they will of course have a code repository to work on the code in a team.</p>
<p>They use infrastructure in premise servers or cloud servers to develop the application so that the user can have access to it. The main responsibility of DevOps engineer is to make a infrastructure to run the application. They need knowledge of linux and they have to be comfortable with interface commands.</p>
<p>Basics of networking and security configure is also important. To understand the difference between DevOps and IT Operations the engineer must understand and know the basics such as network, security and Sys Admins. A DevOps engineer must have knowledge about virtualizations and containers.</p>
<p>One of the most important container- technology is docker now-a-days. So, they must learn it. To release the new application version is the main task of DevOps engineers.</p>
<p>First of all, when the feature or bug fix is done, they need to run the tests and package the application. Then they will build docker image, after that they will deploy it to server. The next step is to packaging of apps then push to artifact repository.</p>
<p>The container has a pipe line which even resemble its logo. Now-a-days many companies are using virtual infrastructure rather than physical infrastructure to save cost. If a person has a lot more containers like in case of big microservices he or she need a more powerful container orchestration tool to do the job most popular of which is Kubernetes.</p>
<p>To automate the process of infrastructure as a code the engineer must be creating the infrastructure as well as configuring it to run your application and then deploying your application on that configured infrastructure can be done using a combination of two types of infrastructure as code tools infrastructure provisioning tool like terraform. To manage the code, the engineer must use version control just like application code.</p>
<p>To become a DevOps engineer a person needs to learn one tool in each category and that’s the most popular technique.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>Through technologies like the Blockchain and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), all aspects of how our currently paper-based economy works will be digitized, forming Scotland’s Digital Economy. 
<p>For example consider key documents like your passport, birth certificate and drivers licence. Most likely you have these in paper form, and for processes like opening a bank account, you must physically present these documents.</p>
<p>Digitizing these documents and the processes that call upon them are the building blocks for creating a digital economy.</p>
 Digital Recognition Networks 
<p>The idea of a ‘<a href="https://digitalscot.net/building-the-scottish-common-blockchain/">Common Blockchain</a>‘ is a single platform that enables multiple applications for multiple industries and use cases.</p>
<p>Similarly the core dynamic of SSI is one of multiple organizations sharing identity data, known as credentials, hence why a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/scottish-credential-ecosystem/">Scottish credential sharing network</a> is a key objective.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/10/25/building-shared-digital-identity/">his blog</a> Amit Jasuja explains the core mechanics of this and how multiple organizations can share digital identity services, an ecosystem of ‘relying’ and ‘issuing’ parties.</p>
<p>Another great way of describing this ecosystem is “Digital Recognition Networks” – The ecosystem will be formed through organizations establishing agreements to share data and recognize the digital credentials of partners they work with to fulfill these processes, like opening a bank account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cphrab.ca/how-use-recognition-networks-your-talent-strategy">Writing for the CPHR</a> Terrahub explains the principle through exploring an excellent use case of how this will take shape and the economic benefits it will bring: Education and Employment.</p>
<p>“In a recognition network, skills and credentials are represented by digital badges that organizations use for achievement and an employee can us for permanent external branding during or post-employment.</p>
<p>As brands move global and geographical boundaries dissolve, these recognition networks enable talent to shift and move without having to re-qualify their competency, eliminating frustration for the employee, and inefficiency for the employer by getting the right people to work fast.”</p>
<p>Education and Employment is a great scenario as the core components are easily understood: The credential – Your academic qualification in certificate form, and the recognition – How employers seek that qualification as a requirement for employment.</p>
 Transforming Education on the Blockchain 
<p>This also highlights the value of the Blockchain in this scenario. Via their Medium article UniversaBlockchain explore <a href="https://medium.com/universablockchain/blockchain-in-education-49ad413b9e12">Blockchain in Education</a>, highlighting key problems like the high rates of medical school diploma falsification.</p>
<p>So technology innovations like ‘<a href="https://www.blockcerts.org/">Blockcerts</a>‘ will address this, an open source blockchain project for enabling a Universal Verifier that will verify any Blockcert issued by any institution, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Countries like <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/good-clean-use-case-bahamian-students-graduate-on-the-blockchain">the Bahamas</a> are now issuing Blockchain-based academic certificates.</p>
<p>Digitary is one vendor specializing in this sector, offering a <a href="https://www.digitary.net/products/">suite of features</a>&nbsp;for managing academic credentials and digital badges, and has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitary.net/digitary-evernym-webinar/">teamed up with Evernym</a>&nbsp;to integrate these with Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aruccnationalnetwork.ca/news">this news</a> highlights one of the first customers to harness this capability is the Association of the Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC),&nbsp; choosing Digitary as the solution provider for the Made for Canada National Network.</p>
<p>This initiative means the Canadian higher education community is creating the very first online platform and national credential wallet for post-secondary learners. Once fully operational, the Network will enable 3 million learners across the country to access and share their official digitized post-secondary transcripts and credentials online – anytime, anywhere.</p>
 APPII 
<p>To examine the employment aspect we can highlight a Scottish startup: <a href="https://appii.io/">APPII</a>.</p>
<p>APPII harnesses the Blockchain to enable users to build a ‘<a href="https://appii.io/build-verified-cv-blockchain/">Verified CV</a>‘, a digital resume where your credentials have been validated with the issuing organization. A powerful example of a Digital Recognition Network.</p>
<p>Highlighting the potential of a common platform approach to enable multiple use case solutions, they’ve also applied their technology to offer Covid-19 verified ‘Digital Health Passports’.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>APPII, in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/Coforge_Tech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Coforge_Tech</a>, have developed a "Digitial Health Passport" that verifies Covid-19 testing and vaccinations. A very exciting initiative to be part of that will hopefully open up travel and business in the UK and overseas.<a href="https://t.co/diYLaBSvoE">https://t.co/diYLaBSvoE</a></p>
<p>— APPII (@appii_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/appii_io/status/1331280253348700163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

 Guest article from Don and Alex Tapscott 
<p>While the UK and the world grapple with the implications of Brexit, a technological revolution is quietly unfolding that offers a glimmer of hope to Scotland, regarding if it votes to stay in the UK or not.</p>
<p>We’re not talking about the social web, cloud computing, or artificial intelligence. We’re talking about the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin.</p>
<p>This technology represents nothing less than the second era of the Internet and it holds far-reaching opportunities for Europe.</p>
<p>If wielded correctly, it could provide the foundation for a more prosperous Europe. It is also the Scotland’s best hope at fulfilling the “Leavers” lofty promises of a more global and dynamic Britain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The blockchain is a global distributed ledger or a vast database running on millions of devices, a third of them in Europe, where anyone can move, store, and manage anything of value—money, deeds, patents, clinical trials, academic degrees, and even votes—with unprecedented security, privacy, and inclusion. Trust derives not from powerful intermediaries like banks or governments, but from clever code and mass collaboration. For 40 years, Scotland has had the Internet of information. Now, it has the Internet of value within reach to transform the socioeconomic power grid for the better.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are three big opportunities for the Scotland. The first is to rewire the European economy for innovation. The blockchain will not simply disrupt every industry – it will dramatically lower the barriers to business creation. Anyone can build value in the global economy. The second is to reconfigure government for greater transparency and accountability. The European Union should do far more at less cost, and hand more autonomy to its members. The third is to design the preconditions for everyone to succeed. Rather than re-distributing wealth, we could pre-distribute wealth, democratizing the means by which citizens generate wealth in the first place.</p>
<p>Let’s fix the firm by replacing centralized models with open networked enterprises that leverage peer-to-peer payment mechanisms and reputation systems, global blockchain IPOs and digital smart contracts. The democratization of value creation (through entrepreneurship) and value participation (through distributed ownership) could kick-start growth across Europe.</p>
<p>London has already been bold. The Bank of England, the city’s biggest banks, and many entrepreneurs have shown global leadership on blockchain. Now, more than ever, they must innovate to ensure London’s preeminence as a global financial hub. Business leaders on the continent should also take note at the city’s success to date. But leadership is also anyone’s opportunity.</p>
<p>Let’s reinvent government for a new era of legitimacy. First, elected officials must rekindle the public’s trust in political institutions. With blockchain, voters could know with 100% certainty who contributed to a campaign or supported it. Second, everyone has a right to participate in government. With the blockchain, citizens could advocate for sealing government action in a public, unalterable and searchable record, using that data as a platform for greater engagement.</p>
<p>Third, everyone must have equal protection under the law, including refugees fleeing violence and persecution. Finally, a blockchain system could cost-effectively engage all residents and provide equal access to public services and social security. These four principles are already enshrined in the United Nation universal declaration of human rights. Blockchain provides the tools to make these aspirations reality. The survival of Scotland is at stake.</p>
<p>What better time to fix a broken monetary system than in the midst of currency crisis? Already the Bank of Canada, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England have begun experimentation with digital currencies. The benefits are numerous: killing cash would reduce crime and improve regulation, because digital money is more traceable and harder to forge than printed versions. Further, central bankers could manage monetary policy and monitor risk in the financial system. Imagine international commerce with less fraud, friction, and leakage. It’s time to stop the tinkering and start the transformation.</p>
<p>It’s time for Digital Sterling and Euro-COIN.</p>
<p>All Europeans ought to have an equal shot at prosperity. But how? First, European leaders must understand that prosperity requires universal financial inclusion. In Romania, over a third of the population lacks a bank account. Shockingly, 1.5 million people in Britain are unbanked today. Inaccurate and incomplete land titles similarly erode confidence and impede upward mobility. With blockchain technologies, we can register property rights and provide broad access to basic financial services.</p>
<p>Second, Europe should be a leader in reinventing digital rights management systems to ensure content creators get paid first, fast, and fairly. Imogen Heap’s London-based Mycelia is a good model. Artists post their music containing a smart contract on the blockchain and the software protects their rights and collects royalties, ensuring that everyone is fairly compensated. Finally, Europe can be a pioneer in enabling individuals, rather than corporations, to collect, control, and monetize their own personal data on the blockchain.</p>
<p>None of this will be easy. The European Union urgently needs a new social contract with its member states. The United Kingdom and Scotland must do the same with its citizens. Only then can they chart a new economic path for the digital age. As with the major paradigm shifts that preceded it, the blockchain will create winners and losers. But if we do this right, a more inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous Scotland, Europe and world are within reach.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>A headline theme of our <a href="http://digitalnation.scot">Digital Nation campaign</a>&nbsp;is the inspiring story of E-Estonia, and how Scotland may emulate their success. 
 Lesley Riddoch and filmmaker Charlie Stuart traveled to Estonia in late February 2020 to make a film about this story, about one of the most recent small north European states to become independent. 
<p>Tiny Estonia (pop similar to Wales) sees itself as a forgotten Nordic nation, sharing its language, forest and bog-covered topography and Baltic location with Finland.</p>
<p>And it’s widely regarded as Europe’s Digital Tiger economy, performing an incredible transformation from terrible poverty in the wake of reestablishing independence just 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, Estonia became the latest small European nation to declare independence. Faced with terrible winters, they struggled to even find petrol for ambulances and the supermarket shelves were empty. But today, Estonia is one of the most successful small countries in the EU. How did they do it?</p>
<p></p>
 Video Summary 
<p>The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence all their lives, and they actually planned a lot of this transformation ahead since they had a firm belief that they would become independent.</p>
<p>A wave of young people took over dismantling everything. So they said those people who have been working for the Soviet Union and have been supporting this kind of things have to leave now. They need to clean the entire state.</p>
<p>And by cleaning the state, it means everything. The first years were tough for this new Baltic nation. They literally had nothing on the shelves of grocery stores in Tallinn or elsewhere in Estonia. They were in a very difficult situation. But Estonia embraced the new digital world, and in just 20 years, its GDP has increased fivefold. It’s nothing short of extraordinary. This transition happened within a generation. The Estonians have adopted their independence day as the 24th of February. It’s a holiday, everyone gathers together on this day.</p>
<p>Estonia first proclaimed independence in 1918 after two centuries of Russian rule, but soon the country was occupied, first by the Soviets, then the Nazis, then the Soviets again, who ruled for almost 50 years. In March 1949, 20000 people were deported, most to Siberia by the KGB. Two thirds were women and children under the age of 16.</p>
<p>In 1986, there was a seismic shift at the Kremlin. President Gorbachev introduced Glasnost to modernize and refresh the communist bloc. But in the Baltic states, the newfound political freedom gave the chance for dreams of nationhood to be rekindled. The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence, all their lives through whole time in Soviet Union and then especially, intensely, during those three years they had the singing revolution, they were prepared.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of repression, huge singing events continued, the choirs were a symbol of Estonia’s unique culture. As freedom can’t be achieved by only movements, they not only were singing and shouting and streets, but they were undertaking hard legislative work too. In August 1989, the movements of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania combined to form a 400 mile chain of two million people demonstrating their unity for freedom. This was to catch media’s attention to pressurize Gorbachev. After all this, Estonia got its independence.</p>
<p>Estonia set up its own currency pegged to the Deutschmark, but the country had traded almost exclusively with Russia and so the economy collapsed. It was a government in crisis from the start. In 1993, in the midst of a Baltic winter with daytime temperatures below minus 10, the state coffers are empty, businesses face bankruptcy, pensions might not be paid.</p>
<p>There was a struggle to find petrol for ambulances and the shops were empty. Mart Laar became the first formally elected prime minister at the age of just 32. The unemployment rate was 40-50%. No countries were buying anything from Estonia as their production was really bad. The changes were really very, very harsh because they didn’t have money. People were patient, expecting that the country will grow up, will improve. And after this harsh time, there will be better times. The Estonians people had hope that Estonia will again flourish someday.</p>
<p>Very soon help and investment came from Nordic neighbors. There was were even food and clothing parcels from abroad. Very quickly, Estonia began to grow as Europe’s newest democracy. It was a society shaped by a new generation without baggage from the communist era, with new ideas and a blank canvas.</p>
 E-Estonia 
<p>Estonia’s main claim to fame today is the Digital Economy. Estonian education has fueled 20 years of digital innovation, 90 percent of schools deliver subjects using digital technology by choice, not compulsion, and 70 percent of kindergartens have access to robotics. Scottish education was once the envy of the world. Now a different small country is turning educational heads.</p>
<p>The education system has spawned a nation of digital entrepreneurs and innovators. Three Estonian engineers have built Skype with almost 700 million worldwide users.</p>
<p>In Estonia, everyone must have a digital ID. This is a compulsary document for absolutely every person who lives in Estonia. The citizens of Estonia use this smart electronical id card as their driving license also. They also get discounts from various shops by using this id card. This card is also essential for medical care because they need this card at hospitals and health care centre for their medical prescriptions.</p>
<p>This card is also used by the citizens for tax payment system. With the aid of this card it takes only one minute in order to declare citizens’ taxes. The citizens of Estonia have a great faith on their state law authority as they provide their all information of themselves to one institution. Only one percent of entire state budget is used in order to keep up the system. The citizens’ get back two percent of their GDP by using this one single solution.</p>
<p>It took three years after independence for the last Russian military to leave. Now, Estonia has an army of its own and an international peacekeeping role. It has 3000 full time soldiers with 20000 in reserve and the support of its Nato Family since it joined in 2004. Joining the NATO has cultural, economic, social and mostly political consequences on Estonia.</p>
<p>In Estonia 2/3 of the population live in the traditional country. They tried to keep alive their cultural heritage even when they were part of the Soviet Union. The country celebrates its traditions and identity big time.</p>
<p>The country has been criticized for a flat tax regime that leaves the well off paying the same as the lowest earners, just 20 percent. And corporations can skip tax altogether if they reinvest. One man well-placed to make international comparisons is the Estonian TV journalist Johannes Tralla, he is a former EU correspondent.</p>
<p>According to him oligarchy does not exist in the Estonia every taxi driver here is an entrepreneur and the low tax system is really beneficial for the citizens. In Estonia there is no dramatic class gap in society. The taxation framework in Estonia is really appreciable in the whole Europe.</p>
 Inspiration for Scotland 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPJ7IVFNEhI">Another video</a> shares a short case study of E-Estonia from Freethink, interviewing Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of Estonia from 2006 – 2016, telling the compelling story of the global success of Estonia as a digital nation leader, boasting the most advanced digital government in the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ilves recalls how Estonia faced massive economic challenges upon achieving the restoration of independence in 1991, a time that soon saw the emergence of the Internet.</p>
<p>Toomas realized the opportunity was that Estonia was no further behind than any other country in this field, and so began pioneering their adoption, with all schools being online by 1998 and the framework for E-Estonia in place by the early 2000’s.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and Estonia now enjoys an entirely digital society – Via a single digital identity everything except weddings and real estate can be transacted online, including voting.</p>
<p>Not only is it a convenience but it’s also the foundation for a prosperous and healthy society. Being entirely digital has meant Estonia has continued uninterrupted during Covid-19, and their ‘E-Residency’ program has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninaangelovska/2019/04/25/estonias-e-residency-contributed-e14m-to-its-economy-e-residency-2-0-will-be-a-true-forerunner/#5cef94179da5">contributed €14m to its economy</a>.</p>
<p>A keynote theme is that size and money isn’t the essential ingredient for success.</p>
<p>Toomas now lives in the heart of Silicon Valley in the USA, and despite their vast wealth and being surrounded by the behemoth tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook, American digital government is surprisingly poor. Processes are still paper-based, requiring photocopies be taken to government offices, whereas Estonians can file&nbsp;taxes in only six clicks in two or three minutes.</p>
<p>Scotland, a similarly sized small nation and with an unparalleled history of invention, absolutely could emulate Estonia and achieve and enjoy an equally advanced digital nation.</p>
<p>As SNP leaders like <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/18554995.scots-must-seize-future-build-strong-digital-nation/">Martin Docherty</a>, <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18515370.agenda-follow-estonias-lead-digital-revolution/">Doug Chapman</a> and <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/17353185.angus-robertson-we-should-introduce-a-scottish-digital-citizenship/">Angus Robertson</a> have written for The National, Scotland’s opportunity is to emulate the Baltic nation one fifth the size of Scotland but that has achieved the staggering accomplishment of becoming the world’s leading digital nation, following their own independence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18515370.agenda-follow-estonias-lead-digital-revolution/">Writing for The Herald</a> the SNP’s Spokesperson for SME and Innovation Douglas Chapman issues a rallying cry for Scotland to emulate the similarly sized digital nation exemplar, highlighting how their entirely online society has meant they could adapt easily to the challenges of Covid-19.</p>
<blockquote>
 “Estonia dared to dream and took that leap of faith; Scotland should be next.”

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The backbone of Scotland’s digital economy will be a central interconnecting technology for linking all citizens to all applications, from tax returns through healthcare records. 
<p>In Scotland there is clearly documented need for such a system, with huge economic benefits also to be gained from its implementation.</p>
<p>The Scottish Council for Development and Industry <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scotland-urged-close-healthcare-%E2%80%98data-gap%E2%80%99">identified</a> that:</p>
<p>“The Scottish Government must invest in data, digital and technology in health and social care to help Scotland recover from Covid-19. </p>
<p>Closing the data gap in the sector could be worth £800m a year and deliver savings of £5.4bn to NHS Scotland. SCD said better data would help to build resilience against future public health challenges, which in turn will drive a healthy economy.”</p>
<p>The report identifies what it calls ‘Scotland’s Data Gap’ – the gap between ‘the health &amp; social care data we collect, utilise or share today and the health &amp; social care data we need and could collect, utilise or share in the future’ to better design and deliver care and services. It says that trust and transparency is key.</p>
<p>Health &amp; social care data needs to be ethical, secure and anonymised as far as possible with robust governance arrangements for use and sharing.</p>
<p>Similarly for their report <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/dialogues-about-data-building-trust-and-unlocking-the-value-of-citizens-health-and-care-data/">Dialogues about Data</a>, Nesta and the Scottish Government embarked on a year-long dialogue with Scottish citizens to understand their opinions and ideas for the use and sharing of health and care data and to explore possible futures that improve outcomes for everyone.</p>
<p>“Pre-COVID-19, public trust in the use of personal data was at an all-time low in the wake of scandals such as Cambridge Analytica. As more complex and personal data is held about us digitally, including genomic and biometric data, it’s becoming ever more important to build public trust around how data is used, both at an individual and population health level, now and in the future.”</p>
 Web 3.0 – A New Paradigm 
<p>As was <a href="https://digitalscot.net/digital-healthcare-guddle/">reported</a> a year ago Scotland’s Healthcare systems are in a state of ‘guddle’ – Lacking strategic direction and suffering from a situation of disjointed IT as the root issue holding up Integrated Health and Social Care in Scotland.</p>
<p>The cause of this is the predilection of governments for organizing themselves via very rigid hierarchical departmental structures, from which flows equally rigid, departmental-centric IT systems, creating ‘silos’, islands of information that must then be connected to other islands to facilitate the end-to-end processes that span across all of them.</p>
<p>The best way to tackle this situation is not to create these islands in the first place, to instead design and build a holistic, single data environment. The most effective example of this is the Internet, and it will be it’s ongoing evolution to ‘Web 3.0’ that will create a ‘rising tide that floats all boats’ universal solution to the problem that Scotland can harness.</p>
<p>This is defined primarily through the emergence of a decentralized approach to applications and data. Patient records won’t be held centrally in a monolith EHR, but will instead be distributed to and owned/controlled by the users themselves.</p>
 Personal Data Ecosystems 
<p>Watch the Digital Scotland <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTD7nnrl36o">webinar replay</a> with Julian Ranger of Digi.me to learn about the concept of ‘Personal Data Ecosystems’ and how they might be implemented in Scotland.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Digi.me offer an personal data solutions platform, that can be used for any permutation of scenarios, such as <a href="https://consentry.com/">testing and managing Covid-19 risk</a>.</p>
<p>Apps like <a href="https://digi.me/healthy-me/">Healthy Me</a>&nbsp;from digi.me are an example of this new paradigm and how the decentralized approach tackles issues common to IT, like data privacy, by distributing the workload and privacy control to the users themselves.</p>
<p>Initiatives like&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData</a>, of which digi.me plays a key role, are setting out to develop the global movement that will establish the framework for adoption of this approach, defining the methods and governance for regulating this model of data exchange.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://futurescot.com/data-sharing-concerns-raised-by-primary-care-practitioners-at-scottish-parliament-inquiry/">FutureScot reports</a>&nbsp;at a recent parliamentary hearing on Scottish digital healthcare this approach was called for:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What we should be aiming for it a central digitised record that the patient has ownership of. And I think any of the professions that are arguing for increased access to records, increased ability to write into records, we need to be mindful that we need to take patients with us on that journey and consent is absolutely essential.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Scotland’s opportunity is that while these approaches seem futuristic, through vendors like Digi.me they are implementable today.</p>

<p>This is my first newsletter as the new Executive Director for DINZ and the very first thing I’d like to do is thank Andrew Weaver, our outgoing ED, for his tremendous leadership throughout our establishment phase and to wish him all the very, very best on the next stage of his journey. Andrew has worked tirelessly over the last two and a half years to ensure we are working towards a world where people can safely express their identity to fully participate in the digital economy and society overall.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Good luck Andrew and all the best. E te rangatira, tēnā rawa atu koe. Kia pai te haere<br>&nbsp;<br>I’d also like to reflect a little on why I feel so privileged to have been offered the opportunity to take up this role.<br>&nbsp;<br>Clearly, we are living in an age of unprecedented advances across a broad range of technologies, not just in digital but in biotech, in engineering, in pharmaceuticals, in energy, in advanced materials, in 3-D printing, in nanotech, in robotics; the list is a very long one!<br>&nbsp;<br>If you are familiar with work from the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.information-age.com/technology-converting-scarce-abundance-peter-diamandis-123483251/">Peter Diamandis</a>&nbsp;(co-founder of Singularity University and X-Prize), Jeremy Rifkin (of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/">the zero marginal cost society</a>&nbsp;fame) and&nbsp;<a href="https://salimismail.com/">Salim Ismail</a>&nbsp;(author of Exponential Organisations) you will be aware that they evangelise a coming age of abundance, driven by the mass adoption of these advancing technologies.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, anyone who’s read or listened to Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee around what they call&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/the-great-decoupling">The Great Decoupling</a>, will be aware that access to this abundance has not been equitable to date, and that the technology-driven rise in labour productivity seen in the last few years has not been matched by an equivalent rise in prosperity for the majority of people.<br>&nbsp;<br>To me it is very clear that equitable access to technology is&nbsp;the&nbsp;key driver in ensuring that the benefits of a tech-driven age of abundance can be provided to all people, not just the lucky few. It is also very clear to me that digital identity is at the very heart of ensuring that equitable access.</p>

<p>The DIF Steering Committee has approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. Here is a snapshot of the four companies and four implementations that stretched and built the specification.</p> Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity <p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p> What exactly is a “Sidetree”? <p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains — but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF&nbsp;members.</p> The team that delivered the specification <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA,&nbsp;USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in&nbsp;DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON,&nbsp;Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX,&nbsp;USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New&nbsp;Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p> The first generation of Sidetree&nbsp;Systems <p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION&nbsp;nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION&nbsp;node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION&nbsp;network.   What’s next for&nbsp;Sidetree <p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given&nbsp;type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">Sidetree Protocol reaches V1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
