<p><a href="http://index.as/">Index.as</a> is a Web3 native, no-code, organizational and content curation tool taking aim at the content discovery space. It offers creators, curators, and topical experts the ability to create their own search ecosystems and independently control the value of their curation. The Index team chose to build on Ceramic's new decentralized graph database, <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb">ComposeDB</a>, because of its ability to facilitate decentralization and support interoperable ownership and discovery.</p><p>Index.as is building tools to enable context-based discovery to become as powerful as social discovery. Platform-controlled content distribution purposefully inhibits cross-platform discovery and seeks to capture and hold hostage user attention. This limits users’ ability to discover engaging, interesting information outside of these silos, trapping them with the same or irrelevant content instead of revealing corners of the internet that pique curiosity and delight. Additionally, these businesses wrest value away from creators, concentrating power at the distribution layer. To solve these problems, Index.as set out to build a tool that helps builders, creators, and communities connect atomized information without creating another walled garden—opening vast opportunities for authentic content playgrounds.</p> How it Works <p>Data ownership, signing and authorization via DIDs and interoperability with shared schemas offered Index.as a reliable framework to build on top of. Indexes are schemas that represent context and become curated maps based on users’ tastes and motivations. They act as niche, topic-based search engines that are both searchable and filterable. For example, product curations are automatically sortable by price, brand, or event, and can be filtered by date, location, and other relevant criteria.</p><p>Additionally, it allows the product to index data from specified models such as profiles, indexes, and links and makes it easy to define one-to-many relations between documents. Every new element in an index (e.g., a product, video, or article) can be related to the Index document, creating a complete and interoperable graph.<br><br>You can learn more about how Ceramic powers applications <a href="https://ceramic.network/how-it-works">here</a>.</p> Composability in Action <p>Index.as’s partners are collaborating on developing and reusing data models on <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb">ComposeDB</a> (Ceramic's composable graph database) for a variety of use cases. Veeo is focused on an interoperable web annotation model to support knowledge mapping. <a href="https://www.csensemakers.com/">Csensemakers.com</a> is leveraging the aforementioned index schema to enable decentralized curation of scientific research.</p><p>Developers can access a wealth of data simply by reusing established models, all while keeping ownership, access and authorization in the hands of users. Veeo and Csensemakers are bypassing the time and resources required to build and maintain siloed data structures by collaborating across models built in ComposeDB on Ceramic, and are speed-running the process of building network effects by automatically populating their dApps with network data.</p><p>Index.as is excited to continue development, first with multi-user curation and role-based access control via NFTs enabled by Lit Actions and subsequently with private indexes, incentivizing creators and curators to invest in developing experiences meeting the unique interests, tastes, and needs of their communities.<br><br>If you're interested in building your application on Ceramic you can learn more <a href="https://composedb.js.org/">here</a> or ask questions on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">forum</a>. </p>

<p>It is hard to imagine a world without passwords. They remain the most-used authentication method for consumers according to the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance’s annual Online Authentication Barometer, despite the fact that passwords almost universally fail at keeping accounts secure and preserving a smooth user experience. The death of the password will be a huge relief for users, removing the need to remember or type passwords and enabling better user experiences. For organisations, the upsides are just as powerful, with a passwordless future offering better improved security, reduced risk of data breaches and lower support costs. As we enter the new year, 2023 seems set to be the year when passwords finally become an endangered species.</p>

<p>Passwordless authentication has the potential to continue to grow in 2023. In any case, the tech giants, Microsoft, Google and Apple in the lead, within the FIDO Alliance, are doing everything to ensure that the adoption happens as soon as possible. To quickly summarize what we had already explained previously, authentication without passwords, or passwordless , has, as its name suggests, the purpose of allowing you to connect to sites and services without passwords.</p>

<p>ISO Publishes Registry and Repository Standard from OASIS to Securely Manage and Disseminate Information&nbsp;</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, 23 February 2023 — OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced that the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/regrep/regrep-core/v4.0/os/">OASIS Electronic Business eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) Registry and Repository (RegRep) v4.0</a> has been published as a global standard by the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO) as <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/83479.html">ISO 15000-3</a>, Electronic business eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) – Part 3: Registry and repository. ISO 15000-3 is one of many data and documents standards approved by <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/53186.html">ISO Technical Committee (TC) 154</a>.</p>



<p>Originally produced by the OASIS ebXML Registry Technical Committee (TC), ebXML RegRep v4.0 is a standard that defines the service interfaces, protocols, and information model for an integrated registry and repository. The repository stores digital content while the registry stores metadata that describes the content in the repository. The ebXML registry standard has been deployed in diverse applications by organizations worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ebXML RegRep standard allows for greater interoperability and cooperation between public and private authorities. Versions of ebXML RegRep are used in domains such as healthcare and geospatial information. The current version of the standard is adopted by one of the European Commission’s initiatives, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/OOTS/OOTSHUB+Home">Once-Only Technical System</a> (OOTS) for exchange of official documents and data for EU citizens and businesses. It is also used in OpenPeppol in pre-award electronic tendering specifications: “<a href="https://docs.peppol.eu/pracc/profiles/p006/index.html">Search Notices</a>” and “<a href="https://docs.peppol.eu/pracc/profiles/p008/index.html">Publish Notice</a>”.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ebcore/">OASIS ebXML Core (ebCore) TC</a> provides continued maintenance and related work on ebXML RegRep and other OASIS ebXML specifications. Its newest specification added an <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/ebcore/ebrr-ebms/v1.0/cs01/">ebXML Messaging binding for RegRep</a>.</p>



<p>“It is great to see ISO and OASIS working together in order to advance the ratification of ebXML specifications, in this case ebXML RegRep,” said Nikola Stojanovic, an author of the ebXML RegRep standard. “Congratulations to the EU teams on implementing such major initiatives while leveraging the ebXML RegRep standard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Single Market is one of the EU’s greatest achievements. Online procedures mean that ever more citizens and businesses can make use of their rights and live, work, and do business in different EU countries. Through the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, the Commission and the EU Member States are implementing a large-scale distributed system called the Once-Only Technical System supporting the exchange of evidence in administrative procedures,” said Joao Rodrigues Frade, Head of Sector at the Directorate-General for Informatics of the European Commission. “The Once-Only Technical System will use OASIS RegRep version 4.0 as a key specification for the common services and secure exchange of evidence i.e. official documents exchanged by public administrations on the explicit request of the citizen. In this context, we welcome the adoption of this specification as use of open standards is a core principle of the Once-Only Technical System architecture.”</p>



<p>“OASIS ebXML RegRep is a robust specification for the definition of queries and realization of data requests to public registries,” said Andriana Prentza, Professor at University of Piraeus. “It has been proven very valuable in the realization of the once-only principle and implementation of data services that enable the service discovery and exchange of information between data consumers and data providers.”</p>

 We need everyone around the table to move AI principles into practice. <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/maroussia-levesque">Maroussia Lévesque</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tom-zick">Tom Zick</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/dredeker">Dennis Redeker</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/you-jeen-ha">You Jeen Ha</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/florian-martin-bariteau">Florian Martin-Bariteau</a>, and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/mkortz">Mason Kortz</a> — inspired by discussions within the Rebooting AI Working Group at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;&nbsp;Society</p><p>The White House recently released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>. It consists of five high level principles and supplementary information detailing its relevance, expectations, and examples of good practices.</p><blockquote>We propose to build on the Blueprint, opening up the conversation between and across people working on AI governance from various&nbsp;fields.</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/about-this-document/">legal disclaimer</a> is careful to say that this is ultimately a non-binding white paper, so any expectation of binding legislation is off the table for now. The Blueprint aligns with a history of aspirational, yet mostly non-binding documents that articulate people’s rights and technology governance principles in the digital age. Such <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2687120#">Internet bills of rights</a> have been proposed by various actors including tech firms, civil society, and states. Even more closely related, documents outlining <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42160420/HLS%20White%20Paper%20Final_v3.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">AI principles have proliferated around the world</a>, mostly non-binding and mostly as high-level principles.</p><p>Yet the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights stands out from other such documents in several respects. First, the document was drafted in a relatively inclusive one-year process, which has been <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/listening-to-the-american-people/">well documented</a>. Second, it adopts a civil rights framing. Civil rights come with a body of clarifying case law, enforcing institutions and mechanisms, and a shared vocabulary to articulate, contest, and redress harm. Third, concrete <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/10/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-key-actions-to-advance-tech-accountability-and-protect-the-rights-of-the-american-public/">executive/administrative actions</a> accompany the Blueprint. This signals a comprehensive governmental approach to AI policy that is often missing and may allow the Blueprint to percolate across the various nooks and crannies of government. Fourth, the Blueprint attempts to complement high-level guidance with cues for implementation. In our opinion, this crucial piece is often missing to bridge ambitious policy ideas to the nitty-gritty task of implementation.</p><p>In this post, we explore how to further specify the Blueprint’s principles into workable guidance for engineers and others on the ground. We propose to build on the Blueprint, opening up the conversation between and across people working on AI governance from various&nbsp;fields.</p> Now what? <p>The Blueprint provides an opportunity to further translate general guidance into technical specifications for industry adoption. While “plug and play” recipes are challenging in light of the contextual variability across deployments, academic and civil society organizations can play a key role in mediating between theory and practice. The Blueprint’s breath is vast, but two areas conducive to such specification are discrimination and explanation. In what follows, we propose concrete ways for multi-disciplinary groups to narrow the gap between high-level statements and implementation.</p><p>Discrimination</p><p>The technical companion to the Blueprint purports to provide concrete steps to move the principles into practice. Its section on disparity assessment suggests three types of metrics: demographic performance measures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, as well as calibration. While this is a step in the direction of more explicit guidance, it still leaves important questions unanswered for the technical community at the frontline of implementing protections against discrimination. To name but one obstacle, some fairness metrics are mutually exclusive, in the sense that satisfying them simultaneously is impossible when demographic subgroups fare differently. As the <a href="https://perma.cc/2WAM-7QPM">controversy</a> about risk assessment tools in the criminal justice system illustrates, equalizing error rates entails a loss of accuracy when the base rate differs between demographic groups. The devil is, so to speak, in the&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer as to what fairness metrics should prevail. But developing a common language to bridge high-level equality principles with the actual task of measuring a model’s performance is a good starting point. A shared vocabulary will foster transdisciplinary debates and avoid the proverbial two ships passing in the night. This is a two-way street: those with legal and policy training should strive to get a more granular understanding of the statistical theory undergirding fairness metrics, while technical experts should grasp the contours of legal and ethical implications. As examples of this sociotechnical approach, questions for further research&nbsp;include:</p>  What is missing from the proposed metrics in the Blueprint?  Which fairness metric is most compatible with legal obligations in a given&nbsp;context?  Who should make judgment calls about which fairness metric to constrain a model&nbsp;with?  Are the existing siloed institutions (e.g. developers conceiving models ex-ante; courts reviewing harm post-facto) capable of making such&nbsp;calls?  How should we (re)think the pipeline between the technical front-line implementors and external oversight?  <p>Explanation</p><p>Much like discrimination, the notion of explanation in a colloquial and legal sense differs from the technical conception. Moreover, explainability is subject to technical limitations that inhibit its efficacy in a multitude of ways. The implementation guidelines for the Blueprint bundle the notion of ex-ante and ex-post explanations.</p><p>On the ex-ante side, the guidelines prescribe documentation reporting “how the system works and how any automated component is used to determine an action or decision,” as well as stakeholder notification when the system has changed. Ex-post explanations are more like justifications. The guidelines state this “need not be a plain-language statement about causality but could consist of any mechanism that allows the recipient to build the necessary understanding and intuitions to achieve the stated purpose.” The guidelines emphasize the need for such explanations to be tailored to their use and validated by user experience research. That’s great. But how that plays out in real world systems can get complicated.</p><p>The guidelines correctly point out that explainability is an active area of AI research. This means that ‘explanations’ from AI can take a variety of forms, some of which may not comport with intuitive definitions of explainability. Some explanations can draw on the data used by an AI to reach a decision. Others are completely ex-post, meaning that explanations can be provided by an entirely separate AI system that has been trained to output explanations for the original system’s recommendations. In other words, one AI system produces recommendations, another explains them. Some initial questions that come to mind&nbsp;are:</p>  What level of sophistication do AI explanations need to reach before they can fill the role the Blueprint envisions? Which types of explanatory AI have cleared this bar (if&nbsp;any)?  What should be contemplated in ex-ante documentation given the type of AI&nbsp;system?  How much of the system should be described ex-ante versus how much can ex-post rationales be relied&nbsp;on?  What does it mean for models to be fully transparent?  How should techniques for ex-post explainability vary with risk&nbsp;levels?   Next steps for building on the Blueprint <p>Neither policy, law, or technical approaches alone can build on the Blueprint. Just like carpenters, plumbers, and electricians contribute to building a house, we need different expertise to come together. In terms of AI governance, this requires technical systems to surface facts for human oversight, rather than baking in opaque editorial choices that resist external review. Thankfully, we have references in adjacent areas on how to improve the interoperability between technical implementation and external oversight. For instance, <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">data nutrition labels</a> provide qualitative assessments to inform external evaluations of data provenance, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf):">model cards</a> foster transdisciplinary discourse on fairness by detailing salient model parameters, and <a href="https://cltc.berkeley.edu/reward-reports/">reward reports</a> do the same for continually learning AI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The Blueprint provides a foundation for aligning AI systems with democratic values and civil rights and liberties, but it is ultimately up to all of us to build on that foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/building-on-the-blueprint-9471276f2cce">Building on the Blueprint</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, February 23, 2023  – Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge, will join co-presenter Melissa Handa, IEEE Program Director Technical Activities, at the NorthEast Regional Computing Program (NERCOMP) Annual Conference for an exciting discussion of Research Data Management for Open Science. NERCOMP partners with EDUCAUSE to bring together leaders in the higher education IT community from across the region at the NERCOMP Annual Conference.</p>
<p>Held March 27–29, 2023 in Providence, Rhode Island, the NERCOMP Annual Conference brings together IT and library professionals, faculty, researchers, and higher education leaders from across the Northeast to connect and share their experience and expertise on the latest issues in the field. With a goal of promoting collective learning, attendees are able to discuss their successes and challenges in advancing innovation, including data-driven decision-making, supporting audiovisual and IT services, and innovating student success.</p>
<p>The Research Data Management for Open Science session will explore the fundamental aspects, benefits, and challenges of data management and the requirements for a unified data and collaboration platform. Features of the IEEE DataportTM platform which support Data Management by researchers will be explored and demonstrated. “Open access is critical for advancing science, scholarship, and society,” says Dr. Ghahramani. “The challenge of ensuring the long-term preservation and access to the outputs of scientific research, especially data sets produced by publicly funded research projects, has become a prominent topic in this country. Data management and sharing policies are also increasingly becoming a requirement to qualify for research funding. For research data management to become a higher priority for researchers, they must see a clear benefit from devoting time, attention, and funds to these purposes.”</p>
<p>“In 2023, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will implement an updated data management and sharing policy,” explains Dr. Ghahramani. “Like similar policies implemented by other research funding organizations, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), researchers will be required to submit a data management plan as part of any grant proposal. There has been extensive research into why researchers do and do not share their data openly, and the major themes that arise are lack of time and skills necessary to organize the data into a form suitable for sharing.”</p>
<p>Attendees of this session will explore trends and patterns in data management, the barriers that currently exist, and the specific skills and training that are currently in demand for data management professionals. “Developing a skilled workforce with diverse ideas, styles, and identities will require attracting more individuals to the data management profession, specifically from under-represented groups in the community,” says Dr. Ghahramani. “We must strive to enable equal access to resources and opportunities and believe in the individual ability of all to learn and grow. Melissa and I look forward to connecting with conference attendees and discussing how we can work together to accelerate institutional research efforts throughout the region.”</p>

 What is the OpenWallet Foundation? 



<p>The <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallet Foundation</a> (OWF), which <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-an-intent-to-form-the-openwallet-foundation">announced its intent to form</a> last September, formally launched today, February 23rd (press release: <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">English</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/fr/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">French</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/de/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">German</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/it/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">Italian</a>, <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/de/newsroom/linux-foundation-europe-launches-open-wallet">Spanish</a>). As an open source project of the Linux Foundation, the mission of the OWF is to develop a digital wallet “engine” that anyone can use to build secure, privacy-respecting, interoperable multi-purpose wallets. The OWF compares this wallet engine to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines">the open source browser engines</a> that currently power all major Internet browsers.&nbsp;</p>



 Why is this important to the ToIP Foundation? 



<p>The mission of the OWF is highly relevant to the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) since our mission (described in our <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">Introduction to ToIP white paper</a>) is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layers with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers.</p>



<p>In this architecture, referred to as the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">ToIP stack</a>, digital wallets play a prominent role at the very heart. They are the tool that individuals and organizations—even connected things—will use to generate and store cryptographic keys, obtain and present digital credentials, make payments, exchange cryptocurrency and NFTs, unlock cars and hotel rooms, sign digital documents, and perform countless other digital trust tasks.</p>



 What does the ToIP Foundation expect to contribute? 



<p>Since the missions of ToIP and OWF are so complementary, the ToIP Foundation is joining the OWF as an Associate Member. We will support the development of OWF code projects by providing requirements, specifications, governance tools, and best practices as to how OWF code modules can accomplish interoperability using the ToIP stack. For example, ToIP deliverables immediately relevant to OWF include:</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a> 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Architecture V1.0</a> 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification V1.0&nbsp;</a> 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0</a> 
 



<p>ToIP also has two task forces currently working on protocols that can be incorporated directly into OWF code modules:</p>



 
 <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">The Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force</a> is developing <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">the ToIP Layer 2 protocol</a> that will enable authentic connections between any digital wallets and agents. 



 <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">The Trust Registry Task Force</a> is developing the protocol that any digital wallet can use to query a compliant trust registry for governance information—for example to verify if an issuer is authorized under a governance framework to issue a certain type of digital credential, or if a verifier is authorized to request presentation of a certain type of credential. 
 



<p>ToIP anticipates a rich ongoing dialogue with OWF as its coding projects implement ToIP specifications and OWF feedback improves ToIP specifications, tools, and guides.</p>



 Why another Linux Project? 



<p>The OWF represents the largest global collaboration on open source digital wallets since the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">decentralized digital identity</a>. It represents an expansion of — and ideally a collaboration with — the Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries digital wallet project</a> that began in 2019 and currently powers a first generation of open source digital wallets, such as the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-wallet">BC Wallet</a> from <a href="https://bcdigitaltrust.info/">BC Digital Trust</a>. The OWF will also build on years of work on decentralized identity standards and open source code at another Linux Foundation sister project: the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF). OWF is a wonderful complement to ToIP, Hyperledger, and DIF as the LF projects working to directly enable a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust.&nbsp;</p>

 State-of-the-art approaches to cybersecurity awareness training are challenging the old employee education models 







<p>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, February 22, 2023 /<a href="http://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — CybeReady, provider of the world’s fastest security awareness solution, today announced the availability of a new&nbsp;<a href="https://cybeready.com/live-talk-with-the-ciso-for-the-city-county-of-san-francisco">on-demand webinar</a>&nbsp;featuring Michael Makstman, CISO for the City &amp; County of San Francisco and Michal Gil, Head of Product Development for CybeReady. In this webinar, Michael Makstman shares his experience of using positive training techniques, combined with advanced automation to motivate more than 30,000 employees to take an active role in mitigating cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Known for its progressive approach to deploying innovative technologies, The Golden City decided to shift from a legacy security training model to engage in a more effective employee-centric cybersecurity culture. During the webinar, he shares how a positive and more modern training approach, combined with advanced automation, now motivates over 30,000 employees to take a more active role in mitigating cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Michael Makstman mentions the primary challenges faced by CISOs today:<br>1. Understaffed and overburdened security teams with endless tasks, which are time-sensitive and essential for keeping the organization safe.<br>2. The focus of employees on their own professional development and KPIs who view cybersecurity training as a waste of time.<br>3. Workforce dynamics such as a high number of remote employees with high turnover rates which is now resulting in additional risk and uncertainty from new, untrained employees.</p>



<p>According to Makstman, “The role of a CISO is no longer limited to the technology aspects of an IT environment. Being part of a larger ecosystem, CISOs must be part of the business and understand employees and customers in order to make better informed decisions. It includes looking at business aspects, understanding employees, and understanding the potential ramifications throughout the decision-making process.”</p>



<p>When it comes to security awareness training, the CISO’s challenge is amplified. Cybercrime is escalating and so are the attacks employees are facing. Organizations must embrace change to address these evolving challenges, and create a new culture-based training.</p>



<p>To start building a cybersecurity culture, Makstman suggests the following:</p>



<p>1. Define your KPIs – Set measurable goals you can work toward and choose a solution that allows you to track progress over time.<br>2. Set employees up for success – Deploy a positive training approach with immediate feedback for maximum success. Training sessions should be short and embedded in employees’ work day to generate quick, rewarding engagements.<br>3. Communicate continuously – Conduct the training in ongoing cycles to create multiple opportunities for engagements and at the same time, yield multiple data points for adapting the training to each employees’ performance.</p>



<p>“CISOs today have a lot on their plate. Training employees can be a tedious task if the wrong path is taken, which often results in training taking a backseat to other activities,” said CybeReady’s Head of Product, Michal Gil. “Having a highly automated security awareness platform that communicates continuously and ensures progress is the preferred direction for CISOs today.”</p>



<p>Following the webinar, the following resources were shared to help cybersecurity leaders build an effective cybersecurity awareness program:</p>

 Learn how Blockchain Laboratories is using web3 to bring more trust and better ROI to ESG markets, and how you can too. 







<p>SHERIDAN, WYOMING, UNITED STATES, February 22, 2023 /<a href="http://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — In recent years, digital assets have emerged as a revolutionary new technology that is beginning to change the way businesses operate. Digital assets are a form of cryptographic token that can be used to store and transfer data in a secure, immutable, and reliable manner. The potential applications of digital assets are seemingly endless, and businesses around the world are beginning to adopt this technology in order to take advantage of its potential benefits.</p>



<p>An advantage of ESG digital assets is the efficiency they provide. By using digital assets, brands can quickly transfer assets and track ESG related data knowing that it is publicly auditable. This can help to reduce overhead costs associated with data management and transfer fees. Also allowing businesses to quickly and easily access and track their ESG data.</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/lionsgate.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/esg-tokenization-forecast.jpeg?ssl=1"></a>



<p>Finally, digital assets can also help to reduce the risk of fraud. By using digital assets, businesses can securely store and transfer data in a way that is nearly impossible to forge.</p>



<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and its Potential to Conserve &amp; Increase Biodiversity</p>



<p>Also in the last few years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has come on the scene and is beginning to change the way financial markets operate. DeFi is a form of blockchain-based finance that allows anyone to access financial services without the need for a trusted third party. This new technology has the potential to revolutionize the way industries operate, and one of the areas in which it could have the most impact is ecological conservation and regenerative finance.</p>



<p>One of the potential benefits of DeFi for conservation and regenerative finance is increased transparency in carbon markets. By using DeFi for carbon credits, businesses can ensure that their financial transactions are transparent and secure. This increased transparency can help to validate ESG claims, and provide supporting data for ESG reporting.</p>



<p>Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and its Potential to Protect Biodiversity</p>



<p>And in more recent years, regenerative finance (ReFi) has become a trending topic to fund ecological projects, protect biodiversity, and to support regenerative practices on many types of landscapes. ReFi allows individuals and businesses to access ESG markets and services in a publicly auditable way. This new Green Finance model has the potential to have a major impact on biodiversity conservation and regeneration.</p>



<p>One of the potential benefits of ReFi for biodiversity protection and preservation is increased transparency through using digital assets and distributed ledger technology to track the whole lifecycle of eco projects. Another potential benefit of ReFi for biodiversity protection is increased funding going to the eco projects. By using ReFi, eco projects can quickly and easily transfer funds with minimal overhead costs and without any delays. This can help to reduce overhead costs associated with financial transactions, and create more funding for the work on the ground by making easier for eco projects to fundraise.</p>



<p>Innovators at the crossroads of ESG digital assets and ReFi PaaS</p>



<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carbonlanddao-trust-esg-nfts-protect-133000486.html">Blockchain Laboratories has been at the forefront of ESG digital assets</a>&nbsp;and the ReFi movement. Since April 2021 Blockchain Laboratories has been working on building Carbonland Trust’s carbon credit registry on the XRP Ledger. And although there have been setbacks to overcome that caused the development timeline to be extended, lots of progress has been made, and the carbon credit tokenization platform is scheduled to go live in April 2023.</p>



<p>And in more recent times, Blockchain Laboratories started&nbsp;<a href="https://blockchainlaboratories.com/blockchain-laboratories-announces-partnership-with-intrinsic-methods-to-build-carbon-credit-registry-on-xrpl/">building a XRPL carbon credit tokenization platform for Intrinsic Methods</a>. Intrinsic Methods Registry will use XRP Ledger to issue Future Mitigated Units(carbon credits) from reforestation projects globally.</p>



<p>In the near future, Blockchain Laboratories will be on scene at some industry events to network and share about the web3 platforms that were launching in the 2nd quarter of 2023. In March the events on our schedule are the Climate Summit in Denver on March 1st, the World Sustainability Summit(we are presenting here) in Dubai on March 16th-17th, and the World Blockchain Summit in Dubai on March 20th-21st.</p>



<p>Our goal in attending these summits is to share about what we have learned from two years of intense R&amp;D. And to showcase and bring attention to the ReFi Platform as a Service(PaaS) that we have developed over the last two years. We know digital assets and DLT have the potential to bring radical transparency to the ESG and carbon markets, and strive to be thought leaders in the industry.</p>

<p>This will be the last release before ComposeDB Beta goes live on Mainnet early next week. The <code>Model Versioning</code> feature provides backwards compatibility, even as future updates are made to the models protocol. The rollout involves a wipe of all models and ComposeDB data currently on Clay testnet, with breaking changes to model indexing and configuration table structure.</p><p>This release will allow devs to experiment with the HistorySync feature.</p> Model Versioning &amp; Table Config <p>The new table config structure includes a <code>version</code> field. Follow these steps below to update:</p>  Stop the node &amp; update packages  If using <code>SQLite</code> delete the existing database found at:   <code>~/.ceramic/indexing.sqlite
</code> <p>3. &nbsp; If using <code>Postgres</code> connect to the DB and drop the following tables: <code>ceramic_models</code>, <code>ceramic_config</code>, and any tables starting with <code>kjz</code>(the index table).</p><p>Example Postgres Structure:</p> <code> Schema |                              Name               |   Type   |  Owner
--------+-------------------------------------------------+----------+---------
 public | ceramic_config                                  | table    | ceramic
 public | ceramic_models                                  | table    | ceramic
 public | kjzl6hvfrbw6c8c48hg1u62lhnc95g4ntsl...vsbjtw374 | table    | ceramic
</code> <p>4. &nbsp;Start up the node: you'll see <code>ceramic_models</code> and <code>ceramic_config</code> tables be created as part of the startup message.</p><p>5. &nbsp; Recreate your models using the latest <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-modeling/introduction-to-modeling">ComposeDB tooling</a></p> History Sync <p>History Sync enables developers to index models and sync all history for the model, enabling full backwards and forwards composability. History Sync will be run by default after the Beta release next week, but if you want a sneak preview, you can try out History Sync by adding <code>CERAMIC_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_SYNC='true’</code> when <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/set-up-your-environment#run-a-ceramic-node">starting your daemon.</a></p>  ComposeDB Beta on Mainnet <p>Thank you for your incredible patience and excitement leading up to our Mainnet launch of ComposeDB Beta on February 28th. We are less than a week away! Stay tuned for more details.</p>

<p>DIACC is hosting a series of spotlights showcasing our amazing female DIACC members in the digital identity space, noting the importance of diversity. These spotlights will be regularly socialized through DIACC’s LinkedIn and Twitter channels as well as our monthly member newsletters.</p>



<p>If you’re a DIACC member and would like us to feature your spotlight,&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/contact-us/">contact</a>&nbsp;us today to learn more!<br></p>


 
 


<p>What has your career journey looked like?<br>I started my career in media as a customer success manager, then got into media sales which lead to working in technology sales in business intelligence. From there I did some consulting and wound up in cybersecurity where I found my sweet spot: product marketing. From there I have focused on scaling and growing innovative technologies; AI and now digital identity. It’s a very exciting time to be contributing the to DI ecosystem globally.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?<br>I wanted to be the CEO of a international marketing agency and a part-time travel photographer for National Geographic.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>The barriers I’ve encountered&nbsp;are reflected across&nbsp;women in the tech industry:&nbsp;<br>1. Lack of mentors<br>2. Lack of female role models in the field<br>3. Gender bias in the workplace<br>4. Unequal growth opportunities compared to men<br>5. Unequal pay for the same skills&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Working for companies with cultures that match my value work/life balance, turning off slack, and prioritizing my personal and family life after 5 pm (easier said than done).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>❝Creating an environment that encourages girls from an early age to pursue technology fields is essential in advancing their participation in the workforce.❞</p>
Alana Bennett</blockquote>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Creating an environment that encourages girls from an early age to pursue technology fields is essential in advancing their participation in the workforce. Whether it’s donating to organizations, promoting young women in STEM, volunteering to mentor, or developing company policies that push for more diversity and inclusivity, there’s plenty to do to shape the future for many girls and women globally.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?<br>Representation is a key step in creating an inclusive and equitable environment where all employees can do the best work of their lives. Today’s companies are well aware that women in positions of power can lead to more innovation and better outcomes. Organizations can develop meaningful programs to develop technical talent, which not only supports women but helps diversify‌ representation and ideas, which often leads to even more innovation. Internships or job shadowing programs provide a chance for women to gain tangible technology skills. Mentorship programs that help employees learn, develop, grow and thrive in today’s ever-changing environment.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?<br>Income inequality compared to male colleagues, workplace gender bias and a shortage of female role models are among the main barriers faced by women working in the tech industry. Women are often underrepresented in leadership positions in tech companies. This can make it difficult for women to advance their careers and achieve their goals.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?<br>Advocate for yourself, and know that reaching outside of your comfort zone with the support of strong mentors and a company that shares your values can take you far.<br><br>Alana Bennet is the Product Marketing Director at <a href="https://atbventures.com/">ATB Ventures</a></p>

     <p>While many countries are trying to meet their climate goals, and companies are embracing ESG by moving away from ICE vehicles, higher utilization of EVs has boosted the demand for charging stations. EV charging infrastructure development is making headway, CPOs, corporates and fleet operators are adding more charging ports every day, and the charger hardware itself is becoming more user-friendly and interoperable, but there are other issues that must be addressed. Among them, how to avoid stressing the power grid and reduce charger downtime are top priorities.</p>
<p>ASJade Technology’s smart EV charging solution tackles these problems with advanced hardware and management software, allowing EV owners to keep their vehicles charged while maintaining a stable grid, providing utilities greater flexibility during times of increased need. It can be particularly useful for companies that operate many EVs or communities that have many private EVs that need to be charged but not necessarily all at once. Future work includes vehicle-to-grid or vehicle-to-home technology that can allow certain EVs to transmit electricity back to the grid during peak hours, or to power a home during an outage. When combined with decentralized renewables-generating platforms such as roof-top solar power along with battery energy storage systems, this can make EV charging even more flexible.</p>
<p>Besides, as more public charge points and networks are available, the EV-drivers are left with choice paralysis when planning a long-distance trip such as driving from Nuremberg to Porto. EV drivers will need to investigate and install several parking &amp; charging network apps that could use different payment methods. The lack of interoperability and trust among eMobility service providers and charge point operators led to fragmented charging network. One of the potential solutions to overcome this challenge is to incorporate decentralized identifier and verifiable credential service that enabled by consortia or Federated networks such as <a href="https://itn.global">ITN (Integrated Trust Network)</a>.</p>

 Multichain Decentralized Knowledge Graph: AI-grade Knowledge Assets Hub on the OriginTrail Parachain <p>This blogpost outlines the next development milestones within the scope of the multichain strategy pursued by the OriginTrail ecosystem and amends relevant sections of <a href="https://origintrail.io/roadmap#turing">the roadmap pertaining to the OriginTrail Parachain development and its overarching role in devising a future blueprint for </a>allowing more blockchain networks to integrate the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;(DKG).</p><p>The OriginTrail technology presents a unique two-layer decentralized system, designed for sharing trusted data as AI-grade knowledge assets made discoverable across the Internet. The core component, OriginTrail Decentralized Network hosts the multichain Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), integrated with multiple blockchains. With each blockchain connected to the DKG, the DKG semantic features of Knowledge Assets are enabled on that particular chain.</p> AI-grade Knowledge Assets are a new, dynamic resource for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The next generation DKG V6 is following the expected growth trajectory, with OriginTrail Parachain underpinning its cutting-edge features. The key innovation V6 brings are dynamic AI-grade Knowledge Assets, with prescribed ownership, designed to drive unprecedented potential network effects as they gain existence on the new DKG V6. The AI-grade knowledge asset represents a leapfrog innovation as a new, dynamic resource on the Internet with the following main features:</p>  Ownership through the non-fungible token (NFT): Each Knowledge Asset is created with an NFT token (inaugurally on the OriginTrail Parachain), enabling trusted ownership of the underlying structured knowledge;  Verifiability: Each Knowledge Asset state can be verified using a cryptographic proof on the blockchain;  Discoverability: Each Knowledge Asset has its own Unique Asset Locator (UAL), similar to how websites have&nbsp;URLs;  Asset knowledge graph: Knowledge Assets have AI-grade data structure and their growing knowledge graph can be private and public (e.g. metadata/indexing data is always public, the rest of the knowledge can be kept privately), thus capable of powering AI and ML algorithms in a fully decentralized manner;  Composability: Due to their underlying vehicle — the DKG, each Knowledge Asset can be connected to others to form a connected knowledge about anything (scientific research, supply chains, value transactions, IoT data…) and establish an unprecedented potential for the value generation based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metcalfe’s law on network&nbsp;effects</a>.  The anatomy of a DKG Knowledge Asset<p>You may learn about the growing number of solutions and industries that are being positively impacted by the knowledge assets&nbsp;<a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions">here</a>.</p> Multichain approach <p>The multichain approach, envisioned in the initial 2017 whitepaper, embodies the 3 key principles of the ecosystem — neutrality, inclusiveness and usability — driving the DKG expansion to blockchain ecosystems that benefit from the unique capabilities of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph.</p><p>With the recent launch of DKG V6 on the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, the DKG receives an additional, tailored blockchain environment to both further innovation on the DKG, as well as to devise new means and approaches to expand the infrastructure and creation of Knowledge Assets on other blockchains (Polkadot Parachains and EVM compatible networks alike). The potential value of knowledge assets interconnected across blockchain networks integrated in the DKG, will grow according to Metcalfe’s law of network&nbsp;effects.</p><p>After DKG V6 inaugural launch on ecosystem’s own L1 — the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, an important milestone was achieved, as this DKG-specific blockchain became both an AI-grade Knowledge Assets Hub for innovations in the semantic web space as well as an acceleration environment for developing new approaches for expanding the DKG to other EVM-capable blockchains (multichain strategy, starting with Polkadot Parachains). Each expansion will be decided within the OriginTrail community through an auction-like selection process (the blueprint to be rolled out in the<a href="https://origintrail.io/roadmap#metcalfe"> Metcalfe phase of OriginTrail’s roadmap</a>).</p><p>With <a href="https://teleport.origintrail.io/">nearly 85 million TRAC utility tokens teleported</a> to the OriginTrail Parachain (23% of circulating supply) to provide utility needed on the DKG V6, we now aim to address the following topics under the scope of the multi chain strategy within the Turing phase <a href="https://origintrail.io/roadmap#turing">of the&nbsp;roadmap</a>:</p>  Strengthening decentralization for the OriginTrail Parachain,  OriginTrail Parachain Token (OTP) availability,  OriginTrail multichain growth.   Strengthening decentralization for the OriginTrail Parachain <p>In the Turing phase of the roadmap, we will see the OriginTrail Parachain reach its maturity as a decentralized blockchain. This will be achieved by initiating the OriginTrail Parachain collators system, OriginTrail Parachain’s governance system and performing the sudo removal&nbsp;process.</p><p>Both collators and governance systems will be introduced through an RFC document open for inputs from stakeholders before their deployment on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet and mainnet. Both will also follow the good practices that we’ve already seen established in the Polkadot community and leverage some of the battle-tested components.</p><p>Successful integration of both components will be followed by the sudo key removal process, which will be detailed in the Governance RFC document.</p><p>RFCs pertaining to strengthening decentralization topics are planned to be released in&nbsp;March.</p> OriginTrail Parachain Token (OTP) Availability <p>As described in the OriginTrail whitepaper, OTP’s basic utility is to facilitate the transactions in the OriginTrail consensus layer (similar to ETH used on Ethereum). With the inaugural deployment of the OriginTrail DKG V6 on the OriginTrail Parachain, there has also been a growing need to access OTP to use the DKG v6 functionalities. Partially, this has already been addressed through the OTP bounty distributed during the TRAC Teleport process. Additionally, there are 4 other important developments coming in the Turing phase — the OTP sponsorship pallet, XCM enablement, OTP availability on Statemint (<a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/t/statemint-update-roadmap/1200">in line with their roadmap</a>), and Ledger hardware wallet support for&nbsp;OTP.</p><p>The OTP sponsorship pallet’s aim is to support the knowledge asset users by “sponsoring” the costs of gas fees for Knowledge Asset interactions (create, update, transfer) on the OriginTrail Parachain. By doing so, the core functionalities of the DKG v6 will be accessible to anyone even before additional options to obtain OTP tokens are available. The sponsorship pallet will substitute the need for a converter on the OriginTrail Parachain and will, before deployment, be also introduced in an RFC document detailing its implementation.</p><p>Another important milestone for OTP availability which will take place in the Turing phase is integration with Statemint via XCM. The exact timeline is largely dependent on the<a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/t/statemint-update-roadmap/1200"> Statemint roadmap</a> but is expected to happen in the coming months. This will allow anyone to obtain OTP on the decentralized exchange and transfer it to the OriginTrail Parachain using XCM to be used for DKG and OriginTrail Parachain functionalities.</p><p>Final availability milestone in the Turing phase is a dedicated OTP app on Ledger devices. We can confirm that through our collaboration <a href="https://twitter.com/_zondax_/status/1592173152364384256">with Zondax</a>, we have submitted the final version of the OTP app for review with the Ledger team. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/origin_trail">our Twitter </a>for any updates on the review process timeline.</p> OriginTrail Multichain Growth <p>The fact that the OriginTrail DKG is a network integrating with multiple chains has already proven valuable for efficiency and resiliency of the OriginTrail ecosystem. With the launch of the new OriginTrail V6 in December, we are also turning a new page in the OriginTrail Multichain approach, ensuring that the Knowledge Assets and its functionalities can be accessed across more blockchain ecosystems.</p><p>Opening access to blockchains other than the OriginTrail Parachain will start within the Polkadot ecosystem (leveraging the core Polkadot capabilities), followed by possibilities of other EVM-compatible blockchains to integrate with DKG as well. In the Turing phase, we are expecting 3 important developments in this process — the conclusion of the TRAC teleport process, integration with the Polkadot Snowbridge system and detailing the DKG integration capabilities and requirements for Polkadot Parachains.</p><p>The Teleport process for TRAC tokens started last August and has so far seen over 84 million TRAC get transferred from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain (23% of circulating supply). The teleported TRAC tokens are used to fuel the DKG functionality on the OriginTrail Parachain and have been implemented as a native token on Polkadot, allowing it to leverage all other Polkadot capabilities (including XCM transfers between Polkadot parachains). Teleport will conclude on 22nd of March 2023 with a total of up to 100 million TRAC having the possibility to be teleported from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>Following the teleport process, there are no planned movements of TRAC between Polkadot and Ethereum until the Polkadot-supported <a href="https://docs.snowbridge.network/">Snowbridge infrastructure</a> is in place. Their treasury proposal suggests a Polkadot deployment of the infrastructure in July 2023, which would be the requirement for further integration with TRAC to take place with an RFC detailing the process available before that, in the Turing phase of the OriginTrail roadmap.</p><p>Finally, the Turing phase will also see more details on how the OriginTrail DKG can get integrated on other parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing the first wave of multi-chain network effects. While all the details on the approach will be available at a later stage, it is expected that the approach will leverage core Polkadot capabilities like&nbsp;XCM.</p> Towards a human-centric knowledge economy <p>With the advent of AI-grade Knowledge Assets as the new resource on the Internet made possible with the DKG V6, the potential to spawn a human-centric knowledge economy has become a possibility. Each Knowledge Asset gaining existence on the DKG is discoverable and verifiable across the universe of otherwise disconnected systems, which constantly expands the value potential based on the Metcalfe’s law of network effects and then materializes in connections generated to form connected knowledge about anything.</p><p>The AI-grade Knowledge Assets hub on the OriginTrail Parachain is now envisaged to spawn new methods to bring the powers of the DKG to other parachains on Polkadot as well as any EVM-compatible blockchain, furthering network effects across a multiverse of communities. Upon validation of each reusable component within the OriginTrail-specific blockchain environment, more Web3 teams will gain a chance to leapfrog their value proposition with these strong semantic web fundamentals.</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Join our mission</a> in making the global economy work, by organizing the AI-grade Knowledge Assets!</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing trusted AI — grade knowledge assets.

<p>The death of the internet password has been proclaimed many times, but this time, it may actually be coming sooner than you think. Its replacement? The passkey.</p>



<p>Passkeys are the way of the future in basic internet security as they’re intrinsically more secure and phishing resistant, according to Kathleen Moriarty, the chief technology officer at the Center for Internet Security. As major companies including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL">Apple</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL">Google</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;work with the standards developed by the FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium — two organizations that create password authentication standards — to provide support for passkeys on their platforms, the list of organizations offering passkeys as an alternative to passwords is continuing to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Passkeys are an example of what security should be: seamless and invisible to the end user,” said Moriarty.</p>

But the era of password-protected vaults may soon be a thing of the past, as leading tech companies, including 1Password, are pushing for a new form of authentication technology that is more secure than passwords called passkeys. The company recently&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.1password.com/unlock-1password-with-passkeys/">announced</a>&nbsp;plans to support passkeys in the summer of 2023, allowing users to log in to accounts without using a master password.</p>



<p>This move follows the acquisition of ID authentication start-up Passage and the company’s announcement last year that users would soon be able to log in to apps and websites through its platform using passkeys. While 1Password already supports biometric authentication, CPO Steve Won believes that “For passkeys to be the way forward, it’s not enough for them to replace some of your passwords. They have to be able to replace all passwords – including the one you use to unlock 1Password.”</p>

<p>Internet passwords death may have been proclaimed many times before. But this time, with Apple, Google, and Microsoft going big on passkeys, you might soon have to say goodbye to passwords.</p>



<p>So what exactly are passkeys, and how will they make internet passwords obsolete? Well, there are many great things that this new technology has to bring to the table. And when it goes into the full-fledged integration mode, you feel old using passwords for your accounts. Let’s take a deeper dive to understand more about it.</p>

<p>After hearing that&nbsp;<a href="https://niemopen.org/">NIEMOpen</a>&nbsp;was awarded the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2023/01/26/niemopen-initiative-for-information-exchange-and-csaf-cybersecurity-standard-win-oasis-open-cup-awards/">2023 OASIS Open Cup</a>, you may be interested in learning more about the new OASIS Open Project. With the assistance of&nbsp;<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a>, the current technology darling of the moment, here is a quick summary of what you need to know about NIEM.</p>



 What is NIEM? 



<p>NIEM, formerly known as the “National Information Exchange Model,” is a framework for exchanging information between public and private sector organizations. The framework includes a for using and extending the data model in information exchanges.</p>



<p>NIEM promotes scalability and reusability of messages between information systems which allows organizations to share data and information more efficiently. It was launched in 2005 in response to the U.S. Homeland Security Presidential Directives to improve information sharing between agencies following 9/11. Since then, NIEM has been updated and maintained in a collaboration between the U.S. federal government, state and local government agencies, private sector, and non-profit and international organizations with new versions released roughly annually.&nbsp;<a href="http://niem.github.io/niem-releases/5.2">NIEM 5.2</a>, the latest version released in December 2022, defines a set of common objects, “NIEM Core,” and 17 sets of objects that are specific to certain government or industry verticals, “NIEM Domains.”</p>

<p><br><br>Dear DIF community,</p><p>After my 3.5 years as the voluntary Executive Director of DIF, I am excited to announce my successor Clare Nelson who has joined as full time ED as of Feb 1st, 2023.</p><p>In reflecting on our progress and development over the last few years, I am incredibly proud of the evolution &amp; growth we’ve achieved.</p><p>DIF working groups have delivered various well received specifications like <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1">SideTree</a>, <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2">DIDComm</a> v2 and <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0">Presentation Exchange</a>. &nbsp;We’ve incubated <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">DIDAuth</a> which grew to become a joint effort at the OpenID foundation. Many of the other working groups are making great progress around core elements in the technology stack like decentralized storage &amp; wallet security.</p><p>Membership has grown from around 80 members to over 350 companies and more than 100 individual contributors. DIF has established itself as one of the leading organizations in the broader (decentralized) identity ecosystem and established strong connections with partner organizations like ToIP, W3C, OpenID Foundation, Hyperledger, etc. - and in various cases, established cross-ecosystem collaborations like the DIF facilitated cross-community Interoperability Group.</p><p>Motivated by DIF’s goal to increase global access, education &amp; collaboration, we established virtual events, regional working groups, and special interest groups. In doing so, we educated hundreds of new people about what’s going on in our industry, established a more permanent exchange amongst organizations in the APAC region including a <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-Japan">Japanese-speaking chapter</a>, and created industry-specific working groups around verticals like <a href="https://www.notion.so/Banking-and-Finance-SIG-b2d528af578d44699aeb742ed47b81d2">Banking &amp; Finance</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-IoT">IoT</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-Hospitality-and-Tourism">Hospitality &amp; Travel</a>.</p><p>DIF as an organization has also evolved significantly. Working groups are largely empowered to operate independently. A technical steering committee (TSC) has been introduced to ensure strong communication &amp; collaboration across these working groups. The overall strategic direction &amp; leadership is provided by the Steering Committee, whose seats are now filled by members based on a yearly election process voted by all membership organizations, rather than based on financial contributions to DIF. &nbsp;DIF has introduced a free membership tier to increase inclusivity for members around the world, and has grown the supporting team from none to three members, whilst becoming a financially stable &amp; sustainable organization.</p><p>As DIF continues to grow and the ecosystem matures, the need for a dedicated Executive Director to bring the organization to the next level has become clear. Over the last months of interviews, we found an excellent candidate for the role. Clare brings a lot of experience in leading organizations, a strong technical background as well as industry experience. I am excited to work with Clare as I continue in my role as a DIF steering committee member. Stay tuned for a welcome message from Clare in her own words.</p><p>To sum up: It has been an honor to serve as the ED of DIF. I am inspired by all we have achieved together, and the positive impact our community can have in the world. I look forward to working with Clare, and all of you, in realizing the very best of these possibilities.<br></p><p>Rouven Heck</p><p>Executive Director at DIF 2019-2023</p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Ceramic nodes operating on Ceramic mainnet must upgrade to at least version <code>2.20.1</code> of the <code>@ceramicnetwork/cli</code> package or the docker image before February 21st.</p><p>The Ceramic core team implemented the network's first hard-fork on February 15th. The team discovered a bug during post hard-fork validation related to an incorrect smart contract address. An immediate hot-fix was deployed to address the issue and will prepare Ceramic nodes to use the proper smart contract address.</p><p>As a result of the hot-fix, Ceramic nodes operating on the Ceramic mainnet must upgrade to running at least version <code>2.20.1</code> of the <code>@ceramicnetwork/cli</code> package or the docker image before February 21st. </p><p>We will continue to share status updates as we work on this via the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Forum</a>. </p><p>Update Feb 22: You might see the AWS error below while updating, please disregard:</p><p>"NOTE: The AWS SDK for JavaScript (v2) will be put into maintenance mode in 2023. Please migrate your code to use AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3).

Enabling HistorySync requires breaking changes to the Ceramic anchoring system.<br><br>There are two main changes we are making to the way anchoring (timestamping) works:</p>  Transactions to put anchor tree merkle roots onto Ethereum will no longer be simple regular transactions. &nbsp;Instead there will be an anchor smart contract and we will call an “anchor” function that causes the smart contract to emit an “anchor event” that ethereum RPC clients can subscribe to. &nbsp;This will make it easier for Ceramic nodes to discover when anchors happen and to sync the history of anchor events.  The second change is designed to make the system more resilient to block reorgs on Ethereum. Ceramic anchor commits will no longer include the specific blockNumber and blockTimestamp that the anchor event was included in, as it’s possible the transaction could later be reorged into a new block. Instead, Ceramic will only use the transaction hash and will look up which blockNumber the transaction was included in from Ethereum directly.  <p>Both of these changes require changes to the js-ceramic node implementation so that the node can still know how to verify and apply anchor commits with the new behavior. Nodes that haven’t upgraded will have failures when applying anchor commits.</p><p>Data update commits that fail to be anchored within the CACAO timeout period will then start failing to apply as the node will not be able to verify that the update was created during the time when the CACAO (the capability that gave the app permission to write into the stream on behalf of the user) was valid. This can wind up corrupting the state of streams and invalidating writes that seemed to be applied successfully at first, but then are later invalidated when their CACAO times out.</p>

<p>Cisco, Comcast, Dropbox, Indeed, Tencent America, TrustArc, Uber, U.S. NIST, and Other Leading Organizations Represent U.S. Technical Advisory Group Under ANSI and OASIS to ISO/PC 317</p> 


<p>New York, NY, and Boston, MA – 16 February 2023 — The U.S. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for Consumer Privacy by Design successfully concluded its mission with the publication of a new global standard approved by the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO). Administered by the <a href="https://www.ansi.org/">American National Standards Institute</a> (ANSI), in partnership with OASIS, the U.S. TAG was a major contributor to the new international privacy standard, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/84977.html">ISO 31700</a>, Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services. This standard represents the first set of preventative international guidelines for assuring that consumer privacy is embedded into the design of a product or service, offering protection throughout the whole life cycle.</p>



<p>Members of the U.S. TAG included leading U.S. companies and government agencies committed to privacy rights for consumers. The U.S. TAG carried U.S. positions forward to ISO Project Committee (PC) 317, the international committee that developed <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/iso/iso317002023">ISO 31700-1</a> and a related technical report, <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/iso/isotr317002023">ISO 31700-2</a>, with the input of 17 participating member countries. The U.S. TAG provided extensive input into both documents, promoting and representing U.S. interests at each stage of the process.</p>



<p>“ISO 31700 is a significant development. Both those with experience — and those new to the domain of privacy by design — will find this standard an essential tool to guide them in creating goods and services with privacy by design,” said Jonathan Fox of Cisco and chair of the U.S. TAG to ISO/PC 317. “The U.S. TAG is pleased to have played a part in bringing ISO 31700 to the global community as an international standard.”<br><br>“Data protection is the work of many. Regulators, organizations, and human interest organizations all have a role to play to ensure that data is processed with respect for human rights. The new standard helps provide tools for organizations looking to implement statutory protections and good privacy policy for the data they manage. It focuses on the empowerment of the individual, transparency into data processing, and accountability and responsibility by those who process the data,” said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive officer of the Future of Privacy Forum. “Privacy by design and default is an essential part of the process, ensuring that data is protected from collection to deletion when it is no longer needed. We congratulate the companies and government agencies involved in this work and ANSI and OASIS for their support.”</p>



<p>The standard will impact online service providers, mobile application developers, providers of digitally connected consumer technologies, and more.</p>



<p>ISO 31700-1 and ISO 31700-2 will continue to be guided by the OASIS Privacy Management Reference Model (PMRM) and the 27561 Privacy Operational Model and Methodology for Engineering (POMME) in development now (based on the PMRM).</p>



<p>ISO hosted a webinar on February 8, 2023, to introduce ISO 31700. <a href="https://share.ansi.org/Shared%20Documents/News%20and%20Publications/Links%20Within%20Stories/Webinar%2031700.pdf">Access the slide deck</a> from the event for more information.</p>



<p>Support from U.S. TAG Members<br>“Cisco is honored to have helped lead the U.S. Technical Advisory Group and contribute to the development of ISO 31700 – Consumer Protection, with Jonathan Fox serving as chair. This new standard will serve as an indispensable, tactical guide to privacy by design for companies of all sizes.” <br>– Harvey Jang, vice president, deputy general counsel and chief privacy officer, Cisco</p>



<p>“Tencent America is proud to have played a role in shaping international privacy standards as a member of the ANSI. Tencent is committed to connecting people, services, and devices, as well as businesses and future technologies, to create mutually beneficial ecosystems for all. With this in mind, we will continue to align with the globally recognized consumer privacy standard set forth in ISO 317.”<br>– Tencent spokesperson</p>



<p>“TrustArc was involved in the development of ISO 31700 from the outset and we believe that the publication of ISO 31700 highlights the importance for companies to build a culture of privacy and trust with consumers. Incorporating privacy by design principles throughout the life of a product is essential to helping companies meet their compliance goals.”<br>– Chris Babel, CEO, TrustArc</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>With a great sense of accomplishment, it’s exciting to share the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final.pdf">Digital Identity in Aotearoa: Identity and Trust in an Increasingly Digital New Zealand</a>&nbsp;report published earlier this month.</p>



<p>The report combines DINZ’s latest results from its survey of people and businesses carried out last year, with perspectives on the state of the growing digital identity ecosystem comprising local and international providers, government and business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ensuring people are delivered secure and privacy-aware identification, authentication and authorisation services, to support a trusted fraud-free digital economy in Aotearoa is the shared goal – and a complex one requiring a range of approaches as the reports’ recommendations make clear.</p>



<p>It also recognises that people have the right to choose a non-digital channel over the convenience of a digital one. Regardless, their personal information must be processed respectfully with the attendant care for security and privacy that it deserves. The concept of digital identity is quite new, with emerging tech continually fueling conversations to challenge yesterday’s status quo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation at the AWS sponsored Wellington event last week was terrific and I expect similar at the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-in-aotearoa-report-and-research-results-virtual/">online event on 9 March</a>. Such a pity that the cyclone forced the cancellation of the Air New Zealand sponsored Auckland event but I hope that all registered for that can make the online event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No doubt not everyone will agree with everything in this report. But that’s why this space continues to attract endless, if sometimes circular conversation that remains the essence of its attraction – it will never simply be ‘done’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please take time to read the report, form your view and share it with colleagues, iwi, hapū &nbsp;and whānau, to form their view as well as DINZ.</p>



<p>The conversation in Aotearoa will be all the richer for it.</p>

Unlike an SQL database there are no joins to worry about.</p><p>Sign In With Web3</p><p>Sign in With Web3 enables secure authentication for users with wallets from Ethereum, Solana, and other popular blockchains.</p> Plug into a data ecosystem <p>The cold-start problem prevents developers from reaching a critical mass of data to make their apps valuable to users, devs building on ComposeDB gain access to a rich ecosystem of interoperable data on day one.</p><p>Plug-and-play data models</p><p>ComposeDB includes a catalog of data models; when devs reuse models they gain access to the data sets stored in those models—allowing data to be shared across applications.</p><p>There will be about 5,000 models from over 300 contributors by the time Beta launches, different use cases include models for: blog posts, verifiable credentials, profiles, messages, follower lists, and more.</p> Scale data across applications <p>Since ComposeDB is built on Ceramic it’s designed for fast write times, high transaction volume, and permissionless data verifiability. Unlike value blockchains, Ceramic uses asynchronous, parallel transaction processing and eventual consistency to power the world’s largest data applications.</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates on our hackathon at EthDenver and please continue to provide your feedback about ComposeDB on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Forum</a>. </p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/category/futures/"></a>When Neal Stephenson coined “the metaverse” three decades ago, his book Snow Crash was found on the shelves of “science fiction”. While the book remains in that category, many of its concepts are now found in reality… 
<p>Fast forward to 2022, where numerous companies are now building toward their version of the metaverse, including Neal himself, working on his latest venture Lamina1, drawing on his experience as a builder at MagicLeap, Blue Origin, and more.</p>
<p>While the present metaverses don’t perfectly mimic that from Stephenson’s early imagination, we get the unique opportunity to discuss the various design decisions that he’s making, but also the intersection between the metaverse and gaming, the involvement that AR/VR might play, the evolving role of IP, how artificial intelligence fits in, what he’s building and why, and where he gets all of his ideas from.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/webinars/future-of-education/"></a>A headline theme for our <a href="https://digitalscot.net/webinars/future-of-education/">upcoming webinar series</a> is to explore the role the ‘Metaverse’ might play in transforming Scottish Education. 
 In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqQMs-S4zw0">Tedx talk</a> Renaat Toppets reveals the ins and outs of using virtual worlds for education and answers the question of the year: will the Metaverse replace traditional education? 
<p>Digital guru Bernard Marr explores <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZxABVWzz3s">How Will The Metaverse Transform Education</a>, where he describes how the metaverse is poised to create more engaging, meaningful experiences for students of all ages.</p>
 The promise and the worry 
<p>The Center for Universal Education and the Yidan Prize Foundation co-hosted a virtual event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV7GW-RLKNc">Education meets the metaverse</a>: The promise and the worry, to consider a path for bringing the best educational practices into the metaverse, stemming in part from a recent policy brief.</p>
<p>A moderated discussion of expert panelists sought to answer questions such as: How can those creating educational products for the metaverse work with educators and scientists to ensure that children experience real human social interaction as they navigate virtual spaces?</p>
<p>How can we empower and support children as they safely explore these spaces? Is there a real eye to diversity in the representation and access to what is created?</p>
 Scottish Pioneers 
<p>As described in <a href="https://digitalscot.net/scottish-schools-eduverse/">this previous article</a> Eduverse pioneers in Scotland include the ESMS schools in Edinburgh and Forfar Academy.</p>
<p>There are also exciting startup ventures: <a href="https://www.edify.ac/">Edify</a> was founded by Scottish entrepreneurs with backgrounds in immersive content and technology Martin McDonnell and Chris Bryson.</p>
<p>With Edify educators can create and share lessons and immersive learning content with students across desktop, mobile, and virtual reality. This means they can:</p>
 
 Teach complex and abstract subjects more effectively and in more engaging ways. 
 Work in virtual labs to conduct challenging or costly experiments safely and on repeat. 
 Travel in time and experience historical sites as they were centuries ago. 
 Level up the in-person learning experience, using virtual reality to go anywhere and do anything.

<p>The ToIP Foundation is pleased to announce the appointment of Judith Fleenor as full-time Executive Director. Judith is taking over the role that John Jordan, Executive Director of Digital Trust Services for the Province of British Columbia, has served in a part-time volunteer capacity since the Foundation’s inception in May 2020. John has been elected to serve as Chair of the Steering Committee.</p>



<p>Judith first joined the ToIP Foundation as Director of Strategic Engagements in May of 2021, a role in which she helped grow the organization to over 400 organizational and 100 individual members and coordinate the Foundation’s engagement at events including the Internet Identity Workshop, the European Identity Conference, Identiverse, and the ToIP 2022 Summit.</p>



<p>Judith recently sat down with John to have a conversation about her new position.</p>



<p>Congratulations, Judith. What was your reaction when the Steering Committee invited you to become Executive Director?</p>



<p>Frankly, I was surprised and honored when the Executive Committee came to me with the proposal. Titles have never been that important to me. I’ve always been about how I can use the skills I have and what I enjoy doing to help move an effort forward. One of my favorite sayings comes from Lao Tzu:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Go to the people.<br>Live with them. Learn from them. Love them.<br>Start with what they know.<br>Build with what they have.</p>



<p>But with the best leaders,<br>when the work is done,<br>the task accomplished,<br>the people will say<br>‘We have done this ourselves.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was an honor to be asked with a group of wonderful individuals who are all volunteering their time and talents to make a real difference in the future of the Internet. What could be more fulfilling than that?</p>



<p>What motivated you to initially join ToIP as Director of Strategic Engagements?</p>



<p>I have always had an interest in Identity and Access Management (IAM), dating back to my time as Director of Training Delivery Worldwide at Netscape. We were promoting the use of LDAP, and the courses we were giving on IAM made me quickly realize that digital identity goes way beyond the need for authentication and access. It is a very complex topic with multiple interweaving issues.</p>



<p>The reality is that the way we have been designing digital identity systems has not matched the way identity works in the real world, where we naturally share different identity attributes in different contexts. For example, in some contexts a person needs the freedom to be anonymous or pseudonymous, while in other contexts the need for individual and community security requires a greater ability to correlate.</p>



<p>As a result, the field of digital identity and trust is always interesting and challenging—even more so when you want solutions to be decentralized and vendor-neutral. It requires deep thinkers who look at problems from multiple perspectives. The ToIP Foundation is a place where these thinkers can collaborate to take on these tough challenges. As the song from the musical Hamilton put it, “I want to be in the room where it happens.”</p>



<p>What resonates with you about the mission of the Foundation?</p>



<p>The mission of the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) is to simplify and standardize how trust is established over digital networks and using digital tools. Our goal is to achieve this by bringing together (and developing when necessary) robust, common standards into a complete architecture for internet-scale digital trust.</p>



<p>While it is easy to state that mission, it is anything but easy to execute on it. It takes a high-functioning collaborative community to get it right. Very few of the protocols within the ToIP stack will be developed within the ToIP Foundation. Some are being developed at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), some at W3C, some at other standards development organizations. Some will be nurtured by multinational organizations, others by open source projects, others by entrepreneurs as yet unknown.</p>



<p>I think the part of the ToIP stack that most resonates with me is the central piece, the concept of a <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">trust spanning protocol</a> that can be used by other higher-level protocols for many different trust tasks, yet works across ecosystems built for different purposes. This is just like how the Internet Protocol works everywhere, yet supports many other higher-level protocols built for many different purposes.</p>



<p>This means we need the equivalent of an IP address, but for digital trust relationships—which is what the trust spanning protocol will provide. Note that I use the term “digital trust”, not “digital identity”, because when we say “digital identity” we most often think of humans, whereas the ToIP stack needs to work not only for people and organizations—in all their complexity—but for objects and data as well.</p>



<p>What are your top three priorities for 2023 in your new role?</p>



<p>Collaboration, Collaboration, Collaboration!</p>



<p>Seriously—the challenges we are trying to solve at the ToIP Foundation all require collaboration at three levels:</p>



 
 Collaboration between different working groups and task forces within ToIP itself. I want to work with our members and Linux Foundation experts to create better processes to facilitate that collaboration. 



 Collaboration across the various communities and foundations in the digital identity, credentialing, and business transactions space. I’d like to help reduce marketplace confusion about who is working on what, iron out differences, and focus on crossover work efforts. 



 Collaboration with government(s) to help educate and influence the adoption of decentralized digital trust infrastructure. For example, when governments begin issuing verifiable digital credentials that citizens can use to prove their identity – as digital versions of the same documents every government does for its citizens today in physical form, it has the potential to streamline and strengthen processes, while providing cost saving and added security. It’s no coincidence, John, that you are leading just such an <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023CITZ0003-000076">effort in British Columbia right now</a>. John, you are forging a path for your Canadian citizens that has the citizens’ best interest in mind. I want ToIP to be a resource for governments everywhere to understand that not all verifiable credentials methodologies are the same and that the choice they are making now, have long range implications. As governments roll out their solutions, it will be a massive boost to adoption. We need to help governments understand the implication of the decisions they are making to allow them to make the best decisions now. 
 



<p>How can potential collaborators get in touch with you to follow up?</p>



<p>One of the benefits of being Executive Director of an international non-profit organization is that it is very easy to reach out to me. You can fill out the contact form at our website, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">trustoverip.org</a>. I get copied on all of those. I’ll try to reply to your message as soon as I can. If you are already a member of ToiP, just send me a direct message via our Slack workspace.</p>

<p>Because India is home to the <a href="https://becknprotocol.io/">Beckn protocol:</a> one that enables peer-to-peer e-commerce at scale without the big platforms taking a large cut of the pie just for matchmaking. The possibilities are endless and extreme—especially for customers and small businesses.</p>
<p>Beckn is open source (<a href="https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications">here on Github</a>),&nbsp;&nbsp;moving into deployment, and expected to grow toward ubiquity on the same slope as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar">Aadhaar</a>, the government ID now held by 1.35 billion people.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective,&nbsp;India has more people than all of Europe (even when you throw in Russia and Turkey), and more than twice the population of North America. Only China has more people, but India is ready to overtake it in <a href="https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/indias-population-will-overtake-china-by-2027-world-population-prospects-2019-1560850930-1">just four years</a>.</p>
<p>We will discuss all this and more&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://fide.org/founders/sujith-nair/">Sujith Nair</a>&nbsp;this coming Monday, 20 February, from 2-3:30 PM Eastern Time.&nbsp; He is the CEO &amp; Co-founder of <a href="https://FIDE.org">FIDE.org</a>, the nonprofit behind the Beckn protocol, and may have the clearest vision in the world toward an e-commerce future that isn’t contained inside big tech’s walled gardens: ones in which every business and every customer can operate with both independence and minimized friction.</p>
<p>This will kick off the Workshop’s next&nbsp;<a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/news-events/events/salon/index.html">Beyond the Web salon series</a>&nbsp;. Stay tuned for more in the coming months, but be sure to catch this one. It could hardly matter more for what our project has worked toward since 2006.</p>
<p>It’s both in-person and online, and free. But you need to register. Do that <a href="https://events.iu.edu/ostromworkshop/event/806588-ostrom-workshop-beyond-the-web-sujith-nair-co-ceo">here</a>.</p>

<p>Are you a civil society organisation or collective working within or with the health sector? Are you thinking about ways to collect, manage and store data more efficiently and securely? Are you looking to strengthen your organisation’s capacity around responsible data practices? Please read on, our Light Touch Support programme might be a great fit for you!</p>



<p></p>



 How we can support you 



<p>One of our goals for the year is to increase our offer of support to organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support</a> (LiTS) programme, we offer lightweight, pro bono support to organisations and individuals with questions about using data or technology in their social justice work. We work with a wide array of individuals and organisations, usually from within Latin America and Africa, most of whom work on some aspect of social justice. Our partners’ technical backgrounds are as varied as the work they do – some are looking for specific, technical advice on their projects, while others want to get more familiar with broader conversations around using data or technology in their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the beginning of a LiTS partnership, we connect with our partners to learn more about their work and understand the challenges they are facing. We then devise a support plan – the exact shape can vary and depends on the identified needs and context, but it often includes a mix of knowledge sharing, provision of technical feedback, drawing specific recommendations, facilitating connections to other organisations or experts, and sharing useful research, tools or resources.</p>



 Supporting organisations working on health and social justice&nbsp; 



<p>Organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice collect, manage and store a lot of data through community health projects, research programs and advocacy campaigns, and a significant portion of that data is often sensitive data that needs to be protected. Many organisations that reach out to us are interested in expanding&nbsp; capacity and expertise to securely and responsibly collect, manage and store data, particularly sensitive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data collected from civil society has the potential to complement and enhance official state data collected by National Statistical Offices (NSOs) on various pandemics and epidemics such as HIV, TB and COVID-19 and their impact on marginalised groups. The repercussions of those pandemics have contributed to broader conversations around data and public health, such as:</p>



 
 Advocating for health data that is inclusive: Who is not being counted and who is left behind as a result? 



 Investigating how data is being used and managed: Who has control over our data and what is it being used for? 



 Learning about the risks associated with data: Can health data be used to abuse marginalised and vulnerable populations? 
 



<p>For many organisations, these conversations have sparked reflections at the organisational level and, through our work, we see that many groups working at the intersection of health and social justice are grappling with questions such as:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Are the ways we collect, share and store data and information that are more secure and more responsible? 



 How can we decide on what data to keep, and which one to delete? 



 How can I explore if there’s a risk for our data to be accessed by unauthorised external parties?&nbsp; 



 How are the ways we use data impacting our work? 



 Are the digital platforms we use safe and effective for our context?&nbsp; 
 



<p>We support our partners by providing space to reflect on these questions, and offer tailored resources to strengthen organisations’ data practices and processes. </p>


 
<a href="https://calendly.com/the-engine-room"></a> 


<p>What do we mean by organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice?<br>By organisations working at the intersection of health and social justice, we are referring to civil society organisations working in the health sector in various ways, such as: advocating for access to care, addressing health inequities, influencing public health policy, providing support and care to beneficiaries, etc. This broad category can also include:<br><br>– Organisations focusing on specific health issues (such as HIV, TB, Malaria, or COVID-19),&nbsp; at a policy and/or advocacy level.<br>– Organisations promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and/or reproductive justice.<br>– Organisations working on human rights issues that involve a health component, such as LGBTQ+ organisations addressing mental health issues, trans organisations advocating for access to gender affirming therapy, youth organisations promoting access to sexual and reproductive health services for young people, and more.<br>– Organisations directly providing specific health services to communities.</p>



 Going beyond Light-Touch Support 



<p>Once your organisation has <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">engag</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">e</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">d with our Light Touch Support</a> multiple times, and it seems like you and your work might be a good potential fit for more intensive support, we may propose an exploratory call to discuss <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Matchbox-partnership</a> possibilities.</p>



<p>Through our Matchbox Programme, we support selected organisations, over a period of 6 – 8 months, to think through the design, development and implementation of their data and tech project or general strategy – customising the support to the specific needs and contexts of our partners. Matchbox support can include targeted research, matchmaking with other organisations, and tailored recommendations.</p>

 “INEEXS” project leverages digital technology to create new business models for utilities and energy service companies <p>ZUG, Switzerland, 14 February 2023 — Energy Web has joined a new, EU-funded initiative to enhance the value of energy efficiency solutions across Europe. The initiative, “Innovative Energy Efficiency Service Models for Sector Integration via Blockchain’’ or INEEXS, is primarily focused on improving the business case for energy efficiency with the help of open source digital technologies. To do so, INEEXS will enable market participants to exchange granular building, asset, and organizational data in a secure, privacy-preserving way. Solutions under the initiative will be deployed in Germany, Spain, Greece and one additional EU member country to be selected during the deployment process.</p><p>Energy efficiency and demand flexibility solutions continue to follow a positive growth trajectory across Europe. However, a series of technical barriers and regulatory challenges prevent these solutions from being adopted at the scale needed to facilitate the European Union’s transition towards a clean energy economy. INEEXS is primarily focused on overcoming technical barriers to progress by enabling energy service companies, retailers, distribution system operators, financial institutions, and distributed energy resource aggregators to exchange trusted data from organizations and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Over the next three years, the initiative will launch new technology and associated business models in support of this objective. As a first step, INEEXS will analyze five primary energy efficiency business cases, their legal requirements, cost structures, revenue streams, and benefits beyond cost savings in order to prioritize technology development activities under the initiative.</p><blockquote>“We couldn’t be more excited to bring our open source technology stack to this initiative” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “Energy Web solutions are designed to support this exact use case — enabling multiple market participants, each with their own information technology systems to exchange and trust granular data — in this case data powering energy efficiency solutions across&nbsp;Europe.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Elaborating innovative and fitting business models by active market participants is pivotal if we are to address the existential challenge of transforming the energy system”. Explains Filippos Anagnostopoulos, Senior Associate at IEECP and Project Coordinator. “The INEEXS project offers a unique opportunity to energy retailers, energy communities, technology developers, energy agencies and real estate companies to validate, replicate, adopt and roll concrete technical solutions with potentially transformative impact.”</blockquote><p>By adopting new digital technologies, methods, and tools to enable automated, accurate, fast and secure data exchange, INEEXS meets the key principles of the European Green Deal; More information can be found on the project webpage: <a href="https://ieecp.org/projects/ineexs/">https://ieecp.org/projects/ineexs/</a></p><p>Partners: IEECP — Institute For European Energy And Climate Policy (the Netherlands), HERON — Iron Thermoilektriki Anonymi Etaireia (Greece), NTUA — National Technical University of Athens (Greece), ESCAN (Spain), ENERCOOP- Cooperativa Electrica Benefica San Francisco De Asis Sociedad Cooperativa Valenciana (Spain), DOMX (Greece), VL — Verdia Legal (Spain), BEA — Berliner Energieagentur (Germany), OFFIS (Germany), Inlecom Group (Belgium), HIVEN (Finland), Energy Web Foundation (Switzerland).</p><p>Co-funded by the European Union under project ID101077033.

 The release of Energy Web’s Decentralized Data Hub on Microsoft’s Azure Marketplace significantly improves user experience for enterprise <p>ZUG, Switzerland — 13 February 2023 — <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-2022-lookback-navigating-the-storm-before-the-calm-9b056e02d8dc">2022 was a major turning point</a> for Energy Web. Whereas in the past much of our effort was devoted to innovation and experimentation, last year our focus shifted entirely to execution–specifically, delivering new features and functionalities across three core solutions.</p><p>We, and our community of enterprise members, are now crystal clear about what <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/what-we-do-the-grid/">problems we solve</a> and how our open-source software solutions create tangible business value. The question is no longer what we’re going to build, but how to streamline implementation.</p><p>As demonstrated by many other software categories with huge addressable markets, the best way to scale adoption and impact is to make our solutions available on-demand, with the click of a button. Or in other words, make EW-DOS look and feel like conventional enterprise Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).</p><p>In December we took the first step in this direction with the release of <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-now-available-on-amazon-9bb6c65375ca">RPC on AWS Marketplace</a>. Today we’re pleased to announce another step forward with the r<a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/energywebdevhubgmbh1670375546257.ewf-data-exchange-client-gateway?tab=Overview">elease of Data Exchange client gateway on the Azure Marketplace</a>. This is an important milestone, as it represents our first core enterprise solution component to be made available with a seamless user experience, and without the need for specialized technical resources.</p> What is the Data Exchange Client Gateway, and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>The Data Exchange Client Gateway is a key component of <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-data-exchange/">Energy Web’s Data Exchange solution</a>: it’s the application that provides the UI and APIs for interacting with shared messaging infrastructure to send, receive, and authenticate messages. One of the main value propositions of the client gateway is providing a single, standardized integration method for many independent organizations to exchange information across various messaging channels.</p><p>The client gateway was developed in support of the Data Exchange solutions deployed in <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-study-project-edge/">Project EDGE</a> and <a href="https://www.westernpower.com.au/community/news-opinion/project-symphony-premieres">Project Symphony</a> in Australia. These projects are demonstrating how a shared industry data hub can <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/canary-in-the-sunshine-australia-is-showing-the-rest-of-the-world-what-a-modern-grid-looks-like-ce95832cc017">enable better utilization of customer-owned, distributed energy resources</a> (“DER”, such as rooftop solar and battery storage systems) by improving coordination between AEMO (the national grid and wholesale market operator), distribution network utilities, and aggregators. Compared to the status quo approach to data sharing, which relies on a multitude of point-to-point integrations between individual companies, a shared data hub will help enhance DER visibility and ensure consistency across market participants, while maintaining standard cybersecurity and reducing costs to industry.</p><p>There are several dozen other markets around the world that need similar solutions for sharing and validating DER data among multiple entities, especially in the US (where r<a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">egulations like FERC 222</a> are removing barriers to DER market participation) and Europe (where <a href="https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/Publications/Position%20papers%20and%20reports/TSO-DSO_ASM_2019_190416.pdf">coordination between transmission and distribution grid operators</a> is <a href="https://www.ceer.eu/documents/104400/3731907/C16-DS-26-04_DSO-TSO-relationship_PP_21-Sep-2016.pdf">a regulatory priority</a>). As Energy Web we see a major opportunity for our Data Exchange solution to unlock the full potential of DER all over the world, and so making the Client Gateway as user-friendly as possible as at the heart of our technology roadmap.</p> DDHub on Azure: How it Works and Why it&nbsp;Matters <p>The EDGE and Symphony trials have been ongoing since 2022 and while overall results have validated the value of a shared data hub, a <a href="https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2022/project-edge-lessons-learnt-2--final.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=0A6D7D1A47CE168E130983F082EA9CDE">key lesson learned is that integration needs to be&nbsp;simpler</a>.</p><p>The Client Gateway is an independent application that each market participant runs within an environment of their choice. Up until now, the process of deploying and maintaining Client Gateways across multiple companies was complex, manual, and required specialized technical knowledge of advanced topics like containers and orchestration.</p><p>The reality is that not all electricity market participants have the internal capabilities to manage this manual deployment model and even those that do don’t always have spare capacity. Further complicating matters, because this approach requires each company to independently download, install, and configure the Client Gateway application, coordinating both initial installations and ongoing maintenance and update releases was challenging and time-consuming.</p><p>Making the Client Gateway available on Azure obviates the need for any specialized IT resources and reduces the time to install the application by 90%. Additionally, participants are able to natively integrate the Client Gateway application with other Azure services (for example, Azure Key Vault) that they already use and need to integrate with the shared data hub. Taken together, this means the Energy Web Data Exchange solution is not only better positioned to support existing projects, but production-grade solutions in any other&nbsp;market.</p> Conclusion <p>2023 is going to be a pivotal year for Energy Web, as the global energy transition is hitting an inflection point right as we’re evolving from delivering individual projects to delivering software solutions that are repeatable and scalable. Our whole focus is simplifying the user experience for enterprises to adopt these solutions not just in the innovation sandbox, but the core operational business.</p><p>Making the Data Exchange Client Gateway available as an Azure marketplace offering is an important step in realizing our vision of a complete EW-DOS-aaS. Going forward, in the near term we will continue to expand marketplace offerings. Later in Q1 we will share additional updates on our plans to make all of our solutions available “as-a-Service” via managed service, third-party resellers, and fully self-hosted options.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>This post was originally published at <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/news/solidarity-not-solutionism-wayfinding-just-paths-digital-infrastructure-serves-planet" title="APC.org">APC.org</a>.  </p>



<p>On 25 January, the European Digital Rights initiative (EDRi) hosted <a href="https://privacycamp.eu/" title="">Privacy Camp 2023</a>, which brought together digital rights advocates and technologists with a call to explore the critical infrastructure of digital technologies, and how they feed into and foster the multiple crises we inhabit.</p>



<p>We (Becky Kazansky, senior research consultant with The Engine Room, and shawna finnegan, Technology and Environmental Justice Initiative coordinator with the Association for Progressive Communications, APC) welcomed this opportunity to deepen and expand the conversation around digital rights, climate and environmental justice, and brought together a hybrid panel with Lili Fuhr, Paz Peña, Plamen Peev and Narmine Abou-Bakari, titled “<a href="https://privacycamp.eu/panel-solidarity-not-solutionism-digital-infrastructure-for-the-planet/" title="">Solidarity not solutionism: digital infrastructure for the planet</a>“.</p>



<p>The panel discussion provided space to reflect on some of the false climate solutions that digital rights advocates should be aware of amid efforts to act in solidarity with environmental defenders and climate justice movements. We invited participants in the session to reflect on shared demands for accountability across our struggles for digital rights, environmental protection and climate justice, and consider opportunities and mechanisms for collaboration.</p>







 Calling out false climate solutions and tech complicity 



<p>Our panel followed on research conducted last year by The Engine Room and APC, and a number of other collaborators, within a <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/learning-reflections/intersections-of-digital-rights-and-environmental-and-climate-justice/" title="">research consortium</a> exploring the intersection of digital rights, climate and environmental justice.</p>



<p>The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/7356/ter-final-report-07-07-22.pdf" title="">research</a> highlighted the lack of transparency around the climate and environmental impacts of the tech sector, where bold pledges have been made in recent years with very little detail of actual progress made available to the public. Despite the opacity of the tech sector, it’s clear that tech companies often rely on dubious tools to claim they’re minimising harms and working towards “carbon neutrality”.[1] One example the research touched on is carbon offsetting, an increasingly common practice long decried as a “false solution” to climate change by the global climate justice movement. Recent evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe" title="">more than 90% of carbon offset schemes have none of the positive impacts they claim</a>, while also increasingly <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2022/12/12/total-congo-offsetting-land-dispossessed/" title="">infringing on the rights of peoples and their territories</a>.</p>



<p>Alongside The Engine Room’s research, APC published a set of <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/interstice-digital-rights-and-environmental-justice-four-issue-briefs-inform-funding" title="">issue briefs</a> based on over a decade of experience working alongside partners around the world on climate and environmental issues. One of the issue briefs developed by APC member and Bulgaria-based foundation BlueLink and APC looked at where environmental governance frameworks can be used as levers for accountability at the intersection of digital rights and climate concerns. For example, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polluter_pays_principle" title="">polluter pays principle</a>” has contributed to the development of policies and standards for <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/extended-producer-responsibility.htm" title="">Extended Producer Responsibility</a>.</p>



<p>What this research underlined for us is how important it is for communities already working towards more just approaches to technology to challenge “false tech solutions” for climate – and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayfinding" title="">wayfind pathways to sustainability</a> that honour the rights and sovereignty of Indigenous people and traditional communities. These two priorities informed the focus of our discussion at Privacy Camp.</p>



 Naming false solutions 



<p>In December 2022, more than 80 civil society organisations sent an <a href="https://etcgroup.org/content/no-climate-geoengineering-open-call-cbd-parties-and-cbd-secretariat" title="">open letter</a> to the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), calling on all parties to the CBD to “prevent geoengineering from harming biodiversity, the environment, the climate, the rights of Indigenous Peoples and the human rights of local communities,” echoing recent calls for a “<a href="https://www.solargeoeng.org/" title="">Solar Geoengineering Non-Use Agreement</a>“. At Privacy Camp 2023, our panellists explained how false climate solutions like geo-engineering are narrowing paths for action, and reflected on calls to action for digital rights communities.</p>



Image: Participants who connected online included APC’s shawna finnegan and panellists Lili Fuhr, Paz Peña and Plamen Peev.



<p>Lili Fuhr, who works with the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL) to monitor emerging “climate technologies” (e.g. geo-engineering, carbon capture) provided historical context on climate-tech debates, raising a sense of urgency around the need for digital rights advocates to engage in how these technologies are governed and invested into, especially as “Big Tech” companies invest heavily into them. Looking back at the past 30 years of climate governance, Lili reflected on the many narrowed pathways that have led up to the present day of climate crisis, and challenges around defining problems and solutions. “False solutions and risky technologies that have potential to destroy entire ecosystems,” Lili stated, explaining how techno-solutionist mindsets often accompany neoliberal capitalist beliefs in endless economic growth within a finite Earth system. The metrics that we use to measure the problems and so-called solutions keep changing and narrowing paths for action.</p>



<p>Paz Peña, a researcher, activist and co-creator of gato.earth who is working with the Latin American Institute of Terraforming, reflected on her experiences at the intersections of technology and environmental crises. In outlining the pitfalls of techno-capitalism, Paz unpacked the false narratives of a “Twin Transition” that promotes the use of technology and data to improve efficiency and productivity as a panacea to climate and environmental crises. “Big Tech portrays itself as friend to the environment, and it gets good press,” Paz explained, emphasising the need for digital rights communities to act in response to techno-capitalist ideologies of unlimited growth and explore the potential of techno-diversities, a concept that Paz will be exploring more this year.</p>



<p>During the discussion, Paz called for European-focused discussions of sustainability to consider the impacts of extractivism of so-called “green technologies” for the Majority World. Paz highlighted the <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/impact/fair-materials/" title="">Fairphone</a> project, which, despite experimenting with more circular approaches to technological production, raises concerns around lithium mining and brings up questions around whether “ethical” mining and resource extraction is ultimately possible.</p>



 Wayfinding just paths for digital infrastructure to serve the planet 



<p>Identifying and calling out tech complicity in false climate solutions is an essential component of digital rights advocacy that supports <a href="https://climatefalsesolutions.org/real-solutions-for-climate-justice/" title="">real solutions for climate justice</a>. In the technology sector, digital rights advocates can learn from and support alternative models for just technology, and use existing and emerging policy mechanisms as levers for change.</p>



Image: On-site participants included Becky Kazansky (The Engine Room) along with panellist Narmine Abou Bakari.<br>



<p>Narmine Abou Bakari, a campaigner who works for the Greens/EFA of the European Parliament, shared a story of her journey from working on data protection to a focus on the right to repair and circular economy policies. Narmine explained the stakes of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/initiative_on_green_claims.htm" title="">new European Union (EU) regulation</a> to hold companies accountable for making false green claims, introspecting on how to make policies focus on <a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu/opinions/digital-technologies-in-europe/" title="">structural accountability</a> alongside consumer-level change. “Companies are using a marketing strategy to make claims about environmental footprint regardless of accuracy,” she shared, noting that this method of greenwashing generates a lack of trust among consumers. When a member of the audience asked Narmine about challenges for enforcement, Narmine reflected on the need for investment by national authorities and involvement of consumer rights organisations.</p>



<p>Plamen Peev, a policy expert and environmental lawyer who works with BlueLink Bulgaria, discussed the journey towards holistically accounting for the intersections of environmental and digital rights, sharing <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/interstice-digital-rights-and-environmental-justice-four-issue-briefs-inform-funding" title="">recent work with APC</a> to explore how existing environmental policies and mechanisms can be used to push for greater transparency and access to justice. Plamen highlighted how the <a href="https://unece.org/environment-policy/public-participation/aarhus-convention/text" title="">Aarhus Convention</a> has been used to push for the right to information, describing it as “a strong safeguard for nature and a benchmark for environmental democracy that links environmental and human rights, and the obligations of technologists.” He explained that the Aarhus Convention created pathways for local communities and environmental defenders to monitor and resist exploitation of natural resources.</p>



 In solidarity for the planet 



<p>As the discussion wrapped up, the panellists reflected on how digital rights advocates can contribute to international climate policy. Paz reminded us that actions taken in Europe will impact the rest of the world, and identified the EU as having an important role to play in addressing global techno-capitalism.</p>



<p>Lili emphasised that phasing out fossil fuels is an urgent priority that is being undermined by false solutionism. Lili also highlighted concerns for surveillance of activists and shrinking space for civil society, particularly in light of the UAE hosting the next UN climate conference (COP 28) in Dubai in November 2023.</p>



<p>Our discussion at Privacy Camp concluded with an invitation to participants to join a growing community working to address crucial issues at the intersections of digital rights, climate and environmental justice. We invite participants and readers to reach out and contact <a href="mailto:beckyk@riseup.net" title="">Becky</a> and <a href="mailto:shawna@apc.org" title="">shawna</a>, and consider joining us in future discussions and related sessions at the <a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/" title="">MozFest</a> Tech &amp; Biodiversity track, 20-24 March 2023.</p>

     <p>Zero trust and its architectures are incomplete in a digital world where the benefits of exponential innovation are starting to be outweighed by its risks. To exponentiate trust in the digital world, zero trust must be expanded to zero trust under zero knowledge — because in a world of generative AI, none can be trusted, nothing should be shared, and if something is shared it must be verifiable to be true by anyone without revealing any sensitive data.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://medium.com/@kimdhamilton">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a>, on behalf of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group</a></p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">The Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group at DIF</a> is excited to announce the release of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/">Presentation Exchange (PE) v2 specification</a>. This updated and ratified version of the spec includes a restructured set of core requirements, as well as an extensibility mechanism through the use of “features.”</p><p>But first, let’s take a step back: <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">The DIF Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group</a> is responsible for developing interoperable formats and supporting tools for broad adoption around issuing, requesting, exchanging and verifying credentials in a vendor-agnostic manner. Current work items include Schema Registries, Trust Establishment, Data Agreement, JWT-VC Interop Profiles, and of course, Presentation Echange. All of this open-source work is licensable under Apache 2.0, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 or W3C Patent licensing, as outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_CC_WG_charter_v1.pdf">WG Charter here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_CC_WG_Operating_Addendum_V1.pdf">WG Operating Addendum here</a>.</p><p>So, what is Presentation Exchange all about? In short, it enables a verifier to express to a credential holder (via their software agent, such as a wallet) their requirements for claims and proofs. For example, a financial institution can use PE to express to a potential customer (via the customer’s credential wallet) that they require a driver’s license from a certain set of state DMVs, as well as proof of address. The customer’s wallet can then use this information to pre-select the necessary credentials and, upon receiving the customer’s consent, generate a cryptographic signature, and package it all up to send to the financial institution. Importantly, different kinds of wallets using different cryptography and credentials formats can be added and subtracted over time, abstracting out many of the divergences in today’s verifiable credential systems.</p><p>With the release of PE v2, we have restructured the spec to define a reduced set of core requirements for implementers. This was based on input from implementers across different identity standards communities, who were all converging around a core set of baseline requirements on their respective roads to production. The spec separates this core set from additional functionalities, known as “<a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/#features">features</a>” which enable additional features only activated when both wallet and server signal support for them. This design allows verifiers and relying parties to layer additional functionality on top of the PE spec, while still providing a streamlined, implementable baseline for all implementers and a graceful upgrade path for wallets and implementations alike.</p><p><br>Additionally, we have restructured some of the PEv1 data model, moving previously mandatory properties and objects into optional features, which enables a more concise and consumer-friendly language. A variety of other minor improvements were also made based on implementer feedback. You can find more details on these updates in a new section of the spec, available <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/#what-is-new">here</a>.</p><p>The net result of these various updates is a broader range of support for the PE spec. A number of companies and organizations have already implemented the spec, including <a href="https://block.xyz/">Block</a>, <a href="http://bloom.co">Bloom</a>, <a href="http://centre.io">Centre</a>, <a href="http://circle.com">Circle</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html">OIDF</a>, <a href="https://sphereon.com/solution/dif-presentation-exchange-with-siop-v2/">Sphereon</a>, <a href="http://spruceid.com">Spruce</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/workday-engineering/lets-actually-share-our-verifiable-credentials-7ab1b4c73079">Workday</a>, <a href="http://benri.io">Benri</a>, and <a href="http://gendigital.com">Gen Digital</a> just to name a few.</p><blockquote>Presentation Exchange: in short, it enables a verifier to express to a credential holder (via their software agent, such as a wallet) their requirements for claims and proofs.</blockquote><p>Presentation Exchange V2 joins the list of delivered work items from DIF WGs, including <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1/">SideTree</a> and <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">DIDComm v2</a>. If you’re interested in getting involved and <a href="https://identity.foundation/join">joining DIF</a>, we encourage you to visit the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF website</a> to learn more about what we do. We look forward to working with you to advance the field of decentralized identity.<br><br></p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/guides/gaming/"></a>Dundee and Angus College is to offer the first degree-level course in Esports in Scotland as they continue to lead the way in the sector. 
<p>Applications are now open for the Foundation Degree of the Arts in Esports and Creative Industries, the first of its kind to be delivered by a Scottish college.</p>
<p>Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition between video game players or teams. Participation has surged in the last decade with many players now full-time professionals, attracting significant sponsorship, playing in front of live crowds of tens of thousands and audiences of millions online.</p>
<p>The new course which has been created in partnership with the University of West London is the latest milestone in the Esports journey for Dundee and Angus, which has been building its offering and profile over the past 12 months. The college is keen that potential students see that Esports is not just about playing games competitively. It is a multidisciplinary career where a range of skills are required to organise, manage, and participate.</p>
<p>James Oliver Head of Curriculum and Quality at Dundee and Angus College said, “Esports is a new and exciting development in our curriculum.&nbsp; This growing industry has a range of skills in diverse areas such as marketing, sports psychology, and cyber security.&nbsp; The widespread interest in Esports will help bridge the digital divide and appeal to a diverse range of students.”</p>
<p>Students in the first college offering an Esports Foundation degree in Scotland will learn a variety of key transferable skills, including how to manage and organise events, understand the culture of Esports, analyse audience engagement, and the role of professionalism and ethical conduct.</p>
<p>Learners will also develop digital skills in live event production, broadcasting, commentating, streaming and will look at the importance of coaching, strategy and sports psychology. The two-year course starts in August 2023, with the opportunity to do an additional year to gain a full degree soon to be an option.</p>
<p>Ella a current Computing student has applied for the foundation course at the college starting in August said. “I took part in a recent Esports tournament at Dundee and Angus College and loved it. The Esports industry is booming and with the new arena coming to Dundee I think it will be a great opportunity to start a career in Esports. I cannot wait to start the course in August as it sounds amazing.”</p>
<p>The college has also opened its Esports offering to school pupils with a weekly club for young people aged 8-14 running three nights a week. There have also been Esports holiday camps with 110 children attending the last one in October.</p>
<p>Dundee and Angus College Principal Simon Hewitt said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are extremely excited to be launching our new, dedicated Esports foundation degree, the first in Scotland. The Esports industry within Scotland is growing at a rapid pace and is offering much more than a mainstream route into the gaming sector.</p>
<p>We are proud to be leading the way on this development and to be providing this choice to the people of this region and beyond. It is another ‘feather in the cap’ of a City and region that has been consistently at the forefront of computer games development for a significant period.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The college’s Esports course will be based at their Gardyne campus which currently has a state-of-the-art Esports classroom comprising of top-of-the-range gaming PCs, and an Esports Society hub equipped with Xboxes and PS5s. New plans are also underway to develop two tournament rooms, two broadcasting studios, and a recording studio.</p>
<p>Applications for Scotland’s first-degree course in Esports are now open and interested individuals can apply at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dundeeandangus.ac.uk/courses/fdesci23-g-1fa/">www.dundeeandangus.ac.uk/courses/fdesci23-g-1fa/</a>&nbsp;or phone Dundee and Angus College at 03001231036 for more information.</p>

<p></p>      Bonifii partnered with Entersekt, a global company, to improve MemberPass functionality. 
          <p>Upon initial consumer feedback, the need to download a second app to enable MemberPass 1.0 became a barrier to adoption for credit union members. In 2022, the primary focus was to improve the functionality of MemberPass, allowing for an easier enrollment and authentication process to protect credit unions and its members from becoming victims of fraud. Now, there is no need to download a second app and the enrollment process was reduced from 16 to 6 steps. 4Front Credit Union and Team One Credit Union rolled out the enhanced MemberPass 2.0 app-less product in the fall of 2022 and the adoption and usage numbers have already exponentially exceeded the initial MemberPass enrollment numbers.</p>
                <p>MemberPass integrated into the banking app of one of the Top 10 National Credit Union.</p>
<p>Additionally, in 2022, MemberPass made major strides in the development of becoming an identity and authentication option developed directly into the banking app of a major, top 10 national credit that will formally launch to its membership in Q1 2023.</p>
                 Since commercialization in 2020, there have been no reported incidents of fraud with members enrolled in MemberPass. 
           Bonifii completed a POC with GlobaliD and Lone Star Credit Union to create the “Bonifii credential” 
<p>Throughout 2022, Bonifii and Lone Star Credit Union worked together to prove the concept that a new member could bring their own “BonifiID” digital identity credential. It gives underserved individuals a secure, private way to access traditional banking services.</p>
<p>Bonifii created the digital credential along with<a href="https://global.id/"> GlobaliD</a>, a trust platform and digital wallet. This credential transforms the new account opening process for unbanked or underbanked consumers. It streamlines how financial institutions get the information they need to open an account. Plus, the credential’s end-to-end digital online application process offers a secure entry point into a financial account.</p>
<p>For underbanked people, this could be a pathway to greater financial stability.</p>
 MemberPass Express (No Code / Low Code) Bonifii’s achievements in 2022 continue to build the on the product value that MemberPass will bring to the credit union industry and beyond. 
<p>Each one is unique, and each addresses a different aspect of how digital identity functions in the real world. By extension, each agreement has made MemberPass stronger, and a more effective personal digital ID solution for credit unions and members.</p>

<p>February 8, 2023</p>



<p>Most New Zealanders believe it is not easy to protect their information online and they find the idea of being more in control of their digital identity appealing, according to a new Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ) survey just released.</p>



<p>DINZ is a not for profit member association of the New Zealand Tech Alliance and their latest research highlights issues holding back more rapid uptake of digital identity and the growth of the digital economy have remained consistent for the past four years.</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final.pdf">Their study</a> found:</p>



  90 percent of New Zealanders believe it is not easy to protect their information online  



  90 percent of New Zealanders find the idea of being more in control of their digital identity appealing  



  78 percent of New Zealanders are concerned about the protection of their identity and the use of personal data by organisations  



  70 percent of New Zealanders place some onus on the organisation holding their data, but there is some sense of shared responsibility  



  60 percent of New Zealanders don’t feel they know how to protect their information  



  60 percent of New Zealanders were satisfied with the process of registering personal details with Government agencies in response to the covid pandemic  



  60 percent of New Zealanders have experienced some form of misuse, with credit card theft being most common  



  50 percent of New Zealanders know their rights regarding the protection of personal data  



  50 percent of New Zealanders have adapted their online behaviour due to concerns around data privacy  



  50 percent of New Zealanders have some issue with registering new accounts online, although there has been a significant increase in satisfaction since 2020  



  80 percent of businesses know where to find relevant legislation for their digital security obligations  



  33 percent of businesses feel equipped to protect their customer’s personal data, while just 25 percent find this easy to do  



  33 percent of businesses believe the pandemic has impacted the way they manage their customer’s personal data  



<p>Digital identity allows people and organisations to use their personal information, including date of birth, income and other proof attributes to access services. Essentially, digital identity is a shorthand for the processes used to confirm identification, authentication and authorisation.</p>







<p>“There is more desire to have control over one’s personal data, says Colin Wallis, executive director of DINZ, and it seems that the Covid experience has driven some progress towards greater understanding of the importance of data protection.”</p>



<p>“Our research found that opening accounts for digital services and having to remember usernames and passwords is a major cause of friction for consumers.</p>



<p>“Three quarters of respondents were wary of the transparency amongst organisations using their data and a similar proportion were unhappy about the idea of organisations sharing/selling their data.</p>



<p>“The results support the consumer research conclusion that there is a trust problem which is why businesses and experts are gathering at the <a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">digital trust hui taumata</a> conference in Wellington in August to identify opportunities to increase digital trust in New Zealand.”</p>

<p>An ardent supporter of OASIS since 2003, Jim Cabral is a recognized thought leader in the justice and public safety technology communities. </p>







<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/board/">OASIS Board of Directors</a> is comprised of industry leaders who play an integral part in the organization’s success. Each month, we’ll interview one OASIS Board Member to give you a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.&nbsp;Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimcabral/">Jim Cabral</a>, Vice President of Court Relations at <a href="https://www.infotrack.com/">InfoTrack</a>, Vice Chair of the OASIS Board of Directors, and long time OASIS member. </p>



<p>Jim serves as Chair of the LegalXML Electronic Court Filing Technical Committee (TC) and the LegalXML Member Section. He is a member of the Code List Representation, LegalDocumentML (LegalDocML), Litigant Portal (LP), and LegalRuleML TCs. Jim also participates in NIEMOpen as co-chair of the NIEM Technical Architecture Committee and is an expert voting representative to the Project Governing Board. In 2020, Jim was named an OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/members/distinguished-contributors/">Distinguished Contributor</a> for his significant impact on the advancement of open standards and/or open source projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re happy to have you on the OASIS board. Can you tell us about your role at InfoTrack?<br>I am a Vice President of Court Relations at InfoTrack, a legal technology provider. We integrate attorneys and their information systems, especially their law practice management systems, with the courts and their technology.</p>



<p>You’ve been involved with OASIS for years. How did you first get involved?<br>I joined OASIS to work on LegalXML. I got involved not just with the courts, but also to work on standards for integrated justice such as electronic contracts, electronic notary, etc. As a management consultant for more than 20 years, I’ve mostly worked in the areas of public safety and justice within courts. I have extensive experience partnering with courts to integrate their systems with legal systems. </p>



<p>Years ago, I was involved with Justice XML, which&nbsp;became the Global Justice XML Data Model and finally the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM). NIEM is now <a href="https://github.com/niemopen/oasis-open-project#readme">NIEMOpen</a>, an OASIS Open Project. We were working with what was known as “integrated justice,” helping to connect law enforcement with prosecutors, and the courts with prosecutors, corrections, supervision, probation, and various other justice partners. Working in management consulting with justice and public safety, we&nbsp; talked about standards from the very beginning.</p>



<p>Tell us about your professional background…<br>I have degrees in electrical and biomedical engineering, and have done a lot of networking and security IT work as a graduate student. I’ve been working with Extensible Markup Language (XML), application programming interfaces (APIs), and things like that for most of my career. Whenever it came to the technology side of certain projects, I was always the one that was brought in because I had the engineering background.</p>



<p>What inspired you to join the OASIS board?<br>I have been an OASIS member for a long time, involved in LegalXML and other TCs before I had any aspirations of joining the Board. I contributed to those committees for a while and wanted to make sure that perspective was represented at the Board level. I started serving as an interim board member as a result of a special board election. After a brief hiatus, I decided to run again after hearing about NIEM transitioning to OASIS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s your connection with NIEM?<br>I’ve been involved with NIEM almost as long as I’ve been involved with OASIS. I have been there through the evolution of NIEM from the Justice XML Model to the Global Justice XML Data Model,​ and then finally to NIEM. I am excited to be here now as it transitions to NIEMOpen at OASIS.</p>



<p>What excites you about OASIS and why are you so passionate about its mission?<br>I’ve always been an advocate of OASIS as standards are very important to me. I’m often frustrated by people, especially those working in technology, who want to innovate as quickly as possible and end up with one-off proprietary solutions to problems. To me, those can only go so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To really make a difference in the world, to really get the type of adoption and broad support that you need for these kinds of innovations to take hold and make a difference, they need to become standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve been involved with OASIS and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for a long time, and in my opinion, they are two of the best standards organizations in the world.</p>



<p>What are the benefits to becoming involved with the OASIS community?<br>The idea that we’re all at OASIS to work collaboratively, even with some that may be competitors, really creates a safe space for doing that work.</p>



<p>As far as what sets OASIS apart from some of the other standards organizations are things like NIEM, UBL, and ebXML. These are all very big projects that helped build our reputation. You consistently find others coming to OASIS because of that reputation for doing great work and for being independent.</p>



<p>OASIS has an incredible brand that’s well known and well respected and I want to make sure that we continue to preserve that.</p>



<p>What are some of the reasons why people should bring their projects to OASIS?<br>OASIS is a mature and successful organization. The OASIS process has shown to work time and time again. As long as you follow the process, you’ll end up with a truly open standard, free of intellectual property concerns, and ready for you to use in your implementation.</p>



<p>What type of skills and expertise do you bring to the OASIS board?<br>In addition to my work on the legal technology side with LegalXML and so on, I’ve also had experience working with the public sector. There’s a lot of interesting things happening at the state and local government level. I’ve developed and implemented best practices as a management consultant. Having that expertise is something that the OASIS Board values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s your role as Vice Chair?<br>Gershon Janssen is a fabulous chair, and I’m here to help support him in any way I can. I serve as backup in the event that he’s unable to make a meeting. As Vice Chair, I am part of the&nbsp; Executive Committee, which helps craft the agenda and prioritizes the items for discussion by the board.</p>



<p>How do you hope to make an impact as a board member during your term?<br>I want to ensure that OASIS continues to be a sustainable organization and continues to evolve. I’m very proud of how OASIS has expanded beyond standards to include open source and open projects.&nbsp; I’m also excited about our selection of Francis Beland as the new Executive Director of OASIS. I think he’s going to help take OASIS in some new directions that will greatly benefit the organization.</p>



<p>What are your goals as an OASIS board member?<br>One of the reasons I joined the board was to make sure that NIEM and other open projects had a voice at the board level. Open projects are fairly new to OASIS, and it will be impressive to see OASIS&nbsp;absorb and support a project as mature as NIEM. I think we’re going to learn a lot from this process, and ultimately I think it will help us recruit other open projects of this magnitude.</p>



<p>My goals over the next year are to help NIEM continue to transition to OASIS, learn as much as possible about what it’s going to take for OASIS to support additional open projects, and develop best practices to onboard future open projects.</p>



<p>What is an achievement/accomplishment that you’re proud of?&nbsp;<br>I was very proud to be recognized as an OASIS Distinguished Contributor.&nbsp; This award plaque hangs proudly over my desk as a constant reminder to me of what’s possible with collaboration.</p>



<p>What’s the best piece of advice you’ve received?&nbsp;<br>As the African proverb says: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” I mentioned this in my OASIS <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68lWygC6zjk&amp;t=1110s">Distinguished Contributor award acceptance speech</a>.</p>



<p>Can you tell us about a role model or mentor that you’ve had and what inspired you most about that person?<br>When I started out at OASIS, I was very much involved with the Electronic Court Filing (ECF) TC, and I eventually ended up becoming the chair. The previous ECF co-chairs were John Greacen and Tom Clarke, who were some of the founding members of the LegalXML Member Section. John Greacen is an attorney in New Mexico and Tom Clarke, at the time, was a vice president for the National Center for State Courts. </p>



<p>They created a very exciting, collaborative community where they pulled people from various projects to work together on the standard. I was very impressed with their ability to recruit people to the effort as well as their independent voices that made it clear that the objective was to work collaboratively. I appreciated their consistency, their honesty, and even their stubbornness when it came to making sure that the standard was something that everyone could use.</p>



<p>What trends do you see in the industry that are most exciting or thought provoking?&nbsp;<br>All you have to do is turn on the news and everyone’s talking about Artificial Intelligence (AI). One ongoing argument is the need for structured information versus unstructured information. Most of what we collect and what we encounter is unstructured information. At OASIS, one thing that we’ve done very well is come up with models for structured information sharing.</p>



<p>Some believe that AI doesn’t need all that structured information because AI can pull out and extract whatever you need out of the unstructured information. While AI can be very good at pulling out information from unstructured information, the problem is when your AI and my AI pull out different information from the same unstructured information. As a result, we don’t have semantic interoperability. We’re looking at the same data, but we’re coming up with two different sets of knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to figure out how to use both of those together to capture that structured information, and then share it in a way that is consistent, so you and I agree on what that actually means and what the knowledge is in that data.</p>



<p>Can you share an impact story about OASIS or your work in open standards?<br>Electronic Court Filing (ECF) basically created a market. Until standards like ECF, court solutions were kind of one-offs. Let’s say a court selected a particular vendor to come in and provide, for example, their public access system or their report filing system. That was the one available option, and from an attorney perspective or from a self represented litigant trying to work with the courts, hopefully that one option met their needs because that was the only one that was offered.</p>



<p>Standards like ECF allow the courts to publish an API and say, “If you want to interact with the courts, here’s the API that you need to connect to.” That allows market providers like InfoTrack to come in and say, “OK, I recognize that this group of attorneys or this group of self representing litigants have some specific needs. I can build a solution that caters to their needs, but then integrates with the court’s API.” From the court’s perspective, it’s all the same because it’s all coming in through the same place, the same API. From the filer’s perspective, it actually shows a lot more flexibility and adaptability to their particular needs. ECF has created a market allowing legal technology providers like InfoTrack to better serve the needs of the court and legal communities. In the U.S., 55% of the population are in jurisdictions where the courts support ECF.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the future of standards?<br>I think we have to continue to adapt and be open to new ways of developing standards. Open Projects is one of those examples where if you already have some IP and you think it should go through a standards process, OASIS has a path for you to set up a project to do just that. You can pick out the pieces that should go through the standards process and then proceed using the tested OASIS standard track.</p>



<p>What are a few words that come to mind when you think about the work being done at OASIS?<br>You can’t say OASIS without saying “open.” I would also say “collaborative,” “innovative,” and “proven.”</p>



<p>What is a fun fact about you?<br>I’m a bugler. I’m involved with a volunteer organization called Bugles Across America, and we play “Taps” to honor our veterans and our public safety workers at their funerals. Bugles Across America allows families to request a bugler, and a volunteer like myself will show up at the burial site to play “Taps” for them. It’s a song that only has 24 notes, but it means a lot to the families of the veterans, and that’s why I do it.&nbsp;</p>

 Open Workplace Recognition. In practice. Image CC BY-ND Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>We’re publishing this in the wake of mass layoffs in the tech industry, with some people finding out in <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/google-engineer-says-survivors-mass-153122052.html">particularly cruel ways</a> that their employment has been terminated.</p><p>With that as a touchpoint, in this post we want to dig into what Open Workplace Recognition actually looks like in practice. We’ll have a look at what motivates us in the workplace and what Open Workplace Recognition could look like in different types of organisations.</p> Recognition as a&nbsp;driver <p>Let’s just quickly remind ourselves what we mean by <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>:</p><p>“Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.”</p><p>Credentials are usually things that you acquire to be able to unlock an opportunity or increase in status. So degree certificates, drivers licences, and even tickets for a concert can be thought of as ‘credentials’. These abound in the workplace: some group of people (usually ‘higher-ups’), decide what is important and create credentials in line with that strategy.</p><p>This post is not an argument that credentials should not exist. As we have argued elsewhere, the important thing to note is the role of recognition in the act of credentialing. Going further, <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2016/02/26/hiring-by-experience/">we also encourage</a> workplaces to think of non-credential forms of recognition.</p><p>Daniel Pink’s seminal work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us">Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</a> explains that we have three basic needs at&nbsp;work:</p>  Autonomy — the desire to be self-directed and feel like we’re making meaningful choices.  Mastery — the urge to continually improve our knowledge and&nbsp;skills.  Purpose — the impulse to do something that is meaningful and important.  <p>This is not how people tend to be “recognised” at work. ‘Recognition’ is often conflated with ‘reward’ and so we look to award ceremonies, promotions, and company-wide messages from managers for validation. Research shows, however, that these extrinsic rewards can actually replace people’s intrinsic motivation. So what are we to&nbsp;do?</p><p>There is a better way. It’s one that chimes more with the autonomy, mastery, and purpose mentioned above. It’s one that’s more peer-to-peer. And it’s one that can lead to portable, granular, and evidenced-based forms of recognition that employees can carry with them to their next job — whether or not that’s in the same organisation.</p> Recognition in&nbsp;practice <p>As we’ve said before, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">Open Recognition is for every type of learning</a> and it’s for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-workplace-a7533f3f75e7">every type of workplace</a>. So what does this mean in practice?</p><p>If we consider three types of workplace and reference <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">different types of learning scenarios</a>, we can begin to see the types of recognition that are required in each situation. Let’s dig in to find the similarities and differences between Open Workplace Recognition for employees, freelancers, and small business&nbsp;owners.</p> 💼 Employees <p>Employees work for organisations that usually set policies without their input. These could be anything from job requirements and prerequisite skills through to salaries and vacation policies. Depending on the core business of the organisation and progression pathways, this could mean that it doesn’t take long for employees to lack not only autonomy, but mastery and&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>Sometimes, workplaces attempt to remedy this through spurious systems based on ‘points’ to reward colleagues. Our experience suggests this rapidly devolves into either a popularity contest or an empty exercise where colleagues give away all of their points to a peer as it’s the end of the month. Not only are these types of attempts at recognition wide of the mark, they’re actively demotivating.</p><p>Furthermore, employees cannot take any of this with them when you inevitably move on to a new organisation. (LinkedIn recommendations don’t quite cut it.) That’s why Open Workplace Recognition uses a nuanced approach based on <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> to recognise pro-social behaviours as well as knowledge and skills. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Sally has a line manager who notices that she showed up to every company event over the last year. Recognising her dedication her line manager issues Sally an ‘Above and Beyond’&nbsp;badge.  Akaash has learned a lot from his mentor Priya over the last couple of years, and so issues her a ‘Marvellous Mentor’ badge. She reciprocates by issuing him a badge which includes the LinkedIn recommendation she has already written for&nbsp;him.  Junior is committed to professional development but his company’s policy comes with ‘strings attached’ meaning that paying for courses related to anything outside of his immediate job role cannot be sanctioned. One of his colleagues, Blessing, issues him an ‘Onwards and Upwards’ badge to recognise his dedication.  <p>If the workplace functions more as a community of practice, then social learning is visible and recognised. It means that employees would feel more autonomy and mastery, and therefore consider their work to have more&nbsp;purpose.</p> 👩‍💻 Freelancers <p>Freelancers deal with different kinds of recognition problems. They have to have business management and client acquisition skills in addition to whatever product or service they might be offering. These skills are often not recognised at all, with potential clients focusing only on the freelancer’s portfolio, including who they have worked with before. A freelancer’s ability to promote themselves and their work is also explicitly tied to social and cultural factors that they may be unable to&nbsp;control.</p><p>Freelancers may have formal learning credentials and might be able to point to some forms of recognition they have collected over the course of their career. However, if recognition is not a transferable feature of networking events, pro-bono work or career-related participation in a community, freelancers have to find their own ways of showcasing their engagement, talent and&nbsp;skill.</p>  Jayden funds himself to go to one networking event per month. He issues himself an attendance badge and asks the event organisers to ‘endorse’ it to add&nbsp;value.  Valentina agrees to do some work for free to build her brand, but insists on a badge from the company proving her involvement in the&nbsp;project.  Koko organises an online community for freelancers in her industry. She is issued a badge by an industry veteran who is thankful for her voluntary work.  <p>Freelancers could benefit from Open Workplace Recognition between workplaces, and also by conceptualising their own work as happening within a ‘third place’ workplace. As a result, freelancers can be recognised not only by their clients but also by other freelancers, leading to increased autonomy (choosing when and how to work), mastery (being recognised for knowledge and skills development), and purpose (continuing to do what they&nbsp;love).</p> ✊ Small businesses <p>A small agency, business or cooperative often offers more control for the people who work within it. Depending on the organisation and management of an agency, workers may have ways of recognising another that are built into the culture of the workplace.</p><p>Like employees and freelancers, workers in an agency are often initially recognised for their formal learning certification and career history. Just as with larger employers, an agency may use these certifications as a filtering function. And, like freelancers, non-transferrable recognition is often invisible to others within the different workplaces.</p><p>In an agency, a worker is required to advocate for themselves like a freelancer, while beholden to agency-wide decisions and policies like a more traditional employer.</p>  Shiro recognises that a new skillset is required for a new project coming into the agency, and so asks the agency for time to upskill. They are issued a series of badges recognising their increased levels of knowledge and&nbsp;skills.  Mike attends dinners and events on behalf of his small business which often much later turn into business leads/opportunities. His colleagues recognise his networking skills by issuing&nbsp;badges.  Lucas, Amahle, and Diego participate in communities related to growing the co-op movement. Their co-op not only pays them an internal rate for this time, but issues badges under Principle 6 (“cooperation among cooperatives”) of the <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity/">ICA principles</a>.  <p>By thinking about small businesses and networks of small businesses such as agencies and co-ops as communities of practice, we can think of all of the ways that recognition may occur. There are many ways in which autonomy, mastery, and purpose can develop, especially in worker-owned businesses. However, recognition which is portable, granular, and evidence-based does not happen by accident.</p> Next steps <p>Are you interested in Open Workplace Recognition and what it could mean for organisations like your own? Do you have questions about how to get started with Open Badges that recognise pro-social behaviours? What kind of things do colleagues in your organisation really&nbsp;value?</p><p>We’re happy to answer any questions you may have in the comments section.

<p>The number of Open Data ecosystems and industries covered is constantly growing and very soon people around the world will expect free and open access to their data across a wide range of use cases.&nbsp; But today, these ecosystems end at national or regional borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to share the final version of the whitepaper, “Open Banking and Open Data: Ready to Cross Borders?” More than 50 open data, digital identity and API security technologists&nbsp; globally contributed to this whitepaper to answer the following questions:</p>
 
 What are the differences and similarities between different open data ecosystems? 
 Is global interoperability between different ecosystems possible?&nbsp; 
 Who will be driving this movement and what are the use cases motivating them? How will users benefit? 
 How could cross-border use cases work and what “good might look like”? What are the architecture and governance requirements? 
 What can you do if you believe this is the right direction for Open Banking and Open Data? 
 
<p>The good news is that leading technologists already see a viable path to enable Open Banking and Open Data across borders. Our thanks to the contributing organizations and individuals for their efforts over the past year to visualize and distill these recommendations. If “past performance is indicative of future returns,” we can expect their recommendations will become reality in the months and years ahead. The principles and recommendations highlighted in this paper serve as a robust starting point for public and private stakeholder conversations in the months ahead.</p>
<p>The intended audiences for this paper are government officials, ecosystem implementers of open banking open data, and experts in the adjacent fields of cross-border payments, data privacy, international trade and digital identity. The whitepaper can be downloaded <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Help us to form the Open Data Community Group to take the principles, recommendations and diligence from this paper to brief public and private sector thought leaders, respond to government and intergovernmental requests for comment, and evaluate the optimal governance entities and approach. To join this interest group in crafting the Community Group goals, participation agreement, and roadmap please contact <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2023/02/06/final-version-of-open-banking-and-open-data-ready-to-cross-borders-whitepaper-published/">Final Version of “Open Banking and Open Data: Ready to Cross Borders?” Whitepaper Published</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

<p>Passwords are often an organisation’s weakest link. On World Password Day (May 5), Apple, Google and Microsoft jointly announced that they were building in support for passwordless sign-in, leveraging FIDO2, across all of the desktop, browser and mobile platforms that they control. Crucially, they have all emphasised cross-platform functionality will be a high priority in the development of FIDO2-based passwordless features. With the help of its community of identity, security and biometrics experts, the FIDO Alliance has developed and promoted free, open standards that have taken passwordless authentication to the next level.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar highlights growing cyber threats and e-scams amongst seniors online. As one of the least technologically savvy groups, the elderly is also one of the most vulnerable – and targeted – demographics by online scammers. To achieve a more secure Internet for everyone, we must ensure that the elderly’s needs and preferences are considered. Fortunately, there are readily available standards and best practices to help service providers guide users in adopting passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I want to personally thank all Foundation members who voted in the 2023 elections for representatives to the OpenID Foundation board of directors.</p>
<p>Each year Corporate members of the Foundation elect a member to represent them on the board with all Corporate members in good standing eligible to nominate and vote for candidates. Thank you to Ashish Jain, Chief Product Officer at Arkose Labs, and Dima Postnikov, Head of Identity Strategy and Architecture at ConnectID, for nominating themselves for this important board position that requires a substantial investment of time and energy.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to welcome Dima to the board of directors as the 2023 Corporate Representative. Dima’s ongoing support and contributions to the Foundation including being an active participant in FAPI WG working on supporting Open Banking initiatives worldwide and as co-chair of GAIN PoC working group delivering global interoperability for consumer identity are most appreciated. &nbsp;I look forward to his continued leadership in these regards as well as on the board of directors in 2023.</p>
<p>I want to kindly thank Ashish who served as Corporate Representative in 2021 and 2022 and has been a member of the task force defining the Foundation’s strategy and budget. I welcome Ashish’s continued involvement and contribution to the Foundation as his guidance and technical expertise has been of great value.</p>
<p>Per the Foundation’s bylaws, three individual board members represent the membership and the community at large. George Fletcher has one year remaining on his two-year term and I look forward George’s ongoing leadership in 2023 as he continues to contribute significantly as a member of the task force, executive committee and board of directors.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura and John Bradley were re-elected to two-year terms as Community member representatives. I want to thank Nat and John for their continued leadership of the Foundation in their positions as officers and members of the board of directors. I look forward to continuing to work with both closely as we execute the 2023 Foundation strategy and grow the Foundation.</p>
<p>Please join me in thanking Nat, John and Dima, as well as all of the board of directors, for their service to the Foundation and the community at large. And thank you to all members for your continued investment of time and membership that drives and supports the Foundation’s strategic initiatives.</p>

<p>Whatever security key you choose, it must be FIDO certified, Apple says. Apple has revealed what it believes are the best security keys to add an extra layer of protection to your digital world.&nbsp; The recent release of iOS 16.3 saw Apple add security key compatibility to its iPhone and iPad devices – as well as to its laptops and desktops with the macOS 13.2 update. Now, in a support document, the company has selected its recommendations for the best physical security keys to use with its devices, which comply with FIDO standards – the foremost alliance on credential security that most of big tech are signed up to.</p>

<p>Phishing refers to a variety of attacks that are intended to convince you to forfeit sensitive data to an imposter. These attacks can take a number of different forms; from spear-phishing (which targets a specific individual within an organization), to whaling (which goes one step further and targets senior executives or leaders). Furthermore, phishing attacks take place over multiple channels or even across channels; from the more traditional email-based attacks to those using voice – vishing – to those coming via text message – smishing. Regardless of the type or channel, the intent of the attack is the same – to exploit human nature to gain control of sensitive information (citation 1).&nbsp;These attacks typically make use of several techniques including impersonated websites, attacker-in-the-middle, and relay or replay to achieve their desired outcome.</p>

<p>Public review ends March 4th</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 and Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile Version 4.1 from the LegalXML Electronic Court Filing TC [1] are now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for Version 4.1 of these specifications.</p>



<p>ECF defines a technical architecture and a set of components, operations and message structures for an electronic court filing system, and sets forth rules governing its implementation.</p>



<p>LegalXML Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 (ECF v4.1) consists of a set of non-proprietary XML and Web Services specifications, along with clarifying explanations and amendments to those specifications, that have been added for the purpose of promoting interoperability among electronic court filing vendors and systems. ECF Version 4.1 is a maintenance release to address several minor schema and definition issues identified by implementers of the ECF 4.0 and 4.01 specifications.</p>



<p>Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile defines a Service Interaction Profile, as defined in section 5 of the ECF v4.1 specification. The Web Services Service Interaction Profile may be used to transmit ECF 4.1 messages between Internet-connected systems.</p>

 Building the passbolt community in&nbsp;2023 <p>At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.passbolt.com/">passbolt</a> got in touch with us about doing some community work. Pleased to work with the passbolt team <a href="https://weareopen.coop/passbolt/">again</a>, we’re kicking off 2023 with an organisation working to help people embrace their privacy and security while being realistic about how people collaborate in the digital&nbsp;space.</p><p>Passbolt is the open source password manager for teams. They aim to help people collaborate without compromising on password security. We share passwords. It’s just a&nbsp;fact.</p><p><a href="https://community.passbolt.com/t/passbolt-community-plans-for-in-2023/6463">TL;DR — learn about our community plans and get involved!</a></p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Why: To build communal&nbsp;power <p>If you know <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> at all, you know that we are proud to be a cooperative that has some…uh…perspectives. We don’t take on just any project — we prefer to work with organisations that are community-focused and trying to make the world a better place. Passbolt is focused on privacy and security, themes that are near and dear to our nerdy&nbsp;hearts.</p><p>As the passbolt community grows, they want to ensure that their values are baked into everything they do. They also want to be in a position to say no to corporate overloads and&nbsp;asshats.</p><p>WAO members have long been interested in the privacy and security space, and we feel like we have a lot to both learn as well as contribute. We’re good at community building, and a strong community means power. The power to say no, the power to influence change, the power to change the&nbsp;world.</p> Who: passbolt, WAO and&nbsp;YOU <p>The majority of the people currently in the passbolt community understand why password security matters and they are people who can help spread the word. They also understand the complexities of internet security and digital identity. These folks care about the ethics of their tech. There are active developers and security savvy people helping out with passbolt&nbsp;support.</p><p>We want to figure out how we can grow the community and to include people like…well, us. Internet savvy, privacy aware people. People who are trying to be safe online. People who love open source and want to contribute to a growing and ever more important conversation around online security, data privacy and the like. We want to learn and contribute to this discussion, and this community has something to teach&nbsp;us.</p> What: a privacy &amp; security focused community cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>We’re lucky to be able to build together with the passbolt community, instead of from scratch. We are starting by looking at the passbolt community using our patented* <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">Architecture of Participation</a>. This framework helps us make sure we’re covering our bases. We’ve written about applying it many times. You can read all about it&nbsp;in:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-architecture-of-participation-for-community-growth-ed9d964ec360">An Architecture of Participation for Community growth</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">Quick wins to improve your Open Source community’s Architecture of Participation</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/howto-create-an-architecture-of-participation-for-your-charity-project-7c83ebdfef2f">HOWTO: Create an Architecture of Participation for your Charity tech&nbsp;project</a>  <p>Other things we’re thinking about include resources that help ensure that community structures, workflows and processes are clear and being implemented. We’ll help the passbolt team and contributors embrace, encourage and distribute leadership.</p><p>* not actually patented because patents are corporate bullshit used to control people, keep people poor and generally stymie innovation</p> How: the tricky&nbsp;part cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>With any growing community there’s a delicate balance to be struck between improving things for new community members and ensuring that OG community members remain engaged. We’ve identified some areas that can help make the community experience more streamlined and robust. We’re also thinking about how to engage with current contributors and help them reach their&nbsp;goals.</p> Improving Documentation &amp;&nbsp;Pathways <p>Open Source projects are often spread out all over the web and that can be confusing for potential contributors. It’s important to ensure a project is navigable for people who aren’t yet members of the community. Entry points can be varied, but they should signpost and cross link to the information that people are looking for. Getting lost causes frustration, and improving documentation and creating explicit contributor pathways can help keep people involved.</p> Solid plans <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/10-reasons-why-people-contribute-to-open-source-d13b86b1e9d3">We found that there are 10 main reasons why people contribute to open source projects</a>. A solid engagement plan will consider these motivations and create pathways for people to level up their involvement with the project. No matter the motivation, contributors are more likely to continue using their skills on behalf of the project if they feel valued. Ensuring that contribution is recognised is an important part of a healthy community.</p><p>Solid engagement also means consistent engagement, so we’re thinking about the patterns and workflows we need to co-design and document in order to ensure that people feel supported. This includes things like transparent roadmaps, moderation plans or updated community resources.</p> Making it Super Easy to Contribute <p>Any time spent in the service of a collective project is an amazing gift to the community that manages it. There are so many ways to contribute to open source. Open source projects need developers, yes, but they also need a wide range of other types of people and skills in order to be a success. Something as simple as providing feedback can change the course of an initiative.</p><p>Creating an inclusive community means encouraging all sorts of people to see their skills as valuable and necessary. Lowering the technical bar to contribution can help, and here modularity is key. We need to think about what ‘Minimum Viable Contribution’ might be for this community, and then make it super easy to contribute.</p> Where: Across the web and at an event near&nbsp;you cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>We are working to tie together and create spaces to engage with anyone who cares about privacy and security. Passbolt will continue to host spaces for people who are highly technical, while also working to spread good practices and knowledge amongst people who are learning. A community is made up of the individuals who join it, so there’s no way of knowing what this community might become. Our intention, though, is that the passbolt community remains a welcoming and inclusive space.</p><p>People from the passbolt community are planning to be at a variety of open source events this year. <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/passbolt/">Next up is FOSDEM!</a> If you’re going to be there, we highly encourage you to say&nbsp;hello!</p> When: Now! <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/steps-to-success-when-building-a-community-of-practice-15bd7ed9ac5c">We know that building a community like this has a lot of ins and&nbsp;outs</a>.</p><p>Over the next months, WAO is going to help the passbolt team grow and engage an inclusive and healthy open source community. In addition to making sure that anyone can contribute to this amazing project, we want to help open sourcers, makers, co-ops, activists, edtechies and charity folks have an honest conversation about passwords. The reality is that people share passwords, and we’re not going to stop just because we are told it is a bad practice.</p> Help us! <a href="https://whimsical.com/community-roadmap-SaDWjPi7c4xKCmnJbkj4fg">Comment directly on the&nbsp;board!</a><p>We are making and sharing our plans with you, and we want your feedback! Do you have opinions? Do you care about privacy and security? Are you eager to help push an honest conversation? Just looking for a password manager that helps you collaborate? <a href="https://community.passbolt.com/t/passbolt-community-plans-for-in-2023/6463">We want to hear from&nbsp;you!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/can-we-plz-talk-about-privacy-and-security-c3c431247147">Can we plz talk about privacy and security?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Voilà Verified Program Builds Real Trust in Digital Solutions by Spotlighting World-Class Vetted Digital Identity Solutions.</p>



<p>Vancouver, February 1st– The <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> (DIACC) is pleased to officially recognize Consult Hyperion as a Readiness Advisor to help vendors prepare for&nbsp; <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-overview/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a><a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-overview/">TM</a> (PCTF) certification.</p>



<p>A non-profit coalition of over 115 public and private members, the DIACC develops research and opportunities to enable Canada’s confident, safe, and full participation in a global digital economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the PCTF certification goals is to provide certainty and trust in the Canadian market by ensuring that the identity checks will be consistent and trustworthy. Getting Consult Hyperion recognized as a Readiness Advisor will help to prepare vendors to go through this journey,” says Joni Brennan, president of the DIACC. “With the PCTF, and now with Voilà Verified, there is an opportunity to adopt a framework rooted in trust – and to earn compliance recognition. Voilà Verified identifies those who are ‘walking the walk’ and delivering safe and secure access to the global digital economy.”</p>



<p>The DIACC’s PCTF is a publicly available framework for identity solutions that defines client, customer, and individual duty of care. The Voilà Verified program provides a vetting and assessment opportunity where PCTF-compliant solution vendors can earn a public-facing trustmark. The result? Spotlight visibility of trustworthy, safe, reliable, and efficient solutions.</p>



<p>‘Consult Hyperion is excited by the vibrant digital identity and authentication market within Canada and recognizes that the PCTF central to its success. A strong encompassing framework and robust certification process is the foundation for any interoperable service.’ &nbsp;says Justin Gage, Consult Hyperion’s Digital Identity delivery lead for North America. ”Consult Hyperion has over 20 years’ experience designing and implementing global interoperable payment systems, which are currently used by billions of people in every continent every day. More recently we have advised several organizations developing PCTF compliant solutions and look forward to helping them with their successful application to Voilà Verified for accreditation.”</p>



<p>Voilà Verified presents an opportunity to grow provincial-level investments in digital identity solutions. Provincial governments which have launched identity services can now earn a trustmark of their own, and provinces that are on the cusp of entering the digital solution market can do so with confidence by seeking vendors with a Voilà Verified trustmark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ruth Puente, Voilà Verified’s Trustmark Verification Program Manager, says “We are glad to welcome Consult Hyperion as a Readiness Advisor, which will bring its remarkable expertise in the identity domain to conduct gap analysis regarding the requirements that will help service providers to prepare the application for VVP Verification.”.</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is inclusive yet diligent in verifying PCTF-compliant solutions. The program was developed in alignment with ISO standards <a href="https://www.iso.org/benefits-of-standards.html">&nbsp;</a>– and empowers informed decision-making in a rapidly growing ecosystem of identity solutions,” said Puente. “Delivering high-quality service, customer protection, and Increasing access to trustworthy solutions are our priorities. We have formed teams of international experts to perform assessments and to oversee the process through an impartial lens.”</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is a unique opportunity in which I am honoured to share my experience as an advisor and auditor within information security, compliance, and identity,” says Björn Sjöholm, Cybersecurity Entrepreneur of Seadot, and Trustmark Oversight Board Chair.</p>



<p>Vendors are turning to the Voilà Verified program for several reasons, but the leading value proposition is market differentiation. Trustmark holders stand out from competitors by unlocking global business opportunities through international recognition and credibility.</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified puts internationally reputable identity solutions on the map,” says Dave Nikolejsin, the DIACC’s Board Chair. “This is the way forward. With lateral growth of PCTF compliance across sectors – public and private – we establish a common value of trust. Voilà Verified is a monumental stride for Canada to influence a safe and secure global digital economy.”</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/guides/digital-education"></a>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETv6nLypoL4">this talk</a> Ollie Bray, Strategic Director Education Scotland, talks on the Future of Digital in Scottish Education. 
 This is part of a series intended to share insights from keynote leaders from across Scottish Education on where they see Digital Technology in the sector is headed. 
<p>From 12m:30s Ollie talks about how Scotland has long been a pioneer of Technology for Learning, being a leader in adopting computers in schools and online learning systems.</p>
<p>But critically, this hasn’t necessarily been accompanied by modernization of the associated teaching practices.</p>
<p>Covid highlighted this, where online learning was simply a process of moving traditional teaching models into a virtual world, not really embracing the capabilities to change how teaching itself is delivered.</p>
<p>With this in mind at 33m:40s Ollie asks how do we equip young people’s skills to prepare them for online learning, given the sector continues to move in that direction. It can be a challenging experience for them.</p>
<p>He suggests one key methodology for addressing this is Building Digital Communities. He feels the Scottish Curriculum is well designed to lend itself to that, and at 45m:50s he explores the pedagogies that can support the adoption of digital across Scottish schools.</p>
<p>Ollie sees the curriculum reform in Scotland as a great opportunity to develop different types of curriculum experiences, where technology can play a more pivotal role in enhancing teaching and learning in general, not just in computing subjects.</p>

<p>IBM, Publications Office of the European Union, and Others Advance Open Standard for IT-Enabled Code Lists Used in Transportation, Finance, and Other Areas</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 1 February 2023 – Members of OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, have approved Code List Representation (genericode) v1.0 as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies that highest level of ratification. Developed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/codelist">Code List Representation Technical Committee</a> (TC), the format, known as “genericode,” is a single semantic model for code lists and accompanying XML serialization that is designed to IT-enable and standardize the publication of machine-readable code list information and its interchange between systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A code list in its simplest form is a set of strings that represent an item or idea. Standardized code lists include country abbreviations, currency abbreviations, shipping container descriptors, and airport codes, while nonstandardized code lists used between trading partners include financial account types, workflow status indicators, and any set of values representing the semantics of related concepts known between the parties involved in information interchange. Genericode, a standardized code list representation, is a complete description of a code list, including alternate codes, and any other associated data. Genericode also describes how new code lists are derived from existing code lists, so that the derivation is repeatable, automatable and auditable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Code lists have been used for many years, often published and disseminated in manners that have not been IT-enabled nor standardized. Genericode is needed to ensure that communities, from business sectors to public authorities worldwide, are able to publish, exchange, and process code lists, a key element for business documents and data spaces interoperability, with a standardized IT-enabled representation,” said Andrea Caccia, Chair of the Code List Representation TC. “Since 2007, with the publication as a Committee Specification, genericode has been widely used. With its publication as an OASIS Standard, it’s expected to gain even more traction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Publications Office of the European Union publishes European Public Procurement Notices on the TED website. We are pleased to announce the new generation of these notices, eForms, has been restructured using UBL and the associated genericode files,” said Ms. Hilde Hardeman, Director General of the Publications Office of the European Union. “We have made the genericode files that we use in the notices freely available for reuse in EU Vocabularies under the eProcurement Business Collection.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participation in the Code List Representation TC is open to all through membership in OASIS. Key stakeholders (those who use code lists in their business exchanges) including standardization bodies, registration and source authorities, implementers of software and services, business sectors and public authorities, and others are invited to join the group.</p>

<p>Standard semantic model for code lists and accompanying serialization approved as an OASIS Standard</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that the call for consent has closed [1] and, effective 30 January 2023, Code List Representation (genericode) V1.0 is an OASIS Standard. Project Administration will now undertake the final tasks of preparing and loading the standard.</p>



<p>Code lists have been with us since long before computers. They should be well understood and easily dealt with by now. Unfortunately, they are not. As is often the case, if you take a fundamentally simple concept, you find everybody has their own unique view of what the problem is and how it should be solved.</p>



<p>The OASIS Code List Representation format, genericode, is a single semantic model of code lists and accompanying XML serialization that can encode a broad range of code list information. The serialization is designed to IT-enable the interchange or distribution of machine-readable code list information between systems.</p>



<p>The ballot was held under the OASIS call for consent procedure [2]. In the ballot, the candidate OASIS Standard received 14 affirmative consents and no objections.</p>



<p>Our congratulations to the members of the TC and to the community of implementers, developers and users who have brought the work successfully to this milestone</p>

<p>2023 brings a new year and a new Congress – but America is still struggling with many of the same old problems when it comes to digital identity and authentication. Passwords keep getting phished, new account fraud keeps growing, and companies and consumers continue to struggle to prove that they are not a proverbial “dog on the Internet.” It’s becoming a major policy concern – and policymakers are considering a number of new initiatives to better protect people and combat these trends.</p>



<p>On January 25th, the Better Identity Coalition, FIDO Alliance, and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC) came together to present a policy forum looking at “Identity, Authentication, and the Road Ahead.”</p>



<p>This policy forum brought together leaders from government, industry, and non-profits to discuss topics including:</p>



 
 The release of the ID Theft Resource Center Annual Data Breach Report 



 The impact of identity-related cybercrime on industry and government over the last year 



 The human toll of identity theft – and the need to build inclusive digital identity systems that work for everyone 



 What to expect from the new Congress and the Biden Administration in 2023 



 Updates on new products and standards like FIDO that can make identity and authentication both more secure and easier to use 



 Discussions on what can be done to drive better identity infrastructure in America

<p>By: FIDO staff</p>



<p>The identity landscape is set to undergo tremendous transformation in 2023 as lawmakers and regulators alike struggle to help protect individual privacy and improve access to services and the digital economy. A primary underpinning for what will enable the new identity landscape is strong authentication.</p>



<p>On Jan. 25, the<a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/"> Better Identity Coalition</a>, the FIDO Alliance, and the <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">ID Theft Resource Center</a> (ITRC) co-hosted the Identity, Authentication, and the Road Ahead Cybersecurity Policy Forum in Washington, D.C. to discuss the challenges and opportunities of identity and authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The full-day event included sessions loaded with data on the current state of data breaches, presentations by government leaders, panels on the state of passkeys and the path toward better identity in 2023 and beyond. A key theme that was often repeated throughout the day, by experts from government and industry alike, was the complexity of the identity landscape and the need for more collaboration and interoperable standards.</p>



<p>“A lot of our ability to make progress on the set of problems starts with a bigger issue, the recognition that identity is critical infrastructure and needs to be treated as such,” Jeremy Grant, Managing Director, Technology Business Strategy at Venable LLP and Coordinator, Better Identity Coalition said during his opening remarks for the event.</p>



<p>“Until we start to think about identity that way we’re going to continue to struggle to address challenges in this space.”</p>



 Identity risk continues to grow 



<p>In the opening keynote session, Jimmy Kirby, Acting Deputy Director of FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) outlined the identity related issues his agency has seen in recent years.</p>


 
 


<p>Kirby said that in recent years financial services have been increasingly migrating towards a primarily online environment. It’s a trend that creates new opportunities for abuse. As a result, FinCEN has been thinking about how it can leverage all of the data that financial institutions send to it to help stem the tide of abuse.&nbsp; He noted that identity related suspicious activity reports (SARs) submitted to FinCEN grew more than 15%, from 2021 to 2022.</p>



<p>According to Kirby, reports of threats at each stage of the customer identification process continue to grow from the proofing and enrollment stage to the authentication stage, including the use of compromised credentials, impersonation and artificial intelligence to conduct illicit finance.</p>



<p>While there are challenges, there are also opportunities.</p>



<p>“We see opportunities for digital identity to address customer identification breakdowns in customer onboarding, account logins, transaction monitoring, as well as in investigations,” Kirby said. “There are a number of features of a digital identity framework that, taken together, have the potential to address threats and spur innovation across all types of financial services.”</p>


 
 


<p>FinCEN isn’t the only organization seeing a spike in cybercrime. James Lee, COO of the ITRC (Identity Theft Resource Center) presented data from his organization’s <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/publication/2022-data-breach-report/">annual data breach report</a>. Among the top line highlights of the report is that there were 1,802 data breaches during the year impacting over 422 million victims.</p>



<p>Lee commented that a prevailing trend was an increase in supply chain attacks as a preferred attack vector over just malware. He also emphatically complained about the lack of information present in many data breach disclosures. Lee said that 66% of data breaches did not include information about the root cause of the attack which led to the breach or any victims details.</p>



<p>In a panel session, titled “Data Breach Notices Suck,” John Breyault, Vice President, Public Policy, Telecommunications and Fraud at <a href="https://nclnet.org">National Consumers League</a> (NCL) lamented the current state of password usage, which inevitably is a root cause for many data breaches.</p>



<p>“I have been doing consumer education work for 15 years now at NCL, and not a day goes by it seems that I don’t tell consumers to not use the same password across multiple accounts,” Breyault said.</p>



 Towards the U.S. Government plan on secure digital identity 



<p>In a lunchtime keynote, Congressman Bill Foster (IL-11), outlined his view on Congressional efforts to introduce a secure digital identity policy for the U.S.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>Foster emphasized time and again during his keynote that secure digital identity needs to be a bipartisan effort in the U.S. Congress as it’s an issue that impacts all Americans. While he noted that there might be some concerns about the U.S. government having a database of user identities that it issues, he argued that to most people, the real life threat to their privacy comes more from having someone impersonate them online.</p>



<p>The lack of secure digital identity may have also been a factor in the massive volume of fraud experienced by the U.S. government over COVID benefits. Conversely, the fact there wasn’t a secure digital identity scheme in place may have made it more difficult than necessary for some to be able to get benefits. Overall, Foster said that he’s hopeful Congress can put something together.</p>



<p>“It can serve as a gentle reminder that the government does some good in your life,” Foster said. “One of the things that we could do a much better job with is preventing identity fraud, because that’s a real life pain for tens of millions of Americans every year.”</p>



 Bias and diversity is a requirement of digital identity 



<p>In multiple sessions over the course of the event, the topic of fairness, bias and diversity in relation to digital identity was discussed.</p>



<p>Jordan Burris, VP and Head of Public Sector Strategy at Socure commented that in his view, bias a lot of times comes down to the reality that an identity approach is taken that is solving for the majority of the population, and as such, the minority or those who operate on the fringes are being left out of the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Andrew Stettner, Deputy Director for Policy at the Office of Unemployment Insurance Modernization at the U.S. Department of Labor argued that his agency and the entire administration are taking equity in identity very seriously.</p>



<p>“We’re looking at equity in a much more conscious way, for us is a very key element of identification going forward,” Stettner said.</p>



 Why FIDO is critical for better identity 



<p>A critical element of secure identity is having strong authentication.</p>


 
 


<p>In a keynote session, Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO of FIDO Alliance, outlined the ways that FIDO is playing a role in helping to improve the state of identity today across multiple efforts. He also predicted that FIDO will become increasingly relevant in the year ahead.</p>



<p>“The average person on the street will start to understand what identity verification means, and actually start to understand what digital identity means,” Shikiar said. “That’s a net benefit because the more people understand what their identity means, and the importance of it, the more steps they’ll take to actually protect it.”</p>



<p>Among the FIDO efforts to help improve identity outlined by Shikiar are:</p>



 
 Biometric performance criteria. This is a biometric certification program, where FIDO helps to assess the performance of different biometric components that are critical to identity verification. 



 Remote Identity Verification. This includes the Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification for mobile document verification, with ongoing work into face verification for liveness and selfie-match. 
 



<p>Shikiar also talked at length about <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, which brings added usability to FIDO based strong authentication.</p>



<p>“FIDO Alliance’s mission is to reduce the industry reliance on passwords,” Shikiar said. “Simply put, passkeys stand to take passwords out of play for the vast majority of consumer use cases.”</p>



 The passkey future for authentication 



<p>In a panel session on passkeys, panelists discussed the benefits and opportunities that passkeys will bring.</p>


 
 


<p>Tim Cappalli, Identity Standards Architect at Microsoft detailed what passkeys enable, including the ability to take a FIDO credential and use it in a similar way to how password managers work today. Passkeys can also be synchronized with a cloud provider and are interoperable across platform vendors enabling better usability overall.</p>



<p>Panelists emphasized that the promise of passkeys is to more easily enable users to benefit from strong authentication. Christiaan Brand, Product Manager, Identity and Security at Google explained that Google has been supporting FIDO for years, including supporting security key based approaches. In his view, passkeys represent the usability necessary to actually make strong authentication with un-phishable credentials a reality for Google’s users.</p>



<p>Usability was also a theme that Paul Grassi, Principal Product Manager – Identity Services at Amazon emphasized, since in in his view, past efforts to get strong authentication adoption haven’t been entirely successful</p>



<p>“It breaks my heart to say it but consumers are not adopting security keys, they’re not adopting Google Authenticator they’re not adopting two-factor,” Grassi said. “We’re excited to see passkeys as that replacement, and to see the adoption numbers skyrocket, reducing friction while increasing security, which is, I think, the goal of any security practitioner.”</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/guides/gaming"></a>Think, Fight, Feel 
 As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/jul/19/video-gaming-artificial-intelligence-ai-is-evolving">Guardian writes</a> AI is playing an increasingly important role in Games. 
<p>From more intelligent characters through dynamically generating complex story-lines to rendering ever more life-like graphics, the technology is infused throughout the gaming experience.</p>
<p>Scotland boasts a world-class depth of expertise that can play a critical role in advancing the industry as a whole.</p>
 Scottish AI Alliance 
<p>This includes the <a href="https://www.scottishai.com/about">Scottish AI Alliance</a>, who recently hosted a podcast on the topic.</p>
<p>The Alliance is tasked with the delivery of the actions outlined in Scotland’s AI Strategy in an open, transparent and collaborative way, and the group provides a focus for dialogue, collaboration and, above all, action on all things AI in Scotland.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/60r6ly3SjiAaL0dqdp0Evg">this episode</a> of their podcast they caught up with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorhofer">Gregor Hofer</a>, CEO Speech Graphics, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewthomasjack/">Matthew Jack</a>, CEO Kythera AI, to find out how they are using AI to improve video game experiences.</p>
<p></p>
 Chris van der Kuyl – How is AI used within video games? 
 Chris van der Kuyl, Chairman of 4J Studios, is a seminal figure in Scotland’s gaming industry, and on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2Ui51hUUU">this RSE webinar</a> explore in depth the topic of AI within video games. 
<p>At 00:12, Kuyl introduces the wide definition of AI.</p>
<p>He says game designers typically ‘cheat’ because if they use the perfect AI technology it would consume all the processing capacity and then the game will typically slow down, especially if it’s a massively multiplayer game. Typically game developers use&nbsp;an unsophisticated side of AI which utilizes basic rules as to what one should do in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>There is also a use of much more sophisticated AI, such as providing the intelligence for a computer controlled character for the player to fight against, so that it feels as much as possible&nbsp;like playing with a real human being.</p>
 What are some examples of outstanding use of AI within games? 
<p>At 01:45, Kuyl says that the ultimate accolade is when a player can’t tell whether it’s AI software on the other end or a real player, a passing of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a> so to speak.</p>
<p>When you look for specific examples, some of the work being done recently on very sophisticated AI is exemplified when you talk about games like chess and Go where they are remarkably good and are defeating the worlds best players. (An evolution documented in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y">AlphaGo movie</a>).</p>
<p>Companies in the UK are also developing AI algorithms that keep getting better, you don’t tell the machine how to play but instead effectively tell them the rules. Because of the fast speed and processing of these algorithms, within hours and sometimes minutes, they turn in to the world’s best players without a human telling anything. Especially board games with fixed rules are where AI has been executed the best so far.</p>
 How has the gaming industry pushed AI advancements within other industries? 
<p>From 04:32, Kuyl says it’s difficult to state that games alone are advancing AI innovations, instead it is a simultaneous progress in parallel across multiple industries and open source communities.</p>
<p>However gaming and the gaming industry is an ideal environment for trying out new algorithms and feeding knowledge back into the communities. In particular Chris believes that what game development is the best at it is utilizing limited resources; as he mentioned developers ‘cheat’, referring to their approach of finding the optimal model for achieving game play functionality and also the huge amounts of user testing gaming delivers.</p>
<p>Thus they provide the best forum for making use of algorithms in the real world and feed that knowledge back into the academic community.</p>
 Is it possible for AI engines to adapt themselves using this player feedback? 
<p>At 06:43, Kuyl mentions how all good game developers put metrics into games to see data regarding how people genetically play the game, where the hotspots are and where improvements can be made in time. However a fine balance has to be struck between the improvements and game experience because you can’t significantly make changes like people stop defeating levels that they could easily defeat earlier.</p>
 Have hardware advancements allowed developers to push the boundaries of AI? 
<p>At 08:53, Kuyl talks about the integration of such sophisticated AI has been made possible because of the overall improvement in technology. He talks specifically about GPUs (Graphical Processing Units), that companies like Nvidia and AMD make, that may sound very expensive to people but the processing power it gives the user is almost inconceivable. Twenty or thirty years ago this was a power only available in Cray supercomputers.</p>
<p>He also talks about how in automotive industry, people have started using autonomous AI algorithms to drive cars. He also goes on to talk about cloud based AI in massively multiplayer games which, from a player’s perspective, is a player like any other player but it’s mainly to gather feedback. Some of that can also be challenging because they have to careful to not let the user experience be affected.</p>
 What are your views on the ‘Paper Clip Theory’? 
<p>At 13:29, he says that everyone has to realize that any computer program and any instructed machine will operate as the humans have made it to. However with AI, there’s no doubt that you have to be incredibly careful. He goes on to talk about the different schools of thought, the followers of one are extremely scared about the future of AI as it gets stronger while the other are very optimistic.</p>
<p>He talks about robots are never meant to harm the user so the same should be kept in mind while building systems with AI to rule out any negative implications. He says the optimization of anything without thinking of the consequences around it can naturally be harmful.</p>
<p>(The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip maximizer</a>” is a thought experiment&nbsp;described by Swedish philosopher&nbsp;Nick Bostrom&nbsp;in 2003. It illustrates the&nbsp;existential risk&nbsp;that an&nbsp;artificial general intelligence&nbsp;may pose to human beings when programmed to pursue even seemingly-harmless goals, and the necessity of incorporating&nbsp;machine ethics&nbsp;into&nbsp;artificial intelligence design.)</p>
 Do you think improved AI will hurt future developers or become another tool? 
<p>At 20:16, he says that the availability of solutions has really made a significant difference. He doesn’t think reinventing the wheel is necessary so a lot of record developments are optimized, shared and making life easier. He also believes that these developments should be democratized to avoid the alchemist paradox where only one person has all the knowledge so naturally they become more valuable.</p>
<p>He references the inventor of Minecraft (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson">Markus Persson</a>) as a great example. He didn’t overly concern himself with it being the best technology but rather that it delivered the best gaming experience for players, and then as the venture grew organizations like Chris’ 4J Studios could worry about the detail of platform optimizations. This is a guiding principle for the type of team members Chris is looking for.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/guides/gaming/"></a>This article begins an Industry Innovation Roadmap for Scotland’s <a href="https://digitalscot.net/guides/gaming/">Gaming sector</a>. 
<p>Industry Innovation Roadmaps provide a vehicle for a sector to collaboratively develop a shared growth strategy, encompassing market research, product innovation and development of new routes to market.</p>
 Career Opportunities 
 In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNWMEChyFhI">STV News special</a> they highlight just one dimension of the sector, sharing the story of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRealSlimJade">Jade MacIntyre</a> who is developing a career as a game streamer. 
<p>Jade broadcasts to more than 20k followers of her Facebook live streams playing Call of Duty.</p>
<p>It has proven more lucrative than the law degree she began and is personally much more rewarding for her too. Jade was urged into it by friends and was initially reluctant but decided to give it a go and her success brought sponsors and advertising revenues.</p>
<p>So this gives a small taste of the fact the gaming offers many different facets and career opportunities not just game programming.</p>
 Scotland’s Gaming Industry 
<p>From 3m:15s in the video STV move on to describing the gaming industry for Scotland. In the UK it’s now a sector worth £7 billion. Dundee boasts more than 40 companies with thousands of employees, and has plans to open a 4,000 seat capacity <a href="https://thebusinessofesports.com/2022/03/01/dundee-esports-arena-expected-to-open-in-2025/">Esports arena</a>.</p>
<p>They interview the team at Dundee and Angus College to highlight how the sector acts as a magnet and enabler for students to enter the industry. One very interesting career journey they share is of Lucas Blakeley, who began in motor racing but had to give it up due to costs who then found success as a virtual F1 Esports racer, and that success enabled him to return to real-world racing.</p>
<p>Scottish Enterprise provides industry support for Scotland’s digital sectors, and <a href="https://www.sdi.co.uk/business-in-scotland/find-your-industry/digital-and-technology-industries/games-and-creative-industries">here</a> provides an overview of the cluster.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://scottishgames.net/2022/05/11/scottish-games-industry-growing-more-quickly-than-uk-may-22/">Scottish Games Network reports</a> that Scotland’s industry grew 26% between April 2020 and December 2021, keeping Scotland’s position as the UK’s <a href="https://scottishgames.net/2020/01/29/scotlands-game-development-sector-ranked-4th-in-uk/">fourth largest games cluster</a>, following London, the South East and the North West. There are over 2,000 creative staff working on games development in 147 companies, generating over £350 million for Scotland’s economy.</p>
 Playing to Win 
<p>To the point of our innovation roadmap there are also challenges and much more room for growth, indeed given the success of the sector thus far and the ever-expanding global market, it’s a strategic priority for our whole economy to do so.</p>
<p>The founder of the Scottish Games Network Brian Baglow talks with the Herald’s Neil Mackay in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19257294.neil-mackays-big-read-success-another-level---scotlands-bizarre-silence-genius-video-games-not-compute/">this interview</a>, providing a detailed summary of just how successful the sector has been but yet coverage is very low key – Scotland should be doing far more to shout about it.</p>
<p>The cost of living crisis is forcing a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63906654">slow down in recruitment</a> and last year <a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/business-environment/business/3302114/uk-wide-games-network/">the Courier wrote</a> that Scotland risks being left behind.</p>
<p>The article cites the report ‘<a href="https://ourscottishfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Playing-to-Win.pdf">Playing to Win</a>‘ published by Our Scottish Future, which warns Scotland’s gaming sector now risks being left behind as American, Chinese and Japanese giants dominate the market, and proposes the development of a UK-wide network to leverage economies of scale.</p>
<p>“The National Strategy for Economic Transformation launched earlier this year in Dundee. It does not grasp the potential for greater cooperation with the rest of the UK. </p>
<p>Nor has Westminster woken up to the value of combining Scottish expertise with industry across the country.”</p>
<p>The report offers a first blueprint that can act as an Action Plan for Scotland’s gaming sector, with a number of recommendations to draw out and act on.</p>
 Collaboration Network – Building Scotland’s Games Ecosystem 
<p>The central theme of building a collaboration network is one that can be pursued with immediate impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://gamesandgaming.gla.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SGE-Briefing-Document-Oct-2022.pdf"></a>As Brian Baglow <a href="https://www.digit.fyi/scottish-games-industry-tech-collaboration/">comments to Digit</a> he already leads such work to great effect, and academics at Stirling and Glasgow Universities <a href="https://www.scottishfinancialnews.com/articles/video-games-ecosystem-project-aims-to-boost-scottish-games-industry">teamed up</a> on research to help create more successful companies that can compete on a global basis, producing <a href="https://gamesandgaming.gla.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SGE-Briefing-Document-Oct-2022.pdf">this report</a>.</p>
<p>This research offers another knowledge asset to build an action plan around, providing a number of critical insights that can be acted on:</p>
 
 Companies are geographically scattered – No games hub. 
 Highly competitive sector. 
 Difficulty connecting with potential clients, especially internationally. 
 Difficulty recruiting talent: a skills gap and an access issue, locally and internationally. 
 Little collaboration between academia and games. 
 Lack of funding for joint projects. 
 Weak entrepreneurial culture and mindset – Game Makers do not identify as entrepreneurs. 
 Weak networks among the game maker community – Weak networks between game makers and other key actors. 
 The sector is not well understood, which undermines the quality of support – Key support needs around the commercial side of running a company. 
 Lack of role models to inspire future generations. Lack of mentors to provide guidance. 
 There is nobody leading the industry (!) 
 
<p>Clearly Scotland’s opportunity is simply one of execution: These are all challenges easily addressed through the resources we have to hand.</p>
<p>The global market is vast in size while our small country punches far above it’s weight in both legacy and sector capability, meaning it’s not a challenge of building from scratch but rather of more and better joining of dots to yield a further boost for an already supercharged industry.</p>
<p>The report offers the headline theme and objective of the action plan:&nbsp;Building Scotland’s Games Ecosystem.</p>

 A headline feature of our Digital Nation Action Plan is the development of ‘Industry Innovation Roadmaps’. 
 Industry Innovation Roadmaps provide a vehicle for a sector to collaboratively develop a shared growth strategy, encompassing market research, product innovation and development of new routes to market. 
<p>Roadmaps collate market research, identify niche opportunities and co-ordinate a shared innovation pipeline for members to co-develop products to meet those opportunities.</p>
 Global Best Practices 
<p>The approach is based on best practices from around the world, notably Canada.</p>
<p>Canada has made extensive use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster">Michael Porter’s cluster model</a>&nbsp;to underpin their economic development strategies, a focus on building industry sector collaborations that pool resources and encourage shared innovation that grows the success for all the participating members.</p>
<p>The backbone of these efforts are the creation of ‘Technology Roadmaps‘ (TRMs), a common product innovation roadmap and business plan for the whole industry that each business contributes to and can benefit from.</p>
<p>Technology Roadmaps are introduced and how to use them explained in detail in <a href="https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2012/ic/Iu44-58-2007-eng.pdf">this guide</a>, and the Canadian Government further explains them <a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/offices-labs/canmet/technology-roadmaps/5765">here</a>, providing a list of completed roadmap programs for industries such as electric vehicles, intelligent buildings and smart grids among others, where they describe:</p>
<p>“Technology roadmapping brings players together to work together in a far-reaching planning process and opens the door to collaborative research and development (R&amp;D).</p>
<p>Technology Roadmaps (TRM) can play a key role in enhancing innovation. It is a document outlining future market demand and the recommended means to meet this demand. A roadmap does not predict future breakthroughs in science or technology; rather, it forecasts and articulates the elements required to address future technological needs. A roadmap describes a given future, based on the shared vision of the people developing the roadmap and provides a framework for making that future happen technologically.”</p>

 Micro Clusters 
<p>Clusters&nbsp;have long been a staple of government’s Economic Development strategies but are often organized by government in a top down fashion around large, broad industries like aerospace, and typically feature mostly large enterprises.</p>
<p>For smaller countries like Scotland with mostly SMEs this can be a limited approach, and so Digital Scotland is pioneering an approach of ‘Micro Clusters’, a bottom up forming up of an industry group around very specialized, small but very high growth niche segments.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/multi-factor-authentication">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>&nbsp;gets touted as a significant security improvement over traditional “username + password” authentication. However, not all MFA processes are created equal. As the opportunities narrow for cybercriminals to pick off the low-hanging fruit of password-only systems, they’ve turned their focus to weak MFA.</p>



<p>A growing number of organizations have suffered security breaches&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">despite having MFA in place</a>, thanks to expanding digital systems, more advanced phishing tools, and the continued allowance of passwords as an authentication factor. The past year, which saw Microsoft,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">Uber and Cisco</a>&nbsp;breached by MFA “prompt bombing,” demonstrates that organizations can’t just deploy any type of MFA and presume they’re safe from breaches.</p>



<p>For these reasons, the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency</a>&nbsp;(CISA) have emphasized the need for phishing-resistant MFA, specifically passwordless MFA built around FIDO standards. We’ve examined&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-fido2-authentication">FIDO standards</a>&nbsp;and what they mean for authentication before, but in this post, we look at one of the most critical elements of the process: FIDO Certified authenticators.</p>

<p>Well-implemented passkeys can improve the user experience and make it harder for cybercriminals to launch phishing and other attacks. </p>



<p>Passwords are a central aspect of security infrastructure and practice, but they are also a principal weakness involved in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2022/summary-of-findings/">81% of all hacking breaches</a>. Inherent useability problems make passwords difficult for users to manage safely. These security and useability shortcomings have driven the search for alternative approaches known generally as passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>Passkeys are a kind of passwordless authentication that is seeing increasing focus and adoption. They are set to become a key part of security in the coming years. Passkeys represent a more secure foundation for enterprise security. Although they are not foolproof (they can be synced to a device running an insecure OS, for example), they are far more secure than passwords for customers, employees, and partners alike.</p>

<p>Andrea Caccia, Jason Keirstead, and Vasileios Mavroeidis Named Distinguished Contributors</p> 


<p>26 January 2023 — OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the winners of the 2022 <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/open-standards-cup/">Open Cup</a>, which recognizes exceptional advancements within the OASIS technical community. The Open Cup for Outstanding New Initiative was awarded to <a href="https://github.com/niemopen/oasis-open-project#readme">NIEMOpen</a>, a framework for sharing critical data in justice, public safety, emergency management, intelligence, and security sectors. The Open Cup for Outstanding Approved Standard was awarded to <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=csaf">Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) v2.0</a>, a widely used open standard for automated security advisories and vulnerability reporting. Also announced were the 2022 OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/members/distinguished-contributors/">Distinguished Contributors</a>, individuals recognized for their significant impact on the open source and open standards communities: Andrea Caccia, Jason Keirstead, and Vasileios Mavoeidis.</p>



<p>Open Cup Recipients</p>



<p>The 2022 Outstanding New Initiative, NIEMOpen, transitioned to an OASIS Open Project from the U.S. Department of Defense in October. A collaborative partnership between private industry and all levels of governmental agencies, the NIEM framework enables the effective and efficient sharing of critical data as currently demonstrated in the justice, public safety, emergency and disaster management, intelligence, and homeland security sectors. Developing and implementing NIEM-based exchanges allows diverse organizations to leverage existing investments in information systems by building the bridges for interoperability at the data level.

 Trusted and extensible product master data hub based on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph and GS1 standards  Product master data — the foundation for supply chain visibility <p>Product master data is important in supply chain networks because it provides a consistent, accurate, and up-to-date set of information about the products that are being bought, sold, and moved through the supply chain. This data can be used by various stakeholders in the supply chain, such as manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, logistics providers, and consumers, to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and improve efficiency.</p><p>Having access to reliable product master data also sets the foundation for business partners to generate more advanced insights into their supply chains, including product supply chain visibility, authenticity verification, utilization reporting, and other insights that enable more sustainable supply chain management. For example, product master data, combined with LOT master data and supply chain event data, made interoperable using GS1 standards, is essential to getting a comprehensive end-to-end understanding of what transpired to products as they flowed through the supply chain towards the consumer — and make the necessary business decisions to address any identified issues.</p><p>There are several potential challenges that manufacturers face when it comes to sharing product master data with their business partners:</p>  Data quality — product master data shared with business partners needs to be accurate and up-to-date to avoid misunderstandings and making decisions based on outdated or wrong information. Maintaining data quality is therefore one of the key things for manufacturers to consider when setting up product master data-sharing mechanisms.  Data standardization — manufacturers share product master data with numerous business partners, so they need to make sure it is standardized and not in different formats for every business partner. Standardization significantly reduces the effort associated with sharing product master data and ensures everyone understands it in the same way. This is where GS1 standards, specifically the GS1 Global Data Model (GDM) and GS1 Attribute Definitions for Business (ADB), play a crucial&nbsp;role.  Data security — product master data may contain sensitive information about a manufacturer’s product and business operations. Sharing this data with business partners may increase the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to the data, so manufacturers need to make sure that there is sufficient data security in&nbsp;place.  Data ownership — sharing product master data is often done through third parties that aggregate master data from multiple manufacturers and enable access to their business partners. In these situations, manufacturers might have considerations about handing over the ownership of their data, as this data is inherently valuable.  <p>Some existing frameworks for product master data exchange, such as the GS1 GDSN Master Data Pools where GS1-certified third parties provide infrastructure for sharing product master data between manufacturers and their business partners, help address the first three challenges. However, the data ownership issue still persists, as these third parties aggregate product master data from various manufacturers in centralized systems, making them the de-facto data owners. Additionally, product master data in such systems is relatively isolated from and can’t be linked to other relevant supply chain data, such as LOT master data, supply chain events, IoT data, and others. This prevents manufacturers and their business partners from utilizing product master data to its full potential.</p> Trusted sharing of product master data with the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph and GS1 standards <p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) is an open-source infrastructure blending two powerful technologies, knowledge graphs and blockchains, to facilitate the trusted exchange of supply chain data. This is done by enabling businesses to transform their data into discoverable, verifiable, and interoperable knowledge assets. In the context of supply chains, a knowledge asset can be a variety of things, for example, a supply chain event, business location, trade document, or in this case product master&nbsp;data.</p><p>Turning their product master data into knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG, manufacturers essentially create an index of that data that their business partners can search to retrieve the required product information. This innovative and trusted way of exchanging product master data delivers value from multiple&nbsp;angles:</p>  Even though product master data is indexed on the OriginTrail DKG, the actual data can be kept on the manufacturer’s own IT real estate, allowing them to retain full data ownership and simply authorize their business partners to access it. When it comes to data privacy, the OriginTrail DKG allows for a full spectrum of&nbsp;options.  Product master data on the OriginTrail DKG is trusted and verifiable, meaning business partners can be absolutely certain that the data they need was issued by the product manufacturer.  Created knowledge assets are interoperable based on GS1 Global Data Model (GDM) standard, the same as in a traditional GDSN network, so they can be searched for and understood by all business partners.  Knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG can be easily updated at any time, ensuring that the latest product master data is available to business partners at all&nbsp;times.  <p>All of the characteristics above provide a powerful way to manage product master data, but this is only setting the foundation for a variety of other advanced business applications that can make use of it. As product master data in the form of knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG doesn’t live in isolation, it can be automatically linked to other relevant supply chain data across business partners. For example, it can be combined with instance/lot master data (GS1 CBV standard), relevant business locations (GS1 GLN Data Model standard), supply chain and consumer/end-user generated events (GS1 EPCIS standard), and other relevant data to provide comprehensive insights into supply chains, ranging from end-to-end product traceability to utilization reports, incident alerts, shipment risk profiling, insurance-related proofs, and many&nbsp;more.</p>Product master data and other supply chain data in the form of knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG, utilizing GS1 data standards.<p>Building such a supply chain data management hub with the OriginTrail DKG and GS1 standards can start off simple, focusing only on product master data, and be extended in stages — it is easy to introduce additional components, i.e. supply chain data, IT systems, and business partners. In fact, to streamline the creation and management of assets on the OriginTrail DKG, Trace Labs developed the Network Operation System (nOS) that makes it easy to connect to IT systems, apply the appropriate GS1 standards to the data, and create discoverable, verifiable and interoperable assets. Once those assets are available, specific business applications that make use of them can be built&nbsp;quickly.</p> AidTrust: A BSI and Trace Labs&nbsp;solution <p>Ensuring the transparency and traceability of medicine distribution is important, but it can be challenging. Pharmaceutical supply chains are increasingly complex and often don’t have standardized management controls, leading to issues with security, inventory management, and other aspects of distribution. If product distribution is not properly managed, it can result in suspicious loss, diversion, damaged and wasted products, and uncertainty about whether the medicines reached their intended patients.</p><p><a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/healthcare/donated-medicines-and-vaccines/">AidTrust</a> increases transparency and trust in the distribution of medicines by bringing together BSI’s global presence and supply chain risk management expertise with the OriginTrail DKG, developed by Trace Labs. As a business application built on the OriginTrail DKG, it enables visibility (product flows and utilization, inventory levels, etc.), risk alerts, and real-time decision-making at all stages of the supply chain while protecting the integrity, security, and privacy of data. Ultimately, the goal of AidTrust is to help donor organizations and NGOs demonstrate that donated medicines were handled properly and reached the intended patients, even in challenging environments.</p><p>BSI and Trace Labs have been working with the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), an NGO distributing donated hemophilia medicine to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), to deploy AidTrust across 25+ treatment centers in India. The main objective is to better understand product utilization through increased supply chain visibility, particularly after products arrive at the in-country distribution center and are distributed to treatment centers across India. To achieve this, knowledge assets on the OriginTrail DKG are created from existing data locked in IT systems, amended by supply chain data generated by warehouse staff, treatment center staff, and physicians using the AidTrust scanning&nbsp;app:</p>  Product master data (GS1 GDM standard), such as manufacturer, GTIN, product description, and packaging level. This is the foundation that enables all other supply chain data to be linked and understood in a comprehensive manner,  Product LOT master data (GS1 CBV standard), such as LOT numbers and expiry&nbsp;dates,  Supply chain events (GS1 EPCIS standard), such as shipping, receiving, destroying, and dispensing to patients. Some events are generated from data already stored in IT systems, while others are created using data captured by users with the AidTrust scanning&nbsp;app.  <p>These verifiable and interoperable knowledge assets from across the supply chain network power the AidTrust business app, where WFH can log in and get real-time utilization reporting, diversion alerts, inventory overview of treatment centers, and other insights. This enables them to manage their donations much more efficiently and helps ensure products reach their intended patients. After successful deployment in India, BSI and Trace Labs are now in discussion for rollout to further countries.</p>AidTrust dashboard and scanning application.<p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing trusted AI — grade knowledge assets.

 What did you work on? 



<p>Project name: <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62242656">GVCR: Secure Verifiable Credential Registries (VCR) for GitHub &amp; GitLab</a></p>



<p>My name is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sarvesh67">Sarvesh Shinde</a> and this is my personal blog that I’m writing to share my experience of working on the GVCR Project. A little background about the project is really necessary to fully appreciate the objectives of this project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a digital identity management model in which an individual or a company has the exclusive ownership over their accounts and personal data. A verifiable credential protocol, in turn, forms one of the three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity, along with the Decentralized Identifiers protocol (DIDs) and Distributed Ledger Technology (or blockchain).</p>



<p>This project was conceptualized to provision secure verifiable credential registries that utilize Github’s data model and API to offer exactly the same APIs for any other verifiable credential registry. This project exists as an extension to the DRMan project.</p>



<p>The DRMan project, inspired by the SDKMan, acts as a tool for managing multiple versions of different software development libraries. These libraries form the necessary dependencies for the extended feature modules that reside inside DRMan, including GVCR.</p>



 What did you learn or accomplish? 



<p>GVCR, along with DRMan, is a command line utility. This project has been entirely written in shell script. Shell script has a distinct advantage of making the tool light weight, easy to install and to use.</p>



<p>As of now, GVCR has been provisioned to utilize Github and Gitlab as its two git based registries. The plugin architecture of GVCR allows it to provision for more VCRs in the relative future. The APIs of these individual git based registries are designed to be a collection of facade functions that provide the same feature on the surface, all the while accommodating for the individual data models of the specific registry under the hood.</p>



<p>GVCR can be utilized in an <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> Framework as an implementation of VCR and collaborates with existing Agent and Wallet open source projects in Hyperledger Aries. It can also be used in <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> projects by providing endpoints of cryptographic verifications for credential issuers.</p>



<p>In near future, GVCR is envisioned to leverage <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a> to implement encryption, decryption and verification functions for verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>I was responsible for the design and implementation of this very GVCR module.</p>



<p>Now coming to the topic of the mentorship program itself, let me give you a rundown of its structure, working mechanism and decision making process. This mentorship was a careful balance of a hands-off approach towards the design planning and realization part that I undertook and the existence of biweekly meetings that acted as an efficient feedback mechanism from the mentors. These biweekly meetings were really efficient in setting the tempo of the progress and made sure that all the involved participants were aware of their individual tasks at hand.</p>



<p>The mentorship started on June 1st and continued until November 16th. Further, the mentorship was broken into two halves. In general, the first half was more focused on the design aspect of this project while the second half came down to its implementation.</p>



 What comes next? 



<p>Overall, this mentorship has been a wonderful experience and has enabled me to pursue my career in blockchain. The future of a secure, verifiable digital identity and its co-operability with a decentralized ledger brings a new outlook to the future of digital identity and just how important its acceptance is to finally realizing the ultimate goal of exclusively owning our own identities. New technologies are constantly coming up to make this future a reality, and I’m looking forward to contributing my part towards it.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of the ADI Association?</p>



<p>The mission of the ADI Association is to create a global digital identity framework for creating, managing, and using digital identity as well as sharing personal information. This system solves some of the most important practical problems attached to the operation and adoption of decentralized identity technology with an accountable governance framework by enabling a business interoperability layer as well as a technological specification.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Establishing an effective model for digital identity is a priority that spans industries. The traditional identity model for the digital world has been an account with a password. Service Providers give each of their customers an account and assume that those accounts can be secured. However, accounts are breached, and data are compromised. Service Providers do not often even know if the person who created the account was legitimate. In the physical world, individuals can prove who they are by presenting formal documents like a driver’s license, passport, or birth certificate. In the digital world, individuals cannot definitively prove who they are, and the malicious can easily masquerade as someone they are not. This gap between physical and digital identity has led to an exponential increase in online fraud as more interactions and financial transactions have gone digital. It has also led to a rapid rise in misinformation and disinformation propagating through online social media. </p>
 



  
<a href="https://adiassociation.org/"></a> 


<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>In the physical world, identities are created at birth by a trusted group of people. Parents choose names; hospitals record birth events; and governments create birth records, which are then used by individuals to register at schools, employers, banks, medical facilities, and so on. Everything an individual does in life is tied to that identity, and that identity becomes the accountable party. ADI Association has defined a similar concept for the digital world, called the “Digital Address.” The next generation of federated identity standards should support the issuance of a lifetime digital identity that a consumer can use across the digital services of their choice. It should eliminate passwords and protect personal data. The Accountable Digital Identity (ADI) Association is developing an open standard, based on decentralized identity, for bootstrapping individual identities online. The work will give identity providers and relying parties a framework to establish secure exchanges of identity-based services for their consumers, customers, employees, and partners. The ADI Association focuses on standards that enhance the digital consumer experience while improving cyber security at the same time.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>As a current leader, Canada has the opportunity to frame how the future gets shaped by digital identity for both online use cases as well as in the physical world.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>The ADI Association believes that this work cannot be done by a single organization, but will only be realized by concerted efforts to create and promote open standards which can be made available to and adopted by all.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>The ADI Association is a diverse coalition of companies and organizations from around the world who have come together to create an interoperable specification and ecosystem for accountable identity. This level of coordination across industries seamlessly connects a global community of businesses, governments, healthcare providers, and other organizations with customers, people, and patients to modernize the way we manage our online digital interactions.</p>

 Documenting our first IRL meetup since the&nbsp;pandemic From left: John Bevan, Bryan Mathers, Doug Belshaw, Anne Hilliger, Laura&nbsp;Hilliger<p>Last week, four members of We Are Open Co-op, plus one collaborator, descended on an American-style villa in the Netherlands for a meetup. We left with three members, two collaborators, a new pair of socks, some plans, and great memories.</p><p>Our aims and ‘rules’ for the week, such as they were, could be outlined&nbsp;simply:</p>  Take some time away from client projects to reflect on who we are, where we’ve been, and where we’re&nbsp;going.  Hang out with each other in real life and have some&nbsp;fun.  The co-op will pay for everything. Except&nbsp;spirits.  <p>Well, we managed two of the three. And it didn’t get too messy after some heavy pouring by the bartender at the <a href="https://tontonclub.nl/">TonTon Club</a>&nbsp;🥃</p> Collaborator pathways &amp; member&nbsp;benefits CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual&nbsp;Thinkery</a><p>After an extended period of <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/guidelines/membership">dormancy</a> in 2022, we knew that Bryan intended to step down as a director of WAO to become a collaborator. We’re looking forward to actually working with him more this year than last, now that he’s done the “wandering and crying” (his words!) needed to find <a href="https://ulster.visualthinkery.com/">what’s been calling&nbsp;him</a>.</p><p>The image above was drawn by Bryan during a session where we though about what it means to be a collaborator with, versus being a member of, WAO. As with any business, it’s about money and power, although that operates in a different way within an organisation with a flat hierarchy and <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2020/08/25/consent-decision-making/">consent-based decision&nbsp;making</a>.</p><p>Essentially, we would love to grow the co-op by working with more collaborators. The benefit for us includes everything from accessing new clients to learning new skills and discovering different ways of working. We would hope that the benefits of working with WAO are manifold and obvious, but for the avoidance of doubt, it’s autonomy, solidarity, and a pathway to becoming a&nbsp;member.</p> Highway to membership CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual&nbsp;Thinkery</a><p>Talking of pathways to becoming a member of WAO, we talked about that too! Outlining a policy for this is a bit of a ‘Goldilocks’ strategy, as while the <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity/">first principle</a> of the International Cooperative Alliance is ‘voluntary and open membership’ there has to be some kind of speedbump. That barrier can’t be too high, though, otherwise we’ll never be able to welcome anybody&nbsp;new.</p><p>What we’ve settled on for now isn’t too much different from what went before. To join WAO, you need&nbsp;to:</p>  bring in work from your&nbsp;network  have worked with every current WAO&nbsp;member  mesh with our&nbsp;values  <p>Some of this is subjective. Of course it is. But then being a member of WAO currently also means being a company director so we want to get it right. While things may change in future with more than one class of membership, for now any additional members of WAO are taking on joint <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10150608">legal responsibility</a>.</p> Introducing the ‘Context Understudy’ CC BY <a href="https://laurahilliger.com">Laura Hilliger</a> of&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>When you’re a small organisation like our co-op, knowledge management can be both easier and more difficult than when you’re either a larger organisation or a single freelancer. It’s not sustainable for one member to be on every project, but nor is it reasonable to spend time documenting every little thing on every&nbsp;project.</p><p>At the meetup, we created the role of the ‘Context Understudy’. It’s a title that may change in name over time, but the idea is that they are the go-to partner for co-working. Just like an understudy in a theatrical play, they can step in as and when needed. They’re also the default person to co-work with on the&nbsp;project.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you have to be a member to lead a WAO project but you don’t have to be in order to be a Context Understudy. In fact, in terms of the ‘highway to membership’, bringing a project to the co-op and working on it in this way is a perfect&nbsp;fit.</p><p>We haven’t got a name we’re completely happy with for other roles on the project. ‘Skills provider’ feels… a bit corporate? Although that’s exactly what other people are bringing. As with everything, it’s a work in progress.</p> And now for something completely different… <p>If you’ve scrolled this far, you deserve more fun photos of our meetup. And we hate to disappoint!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wao-were-almost-seven-8921f530284b">WAO!

<p>The amount of data available about almost anything is growing, but if it’s not collected, processed and used in thoughtful and critical ways, the data increases risk of harm – especially to marginalised communities.</p>



<p>Many organisations doing evidence-based advocacy handle large amounts of data and need to strengthen their capacity to manage, store, and archive the data responsibly, as well as grow their knowledge on how to disseminate and present this data to external audiences in easily digestible ways.</p>



<p>Today we are launching a pilot of our new cohort learning programme: a collaborative course aimed to equip social justice leaders with the knowledge and tools needed for implementing responsible data (RD) practices and policies for their own internal operations, as well as for their advocacy efforts.</p>



 Our approach to cohort learning 



<p>Cohort learning represents a capacity building approach that connects peer support with tailored knowledge and vision, built from research, technical experimentation and community engagement The Engine Room has led over the past years.</p>



<p>Inspired by feminist movements and the “<a href="https://www.freire.org/paulo-freire/" title="">popular education</a>” movement that emerged in Latin America and widely adopted in other parts of the world, we are proposing a participatory learning approach that will allow participants to share their individual knowledge and enrich each other through collective engagements with the cohort. </p>



<p>Through community-facing activities we will stress the “action/reflection” principle; as the Freire Foundation <a href="https://www.freire.org/concepts-used-by-paulo-freire" title="">defines</a> this: “It is not enough for people to come together in dialogue in order to gain knowledge of their social reality. They must act together upon their environment in order critically to reflect upon their reality and so transform it through further action and critical reflection.”</p>



 What will the programme look like? 



<p>The learning process will consist of engaging sessions with experts from The Engine Room, asynchronous activities such as reading guided material and watching videos, and community building activities where participants facilitate conversations within their organisations and movements.</p>



<p>Once a module starts, participants will be asked to read selected material and watch presentations from the responsible data community. In the third week, participants will engage in a 1,5 hour session with the team that will lead to assignments meant to bring their learnings back to their communities for discussion. Throughout the module, participants will have the opportunity to connect online through an immersive virtual environment.</p>



<p>By the end of this learning programme, we hope that members of the cohort will be able to: </p>



 
 Apply responsible data principles to their own work. 



 Evaluate the relationship between power and the data they collect, and be able to identify and reject data practices that cause harm to the communities they serve. 



 Continue building connections with others in the field and accompany each other in their journey. 
 



<p>At the end of the program, participants will be connected to our <a title="">Light Touch Support</a> programme to receive guidance for their organisation to strengthen a responsible data area of their choice.</p>



 Programme content 



<p>Module 1: Introduction to responsible data management<br>During weeks 1 and 2, we’ll focus on everyone getting to know each other and establishing some ground rules together for an inclusive space where we can explore ideas, ask questions and learn from each other. We will also start diving into key concepts and principles that drive responsible data management, and reflect on how your organisation may already be using responsible data practices and how you may be able to apply this framework in future.</p>



<p>Module 2: Justice-based approach to data<br>Given the array of harms that people have caused (and continue to cause) through their use (or misuse) of data, this module considers how to apply justice frameworks to data. The resources cover data justice, data feminism and decolonial approaches to managing and thinking about data through a variety of readings, podcast episodes and videos. We’ll discuss what resonates and how these approaches can be applied in our various contexts.</p>



<p>Module 3: Where to start and what responsible data looks like for an organisation<br>It’s time to dive deeper into responsible data management. We’ll look at what RD means for your organisation, collective or movement, help you to understand where you’ve taken steps already and where you need to fill in gaps, and start strategising about ways to further apply the RD principles.</p>



<p>Module 4: Becoming RAD<br>Using what we’ve learned in previous modules, we’ll now focus on practical applications of RD. We’ll dive deeper into the data lifecycle, spend time on topics relevant to data collection such as informed consent, walk you through activities such as storing and analysing data, and lastly discuss ways of sharing your data safely and securely. Through this session, you’ll learn how to start developing your plan for data retention, archiving and deletion and how to map your organisation’s critical information management processes and assets, as well as potential data risks and harms.</p>



<p>Module 5: Moving Forward<br>RD encompasses every stage of the data process, from data collection to deletion. It’s a lot to work on, so how do you figure out where to start? We’ll explore how to make RD transformations doable by beginning with a few simple changes and developing a plan for identifying and addressing gaps.</p>

     <p>Two of the largest mobility-focused consortia in the world join efforts to co-develop solutions for more robust, resilient, and privacy-preserving connected ecosystems.   </p>
<p>Los Angeles — 23 January 2023: MOBI (Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative) today welcomes the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), an innovation and advocacy group representing over 16,000 franchised new-car dealer members, into its global community. </p>
<p>The MOBI community aims to develop and accelerate adoption of zero trust Web3 standards and solutions to enable seamless and secure business processes, while safeguarding sensitive business and consumer data. NADA brings a critical dealer viewpoint to this process. MOBI and NADA agree that the widespread adoption of a shared technology-agnostic framework will be critical to future innovations for members of both consortia. NADA and MOBI also believe that compliance with the Federal Zero Trust Strategy issued by the White House in 2022 will be crucial to maintain their competitive edge. </p>
<p>“We are thrilled to team up with NADA to co-develop solutions to help solve pain points for use cases such as Vehicle Registration, Titling, and Dealer Floorplan Audit,” said MOBI CEO and Founder, Tram Vo. “We look forward to collaborating on additional mobility and geolocation applications that improve security while preserving customer privacy.”</p>
<p>“NADA is excited to work with the experts at MOBI on behalf of dealers to ensure that this important technology improves and modernizes the auto retail experience, generates efficiencies, and brings increased convenience for dealers and consumers alike,” said Mike Stanton, President and CEO of NADA. </p>
<p>MOBI anticipates that NADA’s entry into the community at large will play a critical role in igniting a two-way exchange of expertise between the organizations’ respective communities, enabling greater collaboration on the road to more resilient mobility value chains and accelerating related innovations in research, development, and implementation. MOBI welcomes organizations of all sizes, industries, and locations to share expertise, define industry standards, and improve the sustainability, efficiency, and accessibility of mobility services around the world.</p>

<p>Ceramic’s first hard fork will take place on February 15, 2023.</p><p>All Ceramic nodes operating on Ceramic mainnet must upgrade to (at least) version <code>2.18.0</code> of the <code>@ceramicnetwork/cli</code> package by February 15, 2023.</p><p>The ‘HistorySync release’ will result in changes to Ceramic’s anchoring system, this work will enable the upcoming release of <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/composedb-using-ceramic-as-a-graph-database/">ComposeDB</a>. These changes will allow nodes to discover and sync existing data, for a given data model, from other nodes on the network.</p><p>Nodes that do not upgrade by February 15th will no longer verify anchor commits from the network, which will lead to the corruption and loss of all writes due to CACAO timeout errors. If you are operating a Ceramic mainnet node, please let us know if you have any concerns about upgrading on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">forum</a>.</p> Protocol Changes <p>Two main changes will affect how anchoring (time-stamping) works:</p>  There will no longer be simple, or regular, transactions to put Merkle tree roots onto Ethereum. Instead, an anchor smart contract will call an “anchor” function resulting in an “anchor event” that Ethereum RPC clients can subscribe to. This will make it easier for Ceramic nodes to discover when anchors happen and to sync the history of anchor events.  The second change is designed to make the system more resilient to block reorgs on Ethereum. Ceramic anchor commits will no longer include the specific blockNumber and blockTimestamp that the anchor event was included in, as it’s possible the transaction could later be reorged into a new block. Instead, Ceramic will only use the transaction hash and will look up which blockNumber the transaction was included in from Ethereum directly.  <p>Both of these updates require changes to the js-ceramic node implementation, so that the node can still know how to verify and apply anchor commits with the new behavior. Nodes that haven’t upgraded will experience failures when applying anchor commits. Data update commits that are not anchored within the CACAO timeout period will then fail to apply since the node will not be able to verify that the update was created during the time when the CACAO (the capability that gave the app permission to write into the stream on behalf of the user) was valid. Over time this can corrupt the state of streams and invalidate writes that seemed to be applied successfully at first, but then are later invalidated when CACAO times out.</p><p>Please get in touch with us on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">forum</a> for assistance or if you have any other questions! </p>

<p>Second public review ends February 2nd</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that Electronic Court Filing Version 5.01 and Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile Version 5.01 from the LegalXML Electronic Court Filing TC [1] are now available for public review and comment. This is the second public review for Version 5.01 of these two specifications.</p>



<p>ECF defines a technical architecture and a set of components, operations and message structures for an electronic court filing system, and sets forth rules governing its implementation.</p>



<p>Electronic Court Filing Version 5.01 (ECF v5.01) consists of a set of non-proprietary XML and Web Services specifications developed to promote interoperability among electronic court filing vendors and systems. ECF v5.01 is a minor release that adds new functionality and capabilities beyond the scope of the ECF 5,0, 4.0 and 4.01 specifications that it supersedes.</p>



<p>Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile defines a Service Interaction Profile (SIP), as defined in section 7 of the ECF v5.01 specification. The Web Services SIP may be used to transmit ECF 5.01 messages between Internet-connected systems.</p>

<p>Project Specification 02 is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that OSLC Tracked Resource Set Version 3.0 from the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project [1] has been approved as an OASIS Project Specification.</p>



<p>Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle is very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across a product’s entire application and product lifecycle.</p>



<p>The Tracked Resource Set protocol allows a server to expose a set of resources in a way that allows clients to discover that set of resources, to track additions to and removals from the set, and to track state changes to the resources in the set. The protocol does not assume that clients will dereference the resources, but they could do so. The protocol is suitable for dealing with sets containing a large number of resources, as well as highly active resource sets that undergo continual change. The protocol is HTTP-based and follows RESTful principles.</p>



<p>This Project Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the OP’s Project Governing Board and fully ready for testing and implementation. The applicable open source licenses can be found in the project’s administrative repository at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md">https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md</a>.</p>

<p>According to a PayPal notice of security incident dated January 18, attackers got unauthorized access to the accounts of thousands of users between December 6 and 8, 2022. The total number of accounts that were accessed by threat actors using a credential stuffing attack is reported as being 34,942. While accepting that PayPal is seemingly doing the best it can for the customers involved in this security incident by recommending password changes, Jasson Casey, chief technology officer at Beyond Identity insists that “passwords – whether unique or complex – are fundamentally flawed.” Instead, Casey says, organizations should be moving to phishing-resistant credentials such as the FIDO Alliance standard blueprints.</p>

<p>Image Matrix Tech Editor Djuro Sen says “passkeys”, developed by FIDO, means you “never need to know a password”. “It essentially removes the fact of using a password and you just use your device, your phone or something else, mostly your phone, to log in to say, through this example, eBay,” Mr Sen told Sky News Australia. “This uses a type of cryptography that has a public key and a private key.”</p>

<p>On major trend from 2022 is the continued evolution of the fraud industry. A combination of active and passive authentication can ensure that the payments flow is secure while limiting the impact on the customer experience. Major global payment schemes are introducing new regulations that will see banks recognize the authentication work done on the merchant side. This means that merchants are able to leverage industry authentication standards like FIDO Alliance to create their own checkout journey to reduce the friction between the customer and merchant services. This helps combat both fraud and cart abandonment, helping to deliver higher sales conversion rates and a better return on investment.</p>

<p>As an organisation we are committed to <a href="https://responsibledata.io/what-is-responsible-data/" title="">responsible data</a>, which includes practices such as data minimisation, seeking consent, establishing a RAD plan (or a plan for <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Retention, Archival and Deletion</a> of the data we use in our work) and more.</p>



<p>Last week, in the spirit of starting the work year with some RAD energy, our team got together to have a “digital declutter fest”. Equipped with a cleaning-themed playlist (including tunes like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JfEJq56IwI" title="">Outkast’s “So Fresh, So Clean”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDLNmailOwI" title="">Hilary Duff’s “Come Clean</a>”), we went through folders from past projects and listed which subfolders and files needed to be “cleaned” or re-organised.</p>



<p>During the declutter session we didn’t actually archive or delete files from our shared Drive.We used the template below to identify what needed to be deleted or archives and what needed a closer review (by project managers or other team members who worked on the project).</p>



<p>We especially kept an eye out for files that could possibly include personal data and/or sensitive data, and also files that have not been used in a long time and that we wouldn’t need in the future (such as email drafts or notes from calls with partners from projects that are no longer active). In short, every time we saw something that required further action, we made a note of it on the template.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the session, we reflected on the process, noting how this was a practical way of acting on our Responsible Data values. We talked about the importance of&nbsp; taking care of the data and information we might hold on our partners and research participants (like email addresses and interview notes), the usefulness of reviewing our RAD plan frequently (especially when working on long projects in which many years worth of information can accumulate) and the ways we can make a habit out of digital decluttering our organisational and individual files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the call, we divided up the work of actually reviewing the identified files, with plans to responsibly archive the things we want to keep and delete what we no longer need.&nbsp;</p>



 Declutter your own digital space 



<p>If you’re interested in having a similar digital decluttering session with your team, feel free to use and adapt the template we used (reproduced below!).</p>

<p>I would also recommend taking a look at our resource “<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD – How to Retain, Archive and Dispose of data responsibly</a>”. It’s a short collection of tipsheets designed to support civil society organisations taking the first steps towards becoming RAD and developing responsible and streamlined processes for retaining, archiving and deleting data, currently available in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/RAD-Tip-Sheets.pdf" title="">English</a>, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Becoming-RAD-en-espanol-october-22.pdf" title="">Spanish</a> and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Apprentissage-RAD.pdf" title="">French</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 Trace Labs, the core development company of OriginTrail, joins Sustainable Medicines Partnership to help make medicines more accessible and sustainable <p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a>, the core development company of OriginTrail, is excited to announce that we have joined the <a href="https://www.yewmaker.com/smp">Sustainable Medicines Partnership (SMP)</a>, a not-for-profit, multi-stakeholder, action collaborative of 48 organizations. The SMP is committed to reducing waste of medicines and medicines packaging, making medicines more accessible and more sustainable.</p><p>The purpose of the partnership is to bring together leading organizations from across the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry to collaborate and share knowledge, in order to find sustainable solutions to the challenges facing the industry. Trace Labs will play an important role in this partnership by supporting the creation of industry relevant knowledge assets on the <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;(DKG)</a>.</p><p>These verifiable knowledge assets will be used to advance the mission of the SMP by providing data that can be used to identify and track the movement of medicines and packaging materials throughout the supply chain. This will enable the SMP to identify areas where waste is occurring and develop solutions to reduce it. Additionally, knowledge assets will be used to improve the accessibility and sustainability of medicines by providing insights into the distribution and delivery of medicines to patients.</p>The Sustainable Medicines Partnership (SMP) is a not-for-profit, multi-stakeholder, action collaborative of 48 organisations. The SMP is executing a four year programme to build science-based, scalable, sustainable solutions to reduce the waste of medicines and the waste from medicines.<p>Nazneen Rahman, Founder and CEO at <a href="https://www.yewmaker.com/">YewMaker</a>, executive lead of the Sustainable Medicines Partnership, said: “I’m delighted Trace Labs has joined the SMP. Their technological expertise in delivering accessible, transparent, verifiable data in complex supply chains is highly relevant for the SMP’s goals. We are hugely excited about the potential of the collaboration to improve the sustainability and accessibility of medicines.”</p><p>Jurij Skornik, <a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a>’ General Manager, highlighted: “We are thrilled to be joining forces with other member organizations such as Pfizer, British Standards Institution (BSI), GS1, Walgreens, and AstraZeneca, to create a more sustainable and accessible healthcare system for everyone. As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, we believe that partnerships like the SMP are crucial for driving progress and finding innovative solutions. As part of this collaborative effort, we look forward to working with our partners to achieve our shared goal of reducing waste, improving access, and making medicines more sustainable.”</p><p>Trace Labs has already deployed OriginTrail-based solutions in the pharmaceutical industry that make use of verifiable knowledge assets. <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/healthcare/donated-medicines-and-vaccines/">AidTrust</a>, a product developed jointly with our partner BSI, increases transparency and trust in the distribution of medicines by bringing together BSI’s global presence and supply chain risk management expertise with the power of OriginTrail DKG. It enables visibility (product flows and utilization, inventory levels, etc.), risk alerts, and real-time decision-making at all stages of the supply chain while protecting the integrity, security, and privacy of data. Ultimately, the goal of AidTrust is to help donor organizations and NGOs demonstrate that donated medicines were handled properly and reached the intended patients, even in challenging environments.</p><p>By joining the Sustainable Medicines Partnership, Trace Labs will bring the power of OriginTrail knowledge assets to the mission of reducing waste of medicines and packaging and making medicines more accessible and sustainable. We are excited to work together on innovative and impactful solutions in the next months and&nbsp;years.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing humanity’s most important knowledge assets.

<p>by Santiago Lyon, Head of Advocacy and Education, CAI&nbsp;</p><p>We are delighted to welcome Canon, one of the world’s leading camera manufacturers, as a member of the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) joining more than 890 media and tech companies, NGOs, and academics working together to fight misinformation by furthering the implementation of open-source digital provenance technology. &nbsp;</p><p>Founded in 1937, Canon is a leading global manufacturer of both professional and consumer cameras and lenses and brings a long history of innovative and ground-breaking photojournalism projects to the CAI. Canon’s equipment is widely used by photojournalists and others to capture impactful, compelling and beautiful imagery from around the world. Their equipment has been used to capture award-winning images in recent years including Pulitzer Prizes and World Press Photo awards, among many others.&nbsp;</p><p>“Canon enthusiastically supports efforts to fight misinformation by ensuring the authenticity and provenance of digital images that are created and enjoyed by society. Joining the efforts of the CAI is an important step in this endeavor,” said Go Tokura, Chief Executive of Imaging Communication Business Operations at Canon. “We are looking forward to working with other technology companies and media partners to develop technology solutions that achieve these goals."&nbsp;</p><p>Provenance technology provides secure, tamper-evident metadata that accompanies images and other file types along their journey from capture through editing to publication, showing the viewer where an asset came from, and any changes made to it along the way. The CAI looks forward to working with Canon on prototyping and implementing provenance technology into their future products.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Canon also joins the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (<a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a>) as its latest member that will provide creators, consumers, and others with opt-in, flexible ways to understand the authenticity and provenance across media types.&nbsp;</p><p>We encourage diverse organizations and individuals to join the Content Authenticity Initiative to advance our efforts for digital provenance. You can find more information <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/membership">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>January Newsletter</p>



<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>Happy New Year. I hope this finds you well and rested from the holidays. Thank you for reading DINZ’s first newsletter of 2023 on the beach, at the office, or in the tent or caravan out of the rain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud issues tend to surface in the news much more over the holidays as increased online purchases offer greater opportunities for attackers. Matthew Evetts is the director of security at DINZ member Datacom and did a great job of explaining the issues in simple terms in<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/summer-days/audio/2018873139/beware-of-cyber-crime">&nbsp;this piece on RNZ</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with consumers and their data in mind, it is notable that the<a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/25842-further-decisions-on-the-consumer-data-right-proactiverelease-pdf">&nbsp;Government has just released a Cabinet Paper on the proposed Consumer Data Right (CDR</a>) with a framework similar to that of the DISTF.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.russellmcveagh.com/insights/january-en/consumer-data-right-update-proposed-penalties-supervisory-authorities-in-scope-sectors-and-appro">Russell Mc Veigh has summarised its insights in this helpful publication here</a>. While DINZ could debate whether the banking sector is a better starting point for CDR compared to digital identification, we expect to analyse the paper and offer commentary in due course. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For DINZ itself, each new year brings the need to balance its limited resources across a range of activities. In 2022 greater focus was placed on documented evidence based thought leadership with its submissions, the research and the landscape report that will be published in a few weeks time. In 2023, expect to see more focus on events and interactive mahi, now that&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">grounding documented mahi</a>&nbsp;has progressed. Next month we’ll begin with events to showcase the landscape report on digital identity in Aotearoa that integrates the results of the research we highlighted late last year (we are always looking for member premises to host so please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">get in touch</a>). We’ll also be kicking off a two-month Summer Series around perspectives of decentralised digital identity&nbsp;where we expect to feature members (<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">get in touch!</a>) with a decentralised service or pilot leading discussion and debate with their perspectives. Planning is already underway for April with an overseas expert visit intermingling with Privacy Awareness Week. So there’s plenty to look forward to before the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata 2023&nbsp;</a>confirmed for 1 August 2023 at Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington.&nbsp;<a href="mailto:colin.wallis@digitalidentity.nz">Get in touch</a>&nbsp;if you’re interested to sponsor or exhibit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What else is in store for us in the digital identity domain in 2023? Truckloads is the short answer. As I observed in my personal email to members before the break, in legislation alone, we expect to be looking at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/versions.aspx">DISTF</a>&nbsp;in its final run up to enforcement on 1 January next year, MoJ’s proposed amendments to the AML/CFT legislation that&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/11/Digital-Identity-New-Zealand-AML_CFT-Report_20-October-2020_FINAL.pdf">DINZ analysed&nbsp; back in 2020</a>, OPC’s proposed Code of Practice for Biometrics that&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Submission_OPC-Consultation-on-Biometrics_4-October-2022-1.pdf">DINZ responded on last year</a>, the exposure draft of NZ’s CDR legislation and further developments in Open Banking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sheer scale of the compliance undertaking for any digital identity service provider looks quite daunting when you think that most service providers will need to comply with most of the above, and also with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0031/latest/LMS23223.html">Privacy Act 2020</a>&nbsp;and conceivably the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2012/0123/latest/whole.html">EIV Act 2012</a>, even if today it applies primarily to RealMe. Aotearoa is not alone in this regard. The EU is a great example where in the fullness of time the upcoming Data Act will sit beside the Data Governance Act, the GDPR, the Free Flow of Non-Personal Data Regulation, the Open Data Directive, the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act as part of the European strategy for data, not to mention&nbsp;<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">EIDAS 2.0</a>. Will 2023 be remembered as the melting pot year for digital law? We’ll see.</p>



<p>But let’s hope that lawmakers everywhere are setting aside resources in the coming years for legislative harmonisation!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

After one year of research and analysis, the paper is ready for your review. Can SSI harm people in the real world? Our paper says “yes” and why that’s so.

<p>Imagine someone you know has a life-changing tragedy, like…&nbsp;</p>



 
 A voter wrongfully convicted of electoral fraud&nbsp; 



 A gambler’s identity used to fuel addiction 



 An immigrant family unable to work, bank, or get basic services 



 A teen suicide 



 An indigenous people whose relationship with their forest is shattered 



 A soldier’s biometrics targeted them for execution 
 



<p>In this paper we explain how each of these real life examples were the outcome of digital identity abused, misused, or gone wrong. In each case, SSI can make things better, or worse. So, can you do anything about these risks that affect others? And why should you bother?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you do anything? Anything that matters?</p>



<p>We listed some responses to the risk of human harms:</p>



 
 Design for a balance of power. Well-executed decentralized or federated identity systems have a shot at assuring agency by empowering those at the edge of the ecosystem, and recognising the vulnerabilities of the least powerful people.&nbsp; 



 Add human harms to existing risk management. Cybersecurity teams, corporate finance, strategy, and legal teams can add negative externality risk assessments for identity ecosystems they support. Investing in detection, prevention, intervention, and recovery services enables identity ecosystem members to manage their exposure according to their respective risk appetites.&nbsp; 



 Align objectives and incentives to minimize regret. Human harms arise when ecosystem actors’ objectives conflict and when mistuned incentives drive harmful choices. 



 Measure the cost of externalities. SSI’s trustworthy provenance might improve accountability and discourage harmful behavior within an ecosystem. But harms are infectious. The collective resilience of an ecosystem, like herd immunity, reduces harm. 



 Build a community of practice on human harm reduction. New disciplines and practices will emerge, as they have for other areas of risk reduction. Start inside and join forces with your business ecosystem.&nbsp; 
 



<p>You can imagine many more. Still, …&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why should you act?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doing nothing is nearly always the easiest path. It can feel like a distraction from today’s work to be aware of negative externalities that show up downstream from your standards efforts, your product development, your engineering and operations. They are distant from you in time, in space, across regulatory jurisdictions, with many intermediaries between you and people who might be harmed. It’s hard to care about hypotheticals and abstract numbers. Should you care anyway?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us offer you five reasons you should act.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Economics. Prevention is cheaper.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Nearly always.“Shift-left” is the practice of moving security concerns closer to the start of the product development lifecycle. Again, it’s easier and more complete to build security into services from the start than try to bolt security onto an inherently insecure system. Perhaps we can shift-left when it comes to harming others, embed harms work into the identity product and governance checklists so those considerations help us steer clear of foreseeable harms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But who pays for prevention and other harm reduction and remediation work? Who should invest in testing if your trust architectures come with few negative externalities built in? Should it be those closer to the utility side of things? Should governments pick up the slack? Will ecosystem operators that serve more vulnerable humans have a better shot at understanding their risks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We should have an “accountability” conversation sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Financial and Legal Risk. Action reduces liability.&nbsp; 
 



<p>But can you avoid liability if laws and regulations are obsolete or enforcement is toothless or regulators are captured? How can we pool exposure so it’s safer to start digital identity ecosystems or to join them?&nbsp;</p>



 
 Opportunity for value and advantage.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Harm reduction practices improve your understanding of strategic context and unmet customer needs. Harm surveillance practices improve identity ecosystem situational awareness and security. Harm intervention and recovery practices improve customer service and speed crisis response.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Harms are infectious and no-one is immune. 
 



<p>Harms impact beyond the close families and friends of those directly harmed to other actors in the ecosystem and in adjacent ecosystems. The 2022 FTX cryptocurrency exchange bankruptcy amplified and spread the human harms of lost investments throughout DeFi and crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sleep better. It’s good karma.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Being real about the potential for harm makes it easier to put it in perspective, to weigh your tradeoffs, and to act in good conscience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Start small, start together…&nbsp;</p>

 Strategy will see major investments in quantum research, talent and commercialization 



<p>January 13, 2023&nbsp;– Waterloo, Ontario, Quantum science and technologies are at the leading edge of research and innovation, with enormous potential for commercialization and game-changing advances, including more effective drug design, better climate forecasting, improved navigation and innovations in clean technologies. The Government of Canada is committed to supporting the continued growth of this emerging sector as it helps drive Canada’s economy and supports highly skilled, well-paying jobs.</p>



<p>Today, the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, announced the launch of Canada’s National Quantum Strategy, which will shape the future of quantum technologies in Canada and help create thousands of jobs. Backed by an investment of $360 million committed in Budget 2021, the strategy will amplify Canada’s existing global leadership in quantum research and grow Canada’s quantum technologies, companies and talent.</p>



<p>Minister Champagne was joined at the launch by Dr. Raymond Laflamme, professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and Canada Research Chair in Quantum Information at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, and Dr. Stephanie Simmons, associate professor in the Department of Physics and Canada Research Chair in Silicon Quantum Technologies at Simon Fraser University and founder and Chief Quantum Officer of Photonic Inc. Drs. Laflamme and Simmons will serve as co-chairs of a new Quantum Advisory Council, which will provide independent expert advice on the implementation of the strategy.</p>



<p>The National Quantum Strategy is driven by three missions in key quantum technology areas:</p>



 
 Computing hardware and software—to make Canada a world leader in the continued development, deployment and use of these technologies 



 Communications—to equip Canada with a national secure quantum communications network and post-quantum cryptography capabilities 



 Sensors—to support Canadian developers and early adopters of new quantum sensing technologies 
 



<p>The missions will be advanced through investments in three pillars:</p>



 
 Research—$141 million to support basic and applied research to realize new solutions and new innovations 



 Talent—$45 million to develop and retain quantum expertise and talent in Canada, as well as attract experts from within Canada and around the world, to build the quantum sector 



 Commercialization—$169 million to translate research into scalable commercial products and services that will benefit Canadians, our industries and the world 
 



<p>Efforts under the strategy are already under way. To reinforce Canada’s research strengths in quantum science and help develop a talent pipeline to support the growth of a strong quantum community, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) is delivering an investment of $137.9 million through its Alliance grants and Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE) grants.</p>



<p>Mitacs will deliver $40 million to support the attraction, training, retention and deployment of highly qualified personnel in quantum science and technology through innovation internship experiences and professional skills development.</p>



<p>The Quantum Research and Development Initiative (QRDI), a new $9 million program coordinated and administered by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), is being established to grow collaborative, federal quantum research and development. QRDI will bring government—offering expertise and infrastructure—and academic and industrial partners together to work on advancing quantum technologies under the three missions of the National Quantum Strategy.</p>



<p>To help translate quantum science and research into commercial innovations that generate economic benefits and support the adoption of made-in-Canada solutions by businesses, the NRC is receiving $50&nbsp;million to expand the Internet of Things: Quantum Sensors Challenge program and roll out its Applied Quantum Computing Challenge program. As well, Canada’s Global Innovation Clusters are receiving $14&nbsp;million to carry out activities as part of the Commercialization pillar.</p>



<p>In addition, the government’s flagship strategic procurement program, Innovative Solutions Canada, is receiving $35 million over seven years to help innovative Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises grow, scale up, develop intellectual property, export and create high-value jobs in the quantum sector.</p>



<p>The quantum sector is key to fuelling Canada’s economy, long-term resilience and growth, especially as technologies mature and more sectors harness quantum capabilities. Jobs will span research and science; hardware and software engineering and development, including data engineering; manufacturing; technical support; sales and marketing; and business operations. The government will continue working with Canada’s quantum community to ensure the success of not only the National Quantum Strategy but also the Canadian scientists and entrepreneurs who are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>

The National Quantum Strategy will support a resilient economy by strengthening our research, businesses and talent, giving Canada a competitive advantage for decades to come. I look forward to collaborating with businesses, researchers and academia as we build our quantum future.”<br>– The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</p>
</blockquote>



 Quick facts 



 
 According to a study commissioned by the NRC in 2020, it is estimated that, by 2045, the Canadian quantum industry, once quantum technologies take hold, will be a $139 billion industry (including all economic effects) and account for 209,200 jobs. 



 The Government of Canada has invested more than $1 billion in quantum since 2012. These foundational investments helped establish Canada as a global leader in quantum science. 



 The National Quantum Strategy was developed following thorough public consultations through stakeholder roundtables and an online survey. 



 A number of investments have already been announced through&nbsp;<a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/national-quantum-strategy/en/canadas-national-quantum-strategy#s10">existing government programs</a>, and additional partners are preparing their quantum programs for launch. 



 Innovative Solutions Canada has awarded four contracts valued at a total of $2.1 million to test quantum sensing, communications and computing solutions developed by Xanadu Quantum Technologies Inc., CogniFrame Inc., Photon etc. Inc. and Zero Point Cryogenics Inc. 



 To date, NSERC has awarded 17 grants valued at $1.5 million over three years and expects to announce further results of its quantum initiatives in the coming months, including the Alliance International Quantum grants, Alliance Quantum grants, Alliance Consortia Quantum grants and CREATE grants. 



 The NRC has launched Challenge programs to support collaborations with academia and industry &nbsp;that help drive commercial innovation and build on Canada’s position as a global leader in quantum technologies.
 
 The Internet of Things: Quantum Sensors Challenge program is focused on developing revolutionary sensors that use the extreme sensitivity of quantum systems to enhance measurement precision and sensitivity rates and even expand the kinds of phenomena that can be measured. 



 The Applied Quantum Computing Challenge program is working to build capacity in quantum algorithms and software, as well as establish collaborative research and development projects with academia and industry to efficiently simulate complex physical systems, delivering new technologies for human health, climate change and advanced materials. 
 
 



 The governments of Canada and the United Kingdom have jointly launched a call for proposals open to organizations from Canada and the UK that wish to form project consortia for collaborative projects focused on developing innovative products, processes or technology-based services in the area of quantum technologies. The call is delivered by the NRC’s Industrial Research Assistance Program and Innovate UK.

<p>Yes: Andrew Shikiar. You might think you’ve heard it all before, right? A passwordless age is the cyber utopia we all yearn for but promises of totally wiping out passwords feels far-fetched and far off. After all, how do you go about unpicking a thread so tightly woven into your daily life? Eradicating passwords will take time, but recent industry news and progress is showing we can confidently say the future is passwordless – and getting nearer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>FIDO was founded in 2012 by PayPal, Lenovo, and Nok Labs. They are working to change authentication through open standards that are more secure than passwords, more straightforward for consumers, and more accessible for service providers to deploy and manage. FIDO’s latest innovation, passkey, provides fast, easy, secure sign-ins to websites and apps across multiple devices. Passkey users can sign in with a biometric, PIN or security key rather than a username and password, FIDO representatives noted, and without having to re-enroll devices or accounts each time, they sign in.</p>

<p>After years of work, the tech industry finally took major steps in 2022 toward a long-promised passwordless future. The move is riding on the back of a technology called “passkeys” that are built on FIDO standards. Operating systems from Apple, Google, and Microsoft now support the technology, and many other platforms, browsers, and services have adopted it or are in the process of doing so. As much as you might wish it, though, passwords aren’t going to disappear anytime soon, thanks to their sheer ubiquity. And amid all the buzz about passkeys, hardware tokens are still an important protection option.</p>

 European Union supports sustainability of construction industry with the BUILDCHAIN project: Bringing trustworthy knowledge exchange using the Decentralized Knowledge Graph <p>Trace Labs, a Web3 development company, joins EU’s efforts to create a smarter and more sustainable built environment with the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101092052">BUILDCHAIN project</a>. Together with eleven other partners from Slovenia, Italy, Spain, Greece, Hungary, and Serbia, Trace Labs will use the <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)</a> to build a trusted knowledge base aiming to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and increase transparency and trust, ultimately leading to more sustainable construction projects.</p> Construction industry lacks trustworthy data&nbsp;exchange <p>Efficient, transparent, and trusted data exchange is a powerful tool for driving sustainability, resilience, and energy efficiency in construction, however there are several obstacles for trusted data exchange in this industry&nbsp;today:</p>  Data silos: Construction projects involve multiple parties and stakeholders, each of which may have their own systems for storing and sharing information. This can lead to data silos and lack of coordination, which can make it difficult to access and trust the&nbsp;data.  Lack of standardization: Different construction projects may use different formats for storing and sharing data, which can make it difficult to compare and combine information from different projects.  Data security: Construction projects often involve sensitive information, such as building plans, materials lists, and inspection results. Ensuring that this information is kept secure and protected from unauthorized access can be a significant challenge.  Lack of incentives: There are often few incentives for construction companies and other stakeholders to share data and collaborate on projects, which can make it difficult to establish trust and transparency.   BUILDCHAIN to create a complete overview of the building life-cycle <p>Having received financial support from the European Union, BUILDCHAIN aims to develop technological solutions that will enhance data exchange and transparency in the industry and overcome the above-mentioned obstacles. Over the three-year period, the key innovative players in construction engineering, architecture, and research will build a knowledge base that will be used by various actors to trace all activities related to the complete life-cycle of buildings.</p><p>Trace Labs’ main contribution will be the integration of OriginTrail <a href="https://origintrail.io/technology">Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)</a> with the existing EU Digital Building LogBook system, creating a new powerful knowledge base with blockchain and artificial intelligence capabilities. The DKG will provide a tamper-proof and decentralized database that can be accessed by all parties involved in a building’s life cycle, including architects, contractors, building owners and regulators. This helps increase transparency, trust, and collaboration among all stakeholders through:</p>  Connected knowledge assets as digital twins: DKG will provide an open, single source of truth for all building-related data, including plans, materials, inspection results, and more. This will make it easy for all parties to discover, access, and update the information in real time, improving communication and collaboration.  Data verification: Using blockchain technology, all data added to the DKG is fingerprinted and cannot be tampered with, ensuring authenticity of the data of the building’s life&nbsp;cycle.  Predictive maintenance: AI and machine learning can be used to analyze data from the DKG to identify patterns and predict future outcomes, such as maintenance needs. This can help improve building maintenance and reduce downtime.  Compliance and regulations: DKG can be used to ensure compliance with building codes and regulations by storing all relevant information in a standardized way and making it accessible to regulators in real&nbsp;time.   Driving value and technological advancement for construction industry <p>The advancements and benefits of building information modeling, automation, and digitalization encourage the development of more effective and efficient building information management. Given the fact that the <a href="https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/building-information-modeling-market.html">global Building Information Modeling market is worth $14,7 billion and is predicted to grow to $53 billion by 2031</a>, the BUILDCHAIN project enables the possibility of great value creation and a strong impact on sustainability of the entire&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Project information available here: <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101092052">BUILDCHAIN Project | Fact&nbsp;Sheet</a></p>This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe Framework Programme, Climate Neutral, Circular and Digitiesed Production 2022, under grant agreement No 101092052.<p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing humanity’s most important knowledge assets.

 Is 2023 the year of Communities of Practice at&nbsp;work? <p>Communities of Practice (CoPs) are groups of people who share a concern or passion for things that they do. For example, they may be teachers, or parents, or paediatricians interested in helping young people. As they interact with one another on a regular basis, they learn to better do the things in which they are interested, which leads to improved outcomes for&nbsp;all.</p><p>CoPs can be seen as somewhat ‘messy’ from the outside, but they nevertheless integrate rituals and recognition as part of their practice. This post argues that now is the time to shift to a more holistic understanding of recognition in the workplace, one that is established by intentionally building CoPs across a landscape of practice in each&nbsp;sector.</p><a href="https://app.participate.com/assignments/cop-curious/140ca80f-4030-4558-af7a-9757ecca3ed5#chapter-1">a badge from our Community of Practice course on Participate.com</a> Credentials aren’t everything <p>Workplace recognition happens in various ways. For example, recognition in some guise is often a prerequisite for employment. This often takes the form of a list of credentials and experience that a worker is expected to be able to prove. This is for good reason, as employers have to ensure that a worker can perform the functions required of&nbsp;them.</p><p>However, we live in a world where not everyone has the same access to the types of credentials or experience that workplaces may require (or think they require!). For example, too many white collar employment opportunities require, at a minimum, ‘a degree’ of any kind, using this as a proxy for a bundle of knowledge, skills, and behaviours.</p><p>In addition, some of the reasons for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation">the Great Resignation</a> include lack of career advancement, work-related stress, and the desire for a better work-life balance. Workplaces that recognise employees and contractors in meaningful ways are likely to better retain staff and have a happier, more productive workforce.</p><p>Greater workplace recognition practices can also increase resilience: interpersonal relationships at work allow for greater and more fluid knowledge transfer, which leads to greater innovation and the ability to route around problems which may&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>What would recognition in the workplace look like if we started to think of our working world as made up of Communities of Practice?</p> Recognising diversity <p>Let’s start at the beginning of the worker journey. The talent pool for a particular job is often limited by the lack of inclusive recognition. Potential workers don’t always have the opportunity to improve their standing due to socio-economic factors, geographic exclusion, and discriminatory practices. Our existing credentialing systems can unwittingly exacerbate this.</p><p>While employers are good at <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/last-mile-credentials-employment-1103">recognising formal credentials</a>, they often don’t attempt to understand the wider picture of recognition.</p><p>We’re seeing innovative systems, like <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a> and badge pathways, begin to push at the inequity of the current system of employment. These approaches make skills more visible. Instead of hiring someone who simply has ‘a degree’, companies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/why-ibm-wants-to-hire-employees-who-dont-have-a-4-year-college-degree.html">such as IBM</a> are beginning to be more specific about the kinds of knowledge, skills, and behaviours they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>These attempts, while valuable, are in the realm of ‘microcredentialing’ — breaking down ‘chunky’ credentials into smaller, more granular parts. Open Recognition goes beyond credentialing to consider relational factors and the wider, more holistic story. After all, people need us to help tell their story, and we need them to help us tell ours. Every credential involves recognition, but recognition does not have to be in the form of a ‘credential’.</p> Connecting networks <p>No-one works in isolation. We all have current and former colleagues who have seen us in action and who can attest to our abilities. A ‘closed’ (i.e. non-portable) example of this kind of recognition is the LinkedIn recommendation, which can lead to surprising insights for the recipient into the knowledge, skills, and behaviours that are valued by those with whom they&nbsp;work.</p><p>Not only can a recommendation or testimonial serve as a form of ‘credential’ but in addition to this, it also establishes a relationship between the recommender and the person being recommended. This is powerful when instantiated in a badge, which provides the additional benefits of being tamper-proof and portable between online&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Demonstrating the connections between our story and someone else’s helps show underlying networks and relationships. It can make visible the Communities of Practice that may be invisible to corporate hierarchies. Social graphs allow us to see, over time, how communities develop and how expertise is established.</p><p>Conceptualising workplaces as sites for Communities of Practice to flourish leads to meaningful recognition between colleagues. Instead of performative Slack messages which may serve as extrinsic motivators for a limited period of time, true Open Workplace Recognition can help peers encourage one another towards ever-more learning and growing. HR departments can help colleagues co-create interest-based career pathways that make sense across&nbsp;sectors.</p> Open Recognition needs to be pervasive <p>In order to put the power of a story clearly in the hands of the person who owns that story, we have to allow that person to tell it. We need ways to ensure that recognition belongs to individuals and can be used regardless of the type of workplace in which they currently find themselves. Just because you have a good, bad, or indifferent boss should not determine the wider recognition you receive when performing well.</p><p>Giving people the ability to describe their career path and employment history in a non-linear, non-time bound way will help employers too. Allowing a person to say what they look for in a workplace, what they believe they are good at, and how they are looking to grow helps reduce turnover and to get people in the correct roles more&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>Individuals can help potential employers or collaborators understand how&nbsp;they:</p>  keep showing up and learn new&nbsp;things  exhibit pro-social behaviours  support their community  <p>These things will help hiring managers get to know someone more holistically than a single, potentially irrelevant credential ever could. Turning workplaces into communities of practice changes the way an organisation functions. It requires recognition systems where everyone can be “seen” and can “see” others — and makes all learning and knowledge creation&nbsp;visible.</p> Conclusion <p>Communities of Practice provide ways for forward-thinking organisations to engage staff in a virtuous circle of improvement, to ensure positive recognition practices, and to bundle up experiences in credentials that can be used to help both the individual and organisation.</p><p>To establish a CoP within organisations involves both a top-down and bottom-up approach. From the top, it requires time, funding, and recognition, and from below it requires will, engagement, and encouragement.</p><p>We firmly believe that both CoPs and Landscapes of Practice have become one of the most important tools for organisations looking to make a sustained impact in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>2023 is going to be a big year for communities, and we’re here for it. To discuss this further with us, get in&nbsp;touch!</p><p>This post was co-authored by Julie Keane and Doug Belshaw.

<p>Municipalities and K-12 school districts have more pressure to meet cybersecurity requirements than ever. Cyber threats to the public sector continue to accelerate, and finding affordable, comprehensive cybersecurity insurance is becoming more and more difficult. As public sector organizations turn to local and statewide Joint Insurance Funds (JIFs), it is vital to understand the funds’ requirements, to ensure that your organization has an effective cybersecurity posture and the ability to be covered in the event of a breach.</p>
<p>In this session, Edge’s lead Virtual Chief Information Security Officer, Dr. Dawn Dunkerley, will outline:</p>
 
 Steps every municipality and K-12 district can take to be more attractive to cyber insurance providers in general 
 Common cybersecurity requirements of JIFs, with a particular focus on the emerging requirements of NJ MEL 
 How your organization can uncover and prioritize its most pressing cybersecurity needs 
 How a nonprofit vCISO provider like Edge can align with your mission, and work with your team to maximize the impact and affordability of your cybersecurity efforts

<p>Schellman Joins the Voilà Verified Trustmark Program<br>Voilà Verified Program Builds Real Trust in Digital Solutions by Spotlighting World-Class Vetted Digital Identity Solutions.</p>



<p>TAMPA, FL, January 11, 2023 – The <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> (DIACC) is pleased to officially welcome <a href="https://www.schellman.com/">Schellman</a> to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/voila-verified/">Voilà Verified Trustmark Program</a> – the first and only certification program to determine digital identity service compliance with the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-overview/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>™ (PCTF).</p>



<p>A non-profit coalition of over 115 public and private members, the DIACC develops research and opportunities to enable Canada’s confident, safe, and full participation in a global digital economy.</p>



<p>“One size does not fit all when it comes to identity solutions – but ensuring a solution delivers upon a defined duty of care is critical,” says Joni Brennan, president of the DIACC. “With the PCTF, and now with Voilà Verified, there is an opportunity to adopt a framework rooted in trust – and to earn compliance recognition. Voilà Verified identifies those who are ‘walking the walk’ and delivering safe and secure access to the global digital economy.”</p>



<p>“Schellman’s participation in DIACC’s Voilà Verified Program demonstrates our excitement and commitment to the Crypto and Digital Trust space. This new step will widen our global footprint as we expand all our assessment services in Canada,” says Avani Desai, Chief Executive Officer of Schellman.</p>



<p>The DIACC’s PCTF is a publicly available framework for identity solutions that defines client, customer, and individual duty of care. The Voilà Verified program provides a vetting and assessment opportunity where PCTF-compliant solution vendors can earn a public-facing trustmark. The result? Spotlight visibility of trustworthy, safe, reliable, and efficient solutions.</p>



<p>“Schellman is excited to participate in this landmark accreditation program. We look forward to serving the DIACC community with distinction as we enable Canada’s world-leading efforts towards true digital trust,” said Scott Perry, Principal at Schellman and leader of the firm’s Crypto and Digital Trust Services.</p>



<p>Voilà Verified presents an opportunity to grow provincial-level investments in digital identity solutions. Provincial governments which have launched identity services can now earn a trustmark of their own, and provinces that are on the cusp of entering the digital solution market can do so with confidence by seeking vendors with a Voilà Verified trustmark.</p>



<p>Ruth Puente, Voilà Verified’s Trustmark Verification Program Manager, says a leading component of the program’s development was to ensure its procedures aligned with the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Organization of Standardization</a> (ISO).</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is inclusive yet diligent in verifying PCTF-compliant solutions. The program was developed in alignment with ISO <a href="https://www.iso.org/benefits-of-standards.html">standards</a> – and empowers informed decision-making in a rapidly growing ecosystem of identity solutions,” said Puente. “Delivering high-quality service, customer protection, and Increasing access to trustworthy solutions are our priorities. We have formed teams of international experts to perform assessments and to oversee the process through an impartial lens.”</p>



<p>Entities responsible for assessing PCTF compliance within the Voilà Verified program are Accredited Assessors, Readiness Advisors, and Testing Laboratories.</p>



<p>The Voilà Verified Trustmark Oversight Board (TOB) will make all final verification decisions based on reports from accredited entities. Made up of third-party volunteers with international expertise in identity management, auditing, compliance, cybersecurity, information security, and law, the TOB is the highest operating body of Voilà Verified. It is subject to impartiality, confidentiality and conflict of interest policies.</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is a unique opportunity in which I am honoured to share my experience as an advisor and auditor within information security, compliance, and identity,” says Björn Sjöholm, Cybersecurity Entrepreneur of Seadot, and TOB Chair.</p>



<p>Vendors are turning to the Voilà Verified program for several reasons, but the leading value proposition is market differentiation. Trustmark holders stand out from competitors by unlocking global business opportunities through international recognition and credibility.</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified puts internationally reputable identity solutions on the map,” says Dave Nikolejsin, the DIACC’s Board Chair. “This is the way forward. With lateral growth of PCTF compliance across sectors – public and private – we establish a common value of trust. Voilà Verified is a monumental stride for Canada to influence a safe and secure global digital economy.”</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In early December, we held a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/join-our-community-call-thinking-about-tech-through-the-lens-of-digital-resilience/" title="">community call</a> to discuss the digital resilience challenges we (and our partners) are working through. We were joined by organisers and activists from different countries and talked about what digital resilience meant for our movements in 2022. Here are some takeaways from our conversations:</p>



 Adapting workflows for uncertain times 



<p>During the call, participants shared that when the Covid-19 pandemic started, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/" title="">many organisations were forced to rapidly recalibrate their work and services</a> in online spaces. A few years into the pandemic, attendees shared that adapting to new tech-related needs and infrastructure has been an on-going effort that they’ve taken on. Organisations and activists have been continuously working to adapt their workflows and methodologies to handle the tech and data concerns that emerged since the pandemic, such as digital security threats, restrictions on the ability to organise and increased surveillance.</p>



 Digital resilience needs to include environmental and climate activists&nbsp; 



<p>We also talked about how conversations about digital resilience must include activists and grassroots organisations working on environmental and climate justice (and we’ve also seen this mentioned in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-can-the-digital-rights-community-do-to-support-climate-justice-work-learnings-from-our-community-call/" title="">other conversations too</a>). One participant shared that, in their country, support for civil society’s digital security is often more readily available in metropolitan areas. This means that some local groups who work on environmental justice outside of the cities and who increasingly rely on digital technologies to communicate and collect data for advocacy purposes are exposed to threats such as surveillance from state parties and other actors.</p>



<p>Our recent <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">research on the intersections of environmental and climate justice</a> confirms this: we saw that while the persecution of those resisting land acquisition and forest encroachment by extractive industries has been going on for a long time, digital tools’ ability to follow, surveil and collect information without individuals’ knowledge has expanded governments’ and companies’ abilities to intimidate, harass and in some cases even to physically harm, dissenters.</p>



 A lot of the times, digital resilience is a balancing-act 



<p>Participants who advocate for digital security practices in their own organisations shared that when they start the process of implementing new tools they sometimes are met with: fatigue with learning new tools and reticence when it comes to using tools that are unfamiliar and sometimes, not-so-widely-known in their communities.</p>



 During the call, those attending shared their strategies for facilitating the process of becoming digitally resilient:&nbsp; 



 
 Combining the use of secure tools that are recommended by organisational security practitioners with learning how to use the more familiar tools more safely: One person shared that, in 2023, they are focusing on developing best practices for working with tools that staff are familiar with.Another shared that it’s important to map what types of information shouldn’t be shared on certain platforms and adopt data minimisation as best practices. 
 



 
 Pacing out how the adoption of new tools and starting small: Another participant shared that working with asmall group and onboarding slowly are good ways of keeping people engaged in the process and to prevent staff from being overwhelmed. It’s also important to have conversations about how organisational security does come with tradeoffs: for example, sometimes choosing a more secure tool means that we might not have all the same affordances of privately owned tools. Here at The Engine Room, we’ve been documenting <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/" title="">our journey on adopting new video-conferencing tools</a> and it hasn’t been without a couple of obstacles here and there.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Look for support from peers and partners: As we adapt to new digital infrastructure, it can be so helpful to have contact with someone who knows the tools and who can provide support. Participants found that this can help build staff’s confidence and help with questions that will inevitably arise. You can also <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">reach out to us</a> for support in this process. 
 



 The work ahead: what’s next on our digital resilience journey 



<p>In the past year, we’ve been internally reflecting on digital resilience as an organisation and with our partners. In 2023, we plan on sharing more resources on how civil society can build digital resilience, including on topics such as digital security, adopting different tech tools, organising safely and adapting to context shifts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, we’re curious to know what digital resilience has looked like for you and your organisations! <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/contact/" title="">Reach out</a> to tell us or to share questions, research or projects you’d like us to know about.</p>

<p>Passwords: they can be tricky at the best of times. Proper password hygiene is one of the most important factors in endpoint security, as it keeps sensitive data secure and prevents threat actors from getting into important systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But despite the risks, the use of weak or recycled passwords continues to be a problem even amongst IT professionals. While systems such as two factor authentication have been used as an extra layer of security, groups like the FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium have been working to make passwords a thing of the past, in favour of more secure methods.</p>



<p>This week, we spoke to Richard Meeus, EMEA director of security &amp; technology strategy for Akamai Technologies, to explore the solutions driving secure sign ons, and how the sector can adapt to this change.</p>

<p>This is from a December 2009 newsletter called Suitwatch, which&nbsp;I wrote for Linux Journal, and was 404’d long ago. (But I kept the original.) I’m re-posting it here because I think syndication may be the most potent power any of us have in the Internet age—and because the really simple kind,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>, has been with us since before I wrote this piece. (I also think RSS has VRM implications as well, but I’ll leave those for another post.) My only edits here were to remove arcana and anachronisms that are pointless today. This graphic illustrates how entrenched and widespread RSS already is:</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>Until recently, the verb “syndication” was something big publishers and agencies did. As a kid, I recognized “© King Features Syndicate” was the one unfunny thing about Blondie or Dennis the Menace. All it meant to me was that some kind of Business was going on here.</p>
<p>Now millions of individual writers syndicate their own work, usually through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS (Really Simple Syndication)</a>. Publishers and other large organizations do too. This article is syndicated. So are updates to product manuals, changes to development wikis, updates on SourceForge, and searches of keywords. You name it: if there’s something that updates frequently on the Web, there’s a better chance every minute that the new stuff is syndicated if it isn’t already.</p>
<p>Far as I know, not many sources are making money with it. Lots, however, are making money&nbsp;because&nbsp;of it. The syndicated world may not look like an economy yet. But trust me, it is.</p>
<p>At this early stage in its long future history, syndication is primarily a feature of blogging, which is primarily the product of too many people to count. Blogging is not about large-scale things. It’s about human beings who have no scale other than themselves. Only you can be good at being you, and nobody else is the same as you. Syndication does more to expand individual human potential than anything since the invention of type. Or perhaps ever. The syndicated world economy is the one that grows around unleashed personal powers of expression, productivity, creation, distribution, instruction, influence, leadership, whatever.</p>
<p>In a loose sense, syndication is one side of the conversation. Think about conversation in the best sense of the word: as the way people teach and learn from each other, the way topics start and move along. Syndication makes that happen in huge ways.</p>
<p>The notion that “markets are conversation”, popularized by The Cluetrain Manifesto, was borrowed from this case I used to make for a form of marketing that was far more natural and powerful than the formal kind:</p>
 
 Markets are conversation, and 
 Conversation is fire. Therefore, 
 Marketing is arson. 
 
<p>If you want to set fires, start conversations that tend to keep going. Nothing does the latter better than syndication.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why we still don’t hear as much about syndication as we should (and will). First, it’s still new. Second, it didn’t come from The Big Guys. (It came from&nbsp;<a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>, father of&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS —&nbsp;Really Simple Syndication</a>.) Third, it points toward a value system not grounded only in exchange — one especially suited for the Net, a deeply ironic worldwide environment where everybody is zero distance apart.</p>
<p>But let’s park the value system until later and talk about next week. That’s when I’ll be in San Francisco for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.syndicateconference.com/live/38/">Syndicate</a>. It’s the second in a series of conferences by that name. The first was in New York last Spring.</p>
<p>Since I’m the conference chair (disclosure: it’s a paying gig), and since I’ll be giving both the introductory talk and the closing keynote, Syndication is on the front burner of my mind’s stove.</p>
<p>There are others subjects there as well, some of which will be visited in sessions at the show. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>, for starters. And&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagging">tagging</a>—a practice so new it’s not even close to having standards of the sort we find at OASIS, the IETF, and the W3C. Instead, it has emerging standards, like the ones we find at&nbsp;<a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats.org</a>.</p>
<p>Like syndication, tagging is a long-tail activity. Something individuals do. Along with blogging and syndication, it helps outline a new branch of the Net we’re starting to call the Live Web — as opposed to the Static Web with “sites” that are “built” and tend not to change.</p>
<p><a href="http://interactive.linuxjournal.com/article/8549">The World Live Web</a>&nbsp;is the title of my December Linux For Suits column in <a href="http://linuxjournal.com">Linux Journal</a>. In it, I note that the directoryless nature of everything on the Web falls in the Unix file path east of the domain name. Every path to a document (or whatever) is a piece of straw in the static Web’s haystack. Google and Yahoo help us find needles in that haystack, but their amazing success at search also tends to confirm the haystack nature of the Static Web itself.</p>
<p>The Live Web is no less webby than the Static Web. They’re both parts of the same big thing. But the Live Web is new and very different. It cannot be understood in Static Web terms.</p>
<p>In that piece, I also observed that blogs, as continuing projects by human authors, leave chronological trails. These give the Live Web something of a structure: a chronological one that goes /year/month/day/date/post, even if that’s not the way each post’s URL is composed. There is an implicit organizational structure here, and it’s chronological.</p>
<p>Tagging, by which individuals can assign categorical tags of their own to everything from links to bookmarks to photos, has given the Live Web an&nbsp;ad hoc&nbsp;categorical structure as well.</p>
<p>So that’s what we’re starting to see emerge here: chronology and category. Rudimentary, sure, but real. And significant.</p>
<p>But not organized. New practices, and new ideas, are coming along too fast.</p>
<p>What matters, above all, is user-in-charge: a form of personal agency in the connected world. That’s a concept so key to everything else that’s happening on the Web, even on the Static one, that we may need a new word for it.</p>
<p>Or an old one, like&nbsp;independence,&nbsp;liberty,&nbsp;sovereignty, or&nbsp;autonomy. That’s my inner Libertarian, choosing those. If your sensibilities run a bit more to the social side, you may prefer words like&nbsp;actualization&nbsp;or&nbsp;fulfillment.&nbsp;Point is, the Big Boys aren’t in charge anymore. You are. I am. We are.</p>
<p>There’s an economy that will grow around us. I think free software and open-source practices (see various books and essays by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard M. Stallman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond">Eric S. Raymond</a>) put tracks in the snow that point in the direction we’re heading, but the phenomenon is bigger than that.</p>
<p>It’s also bigger than Google and Yahoo and Microsoft and IBM and Sun and Red Hat and Apple and the rest of the companies people (especially the media) look to for Leadership. For all the good those companies do in the world, the power shift is underway and is as certain as tomorrow’s dawn. The Big Boys will need to take advantage of it. We’ll need them to, as well.</p>
<p>This power shift is what I’d like to put in front of people’s attention when they come to Syndicate next week, or when they follow the proceedings in blogs and other reports.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, power is personal. Companies large and small will succeed by taking advantage of that fact. And by watching developments that aren’t just coming from The Usual Suspects. Including the Usual Economic Theories.</p>
<p>For example, not everything in an economy is about exchange, or the value chain, or about trade-offs of this for that. Many values come out of effort and care made without expectation of return. Consider your love for your parents, spouses, children, friends, and good work. Consider what you give and still get to keep. Consider debts erased by forgiveness. Consider how knowledge grows without its loss by anyone else.</p>
<p>Sayo Ajiboye, the Nigerian minister who so blew my mind in conversations we had on a plane nearly five years ago (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Doc+Searls%22%2B%22Sayo+Ajiboye%22">Google them up</a>&nbsp;if you like), taught me that markets are&nbsp;relationships, and not just conversations. Relationships, he said, are not just about exchange. They cannot be reduced to transactions. If you try, you demean the relationships themselves.</p>
<p>Also, in spite of the economic framings of our talk about morality and justice (owing&nbsp;favors,&nbsp;paying&nbsp;for crimes,&nbsp;just&nbsp;desserts), there is a deeper moral system that cannot be understood in terms of exchange. In fact, when you bring up exchange, you miss the whole thing. (Many great teachers have tried in futility to make this point, and I’m probably not doing any better.) Whatever it is, its results are positive. Growth in one place is not matched by shrinking in another. Value in both systems is created. But in the latter one, the purpose is not always, or exclusively, exchange, or profit. At least not from the activity itself. There are&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2007/11/28/adventures-with-because-effects/">because&nbsp;effects</a> at work. And we’re only beginning to understand them, much less practice them in new ways.</p>
<p>Toward that end, some questions…</p>
<p>Where did the Static Web, much less the Live Web, come from? What is it for? What are we doing with it? Whatever the answers, nothing was exchanged for them. (No, not even the record industry, the losses of which owe to their own unwillingness to take advantage of new opportunities opened by the Net.)</p>
<p>Nor was anything exchanged for Linux, which has grown enormously.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="http://kroah.org/">Greg Kroah-Hartman</a>&nbsp;said recently on the&nbsp;<a href="http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2005-December/thread.html#11441">Linux-Elitists</a>&nbsp;list,</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember,&nbsp;<a href="http://lists.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2005-November/000098.html">Linux is a species</a>, and we aren’t fighting anyone here, we are merely evolving around everyone else, until they aren’t left standing because the whole ecosystem changed without them realizing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, we have living ends.</p>

 Introduction <p>The Geo Web is a protocol that creates consensus for browsing digital media anchored to real-world locations. It uses a <a href="https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/partial-common-ownership">partial common ownership system</a> (aka Harberger taxes) to administer a global digital land market and fund public goods.</p><p>The Geo Web chose Ceramic to power mutable P2P content linking from its land parcel NFTs. Ceramic’s ecosystem of composable data, schemas, and applications allows Geo Web landholders to push the use case possibilities of the open metaverse.</p><p>The Geo Web recently launched its <a href="https://geoweb.land/">mainnet on Optimism</a> and is currently in a global <a href="https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/fair-launch">Fair Launch Auction</a> that runs until January 14th, 2023.</p> The Fight for the Open Metaverse <p>Who will control how digital media is organized and experienced in the physical world?</p><p>The Geo Web was founded to provide a credibly neutral, open-source answer to that question.</p><p>The Geo Web creates a virtual layer covering the globe that allows publishers and users to create a shared augmented reality. It’s an alternative to app stores, algorithms, and ad brokers intermediating every experience and transaction in the metaverse era.</p><p>Each Geo Web parcel NFT is like a 3D website. Landholders have the exclusive right to publish arbitrary data, entertainment, and applications within the bounds of their parcel on the network. Users naturally discover and experience the content with a universal browser application that resolves content based on geolocation rather than a URL.</p><p>The Geo Web maintains its DNS-like digital land registry by enforcing the three basic rules of partial common ownership:</p>  Landholders must maintain a public For Sale Price for their parcel(s)  Any market participant can trigger the transfer of a parcel by paying the holder their For Sale Price  Landholders must pay an ongoing Network Fee proportional to their For Sale Price (currently 10% per year)  <p>All of the revenue from the resulting digital land market is reinvested into public goods and prosocial outcomes through participatory mechanisms. Through a flywheel of open-source investment and network effects, the Geo Web can help the internet of the next era return to its permissionless, decentralized roots.</p> Managing Dynamic, Decentralized Content <p>The Geo Web’s property rights system is a good use case for on-chain smart contracts. But when it comes to putting those property rights to use through content publishing, on-chain data is too slow, expensive, and unwieldy.</p><p>The Geo Web needed a dynamic, mutable content layer that could enable the mind-bending use cases of augmented and mixed reality. It needed to be user-friendly without sacrificing the principles of decentralization and user control.</p><p>The Geo Web team found Ceramic early in its architecture stage and knew it would be a fit. Geo Web was <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/geo-web-is-connecting-digital-content-to-the-physical-world-with-nfts-and-ceramic/">one of the first protocols to launch a testnet on Ceramic</a>.</p> How Geo Web Built With Ceramic <p>Ceramic provides the mutable content root for each Geo Web land parcel NFT. A parcel’s active StreamID is deterministically derived based on the current licensor’s wallet address and the ParcelID.</p><p>Landholders frictionlessly manage their parcel’s Ceramic Tile Document through their authenticated DID.</p><p>Open schemas and data definitions shared between publishers and spatial browsers create an endless landscape for use cases.</p><p>The Geo Web team is excited to push new features, use cases, and integrations within the Ceramic ecosystem, now that the Geo Web mainnet is live.</p> Become a Geo Web Citizen <p>The Geo Web’s fair launch auction is live on Optimism (non-auction claims begin January 14th, 2023 at 17:00 UCTC). You can claim land parcels on the <a href="https://geoweb.land/">Geo Web Cadastre</a> corresponding to your home, work, or favorite park then start adding content with Ceramic. All your land market fees go toward funding public goods.</p><p>If you’re a developer, creator, or organization looking to build on/with the Geo Web, get in touch with the team via <a href="https://discord.com/invite/reXgPru7ck">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thegeoweb">@thegeoweb</a> on Twitter, or through the <a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">project website</a>.</p>

<p>On 14 November 2022, the ToIP Foundation <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/11/14/toip-tech-arch-first-public-review/">announced the release</a> of the first public review draft of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0</a>. This specification represents over a year’s work by the ToIP Technology Architecture Task Force to define the technical requirements for each of the four layers of the ToIP stack—the centerpiece of the ToIP Foundation’s work to develop an interoperable architecture for decentralized digital trust.</p>



<p>In this post, we will dive deeper into one particular layer —&nbsp;Layer 2 — to explain the special role of the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol and why it is the keystone to achieving large-scale interoperability.</p>



 But First — Some Context 



<p>It may first be helpful to understand the overall context of this work. The ToIP Foundation recently published a new document for this very purpose, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/evolution-of-the-toip-stack/">Evolution of the ToIP Stack</a>, that contains the following diagram:</p>



Figure 1: The four stages of development of the ToIP stack



<p>Here is a summary of the purpose of each of the four development stages:</p>



 
 Design Principles. Before we could dive into the design of the ToIP stack itself, we needed to agree on the principles governing the design. A six month effort produced <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack V1.0</a>—a document we highly recommend for a much deeper understanding of the problem space. 



 Technical Architecture. Based on the Design Principles, we next needed to come to consensus on the architectural requirements of the overall system and the requirements for each of the four layers in the stack of the endpoints. This year-long effort resulted in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification</a>, just released for public review. 



 Component Specifications. The ToIP Technology Architecture Specification cannot be implemented directly by itself—it only specifies requirements that must be met by a set of component specifications. Each component specification is a building block that can then be assembled into a complete implementation of the ToIP technology stack. 



 Interoperability Testing. Once a sufficient set of component specifications are ready, stakeholders in digital trust ecosystems can develop ToIP interoperability profiles against which test suites can be written to provide objective measurements of functional interoperability. 
 



<p>As Figure 1 indicates, we are already 2.5 years into the process and just reaching the end of the first iteration of stage 2. Note that we expect iteration at each stage, i.e., as we gain experience at higher stages, we expect to make minor adjustments to the foundational documents.</p>



<p>Given that we expect the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0 to be finalized in the first quarter of 2023, we are now ready to move forward into the component specification stage. As the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/evolution-of-the-toip-stack/">Evolution of the ToIP Stack</a> explains, most of these will not be developed by the ToIP Foundation — they are specifications that either already exist or are in progress at other standards development organizations such as DIF, W3C, IETF, ISO, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One exception is the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol—the one and only protocol required at ToIP Layer 2. Since the requirements for this protocol have only just been published, no other standards development organization currently has it as a focus. The purpose of this article is to explain the unique role this protocol plays in the ToIP stack and how we propose to proceed with its development.</p>



 The Hourglass Model 



<p>Section 6.2 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification</a> explains that the design of the ToIP stack is based on the same core design principles as the Internet’s TCP/IP stack, and in particular the principle known as the Hourglass Model. Here is the one sentence summary of this principle from section #3 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack V1.0</a>:</p>



<p>In a layered protocol architecture, the most successful design takes an hourglass shape where a single “spanning layer” in the middle connects a family of higher-level application-facing protocols with a family of lower-level transport protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 2, from <a href="https://www.iab.org/wp-content/IAB-uploads/2010/11/hourglass-london-ietf.pdf">an August 2001 presentation by Steve Deering of Cisco</a>, illustrates how the TCP/IP stack implements the Hourglass Model.</p>



Figure 2: The hourglass model as implemented by the TCP/IP stack



<p>The spanning layer in the TCP/IP stack is the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines the addressing system required to identify and connect any two Internet-connected devices. The spanning layer in the ToIP stack has the same goal except the purpose is to establish a trust relationship, i.e., a communications relationship whose authenticity can be cryptographically verified by both sides. Figure 3 illustrates how the hourglass design applies to the four layers of the ToIP stack.</p>



Figure 3: The Hourglass Model applied to the four layers of the ToIP stack



<p>Appendix B of the ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification includes a functional view of the ToIP stack (Figure 4) that goes into greater detail about the kinds of functions required above and below the Trust Spanning layer. Layer 1 (Trust Support) needs the services for storing and processing the cryptographic key material and encrypted data that is required for secure communications over Layer 2. Layer 3 (Trust Tasks) is a growing family of protocols that can be developed to automate common functions required in digital trust relationships.</p>



Figure 4: A more detailed diagram of how the hourglass model applies to the ToIP stack



 Requirements for the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol 



<p>Given the starring role of the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol, it should be no surprise that it is the target of 60% of the requirements in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification</a>. Of the 30 requirements in the specification (all aggregated in Appendix A), 18 are for Layer 2. They are included in Table 1 below for quick reference.</p>



Req #RequirementL2.1A ToIP Endpoint System MUST communicate with another ToIP Endpoint System using the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol.L2.2A ToIP identifier MUST be unique within the context in which it is used for identification.L2.3A ToIP identifier MUST be a verifiable identifier, i.e., verifiably bound to at least one set of cryptographic keys discoverable via an associated discovery protocol.L2.4A ToIP identifier SHOULD be a decentralized identifier, i.e., a verifiable identifier that does not require registration with a centralized authority.L2.5A ToIP identifier SHOULD be an autonomous identifier, i.e., a decentralized identifier that is self-certifying and fully portable.L2.6A ToIP identifier SHOULD support rotation of the associated cryptographic keys for the lifetime of the identifier.L2.7A ToIP identifier MAY also support rotation to an entirely different ToIP identifier that can be cryptographically verified to be a synonym of the original ToIP identifier.L2.8A ToIP identifier SHOULD support the ability to: a) associate the identifier with the network address of one or more ToIP Systems that can deliver to one or more Endpoint Systems under the locus of control of the ToIP identifier controller, and, b) if desired by the controller, enable that association to be discoverable.L2.9The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol specification MUST define how to construct and format messages that are cryptographically verifiable to have the following four properties: (1) Authenticity: the message was sent from a sender who has control over the ToIP identifier. (2) Integrity: the contents of the message transmitted by the sender are received by the recipient without modification. (3) Confidentiality: the contents of the message are only accessible by authorized parties. (4) Privacy: the contents of the message are bound to conditions of usage agreed to by the parties.L2.10In a ToIP Endpoint System, an implementation of the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol MUST support authenticity and integrity.L2.11In a ToIP Endpoint System, an implementation of the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol MAY support confidentiality and privacy.L2.12The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol MUST enable the composition of higher-level Trust Task Protocols (such features as co-protocols).L2.13The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol MUST support extensible message schema.L2.14The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol MUST support resolution of ToIP identifiers to: a) the network addresses of receiving Endpoint Systems, and b) any required cryptographic keys.L2.15The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol MUST support transport of messages via ToIP Layer 1 interfaces.L2.16The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol MUST support delivery of messages to the Layer 2 interface of the Endpoint System of the ultimate receiver of the message.L2.17The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol MUST support delivery of messages via Intermediary Systems.L2.18The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol MUST support confidentiality with regard to the metadata required for message routing.Table 1: The 18 requirements for ToIP Layer 2 — the Trust Spanning Protocol



 ToIP Identifiers 



<p>The astute reader will notice that 7 of these 18 requirements apply to ToIP identifiers, the term the spec uses for the cryptographically verifiable identifiers needed to establish the ToIP trust spanning layer. The complete taxonomy of ToIP identifiers is shown in Figure 5:</p>



Figure 5: The different subclasses of ToIP identifiers



<p>From broadest to narrowest, the three subclasses of ToIP identifiers are:</p>



 
 Verifiable identifiers (VIDs) include any identifier bound to at least one cryptographic key pair so that control over the identifier can be cryptographically verified. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> URLs backed by X.509 digital certificates are one example of a VID (typically one that uses a domain name based on a centralized DNS registry). 



 Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are VIDs that: a) do not require a centralized registry, b) provide a standard mechanism for resolution, and c) permit dynamic discovery of associated network service endpoints (such as an endpoint that supports the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol). See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">W3C DID Spec Registries</a> for an extensive list of DID methods that implement the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification</a>. 



 Autonomous identifiers (AIDs) are DIDs generated algorithmically from a crypto- graphic key pair in such a way that they are self-certifying, i.e. the binding with the public key can be verified without the need to consult any external blockchain or third party. <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> is an example of a decentralized identity technology based entirely on AIDs. 
 



<p>ToIP identifiers are essential to the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol for the same reason that IP addresses are essential to the IP protocol: they provide the new form of address required to achieve a universal spanning layer. In the case of the IP protocol, the spanning layer enables data to flow between any two endpoints regardless of their local network domain. In the case of the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol, the spanning layer enables cryptographically verifiable data to flow between any two endpoints regardless of their local trust domain.</p>



 Forerunners for the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol 



<p>As DIDs and AIDs emerged, they quickly catalyzed interest in new protocols that used the unique new properties of these identifiers to establish secure communications channels. Table 2 lists the three best-known of these protocols:</p>



ProtocolHostPrimary SpecificationDIDComm V2DIF<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/</a>&nbsp;KERI / CESRToIP / DIF / IETF<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri</a>&nbsp;DWN (Decentralized Web Node)DIF<a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/</a>&nbsp;



<p>Table 2: Protocols designed explicitly to work with verifiable identifiers</p>



 
 DIDComm takes its name directly from the concept of general-purpose “DID-to-DID communications. DIDComm V1 originated at Hyperledger Aries, then as interest grew, a <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm working group</a> was established at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>. <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">DIDComm V2 was released</a> in July 2022. 



 KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), which uses CESR (Composable Event Streaming Representation), is currently being developed by a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/">GitHub community</a> that is preparing Internet Drafts for submission to IETF. KERI focuses on providing the robust key management necessary to secure authentic connections between any two AIDs. 



 DWN (Decentralized Web Node) is, to quote the spec, “a data storage and message relay mechanism entities can use to locate public or private permissioned data related to a given DID.” DWN is a work item of the DIF <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage Working Group</a>. Although DWN is more data-oriented than either DIDComm or KERI, it too specifies a message-based protocol for communicating with a DID-identified endpoint. 
 



<p>In addition to these three general-purpose secure messaging protocols that are clearly relevant to ToIP Layer 2, it is worth pointing out another set of protocols that have been developed specifically for issuing and presenting digitally verifiable credentials. Although from a ToIP layering standpoint, these protocols are all primarily Layer 3 (Trust Task) protocols, some of them include some Layer 2 functions for the simple reason there has not been any clearly defined Layer 2 protocol yet. Table 3 lists several of the most popular:</p>

<p>Table 3: Protocols designed for issuance or presentation of digital credentials</p>



<p>We mention all of these protocols (and undoubtedly there are others) for two reasons:</p>



 
 All of these protocols may have something to contribute to the design of the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol. All of them enable the exchange of secure and privacy-respecting content between endpoints. 



 None of these protocols, as currently specified, meet all the requirements of the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol. While some may be very close, none were explicitly designed to function as a spanning layer protocol—a protocol that by definition must be, to paraphrase Einstein, “as simple as possible but no simpler”. 
 



 The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force 



<p>The fact that such strong candidate protocols already exist has three key implications for development of the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol:</p>



 
 This work does not need to “start from scratch”—or anywhere near it. Rather it can focus immediately on what can be learned/inherited from these existing protocols—and especially on what can be removed from them (and put into a Layer 3 trust task protocol). 



 This work can benefit enormously from the participation of the architects of these other protocols. These experts have already poured several years of their lives into designing protocols that implement a superset of the functionality needed by the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol. Our hope is that with their help, we can achieve consensus relatively quickly about the subset of features that are absolutely essential. 



 The simpler the protocol, the faster we can have multiple implementations. By definition, a spanning protocol needs to be adopted very widely. The faster we can show multiple interoperable implementations, the faster we can kick start adoption. 
 



<p>For all these reasons, the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">ToIP Technology Stack Working Group</a> launched the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force</a> (TSPTF) on Wednesday, January 18. You can listen to a <a href="https://zoom.us/rec/share/xNMMjwXL3FiVoY_-8NbdUWn--mQydThGCoPQ7RyCoRfi4RiKDbr9Hq75V6kvZRb8.zVVbrTDp0DgN8kcC">Zoom recording of the first meeting</a>.</p>



<p>The TSPTF will now begin holding pairs of meetings on Wednesdays —one for NA/EU time zones at 08:00-09:00 PT / 16:00-17:00 UTC and one for APAC time zones at 18:00-19:00 PT / 02:00-03:00 UTC. For exact dates and meeting logistics of all ToIP meetings, see the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings">ToIP Calendar</a>.</p>



 A Collaborative, Multi-Organizational Effort 



<p>The most important principle of this work is that it should be as open and inclusive as possible. The whole point of a trust spanning protocol is to enable a new trust ecosystem consisting of interoperable trust applications, where those trust applications remain independent of the underlying trust infrastructure that the trust spanning protocol connects. So for this work in particular we want to involve all the other non-profit orgs and SDOs in our space: DIF, Hyperledger, W3C, IETF, ISO, IEEE, and any other stakeholders in decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



<p>To this end, Daniel Hardman, co-chair of the DIF DIDComm Users Group (DUG) and now co-lead of the TSPTF, held a special meeting of the DUG on 09 January to discuss the topic of multi-stakeholder collaboration. Over 40 members of the decentralized identity and trust ecosystem attended. We recommend listening to the <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/3T2MqVs6gUCnAosPzcegAPq_6dFN8i3zkuKI04nSlPnTaHTDs0tWusbX5G_-FH-Y.pS40kM3zazC_MaYz">Zoom recording of the DUG special meeting</a> and/or reviewing <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ksqVxeCAvqLjr67htWZ4JYaSnI8TUZIO7tDMF5npHTo/edit#slide=id.g1c1ea9f3ac3_0_110">Daniel’s slides</a> to understand his specific recommendations for how we can all collaborate more successfully in 2023.</p>

<p>In the second installment of our DIF Member Spotlight series we sat down with Tarun Gaur, the CEO and founder of <a href="https://qikfox.com">qixfox</a>, a cybersecurity system that includes a decentralized browser. He will share more about his journey into the decentralized identity space and about his product which also supports quantum resistant cryptography. Watch the entire interview on <a href="https://youtu.be/RY00SyBVl-w">YouTube</a></p><p>Limari: First of all, I want to welcome you Tarun. Thank you so much for joining me today and having this discussion. I must say, when I spoke to you a few months ago, when you went through your short demo on qixfox, I was actually really excited about what you guys are doing. I’m really glad we get to have this discussion and go a little bit more in. First what I always like to do when I start out is I like to hear people's story. Everyone in this community is so interesting. and decentralized identity, it is a space which is relatively new. it would be great to just get a sense of your journey, how you came to work on qixfox and also decentralized identity generally. So maybe you can just give us a little bit of an introduction on that</p><p>Tarun Gaur: Absolutely first of all, thanks for having us here, very excited to be an associate member at DIF. As far as my story is concerned, I worked for companies like Deloitte, AOL and Microsoft and I've been all over the place. I'm an engineer by profession, never been a business guy, but somehow by default got into entrepreneurship. I left Microsoft to start my own software consulting firm growing it to around five hundred people and then I had a successful exit from it. Then qixfox was my favorite project since my college days. I always had this feeling that something is drastically wrong with the Internet. It’s very information driver and obviously the technologies were not there. Early on web 1.0 was very information-driven.</p><p>Since my college days I wanted to build an internet browser in the horizontal platform, and that's how ultimately how man and machine came together. You know, I had the resources to do it this time around the hardware and software was now up to par, I could build very immersive experiences and a lot of technology was open source. I said, this is the right time to do it. We are kind of sitting at the beginning of the end of the first era of the Internet. So I think this is the perfect time to do it.</p><p>Limari: &nbsp;Okay, wonderful. If you can give us maybe just a bit of an overview of what qixfox is that would be great.</p><p>Tarun Gaur: Absolutely, we love to call ourselves the trustworthy internet company which practically means that we are building the tool shed for the trustworthy Internet. As part of that we are solving two problems: fixing what is broken in the web, which is safety, security, and privacy and second, design the future which practically means build a more democratic, equitable, and decentralized Internet.</p><p>In the past peer to peer computing has been tried before or decentralized web has been tried before. It did not fail because we could not connect computers together, it practically failed because we could not contain spam. You know for example you have bit torrent, and you download bit torrent, content from bit torrent and you can't put a finger on what are you downloading from and what the content is all about, it could be a malware, it could be a key log it could be anything.</p><p>We have this set of problems in web 2.0 around safety, security and privacy and we are dragging all these problems to web3.0 You know, with all the Hoopla around privacy and trust we thought you cannot solve privacy without solving safety and security, and we thought you need a horizontal platform to do that. Honestly, the more we kind of researched other browsers we realized that, there were some basic problems that other browsers were not solving that we had an opportunity to solve at qixfox. That's how we transpired. You know a number of our team members, they've worked with me in the past. We thought it might be a great idea to get together, and fix this once and for all.</p><p>The icing on the cake was that my mother got scammed for $600 some time back, and her running joke was that, hey, you're good for nothing you can't fix this problem for me and all of the mails. I'm like, okay mom let's fix this problem for everybody. Let's make Internet more safe, trustworthy and reliable and that's what we are doing at qixfox, practically.</p><p>Limari: Yeah, that's great and I know there are a number of browsers that may claim, you know to be security browsers. It would be great if you can give us also a bit of an idea of</p><p>what makes qixfox different from other security browsers that are out there that people can choose from.</p><p>Tarun Gaur: Absolutely. You know tongue in cheek, I generally tend to say that we don't consider other browsers to be our competitors. We consider every other horizontal platform to be a competitor. For example, I think Google is a competitor, we think Microsoft is a competitor. Apple is a competitor. We don't consider Oprah or Brave to be a competitive per se. Our intention was to build a platform that is designed for trustworthy Internet. It doesn't matter whether you are centralized or decentralized, whether you're using web2 technologies, web2.5 technologies or web3.0 technologies.</p><p>We had a feeling that the consumer is not getting a consumer-friendly reliable experience.</p><p>So that's where we kind of delineate ourselves from the likes of Brave and what have you. Their claim to fame is practically that we take care of privacy. As I mentioned before, we think that you cannot solve privacy if you don't solve safety and security. I'll give you a simple example. You have an email from a phishing website. You click on that website, and you willingly provide all your information. There goes your privacy out of the window. If the browser does not have the technology to identify that the entity you are dealing with is not a legitimate business, or you are not interacting with a reliable second or third party, then your privacy is not secured. So we jokingly say that privacy is the new Kool Aid these days. Everybody talks about privacy but very few know how to fix it.</p><p>Then safety security privacy, I always had this opinion that it's things like honesty, integrity, are not your speciality, they should be there by default. Safety, security, and privacy are not a speciality that you design the platform around. It is a prerequisite and then comes the things that you want to do. For example, we want to design the future, we want a consumer to be able to create an online shop with a click of a button. We want them to be able to find each other very easily. We want them to be able to verify each other's identity easily. We want them to feel private and then be anonymous if they want to, but at the same time share information at the point of view. That's where decentralized identity was a critical building block for us. We couldn't have done this without decentralized identity, because re-writing the Internet kind of practically starts and ends at creating these building blocks in the horizontal platform.</p><p>So, in short, you know it's quite a mouthful. You know I love to say it in a simple manner that we are solving the problems the fundamental problems that exist in internet today</p><p>and then build pleasant, consumer, friendly, centralized, as well as decentralized experiences for the consumers for the future.</p><p>That's how I would put it. So that's where I think we deviate from all of the browsers like Firefox, Opera, Brave, etc.</p><p>Limari: When I spoke to you months ago, you mentioned that this was a cybersecurity system, and a feature of it is the browser that has decentralized identity baked into it. You describe it as, once you have access to it, you can access all your various accounts. Can you maybe give a little bit of a summary for some of our audience of kind of how that might work?</p><p>Tarun Gaur: Very early on in my career, in one of my incarnations at Microsoft, I used to work with the telecom providers. With telecom providers they were latching on to data networks. It was almost always about the applications that you can bring on a platform. At the end of the day a platform is as successful as the applications that you built on it and decentralized identity is the one such paradigm. If you don't have a working, active application for it, it is very difficult for the consumer to understand the difference between a password manager, and identity.</p><p>You see that in decentralized apps, they are in a dismal state today. You know there are more than 4,000 decentralized apps and their average active users are 699. You look at 350 identity wallets, and practically when you open the application it's completely empty.</p><p>So we thought, having an identity wallet singularly and separately, and in an isolated fashion, does not make sense unless you were Apple or Google. So where do you kind of put your identity wallet? The identity wallet has to be at the point of use, and you have to make the transition for the consumer seamless, from using a password manager to be able to use decentralized identity or using their verifiable credentials as part of that workflow. So we have around four different reference applications that we have built. One of them is a collaboration engine like Zoom, another one is an in built anti-virus, then the third one is a smart stack application, which is our answer to IPFS. All these technologies are put together, they all use decentralized identity. For example, if you log in you have a profile created in our browser, and you want to log into any of these applications you don't have to do anything. One simple question is asked, this service provider is asking for so and so information.</p><p>You click yes, and then you are logged in automatically, because that exchange between the identity wallet and the service provider happens automatically. For the consumer it’s as simple as just clicking on the password manager and selecting the password. This was the experience that we wanted to kind of get to.</p><p>We had a simple philosophy, that if we can't make it simple for the consumers throw it in the dust bin. At the end of the day the browser needs to be used by the consumers and small businesses alike. Another reasoning was how do you bring it to the masses? How do you make sure that, identity systems become an integral part of the next generation experiences. While we were working on building these, reducing the entry barrier for consumers to create a website, to build a shop, you know all those experiences, identity becomes an integral fundamental part of it. We wanted to make sure that it is built into the browser.</p><p>So today all you need to do is you'll go to the browser, there is an application called anti-virus, which is built into the browser. You click on that anti-virus, your identity is automatically shared, your subscription is validated, and if your subscription is still valid (everything happens with decentralized identity), then you get access to the application. We’ve taken care of those advanced use cases like revocation lists and ensuring privacy for the consumer, not going back to the issuer and so and so forth. But all of it is completely transparent to the consumer. The consumer thinks just another password manager.</p><p>Limari: I know you mentioned that your mother was one of the individuals who fell prey to fraud and the boomer generation you mentioned was really your primary market. These are the primary people who are coming to you to use qixfox and that makes sense. My parents are boomers, a lot of us we've experienced strange links that get sent from people, you know they've been hacked. I’m curious to hear more about how you see this moving into other markets, or what's your vision of where you see qixfox going, and how it may change the way people do things and think about things.</p><p>Tarun Gaur: I think this is something first thing yes, my mother, you know I had an ear full from her after she got scammed, and it was all my fault, because I was supposedly an IT guy and I had to fix it! How can she get scammed from her computer? That's how it started. As far as baby boomers are concerned it was our beachhead market, because we realized that you know there are 73 million baby rumors in the United States. Around 46 million are on the Internet every single day, and out of them 21 million purchase an antivirus subscription. We realized that if we can enter this market, and we can safeguard baby boomers from getting scammed that'll give us a lot of credibility to kind of branch out to SMBs, and then ultimately go towards mega corps and then ultimately open up the other verticals and other customer segments.</p><p>So that was the plan, but if you kind of go to our website today and you look at the message it's a very simple message. It says the browser that keeps you safe. It brings you peace of mind, and this is the message for the consumers who have not yet latched on to the crypto bus, or who have not latched onto the web3, marketing buzz words. These are the consumers who use the internet every single day, and they are concerned that they may get scammed or their credit card information will be stolen.</p><p>These are the consumers that we thought are our primary market, and all across the planet. What was surprising when we kind of started doing our market research, we started to realize that it is not the baby boomers who are buying the product, it's actually their kids who are buying it for their parents. The kids are like, oh this seems very interesting. I mean, this browser is able to identify that domain name if you kind of browse to a domain name that is the legitimate business in the United States or not.</p><p>That in itself, this one simple tweak to the to the platform, actually safeguards consumers I mean from 90% of the threats. As far as our future is concerned. I think our future is all about web3. We’ve kind of identified the value proposition when it comes to the regular consumers, that’s the browser that keeps you safe.</p><p>Now the browser of the future is where we in 2023 and 2024, that's where we are working</p><p>In two different segments. One we want to make sure that we redefine what a browser means for small and medium businesses, second, we kind of enable this decentralized, trustworthy web3. That’s where I can say that blockchain in generally a small toolchain. Blockchain is practically a data structure, blockchain is not decentralized internet. Decentralized internet means you and I can connect with each other, we can share in information, we can share conversations we can have performed transactions then finally we can share experiences.</p><p>If we can do all these four things, then we are actually laying the foundation of the next generation of decentralized fragmented internet. I think we are getting there one step at a time, and all this churn that we are seeing right now is an essential part of it, and through this churn will come out the winners and the losers</p><p>Limari: Thank you for sharing all that. The other question I do have is specifically about DIF. What brought you to DIF? I’m always curious kind how you came across us, if there are any work items that were of interest to you at your company, groups that you enjoy attending, or members of your team enjoy. It would just be great to hear your thoughts on that.</p><p>Tarun: Well, I think we've always been curious. We were kind of following &nbsp;two different tracks when it came to decentralized identity and creating decentralized profiles. There is another school of thought that thinks that rather than decentralized identity you can just have nfps, non-fungible profiles and kind of just post them on blockchain and use them as a springboard to kind of define identity.</p><p>But I've been throughout my career, I've been a standards junkie. Very early on you've understood right if you make a lot for yourself, it should work for everybody otherwise you’re the only one using the lot. So the key has to work for everybody.</p><p>I think that's where the standards bodies come in. I think the biggest help that comes from DIF is the establishing of standards and writing of specs and creating use cases. We have practically used it as our prds. Our focus was building the Internet you know, the trustworthy Internet. If we had to kind of build this entire set of, architectural paradigms, the security and the specifications and the use cases around decentralized identity, it would have taken us another two years to do it. So, thanks to the entire community. We keep on following almost all the specs you know, we kind of passively follow. So thanks to the entire community for the amazing work that everybody has done to kind of bring us to this point.</p><p>It's amusing to sometimes see our implementation then ultimately see the specifications that happen at the DIF and the all the debates that go around. One of the sticking points still that we have is the revocation lists, how to deal with the revocation lists. So that's where we are very curious. We are also very curious to see how Google and Apple react to it. What is their roadmap in in terms of implementing it in their browsers? We are not complaining, because we already have it today. As I was mentioning to you last time around, you say that Jack Dorsey has a spec for web5. We have a product that does all of that today. We are not complaining, I mean Google and Microsoft and Apple can take their own sweet time debating whether they are going to go the decentralized identities out or not.</p><p>I think the speed with which we've been able to implement decentralized identity it's all thanks to DIF. If you're checked in into the future, you have to know what's happening in the identity space. Identity is fundamental to any horizontal platform so I can't really recall how I know about DIF, but let's just say, I just know it from the day one</p><p>Limari: Right, if you're in the space you come across it eventually. That's great to share because it is a great place for you to just come in, you can get your hands on the code, or you can just watch, you know you can get into the Github repos. If they’re members they can join our Slack channel, and we have great discussions that are happening there all the time.</p><p>Tarun Gaur: There is one other thing I wanted to mention very quickly. Decentralized identity when combined with quantum resistant cryptography is amazing. I guess we are the only browser that actually ensures that both these technologies are in. So we are today the only browser that has, if your server can support quantum resistant cryptography, our browser supports it today. This is what we are doing for the enterprises to make them more safe and secure.</p><p>Limari: Great thanks for sharing. I'm sure a lot of people in our audience will be very interested in that. That really brings us to the end of things. It was really great to speak with you today, Tarun. Lastly, can you give people a sense of how they, if they want to follow up with you. If they want to learn more about qixfox, what's the best way to do that.</p><p>Tarun Gaur: <a href="https://qikfox.com">qixfox.com</a>. My name is Tarun Gaur and I am available on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/web3now/">LinkedIn</a>, Facebook, Twitter, till we build our own social network as part of the super app. I'm reachable, and I’m busy to nothing. If you’ve got an amazing use case, I would love to hear from you. If I can be of any help to anybody in the community I would love to do that.</p><p>Limari: Awesome. &nbsp;Thank you so much for joining me today. This was a great interview, and I look forward to being in touch.</p><p>Tarun Gaur: Absolutely. Thank you. Thanks again.</p>

 Let’s dive into the past 12 months and reflect on how Energy Web’s technology helped companies navigate the energy transition! <p>It borders on cliche at this time of year to look back on the previous 12 months and reflect on what an eventful year it has been. But within the orbit that Energy Web occupies — namely the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/why-we-exist/">intersection of the global energy transition and Web3 technology</a> — even hyperbole seems inadequate to describe what we witnessed in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>From an energy and climate perspective this year was record-setting in ways both <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-pakistan-rsquo-s-floods-so-extreme-this-year/">horrifying</a> and <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/inflation-reduction-act-follow-canarys-coverage">inspiring</a>. While the energy transition is more urgent than ever, there are encouraging signs that <a href="https://about.bnef.com/new-energy-outlook/">2022 may well be a critical tipping point in the trajectory towards net-zero</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Web3 and crypto world, well… you already know what an exhausting year it’s been, with headlines ranging from merely disappointing to downright infuriating.</p><p>So how did Energy Web navigate such turbulent and tumultuous times?</p><p>As anyone who’s weathered a storm well knows, outcomes are largely determined by a mix of advance preparation and sound decision making when the going gets rough. Nobody could have predicted what a mess 2022 turned out to be, but in hindsight Energy Web benefitted from both strategies.</p><p>In terms of laying a solid foundation, we’re unusually well-positioned amongst Web3 organizations to withstand the current moment thanks to our laser-focus on building solutions for a specific industry. Having collectively invested tens of thousands of hours into designing, deploying, and refining solutions with our members over the past six years, we’re crystal clear about what <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/what-we-do-the-grid/">real-world problems we can solve</a> and where we can (and can’t) create value in the energy transition. Thus instead of relying on speculative crypto nonsense to fuel our growth, we generate steady revenues by <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/projects/">delivering tangible business advantages to our partners in the here and&nbsp;now</a>.</p><p>When it came to in-the-moment actions, this year we made a subtle but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dldrFmmRGgA">important strategic change</a> that will help us ride the tailwinds of <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/record-clean-energy-spending-is-set-to-help-global-energy-investment-grow-by-8-in-2022">accelerating clean energy investment</a> while avoiding the headwinds that befell much of the tech/crypto industries. In short, we transitioned from offering the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) as a stack of standalone components to bundling those components into three comprehensive solutions: <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-green-proofs/">Green Proofs</a>, <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-data-exchange/">Data Exchange</a>, and <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-asset-management/">Asset Management</a>. With this shift not only have we found strong product-market fit, we’ve also enabled a more flexible and scalable commercial model that shares elements with other popular open-source projects.</p><p>As we take stock of the last year and look ahead to 2023, we’re in an extremely strong position to deliver against our mission even as the world around us remains chaotic. We’re not going to change course, or sit around and wait for conditions to improve. Instead, we’re going to continue on our journey, with three themes as our&nbsp;guide:</p><p>Theme 1: Solve Real&nbsp;Problems</p><p>Within the Web3 world there’s been a historical tendency to focus on attributes of technology rather than their practical implications. This was always a dubious practice, but with the recent fiascos in the crypto industry it’s now entirely unviable. Advertising a solution as “decentralized” or “self-sovereign” is meaningless unless you can articulate the ends that justify those&nbsp;means.</p><p>This year we took this lesson to heart. Recognizing both the capabilities as well as limitations of EW-DOS, we honed in on a few narrow use cases where our technology provides material business benefits relative to alternative solutions. Our commitment to problem-solving is reflected in both our communications and commercial strategy. Highlights from 2022&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/stedin-the-dutch-distribution-system-operator-announces-partnership-with-energy-web-to-explore-cd278623809b">Helping distribution utilities strengthen cybersecurity while improving visibility into remote grid&nbsp;assets.</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/rmi-partners-with-energy-web-to-build-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificate-registry-as-part-of-f83ec4f169b6">Helping the aviation industry scale markets for sustainable fuel.</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/australian-energy-market-operator-partners-with-energy-web-on-project-symphony-a-future-proofed-c3e48390d338">Helping grid operators and aggregators coordinate the operation of virtual power&nbsp;plants.</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ev-users-can-take-their-energy-provider-on-the-go-with-rebeam-c9c1e527e056">Helping electric vehicle owners simplify their charging experiences.</a>  <p>Theme 2: Productize Solutions</p><p>Back in 2019 we first envisioned EW-DOS as a box of Legos: interoperable building blocks that companies could mix and match to build bespoke creations. This approach has proven reasonably successful in developing minimum viable products, but it’s not scalable in production. To maximize our impact we need to make the adoption of EW solutions as transactional and repeatable as possible, while minimizing the need for us as an organization to assist with customization and implementation. In short, we need to get closer to offering curated (or even pre-assembled) Lego sets. For Energy Web this means eventually offering solutions under multiple commercial models, with fully self-hosted and managed services options available. This year we took a few small steps in this direction with the release of <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-now-available-on-amazon-9bb6c65375ca">Energy Web RPC nodes in the AWS Marketplace</a>, and next year we’ll be announcing much more in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>Theme 3: Emphasize Execution, Not Just Innovation</p><p>Innovation is, and always will be, a core part of our organizational DNA. But 2022 is the first end-of-year cycle where instead of thinking primarily about what prototypes we’ll deliver, or what technologies we want to experiment with in the new year, our focus is on executing on our roadmap to deliver three core solutions in production, at scale. Whereas in the past we measured success by our <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/energywebx">engineering output</a>, or <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-joins-hyperledger-foundation-to-accelerate-web-3-interoperability-9f345ac03d1a">our partnerships</a>, as we mature as an organization and enter a new stage in our lifecycle we will prioritize impact and adoption above all else. Looking ahead to the end-of-year report for 2023, we want headlines not to focus simply on the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-and-volkswagen-deliver-24-7-renewable-energy-charging-solution-for-electric-vehicles-734132c5a737">release of a green EV charging solution</a>, but on how many drivers are using it; not just on <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/japans-electric-power-exchange-jepx-joins-the-energy-web-ecosystem-as-a-member-and-validator-7640d15427a0">partners experimenting with our technology</a>, but operating markets with it; and not just plans to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/climate-safe-crypto-energy-web-and-rmi-unveil-decarbonization-approach-for-electricity-intensive-bc777183863">decarbonize crypto mining</a>, but how many miners have been certified.</p><p>In sum, we’re excited about the future and can’t wait to carry our mission forward next&nbsp;year!</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Andrew Shikiar at FIDO Alliance gives his predictions for what can we expect from the cyber-security industry in 2023. The last twelve months online haven’t been short of action – good and bad. From high-profile breaches and widespread smishing attacks to metaverse speculation and Twitter drama. Not forgetting, of course, the major news in March that saw public backing of new passwordless log-in technology (FIDO passkeys) from some of the world’s largest platform vendors – admittedly we were extra excited about this one…&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by Coleen Jose, Sr. Marketing &amp; Engagement Manager,&nbsp;Content Authenticity Initiative &nbsp;</p><p>As we close out this third year at the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), we want to spotlight the fast-growing CAI community that is leading responsible innovation and implementing the technical standard for restoring trust and transparency through digital content provenance. The urgency to address mis- and disinformation, facilitate transparency and creator attribution online has become even more critical with the speed of developments in generative artificial intelligence. &nbsp;</p><p>Into 2023, we’re furthering our commitment by incorporating <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/10/18/bringing-next-wave-ai-creative-cloud">CAI technology into Adobe creative tools</a> and collaborating closely with the CAI members deploying offerings in generative AI. More to come on this.&nbsp;</p><p>Launching a standard and ecosystem for transparency online&nbsp;</p><p>We started 2022 with the <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/index.html">launch of technical standards</a> and supporting guidance from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), an alliance that Adobe leads alongside Arm, Intel, BBC, Microsoft, Sony and Truepic. These standards are the foundation for certifying and displaying the provenance or source and history of media content.&nbsp;</p><p>In June, the CAI team <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/">released a suite of open-source tools</a>, enabling a broad developer community to integrate the C2PA technical standards across web, desktop, hardware, mobile projects and more—regardless of their level of technical depth. We’re so thrilled to see community adoption, experimentation and feedback that’s critical to progress and wide adoption.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the release, the content provenance ecosystem has seen&nbsp;new and exciting implementation like that of <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/eyes-on-provenance-pixelstream">Pixelstream, a provenance-based platform</a> and system for sharing and delivery of authentic media. At Adobe MAX, we announced <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/10/18/major-steps-forward-cai-partnerships-leica-nikon-new-content-credentials-features-photoshop-beyond-max-2022">partnerships with Leica and Nikon</a>. The industry leading camera manufacturers showcased exhibiting cameras—Leica's iconic M11 Rangefinder and Nikon’s industry-leading mirrorless Z9—with provenance technology. The milestone brings authenticity to digital images at the point of capture, equipping photographers and creators alike with attribution tools.&nbsp;</p><p>We also announced&nbsp;improvements to&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/content-credentials.html">Content Credentials in Adobe Photoshop</a>, which we launched in 2021 to allow users to add their attribution details to their exported images. Enhanced support for a range of actions including working with smart objects and new global settings to keep content credentials on&nbsp;by default or at the document level brings flexibility to any creative workflow. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p>At Adobe MAX this year, Scott Belsky, CPO and EVP for Creative Cloud, announced CAI milestones with Leica and Nikon.</p>

<p>Content provenance for audiences everywhere&nbsp;</p><p>When false narratives or misleading information go viral, we often “Google” to compare coverage and cross-check available information. This common behavior and digital provenance history drive <a href="https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/">Verify</a>, the CAI website where anyone can upload an image to trace the history and edits made to a piece of digital content. This year, we updated Verify to support matching and recovery of provenance and attribution history in files exported with content credentials, ensuring CAI metadata is permanently associated to your content.&nbsp;</p><p>We welcomed many new CAI members this year—leading publishers and visual content providers including the Associated Press, Agencia EFE, El Tiempo, EPA Images, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal to name a few. Our growing global community of more than 860 members includes creative professionals, civil society, academics, media and technology companies implementing and promoting adoption of content authenticity standards online. <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/membership">Consider joining us.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Meeting online consumers and digital creators&nbsp;where they are is fundamental to the CAI’s mission—realized through open-source tools and cross-industry&nbsp;collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p>A commitment to provenance and the C2PA standard &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This year also included significant policy collaboration and developments in Europe and the United States.</p><p>In June, we achieved a milestone of collaborating with the European Commission’s <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/code-practice-disinformation">2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation</a>, the first international code to specifically include commitments on provenance and the C2PA standard. The code aims to encourage adoption by <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/signatories-2022-strengthened-code-practice-disinformation">signatories</a> which include Adobe, Google, Meta, Microsoft, TikTok and others.&nbsp;</p><p>An Adobe sponsored bill in the State of California will establish a <a>Deepfake Working Group</a> to study the risks and impact of digitally altered media while exploring the adoption of content provenance as a solution to identify deepfakes.&nbsp;</p><p>The CAI team also spoke at a number of policy events internationally, including a policy workshop at the Royal Society in London in September. This event was a deep dive into the recommendation from its <a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/online-information-environment/the-online-information-environment.pdf?la=en-GB&amp;hash=691F34A269075C0001A0E647C503DB8F">report on disinformation</a> on provenance technology (pp.16) where Andy Parsons, Sr. Director at the CAI,&nbsp;addressed an audience of ~50 stakeholders from academia, technology and policy alongside CAI and C2PA member, the BBC. We’ll share the learnings from this workshop when it’s published in early 2023. &nbsp;</p><p>"Addressing the issue of content authenticity at scale is a long-term, interdisciplinary, collaborative mission," Andy said. "And it is more essential than ever before with the arrival of mainstream generative AI. This coming year is set to bring deeper collaboration, wider adoption and new innovation in the provenance community. 2022 was a year of critical foundation-building for us and I see 2023 as the year of utility and adoption, built upon that foundation."&nbsp;</p><p>We’re so excited for the year ahead, continuing to co-create an ecosystem built on trust and grounded in open technologies that enable creator attribution and digital transparency.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p><a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/newsletter">Sign up</a> for our newsletter and <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/membership">consider joining</a> the CAI community.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

				 <p><a href="https://www.validatedid.com/">Validated ID</a>&nbsp;was born in 2012 with the purpose of offering a digital signature service with high legal robustness and very easy to use. They bring their experience in different areas of work and developed VIDsigner Bio, a handwritten electronic signature service on tablet, very easy to integrate and above all, legally secure.</p>
<p>Today, we have the pleasure to talk with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanbasart/">Ivan Basart,</a>&nbsp;Validated ID CTO. His professional career is specialized in cryptography, digital identity and digital signature services. He is currently in charge of the technical evolution of our digital signature service VIDsigner and the construction of our digital identity service (SSI), VIDchain. He also participates in forums related to sovereign identity, such as DIF and RWOT.</p>
 1. Introduce yourself and your company, and explain what makes you different. 
<p>My name is Iván Basart and I have more than 20 years of professional experience in the field of cryptography, electronic signatures and digital identity. I develop my professional activity as CTO of Validated ID and as one of the founders of the company, my role is to handle the technical evolution of VIDsigner, our digital signature service, as well as the construction of our digital identity service (SSI), VIDchain.</p>
<p>We have been pioneers in the field of SSI. We started working on it in 2017 when it was at the very beginning. We have participated in various international forums and initiatives such as the DIF (we are founding members) the RWOT, IIW, Sovrin, Alastria, EBSI, Lacchain…. I have been a regular speaker at events related to the topic such as the European Blockchain convention, and the Global Legal Tech and I have been a professor in the three-point blockchain master for 4 editions.</p>
<p>At Validated ID we offer security trust services for electronic signature and digital identity verification processes. We are a Qualified Trust Service Provider and Issuer of Digital Certificates and qualified seals, in compliance with the eIDAS Regulation. Our solutions, certified by ENS, ISO and HDS, help improve processes and offer the security and confidence that both companies and individuals need. We are one of the few companies working on SSI that have an in-depth experience in the field of eIDAS and being a QTSP (Qualified Trust Service Provide)</p>
 2. What services or products do you offer? 
<p>We offer solutions that help achieve a more digital and sustainable world, improve our quality of life and guarantee the privacy, rights and freedom of people.</p>
<p>With our portfolio of solutions:&nbsp;VIDsigner&nbsp;(the multi-channel electronic signature service);&nbsp;VIDchain&nbsp;(the digital identity service); and&nbsp;SP4i&nbsp;(the electronic invoicing service), our goal is to consolidate ourselves as technological leaders in these services, both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>With VIDchain we want to solve the fundamental problem of the Internet with the issue of digital identity, providing a service with which you can own, control and manage your own digital identity and from your phone. VIDchain is based on a new universal digital identity paradigm called&nbsp;Self Sovereign Identityor&nbsp;SSI, and it’s built on blockchain technology. The new Web3 will not exist until we have a reliable and universal digital identity scheme that guarantees our privacy.</p>
<p>With the VIDsigner multi-channel electronic signature service, we seek to offer a safe and easy way to sign documents online.Our different types of electronic signatures are adapted to our customer needs: whether it is a handwritten signature on a tablet, remotely with a smartphone or through digital certificates. Our technology is based on the collection of the maximum evidence, which is why we ensure that the maximum amount of evidence possible is collected in each signature process: from biometric information during the electronic signature process on a tablet (speed, inclination, pressure, etc.); to two-factor authentication, unique IP or certificates and more, all from any device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have&nbsp;SP4i, an electronic billing system&nbsp;that has been developed to&nbsp;send and receive billing documents between companies and/or public administrations.&nbsp;With SP4i, companies and freelancers can&nbsp;create and send invoices&nbsp;to customers and public administrations within the European Union.</p>
 3. What milestones have you achieved so far since your project launch? 
<p>We have been working with national and international partners, such as&nbsp;Sovrin,DIF,&nbsp;Alastria,&nbsp;ToIP,&nbsp;COVID Credentials Initiativeand&nbsp;Good Health Pass,&nbsp;to establish an open and decentralized identity ecosystem accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Our digital identity and attribute verification solution has been awarded first place in&nbsp;Cuatrecasas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Telefónicaaccelerator and first place in the&nbsp;Alastria Open Call Cataluñaproject competition, the leading blockchain consortium in Spain.</p>
<p>Since we started developing VIDchain, we have participated in a large number of projects and won several awards and recognitions for our contributions:</p>
<p>Here is a list of our recent projects and achievements:</p>
 
 Santander X Global Challenge– Winner of the Scale Up category of the Santander X Global Challenge 
 EBSI Wallet Conformance– VIDwallet is the first ID wallet to become EBSI compliant –&nbsp;Early Adopters EBSI program– We successfully designed a scenario where students in Europe can get quick and direct access to all kinds of discounts with their student cards. –&nbsp;Gavius Project– As experts in SSI and EBSI, we help create solutions to facilitate the communication and social benefit requests between local administrations and citizens. –&nbsp;Star4big Project– We created a solution to showcase how users can request, hold and present VC supported on different blockchains using VIDwallet. 
 SportChain&nbsp;– We have created a decentralized ecosystem for the sports Industry to elevate the trust in sports data. 
 eIDAS Brige-We help ensure legal validity of electronic documents and cross border trust services, such as electronic signatures and seals. To make eIDAS available as a trust framework in the SSI ecosystem, the European Commission developed the eIDAS bridge. 
 
 4. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>In the eSSIF Lab we worked on a project called eIDAS Bridge. The idea behind this project is that although there are many credential wallets under development and several companies like us are looking forward to this prominent paradigm, the reality is that the legal framework is still not fully mature. Currently, we have the eIDAS regulation, mostly focused on traditional PKIs and Certificates. In June 2021, the EC approved a new draft of this regulation that states that the new identities of European citizens will be based on the SSI principles and backed by identity wallets. However, this regulation still needs to be formally approved and developed”. In a nutshell, there is still not a clear trust framework. Therefore, the eIDAS bridge has been raised as an in-between step.</p>
<p>We started working on the eIDAS Bridge project as an initiative by the European Commission (EC) within the ISA2 program where Validated ID participated as expert of matter in PKI and SSI. The EC developed eIDAS bridge to promote eIDAS as a trust framework for the SSI ecosystem. In a nutshell, this project pretends to provide a solution to one of the most urgent existing challenges SSI faces: having a trust framework on which to rely on. The result of this project, i.e. the technical specifications, integration guidelines and legal reports produced, can be found&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Sometime later, thanks to the eSSIF Lab, we had the opportunity to evolve the original idea and project developed in the ISA2 program. The main achievement during the eSSIF Lab has been to provide an implementation of eIDAS bridge and to prove the interoperability between different provider implementations. The results of this project are available as open source.</p>
 5. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future? 
<p>As a Trust Service Provider, we are building the services that will allow us to position ourselves as one of the relevant players in the new eIDAS 2.0 scenario. We are participating in the ETSI ESI groups in order to get ready for the upcoming standards in this space.</p>
<p>We try to deliver an easy-to-consume service that packages the complexity on the technology behind SSI, that supports the evolving standards in this space and that fulfils the requirements of the upcoming regulation.</p>
<p>We already have an ID Wallet (EBSI compliant). As most of the existing ID wallets have been made by and for tech users, but at some point, everybody, also older people or with no technical background should be able to use the wallet. UX is often forgotten but very important. We are working on a full redesign in order to deliver a UX that makes possible that ID Wallets will be easy to use an understand by any user.</p>
 6. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
 
<p>It is very important to select properly the program to which you are applying. Beyond the money needs to be aligned with the objectives of your company otherwise you will have the risk of losing focus on the core things of your company. Think in a more strategic way than in a tactical way.</p>
<p>Be resilient, getting public funding is not easy and many people are competing for it. Take advantage of the feedback you get from the rejections in order to improve the proposals for resubmission.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation’s <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI working group </a>is pleased to announce the public review period has started for new Implementer’s Drafts of the <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-security-profile.html">FAPI 2.0 Security Profile </a>and the <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-attacker-model.html">FAPI 2.0 Attacker Model</a>. These drafts coincide with the recently completed <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/12/Formal-Security-Analysis-of-FAPI-2.0_FINAL_2022-10.pdf">formal security analysis</a> of the FAPI 2.0 specifications, the result of a first-of-its-kind collaboration between security researchers at the University of Stuttgart and the OpenID Foundation in the area of web protocols, work co-funded by the Australian government.</p>
<p><br>
Why FAPI 2.0?</p>
<p>The FAPI 1.0 standards have been widely implemented and the working group has gained valuable insight from ecosystems, vendors and developers. The FAPI 2.0 suite of standards builds on this insight and wider learnings from the OAuth ecosystem including the latest <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics">OAuth Security Best Current Practice</a>.</p>
<p>FAPI 2.0 aims to meet and exceed the security characteristics as FAPI 1.0 while reducing the overall complexity and the optionality in the core security profile. This will make FAPI 2.0 easier and more cost-effective to implement and will ensure interoperability across ecosystems. Add-on specs such as Grant Management, Message Signing and CIBA provide ecosystems with additional features where required. The attacker model of FAPI 2.0 makes the standard more amenable to formal security analysis and helps to delineate security boundaries, enabling implementers to better understand the security FAPI 2.0 provides.</p>
<p><br>
Why a Formal Security Analysis?</p>
<p>The standardization process in the OpenID Foundation ensures a comprehensive review of standards under development from experts both at the OpenID Foundation and external organizations . Nonetheless, complex attacks and subtle problems can evade scrutiny and therefore, additional safeguards are required to ensure that protocols are secure even under adverse conditions.</p>
<p>Formal methods allow for a rigorous and systematic in-depth analysis of standards and have proven to be a useful tool to ensure the security of protocols, famously demonstrated during the <a href="https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p1773-cremersA.pdf">development of TLS 1.3</a>. While the current methods for formal security analysis of web protocols require highly specialized knowledge, they are the best tool for uncovering vulnerabilities rooted in the logic of the protocols and can even discover previously unknown types of attacks. Conversely, formal proofs of security can exclude large classes of attacks. In OAuth 2.0, the main building block for OpenID Connect and FAPI, new attacks were found and fixed using formal analysis although its security had been studied extensively before, demonstrating the power of formal security analysis.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation’s FAPI 1.0 underwent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11520">formal security analysis</a> by a team of researchers at the University of Stuttgart. This analysis uncovered several potential attack vectors that the FAPI working group were able to either mitigate or document.</p>
<p>With co-funding from the Australian Government and the OpenID Foundation, the FAPI working group was able to commission the formal analysis of FAPI 2.0 by the same team at the University of Stuttgart.</p>
<p>The analysis on FAPI 2.0 took place over the summer of 2022 and has <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/12/Formal-Security-Analysis-of-FAPI-2.0_FINAL_2022-10.pdf">now been published</a>. This marks the first time<a href="https://openid.net/2022/12/19/fapi-2-0-announcement/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-40468" title=" According to an OpenID Foundation&amp;#8217;s survey">1</a> that a detailed formal security analysis has directly accompanied the development of a new web authentication/authorization standard from the very beginning</p>
<p><br>
Results of the Security Analysis</p>
<p>The researchers at the University of Stuttgart, Institute of Information Security led by Prof. Ralf Küsters, Pedram Hosseyni, and Tim Würtele were able to prove the security properties of the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile (formerly known as FAPI 2.0 Baseline). This is a great result and should give implementers of FAPI 2.0 further confidence in the security benefits of implementing the specifications.</p>
<p>As part of the analysis, the FAPI working group worked with the research team to further refine the FAPI 2.0 Attacker Model and the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile.</p>
<p>There is a good summary of these changes in the <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/12/Formal-Security-Analysis-of-FAPI-2.0_FINAL_2022-10.pdf">formal security analysis</a>.</p>
<p><br>
Attacks and Mitigations</p>
<p>The security analysis uncovered a few potential attacks that are now dealt with in the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile.</p>
<p>Some of these attacks are rooted in the foundations of how the web works and are impossible to fully prevent with existing technology, however they are applicable to all redirect-based authentication and authorization protocols. Since the attacks were already known from FAPI 1.0 and other protocols, it was expected that they would come up during the detailed analysis. Nonetheless, to provide adopters of FAPI 2.0 with all information required to make the best security decisions, the attacks are now described in the security considerations section of the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Cuckoo’s Token Attack (Injection of stolen access tokens)</p>
<p>This is a theoretical attack where an attacker has managed to steal a valid access token and gain control of an authorization server trusted by both a client and the target resource server. This is a very high bar, but is a theoretical possibility. FAPI 2.0 requires sender-constrained access tokens, which is a huge improvement over most OAuth 2.0 based deployments that are currently live. If tokens are not sender-constrained, this attack only requires a stolen access token and is much simpler. Essentially the formal model has shown that even with sender-constrained access tokens there are some scenarios where a sender-constrained token could be used by an attacker, if the attacker is able to control an authorization server trusted by the client. In many FAPI ecosystems the preconditions for this attack are such that this attack is all but impossible. The FAPI 2.0 Security Profile details three possible mitigations for this attack if an ecosystem decides it is necessary to defend against.</p>
<p>Authorization Request Leaks that lead to CSRF</p>
<p>This is an attack where via a CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can break session integrity and engineer a situation where the honest user is tricked and let to believe they have accessed their own account, while in reality they have accessed an attacker’s account. In some circumstances this is dangerous, for example, a user could end up uploading sensitive data to the attacker’s account. All redirect-based flows are vulnerable to this type of attack and the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile details three possible mitigations to this type of attack.</p>
<p>Browser-Swapping Attacks</p>
<p>All redirect-based flows are vulnerable to this particular attack. Again, it has unlikely preconditions: the attacker has to trick a user into following a link, and then be able to capture the authorization code issued to that user following successful authentication. FAPI 2.0 details possible mitigation strategies for this attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The FAPI working group is committed to helping international ecosystems deliver secure APIs. The FAPI 2.0 Security Profile is an important resource and we encourage implementers to consider adopting it.</p>
<p>The first-of-its-kind collaboration with researchers and the formal security analysis help to make sure FAPI 2.0 is highly secure and its properties well-understood and documented.</p>
<p>To ensure that implementations are secure and interoperable, the FAPI 2.0 specifications will soon have a comprehensive set of open source, conformance tests and a low-cost, flexible certification program. The OpenID Foundation and FAPI WG strongly encourage all implementors of FAPI 2.0 to pursue certification to ensure their implementations and communities benefit fully from the security and interoperability inherent to the FAPI 2.0 protocols, and whenever possible, to mandate ongoing conformance to ensure the ongoing benefits. The OpenID Foundation supports direct self-certification or will license 3rd party entities to perform certification, as a service to all entities that select FAPI for their Open Banking, Open Finance and Open Data implementations.</p>
<p>The FAPI working group is free to attend and membership in the Foundation is not required <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/benefits-members/">but encouraged</a>. Working group contributors are required to <a href="https://openid.net/intellectual-property/">accept the OpenID IPR Policy by signing a Contribution Agreement</a>.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2022/12/19/fapi-2-0-announcement/">FAPI 2.0 – Announcing New Drafts and Security Analysis</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic closed offices and forced governments to rapidly move services online, if they weren’t already, to serve its citizens. Although usernames and passwords are easy to deploy and easy for citizens to use, they leave systems and users vulnerable to cyberattacks. They are especially vulnerable to phishing attacks designed to steal login credentials and compromise legacy multi-factor authentication (MFA) tools like those using one-time passwords (OTP) and push notifications. With phishing attacks on the rise, it is imperative for governments to support “phishing-resistant” MFA technology that is also accessible, efficient, and cost-effective.</p>



<p>Enterprises and governments around the globe are turning to modern online authentication solutions featuring FIDO specifications based on public key cryptography. Governments and industries have embraced FIDO as the preferred way to deliver high-assurance MFA to consumers. Notably, the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), refers to FIDO security keys as <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/mfa">the gold standard of MFA1</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several governments globally have deployed and/or supported FIDO authentication for citizens to securely conduct government transactions, including making tax payments and applying for and accessing government benefits. Governments leveraging FIDO authentication solutions have realized reduced operational costs and increased consumer satisfaction.</p>



<p>This white paper provides guidance for policymakers and department/agency heads seeking to learn about FIDO authentication to support or deploy FIDO for e-government services.</p>

				 <p>eSSIF-Lab, an EU-funded Research and Innovation project about self-sovereing identities celebrated its final event last Thursday, December 1st, at La Tricoterie in Brussels, counting with over 80 SSI and NGI experts and many more via an online livestream.</p>
<p>The project was designed to advance the broad uptake of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) as a next-generation, open and trusted digital identity solution for faster and safer electronic transactions via the Internet and in real life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital initiatives are becoming critical to ensure the safety and security of citizens online, as the Internet is an essential tool in our daily lives – Jorge Gasos (eSSIF-Lab Programme Officer)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>The main mission of the event was to&nbsp;highlight and showcase eSSIF-Lab’s beneficiaries and the project’s main achievements since its launch in 2019. It was the perfect opportunity to empower, leverage and consolidate the SSI ecosystem in Europe.</p>
<p>The conference started with the introduction of the Next Generation Internet (NGI) concept by&nbsp;Jorge Gasos, eSSIF-Lab Programme Officer, who explained what this initiative has achieved so far and what are its values, the technologies that are included in its scope, what type of funding the subgrantees can benefit from in every NGI project and what it’s the role and profile of the innovators that shape the Next Generation Internet ecosystem.</p>
<p>After Jorge Gasos’ presentation,&nbsp;Oskar Van Deventer, eSSIF-Lab Scientific Coordinador, talked about actions and milestones the eSSIF-Lab project achieved in helping consolidate and advance the SSI ecosystem in Europe. He also presented some of the best SSI solutions born out of the eSSIF-Lab project and congratulated them for their achievements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t want to create unicorns, instead, we want to create a European ecosystem of startups working together to create a standard beneficial for all – Oskar van Deventer (eSSIF-Lab Scientific Coordinator)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>The attendees had the chance to listen to the event’s keynote speaker&nbsp;Anil John, Technical Director of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (USA), who spoke about how the Blockchain Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) systems can transform into Decentralized Identity Deployment.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
<p>We share the same approaches to ensure interoperability and solutions, and we also want to make sure that the public funding is used wisely and professionally – Anil John</p>
</blockquote> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>After these fruitful conversations, the audience saw nine top beneficiaries of the eSSIF-Lab project pitching their solutions and sharing how their technologies can improve the lives of European citizens. They were : Andrea Danielli from&nbsp;Amlet, Paul Knowles from&nbsp;Human Colossus Foundation, Minh Triet Le from&nbsp;Zenlife, Nick Meyne from&nbsp;Resonate, Marie-Laëtitia Brunet from&nbsp;BCdiploma, Irene Hernández from&nbsp;Gataca, Yanis Kyriakides from&nbsp;eOrigin, and Caspar Roelofs from&nbsp;Gimly.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 A reflection on how the SSI shapes the Internet of Humans 
<p></p>
<p>During the round table,&nbsp;Joao Rodrigues&nbsp;and&nbsp;Maxime Lemm&nbsp;from the The EU Commission Directorate-General for Informatics (DIGIT),&nbsp;Daniel Du Seuil, Convenor of European Self Sovereign Identity Framework (EBSI), and&nbsp;Maya Madrid, EIDAS representative, talked together about the pillars of European Digital Identity and how the European Commission will promote and encourage the use of Self-Sovereign identities in Europe.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>FIDO: New help on the way:</p>



<p>In 2021, the FIDO Alliance developed an open standard called the Fido Device Onboard (FDO) protocol. FIDO will make it easier to connect IoT devices to cloud-based and on-premises device management platforms. The FIDO protocol can autonomously onboard an IoT device without an admin knowing how to configure or access the underlying network and Internet infrastructure the device runs on. The updated FIDO2 protocol enables IoT device onboarding without the need for a password and maintains the network’s security and governance requirements.</p>

<p>Thanks to authors:<br>Ken Lyon, Global expert on logistics and transportation and Trace Labs advisor,<br><a href="https://medium.com/@jurij.skornik">Jurij Skornik</a>, Trace Labs’ General&nbsp;Manager</p><p>Well-oiled supply chains have always been the key enabler of successful international trade. We have seen a notable rise in their prominence and importance in the last few years, driven by a significant increase in consumer demand and events that exposed how fragile these business networks are, such as the Evergreen blockage of the Suez canal. Understanding the ins and outs of supply chains is critical to tackling such challenges through successful deployment of innovative technology, improving not only business outcomes, but also the sustainability of supply chains in the broadest sense. In this article we deep dive into the complexities of global supply chains, look at how state of the art technology such as OriginTrail can be a driver of change, and examine an industry example of a tech-driven initiative that recently closed down, TradeLens.</p> Supply chains as&nbsp;networks <p>Supply chains are, by definition, interconnected groups of organisations that have agreed to perform a series of tasks which usually results in the delivery of a product (or service) to a customer.</p><p>Over time supply chains have become extended, often span the globe, operate to a much faster tempo and are also significantly more fragile. The principal causes have been the growing consumer demand in industrialised nations and advances in technologies such as computers, communications and manufacturing. In response, many organisations, particularly logistics service providers, have transformed the scope and scale of their operations, such that the largest of them have established physical global networks operating continuously to collect and deliver “almost everything to pretty much anywhere”.</p><p>Supply chains are really networks rather than linear ‘chains’. As these complex webs of connectivity extend, some of the links become very fragile and prone to unexpected failures or disconnects. Because they are usually physical channels, the ‘unexpected’ will include weather events, political or social upheaval, or just basic equipment failures.</p>Network of supply&nbsp;chains<p>Establishing many of these networks has in some cases taken years of effort to establish the necessary levels of trust. But this approach conflicts with the demands for the agile and adaptable supply chains that can respond to unexpected events or challenges. It is true that the Internet has made it much easier to exchange data and collaborate with partners, but the necessary levels of trust are still reinforced through either personal relationships or third party services that struggle to operate at&nbsp;scale.</p> Global networks, global complexities <p>As an example, a small jewellery manufacturer will probably buy materials from companies they have known for a while. They will sell to customers either in a physical store, where the customer will pay for the products directly, or through an online platform where a third party payment system supported by a bank will confirm the transaction. This arrangement will continue to work well, providing there is not a significant step change in demand. In short, if the jeweller usually sells 50 items a week, and demand for a popular item suddenly jumps to 4,000 a week, it becomes impossible to fulfil within a reasonable timeframe without drastic changes in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>In contrast, a major automotive manufacturer has several supply chains that will operate across multiple geographies, with thousands of suppliers, including a handful of global component manufacturers, who each have their own constellations of suppliers and subcontractors, with some common to both. Like the previous example of the jeweller, the major relationships have been established over long periods of time and the value exchanges of information, money and material, are usually significant. There will also be a degree of churn and change at the edges as small suppliers fail, or stop providing the products required. These changes are usually handled within the existing (established) processes that are defined by the need to ‘trust’ any new party entering the&nbsp;network.</p><p>These processes are often cumbersome, inflexible and may not reveal any inherent weakness that could compromise the entire network in the future. They rely on a third party somewhere in the chain of command, to validate any new entrants before they can perform the services they are required to deliver. In a high velocity supply chain this can introduce problems further along the chain. In short, it is inefficient.</p><p>This requirement for validation by third parties can be a significant weak spot in diverse and extended supply chains. In 2011, extensive rainfall across south east Asia led to massive floods in Thailand. This stopped operations at a significant number of the worlds contract manufacturing plants specialising in disc drive production who were clustered in that area. Computer manufacturers scrambled to find alternative suppliers, but due to the requirement to validate new suppliers, it was easier to work with existing suppliers and have them boost output in other locations. This proved challenging, as it required the suppliers with functioning plants elsewhere to prioritise customers. Some 14,000 manufacturers were impacted and it took months to resolve, impacting delivery schedules, and forcing some out of business.</p><p>Furthermore, switching production to other locations required the establishment of new logistics pathways and working with new subcontractors, all of whom had to be validated and approved.</p><p>The issue wasn’t that the organisations involved did not have the capabilities to perform what was required. It was that they needed to be ‘validated’ so that they could be trusted by their partners in the network. This is where decentralised trust mechanisms, such as those illustrated by blockchains, are very valuable to extended supply chains with huge numbers of participant organisations. These decentralised networks use a consensus network of thousands of independent systems to ensure immutability and verifiable integrity of identities, transactions and computation. They can support massive scale and are robust and extremely difficult to compromise.</p> OriginTrail and knowledge assets <p>The OriginTrail Decentralised Knowledge Graph (DKG) was designed to exploit and advance these technologies to support the necessary flexibility and adaptability of critical global supply chains. It achieves that by bringing the complex, fragmented processes in global supply chains to a common denominator using a simple yet powerful building block — a knowledge asset. With the endless variety of possible scenarios in global supply chains, a knowledge asset is there to represent any single (small or large) part of it, whether that’s raw material, finished product, professional service, factory building, compliance certificate, quality claim or anything else you can think of. But even though they can be so incredibly diverse, they all share the same core characteristics:</p>  unique identity which can be pointed to using a Unique Asset Locator (UAL is derived the same way how URLs are created in the world wide&nbsp;web),  verifiable ownership ensuring chain of custody can be followed throughout the asset lifecycle,  knowledge asset graph of data combining all relevant claims about an asset with precise data permissioning capabilities from fully private claims, limited access or fully public&nbsp;claims.  An example of OriginTrail Decentralised Knowledge Graph (DKG) in the pharmaceutical supply&nbsp;chain.<p>Each of these characteristics ensures a powerful building block which we can use, almost like lego blocks, to recreate the fragmented reality that are modern supply chains. The most important part, however, is that all these assets aren’t created in data silos but rather issued on a global DKG where they are organised in a way that they can be discovered, verified and used. Because the DKG is not owned, controlled or run by any single entity (it is a permission-less network), it provides the ideal, neutral, common ground where each participant can own and control their assets and important business information while still be able to share it with anyone they wish to share it with. It is perhaps one of the most critical innovations for supply chain, as for once, interoperability of systems based on global standards is the fundamental starting point rather than an after-thought or even seen as something that is not desirable when service providers are pursuing vendor lock-ins.</p> De-siloing data for frictionless international trade <p>The enormous potential of OriginTrail’s DKG is that it can also address many of the challenges embedded within the regulatory structures that underpin the global trading system. Much of the inherent inertia that permeates global supply chains is due to the bureaucracy required to validate and authorise parties and contracts.</p><p>Governments and trade organisations are constantly trying to harmonise regulations and agree on common standards, but technology may now be able to reframe the essence of the debate with the advent of the DKG. With the collaboration of the BSI and others, OriginTrail has been able to demonstrate how the DKG can serve as a universal and immutable system of record for licences and credentials. These digital ‘assets’ of the organisation can now be referenced from anywhere by any relevant authority, thus avoiding unnecessary duplications of certifications, authorizations, inspection and audit&nbsp;reports.</p><p>This has huge implications as there is an enormous amount of cost and operational overheads in the duplication, sharing and managing the documentation necessary for legislative compliance across global supply chain operations. The Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN) is a clear example of how this can work in practice. There are currently 52 SCAN members that have audited some 22,000 factories across 80 countries for security and social responsibility compliance. This collaboration of SCAN members and a small number of audit firms now enables supplier audit reports to be shared with SCAN members removing the necessity for them to conduct their own&nbsp;audits.</p><p>The key element of this is that the approach ensures anonymity and confidentiality, so members do not see proprietary sourcing information, only the information confirming that the audit report confirmed compliance with the agreed standards. This avoids duplication of effort and cost and saves huge amounts of time when establishing new trading partner networks.</p><p>This initiative is growing and is helping the US CBP, CTPAT, and other Authorised Economic Operators (AEO) establish common security standards that can easily be referenced and checked in a secure manner. As more organisations are accredited with AEO status, the ability to record this accreditation on a secure, immutable platform such as the DKG will be immensely beneficial. It is this evolution of a recognized credential into a digital asset, immutably owned by the accredited party and capable of being instantly referenced from anywhere that is transformational.</p><p>As the SCAN example has shown, being able to reference existing accreditations in a fast, trusted and secure manner saves time and also reduces the operational costs when setting up new trading relationships.</p><p>But the real advantages of the DKG will be realised within organisations that are able to record their physical inventories as immutable digital assets on the DKG. Being able to trust inventory data across the supply chain is essential. Inaccurate and unverified inventory results in duplications, excess cost and often disappointed customers due to stock shortages.</p><p>As an example, when inventory items are moved, they may be recorded in a number of different systems. These systems frequently assign different identifiers to the inventory items, without corresponding links back to the original reference. This disconnect makes it harder to identify missing items or duplications. This can be expensive if the supply chains involve pharmaceuticals, or semiconductors.</p><p>For decades there has been a demand for a ‘Single version of the Truth’ when considering visibility systems. The track and trace systems of the global integrated carriers were the first to provide some kind of end to end view of a shipments progress. But as soon as it left their information domain (e.g. passed to another carrier), the information flow either broke down or was delayed. Across a global supply chain comprising multiple partners and a myriad of systems, these data update delays and disconnects illustrate that ensuring referential integrity is very difficult.</p><p>The advent of the DKG provides the opportunity to rethink supply chain visibility. If inventory items are represented as digital assets on the DKG there should be no need to keep recording them in different systems, merely refer back to the original digital asset and its attributes. As it physically moves through the supply chain as an order or shipment, each stage of the journey should reflect the ownership, status and chain of custody as a cluster of digital assets, immutably recorded on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>This is a very seductive and powerful proposition, as it implies a huge improvement in efficiency and reduction in errors and exceptions. This is because every participant will have access to the same information, certain in the knowledge that all of the participants are looking at the same data, albeit in their specific&nbsp;context.</p><p>Clearly, it will take time to achieve this as it is not a trivial exercise to transform existing stores of inventory data into digital assets. The performance of the underlying technology will also have to improve, but initiatives such as Version 6 of the DKG, the Network Operating System (nOS) enabler for enterprises, and Project Magnify are accelerating things.</p>Trace Labs’ Network Operating System&nbsp;(nOS)<p>Innovative companies and curious staff members in the horizon scanning and scenario planning functions of major corporations should explore what the OriginTrail and the Trace Alliance have been doing. As the world evolves from Web2 to a Web3 landscape, those organisations that understand and appreciate the power of Decentralised Knowledge Graphs will have the advantage.</p> TradeLens takeaways: Not less, but more decentralisation and interoperability <p>The importance of having a common infrastructure rooted in decentralisation, neutrality, and interoperability can be reinforced by examining one of the high-profile industry initiatives that has recently announced it is closing down, TradeLens. TradeLens was a joint effort of Maersk and IBM established in 2018 and was considered by many as one of the most promising ventures deploying blockchain technology in the shipping industry. But if that was the case, why did it fail, and how does OriginTrail DKG address the shortcomings that were the root causes of this&nbsp;failure?</p><p>There are a plethora of reasons that led to TradeLens’ demise, but below are some of the ones we consider the most important.</p><p>Low level of digitalization in the shipping industry. In a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-multi-billion-dollar-paper-jam-unlocking-trade-by-digitalizing-documentation">report</a> from October this year, McKinsey estimated that only around 1% of all Bill of Ladings (BLs) are digital today. Such low levels of digitalization present a significant barrier to industry-wide initiatives such as TradeLens. To help overcome that barrier, the Network Operating System (nOS) offers multiple avenues to help organisations create assets on OriginTrail DKG. This ranges from as easy as providing inputs via e-mail to more automated API data ingestion capabilities. Interoperability among multiple inputs is achieved thanks to supporting global data standards such as GS1 EPCIS and DSCA’s Electronic Bill of Lading (eBL), ensuring all created assets are interoperable. And there is a lot of potential in the digitalization of the shipping industry. In the same report mentioned above, McKinsey estimates that 100% adoption of the eBL would have an annual impact of around USD 50bn in the ocean trade ecosystem alone.</p><p>Lack of willingness to share data. It’s no surprise that industry players are reluctant to share sensitive business data, as questions around data privacy and ownership inevitably pop up. This is especially true when the underlying infrastructure is provided by a competitor, as was the case with TradeLens — Maersk being the largest shipping company globally. OriginTrail provides industry players with a way to transform their existing data into assets that are discoverable and verifiable on the DKG, but remain fully within their control and can be shared as needed, for example with customs authorities or other government agencies. This is important as assets (and data) need to be discoverable to be useful, but that should never happen at the expense of data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Level of decentralisation and neutrality. Closely tied to the previous point, the level of decentralisation and neutrality of TradeLens’ infrastructure was not sufficient to facilitate an industry-wide adoption. If any industry-wide initiative is to succeed, the infrastructure needs to ensure that all participants are on an equal footing and minimise the potential for vendor lock-ins. OriginTrail DKG provides this neutral, common ground as a permissionless, open-source infrastructure that is not owned, controlled, or run by any single&nbsp;entity.</p><p>Interoperability of data and infrastructures. Interoperability is crucial to successful industry-wide initiatives. And there are two facets of interoperability, the first being interoperability of data and the second being interoperability of infrastructure. The TradeLens experiment made it clear that more focus needs to be put on both facets, and that industry-wide permissioned blockchains don’t deliver the expected business value. OriginTrail tackles this interoperability challenge from both angles. Data interoperability is achieved by assets on OriginTrail utilising global data standards such as GS1 EPCIS and DSCA’s Electronic Bill of Lading (eBL). From an infrastructure point of view, OriginTrail is multichain by design, meaning a global graph backed by multiple permissionless blockchains (currently Polkadot, Ethereum, Gnosis, and Polygon), giving organisations full flexibility in terms of what infrastructure they want to&nbsp;use.</p><p>While we still have a long way to go, the digitalisation of global supply chains continues, and TradeLens provided valuable insights, as well as highlighted some of the core issues that need to be addressed moving forward. With the paradigm-changing shift from data to assets, OriginTrail can serve as one of the components that will help address those issues and facilitate the successful digital transformation of international trade.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing humanity’s most important knowledge assets.

<p>Yahoo! JAPAN, KDDI and NTT DOCOMO have adopted or committed to passkeys</p>



<p>TOKYO, December 9, 2022 – Global, industry-wide commitment is bringing the passwordless future closer to reality, FIDO Alliance members shared today at the first in-person FIDO seminar in Japan since December 2019. During the seminar, leading organizations shared major updates that will further the Alliance’s mission to replace passwords with simpler and stronger authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A significant milestone came last May when <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">Apple, Google and Microsoft announced plans to expand support for FIDO</a> with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, a phishing-resistant replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. Passkeys can be leveraged across devices and platforms to offer an end-to-end passwordless sign-in option, or bound to a particular device such as a FIDO security key for high-assurance use cases. Passkeys are supported today in iOS 16, macOS Ventura, Android and ChromeOS, with Windows coming soon.</p>



<p>Notably, global service providers such as <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2022-10-24-PayPal-Introduces-More-Secure-Payments-with-Passkeys#:~:text=Passkeys%20are%20a%20new%20industry,is%20no%20shared%20passkey%20data">PayPal</a> have expanded their FIDO support and are offering passkey sign-ins, while early FIDO adopters in Japan have announced passkey commitments or adoption as their next steps towards passwordless:</p>



 
 Yahoo! JAPAN has been working on passwordless initiatives with FIDO since 2015, and more than 38 million active users in 2022 are signing in without passwords. Yahoo! JAPAN now supports passkeys iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. 



 KDDI has <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/deploying-fido-in-japan-an-interview-with-kddi/">first launched FIDO in 2020</a> for its au ID platform with more than 30 million customers. Now au ID is accessible with passkeys on iOS and FIDO2 on Android.&nbsp; 



 NTT DOCOMO has been a leader both within and outside FIDO Alliance beginning with its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-welcomes-ntt-docomo-to-board/">Board appointment in 2015</a> and is the first mobile operator to deploy FIDO authentication at scale. DOCOMO has announced its intention to support passkeys for its more than 50 million of d ACCOUNT users beginning in early 2023.&nbsp; 
 



<p>“From the very beginning of the FIDO Alliance, Japan has been a global hub of innovation, support and deployments of FIDO authentication. It is not a surprise that several leading organizations in the region will be some of the first globally to offer their customers FIDO sign-ins with passkeys,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “This is illustrative of our global membership’s commitment to the passwordless future, and their collaboration to maximize the reach, usability and security of FIDO authentication.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within the FIDO Alliance’s 250+ members, 58 actively take part in the FIDO Japan Working Group, now beginning its 7th year working together to spread awareness and adoption of FIDO in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="http://www.fidoalliance.org">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>



<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is an increasingly critical and difficult area for IT devices that need to be secured.</p>


 
 


<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: The FIDO Fit in IoT held on Dec. 7, a series of experts outlined FIDO Alliance efforts to help device manufacturers and developers better secure IoT. A key theme of the event was all about understanding how the FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO) specifications can help improve IoT security.</p>



<p>David Turner, director of standards development at FIDO Alliance, kicked off the event by noting that passwords remain a large problem across the IT industry. The challenge of passwords is compounded with IoT devices, which scale into the millions and potentially billions of devices. Challenges with passwords for IoT include password re-use, which can be a huge problem with IoT. If a system ships with a default password, it can be trivially easy for attackers to exploit.</p>



<p>“Hackers don’t break into IoT, they log into it,” Turner said.</p>



<p>One way to help secure IoT is with the FIDO Alliance’s FDO standard. Turner explained that FDO is an open standard that allows organizations to quickly and securely onboard IoT devices.</p>



<p>Small things, big impact: The path to FDO</p>


 
 


<p>Rolf Lindemann, director of product at Nok Nok and one of the leaders of the FIDO Alliance IoT Technical Working Group, explained that FIDO authentication standards are applicable to users as well as device authentication.</p>



<p>Lindermann said that there is a clear need to have a strong foundation to help secure IoT. The first step is to have hardened hardware elements at the CPU level including things like TPMs, TrustZone and SGX which are provided by the silicon vendors. The next critical step is to add device level attestation to help with supply chain integrity that also helps to reduce the complexity for device onboarding. The third step is to have strong authentication, that ensures only legitimate entries get access.</p>



<p>“To make the IoT ecosystem more secure, you need strong authentication that’s the front door providing fishing resistance and being still practical for daily large scale use,” Lindermann said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How FDO tackles the onboarding challenge</p>



<p>The challenge of onboarding is where the FDO specifications come into play.</p>


 
 


<p>Richard Kerslake, general manager of industrial controls and robotics, IoT business unit at Intel, explained that onboarding is the process by which a device can establish a trusted connection with a service or platform.</p>



<p>“We have an IoT device, it’s going to connect to a platform or service and we just need to be sure that everyone in that equation is who they say they are,” Kerslake explained. “Is the device talking to the platform that it thinks it is talking to, and is the platform talking to the device that it thinks it is talking to. So we really need to make sure that both sides of that equation are true.”</p>



<p>Onboarding today is often a very manual process. The promise of FDO is an automated approach that benefits from strong authentication. Kerslake explained that in December 2019 the decision was made to base the FDO specification on Intel’s Secure Device Onboard technology. The FDO 1.0 specification was released in March 2021 and updated to version 1.1 in April 2022.</p>



<p>Going a step further beyond just the specifications FIDO has worked with the Linux Foundation’s LF Edge project which has an <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/securedeviceonboard/">open source implementation of FDO</a>.</p>



<p>Going for a deep dive with FDO</p>



<p>There is a fair amount of nuance and details that go into the FDO specification.</p>


 
 


<p>In a deep dive session, Geoffrey Cooper, principal engineer, IoTG at Intel, explained the workflow, technical specification and procedures that enable FDO implementations.</p>



<p>Cooper explained that for example if a device is drop-shipped to a location and the device gets powered up and connected to the network, the goal with FDO is to enable that device to figure out who it’s supposed to connect to with proper authentication, sets everything up, and then it goes right into service.</p>



<p>“The idea is we’re taking something that was a very heavy touch kind of operation that we’re turning it into a zero touch operation,” Cooper said.</p>



<p>Enabling that zero-touch approach with FDO involves a series of protocols that are part of the specification. The protocols include device initialization and onboarding components. There is also a concept known as the FDO Service Info Module (FSIM) that provides an extension mechanism to help support devices.</p>


 
 


 



<p>During a robust Q&amp;A session during the Authenticate virtual event, attendees asked a wide variety of questions.</p>



<p>Among the questions was one about what’s needed to help spur adoption for FDO.&nbsp; Kerslake said there are companies today in different industry verticals including the energy sector, where operators are saying they will not proceed with bringing in new devices without an automated secure onboarding solution.</p>


 
 


<p>There are also a growing number of industry solutions that support FDO. Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at the FIDO Alliance, said that by developing FDO in an industry standards body there are lots of opportunities for collaboration and promotion as well.</p>



<p>“We are in the midst of creating an implementer showcase, which should be live on the website soon,” Shamas said.</p>



<p>The path toward FDO certification</p>


 
 


<p>Looking beyond just the FDO specification there is also a need for certification, which is something the FIDO Alliance is now working on.</p>



<p>Paul Heim, director of certification at FIDO Alliance, said that&nbsp; product certification ensures standardization and interoperability of products within an industry. He added that one of the most important factors about certification is that it helps to ensure consumer enterprise, and industrial protection. The lifecycle for FDO certification includes both functional and security certification.</p>



<p>“The FIDO device onboard certification program is intended to certify IoT devices and onboarding services certification that will be available for both FIDO members, and non-members,” Heim said.</p>



<p>The certification effort is still in development with a program launch set for the first quarter of 2023.</p>

 Energy Web RPC nodes on AWS Marketplace is the first step towards Energy Web as-a-service <p>Zug, Switzerland — December 8, 2022 — This year, Energy Web’s technology roadmap focused on achieving one objective: making it easier for enterprises to use <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/why-we-exist/">Web 3 technology to create real business value</a> in support of the global energy transition. A key pillar of this strategy is to dramatically <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=ceea861f-8fff-4307-8bc7-659637b29e5d">streamline the way companies access EW solutions</a> by offering them as-a-service.</p><p>Today we’re excited to announce the initial step in this journey with the release of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=ceea861f-8fff-4307-8bc7-659637b29e5d">Energy Web RPC nodes in the AWS Marketplace</a>. For the first time, companies can now configure and deploy a component of the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/how-we-work/#section-1117-8306">Energy Web Decentralized Operating System</a> with the push of a button. Over the coming months we will expand these offerings to include additional components and public cloud marketplaces.</p> Why we’re offering EWC technology in cloud marketplaces <p>There’s an adage in the business world that to be successful you need to meet your customers where they are. There are lots of ways to interpret this, but ultimately it boils down to delivering a product or service in a way that aligns with customers’ existing practices and habits. In the context of enterprise software, historically this has been a weakness of Web3 solutions, including Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>Today nearly every category of enterprise software — from marketing to resource planning, HR management to project management, and teleconferencing to file sharing — is dominated by “Software-as-a-Service” (SaaS) solutions that are offered via subscription models. With few exceptions, gone are the days where large companies roll out complex business applications don’t need any specialized skills or dedicated technical resources in order to adopt a new system; rather, with just a couple of clicks they can launch and customize their solution, and it just&nbsp;works.</p><p>In contrast, up until recently implementing an Energy Web solution required a team of developers to provision a dedicated hosting environment prior to creating a bespoke deployment pipeline to configure, install, and integrate multiple discrete components downloaded from public Github repositories. Even with <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/how-tos-and-tutorials/testnet-and-mainnet">robust supporting documentation and tutorials</a>, that’s a tall ask for companies with mature engineering departments. For companies with more limited IT resources, this approach is simply a nonstarter.</p><p>Public cloud marketplaces can significantly reduce this friction by automating and abstracting all of the deployment steps, and delivering a clean user interface to configure and administer EW solutions. Beyond the technical benefits, the marketplace approach also simplifies procurement by consolidating costs under an existing cloud account. Just as popular mobile app stores radically simplified distribution of consumer applications, public cloud marketplaces can act as a springboard for driving widespread adoption of enterprise software.</p><p>At Energy Web, we view cloud marketplaces as a critical channel for scaling our impact in 2023 and&nbsp;beyond.</p><blockquote>“The business value of Energy Web solutions is clear, but when it comes to implementation we need to deliver the user experience that enterprises have come to expect” said Energy Web CTO, Mani Hagh Sefat. “With SaaS, things that used to take lots of time and effort can now be done with the click of a button. By offering EW solutions in cloud marketplaces, we can enable any business user to start using our technology and getting value from it right&nbsp;away.”</blockquote> What’s currently available? <p>RPC nodes, with support for the high-performance Nethermind client (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-cb37zifmdfcec?sr=0-3&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">EWC main net</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-c26a4lcsltmdm?sr=0-4&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">Volta test net</a>) and legacy OpenEthereum client (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-w5fqsiqd6jc5s?sr=0-2&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">EWC main net</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-7n2n5v7kx726m?sr=0-1&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">Volta test net</a>), are the first EW service being offered in the AWS Marketplace. RPC nodes act as a gateway to connect to a blockchain, and are required for any application that reads data from or initiates transactions on the EWC (and Volta test network). Prior to the AWS Marketplace offering, the only options for connecting to the EWC were to <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/how-tos-and-tutorials/connect-to-energy-web-chain-main-network-with-metamash">subscribe to a public RPC node</a> (which is rate limited and not suited for enterprise workloads) or to <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/how-tos-and-tutorials/running-a-local-node">use the command line to run a dedicated private node</a> (which is technically complex).</p><p>With RPC nodes now available in AWS Marketplace, developers and enterprises can easily deploy their own dedicated nodes to enable programmatic and high-volume interactions with the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p>How it started: “quickstart” instructions for EW&nbsp;RPCHow it’s going: EW RPC in AWS Marketplace<blockquote>The Nethermind team has long collaborated with Energy Web to provide smooth, reliable, performant solutions for running EWC nodes. We look forward to seeing enterprises enjoy this improvement to quick node deployment and welcome any opportunities to build solutions for clean and distributed energy resources together. — Tomasz Stańczak, CEO</blockquote> What’s next? <p>Long-term, our vision is to deliver all EW Solutions (and individual EW-DOS components) via a fully self-sovereign solution-as-a-service offering that delivers the simplified user experience of public cloud marketplaces with the flexibility and customization features of existing self-hosted models. In this offering, customers will have the ability to deploy EW solutions in multiple public clouds and/or their own environments.</p><p>In the near term, we will expand public cloud marketplace offerings (both increasing the number of EW services available, such as Data Exchange and Green Proofs solutions, and adding more cloud providers, such as Azure and Google Cloud) in Q1 — Q2&nbsp;2023.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.

<p>By Christina Hulka, executive director and COO of the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication has reached broad support across the web – all major operating systems, browsers and billions of devices support FIDO Authentication today. Having reached such a milestone and the resulting FIDO roll outs from a broad array of service providers, the FIDO Alliance is increasingly focused on ways to make FIDO Authentication more usable and accessible for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In achieving FIDO Alliance’s mission of more secure and password-free authentication, we must ensure that we meet the needs and preferences of people with disabilities. Today, we are pleased to announce the publication of “Guidance for Making FIDO Deployments Accessible to Users with Disabilities,” to provide guidance on planning FIDO deployments that are accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities. It also aims to help hardware manufacturers identify opportunities to deliver more accessible external authenticators.</p>



<p>An estimated 15% of the world’s population lives with some sort of disability today, and in many countries, laws prohibit discrimination to help ensure that these people can fully and equally participate in every aspect of society. Authentication is an important component of the ability to participate, as it provides digital access to many aspects of society including (but not limited to) education, employment, and entertainment. While legacy forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA) like SMS or email codes are technically “accessible,” they often require advanced skill, knowledge and/or assistive technology to enter the codes. FIDO, with its stronger and simpler authentication model, is well positioned to provide accessible authentication, as it supports a wide range of options that accommodate vastly diverse needs. The paper released today details why, and considerations for, deploying FIDO with the needs of people with disabilities in mind. We strongly encourage service providers to reference these guidelines in planning their FIDO deployments.</p>



<p>Much work and collaboration went into this paper. We would like to thank Yao Ming of Meta for his extensive work as lead author on this paper. We’d also like to thank Joyce Oshita of VMware for her contributions, including providing her own experiences leveraging various authentication methods, including FIDO, as a person who has lost her eyesight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the white paper, Yao and Joyce will be joining us on December 15, 2022 at 2pm ET for a webinar to discuss their perspectives on this topic. To attend the webinar, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/webinar-making-fido-deployments-accessible-to-users-with-disabilities/">register here</a>.</p>



<p>The paper is available <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-guidance-for-making-fido-deployments-accessible-to-users-with-disabilities/">here</a>; feedback is always appreciated – please drop a line at <a href="mailto:info@fidoalliance.org">info@fidoalliance.org</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Answering the question: “Are we maturing?” cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>We’ve done a lot of thinking about how a Community of Practice (CoP) matures and have written <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/we-are-thankful-for-keep-badges-weird-8b5c3bd6a895">a variety of posts</a> on tools we use to grow healthy, sustainable communities. This post looks at how you might use data to prove that your CoP is maturing.</p><p>After a year since the launch of the KBW community, we wanted to know if the good vibes of the community were all in our minds or indeed backed up by data. We looked at how community members engaged with each other and the community of practice as a whole. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S4Is3Pg1ttXAUKOJvyLvKB5g29beVd1FOKBXpQ4pYAI/edit#slide=id.g14ce548e3e4_0_191">See the full output in slide&nbsp;form</a>.</p><p>We are analysing this data to have a look at how the community is progressing through growth, activity, and sense of community. Are we maturing? Let’s find&nbsp;out!</p><p>For a more complete walkthrough of the data we’ve collected, <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/080e5da9106243ba92871be40b5e8e2c">here is a video</a> (transcript included!).</p> Why you want to look at&nbsp;data <p>It’s awesome that you might feel that your community is healthy, but likely the community ambitions extend beyond being a friendly and inclusive place. As a community of practice evolves, you likely have specific goals, outcomes and activities you’re promoting.</p><p>To judge whether or not you are achieving these goals, you will want to look at how the community changes over time. We do this with data! Start by setting some baselines to measure against. With a data-driven approach, we can more accurately observe how a community is having&nbsp;impact.</p> Methodology and types of&nbsp;metrics Our three buckets of&nbsp;data<p>You’ll want to set a couple of different kinds of metrics, both qualitative and quantitative. You’ll want to look at how people engaged, how people were recognised and gather insights from the community members themselves. Your first step is to think about what you want to&nbsp;know.</p> 1. Individual Engagement <p>Individual engagement is a way to look at how community members are interacting with one another and the community more broadly. Typically, you will want to look at things&nbsp;like:</p>  Did people introduce themselves?  Did people made a contribution to or start a discussion?  Did they join an event, either online or in real&nbsp;life?  Did they sign up to courses or seminars on&nbsp;offer?  What other signup or attendance rates can you&nbsp;collect?  46% of our sample was actively&nbsp;engaged<p>Depending on the size of your community and the data capabilities of the platform(s) you’re using, you may need to come up with a sampling technique. Sampling allows you to select a fair and impartial subset of your community members to set engagement baselines.</p><p>The sampling technique we used for the KBW community was to select every 5th member who joined the community (listed by date). This technique allowed us to look at approximately 20% of the entire community, a decent sized&nbsp;sample.</p> 2. Community Metrics <p>Many platforms have data capabilities of some kind. You might be able to look&nbsp;at:</p>  the total number of posts per&nbsp;month  the total number of active&nbsp;members  the total number of new discussions.  <p>Setting baselines for posting activities can help you determine if the community is becoming more&nbsp;engaged.</p>41% of the KBW community earned at least one&nbsp;badge<p>The KBW community issues a variety of badges to recognise engagement and to encourage pro-social behaviours. With our community metrics, we were able to see how many badges were earned and what the most popular badges were. We found that 41% of the community earned at least one badge! Community members can earn badges that are discussed and displayed in the community as well as <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wtf-are-stealth-badges-41130a75a1a9">stealth badges</a>. There are badges related to specific activities as well, such as Badge Wiki badges for people who contribute to the community’s knowledge base.</p><p>Looking at these metrics over the course of a year can help you determine ebbs and flows of activity. They can also help you see what kinds of content led to the most engagement.</p> 3. Surveys <p>The third thing you should look at is what community members think and feel. Create an end of year survey focused on the key factors you’d like to know&nbsp;about.</p>  How do you want community members to&nbsp;feel?  What kind of ambitions for the community do you hope people&nbsp;have?  How do community members want to improve the community’s offerings?  we asked people how they felt about the KBW community<p>For the KBW Birthday Survey, we used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale">Likert Scale</a> and a subset of questions from McMillan and Chavis’s 1986 paper Psychological Sense of Community. We wanted to know if people felt like they belonged, if they identified with the values of the community and if their needs were being met. We also wanted to see if they thought the community had influence and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>The best part of surveying actual community members is the things they write in, so be sure and provide open text fields. People offer kudos as well as constructive criticism, so you’re sure to learn a lot about your community.</p> What’s next <p>Once you’ve collected and analysed your data, share it with your community! Other members of the community will have their own insights and ideas to make your community of practice even&nbsp;better.</p><p>We recommend putting on some music and diving into your community data. It’s easy to get excited about the things you learn because your data-driven insights can propel you, collectively, forward towards your&nbsp;goals.</p><p>Join us in <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">the KBW community</a> and learn more about communities of practice and all things&nbsp;badges</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-gather-data-on-a-community-of-practice-881af2846d0d">How to Gather Data on a Community of Practice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When we look at the state of defending human rights today, it is clear that digital technologies play a role – both as a creator of risk and harm and, potentially, as a tool to protect rights and strengthen the work of rights defenders. However, this was not always as clear, and even today, it can be difficult to understand how digital technologies magnify existing harms, introduce new dynamics, and can be used by advocates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning from what others have tried –&nbsp;what has worked and what hasn’t – is important in this space. As such, we were honoured to work with <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/tech/" title="">Amnesty Tech</a> on a pair of case studies looking back at how Amnesty International has woven a critical understanding of technology into their human rights defence work. We conducted desk research and interviews with Amnesty Tech in 2020, and developed the case studies we’re sharing today. Despite the time that has passed, the learnings continue to be relevant for exploring questions like:</p>



 
 How can we weave a deeper understanding of tech into human rights programme work? What impact will that have on our work? 



 What does it take to shift internal ways of working? 



 What are ways to approach digital threats and risk management? 
 



<p>In the first case study <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/TheJourneyOfAmnestyTech_Public.pdf" title="">The journey of Amnesty Tech: How a large organisation integrated technology into human rights work</a>, we look at how Amnesty Tech came to be –&nbsp;the advocates, resources and successes that led to Amnesty Tech becoming an integral part of the broader organisation’s human rights work.</p>



<p>In the second, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AmnestyTechEmpowerement.pdf" title="">Amnesty Tech Empowerment: Transforming digital security support for human rights defenders</a>, we see how Amnesty’s deep knowledge of human rights defenders and their needs around risk management and protection shaped their approach to rising digital threats.</p>

<p></p>     <p>All Smart City services are delivered through technology platforms. From a technology perspective, a global trend is clearly underway — namely, the progressive integration of all services into technology platforms. Of the wide range of platforms in the global digital marketplace, the mobility platform boasts the most complex technology. The mobility platform provides the foundational technology layer for integrating all user-centered services, thus becoming the hub of service delivery.</p>
          <p>Challenges of the Smart City Digital Ecosystem</p>
<p>Today’s great challenge for Smart Cities is developing a “meta-platform” capable of integrating IoT devices, connectivity, data, and apps providing core and value-added services. Around the world, integration is emerging as a new paradigm not only in technology but in business and governance; and interoperability must become a standardized practice in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Achieving full interoperability is therefore critical to overcoming fragmentation among several functional areas (Smart Governance, Smart Education, Smart Energy, Smart Infrastructure, Smart Mobility, Smart Healthcare, Smart Buildings, Smart Technology, and others) in the global Smart City market. Interoperability requires open and shared standards.</p>
                      <p>Energy Insurance</p>
<p>The insurance sector plays a key role in climate adaptation and building climate resilience through promoting climate mitigation and incentivizing green behaviors. This can range from asset management and underwriting to supporting clean technologies and climate-friendly operational changes.</p>
<p>Current global climate and environmental emergencies are pushing regulatory frameworks, business models, and marketing toward standardizing units of measurement. In this global framework, the carbon footprint is emerging as the standard global unit of measurement for a net-zero society.</p>
<p>Carbon footprint measurement is beginning to appear in companies’ reports on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities. This data may also be required for B Corp, ISO, and GHG certifications, eco-labeling, participation in carbon markets, and carbon tax calculations.</p>
                      <p>MOVENS and wefox</p>
<p>One global leader bringing the insurance industry into the digital age is German-based insurtech firm wefox, which developed a new approach to revolutionizing insurance, focused on consumer empowerment and prioritizing solutions for secure data-driven experiences. wefox has developed an insurance platform that leverages data from energy consumption to determine what appliances are in use, enabling innovative and precise coverage for users.</p>
<p>wefox adopted MOVENS technology developed by Henshin Group. MOVENS is a cloud-agnostic IoT platform designed to be the Integration Hub for the Smart City, connecting all layers and related entities involved in the Smart City ecosystem.</p>
<p>The microservice architecture of the wefox platform can cover not only households but also small and medium-sized enterprises and offices by processing the infinite streams of data from MOVENS.</p>
<p>In fact, by reading data and energy curves from machinery and household appliances, wefox can design insurance coverages that cover these risks and any possible damages. This can ultimately help companies avoid breakdowns and business interruptions in addition to helping families keep their disposable income. In addition, to encourage the adoption of environmentally friendly practices, wefox offers insurance coverages that reward sustainable behaviors. More specifically, by collecting data that show evidence of sustainable driving behavior, wefox can offer rewards and incentives in collaboration with other partners to promote risk-averse behaviors and foster loyalty among customers. This, in turn, can result in lower premiums and higher cost savings.</p>
                      <p>Henshin and MOBI</p>
<p>MOVENS platform is evolving according to the global standards set by MOBI. Its high-level microservice abstraction architecture enables the integration of all layers involved in the Smart City ecosystem and encourages the implementation of cutting-edge technology for each layer. The platform thus provides the foundational technology layer for integrating all user-centered services.</p>
<p>MOVENS technology currently includes verticals in the Mobility, Energy, and Insurance sectors. The platform speeds up value creation through an open innovation model, supporting the energy transition.</p>
<p>Henshin joined MOBI for a simple reason: to be part of the global innovation ecosystem and to have the chance to collaborate with other valuable members and their breakthrough technologies. Collaboration is key to driving persistent innovation and accelerating the evolution of the MOVENS platform as the technological infrastructure for the implementation of Smart City initiatives, starting with the integration between mobility and energy sectors.</p>
<p>Henshin is a member of the <a>DRIVES Program</a> and has contributed to the release of two recent standards: the <a>Battery SOH (State of Health) Standard</a> and <a>Rechargeable Battery Identification Number (BIN)</a>.</p>

     Belgian association mobile app uses GDSN to give consumers information about the food they buy 

     
   
 
  
    
       
      
 
             06 December 2022 
     

     
   
 
  
    
       
      
 
              Belgian consumers who want to know more information about food items beyond what fits on the label can now turn to an app that uses product data provided by brand owners. 

 
 
<p>Non-profit organisation Aktina offers a free web and smartphone app designed to help Belgian consumers understand the information on food labels.<br>
The app—called BATRA for BArcode TRAnslator—allows shoppers to decipher a food product label in the blink of an eye, simply by scanning the barcode on the product. It’s part of Aktina’s work to promote healthy behaviours and sustainable mindsets.</p>

 <a href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/gs1_gdsn_success_story_aktina.pdf">Read the case study </a> 
 

  
 
 
     

     
   

         
                                                                                                                                                                                              
   

    
   
    
                         
           
  
    
       
      
 
              Thanks to GS1 GDSN, shoppers access data straight from the source 

<p>The information provided by BATRA is drawn from product data made available by brand owners themselves, because it draws upon the product data in My Product Manager, the GS1 GDSN-Certified Data Pool of <a href="https://www.gs1belu.org/en/gs1-global-data-synchronisation-network-gs1-gdsn" title="GS1 Belgilux GDSN">GS1 Belgilux</a>.</p>

<p>The Aktina BATRA app helps consumers better understand the terms, ratings and graphics on food labels, so they can shop thoughtfully and with confidence.</p>

 Data enables helpful notifications for consumers 

<p>BATRA also allows users to create personalised settings and notifications. For example, consumers can request to be alerted if a product contains a certain allergen. They can also ask to be informed if the AFSCA, Belgium’s Federal Agency for Food Chain Safety, has issued a recall on a product being scanned – or even a product the user has scanned at some point in the past.</p>

 GDSN helps create a direct link between consumers and suppliers

 The open-source Data Privacy Capability Model is a step-by-step guide to designing, running, and evaluating a strong data privacy program for any organization. 



<p>PHOENIX, ARIZONA, UNITED STATES, December 5, 2022 /<a href="http://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oceg.org/">OCEG</a>&nbsp;is pleased to announce the release of the new Integrated Data Privacy Capability Model (IDPM) and associated certification for Integrated Data Privacy Professionals. Together with a global review committee of privacy experts and the input of Singapore-based OCEG training partner, Straits Interactive, we have developed an open-source capability model that offers a detailed step-by-step guide to designing, running, and evaluating a strong data privacy program for any organization.</p>



<p>Carole Switzer, OCEG Co-Founder, and President notes, “Unlike other available resources and certifications, which generally outline the requirements of various data privacy regulations and tell you what you need to comply with, through this Capability Model we are seeking to help you understand how to meet those needs. Following the structure of our respected GRC Capability Model, we walk you through every stage of identifying relevant requirements for your organization, keeping track of where and how you are collecting and processing personal information, and ensuring that your data privacy program is transparent and auditable.”</p>



<p>The Capability Model is a free, open-source resource that anyone may download directly from the OCEG site.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to offer this important certification as an addition to our GRC Professional and GRC Audit certifications,” says OCEG Founder and Chair, Scott Mitchell, “and to include it at no additional cost for anyone who holds an OCEG All Access Pass. The AAP provides access to our premium resources and all our certification exams at one low cost, which ensures that every organization can have skilled and credentialed teams to address these critical needs.”</p>



<p>Said Kevin Shepherdson, CEO, Straits Interactive, “This Model, which we are honored to have authored with OCEG, offers something that has been missing in the information market for data privacy, that is, looking at privacy from an integrated governance, risk management and compliance perspective. The certification demonstrates an individual’s knowledge of how to build, run and assess an effective and agile data privacy program. As data privacy management becomes more challenging, it would be in every organization’s interest to ensure that its data privacy team and every manager of units with data privacy responsibilities, follow the model and obtain this valuable certification.”</p>



<p>Integrated Data Privacy Capability Model vs Other Privacy Certifications<br>The Integrated Data Privacy Capability Model provides a roadmap for both GRC and privacy professionals. Those with specialized privacy certifications can now broaden their expertise into GRC as data privacy involves governing personal data, managing risks relating to personal data as well as complying with data privacy laws and regulations.</p>



<p>As for those who have the GRCP certification, this provides a roadmap for GRC professionals to cover data privacy which has become a big focus due to the General Data Protection Regulation and the introduction of many new data privacy laws around the world. By achieving the certification in the Integrated Data Privacy Capability Model, they have the option to then specialize in the area of data privacy and take on additional privacy certification qualifications.</p>



<p>Testimonials from Testers<br>Testimonials from those who recently took the training have been encouraging and are shared here:<br>“The course has a definitive guide for Data Protection Officers who are looking towards being operationally ready. What I learned the most would be the specific steps in preparing a robust data protection management program.”</p>



<p>“Relevant to my consulting practice going forward [the Model] provides a more detailed framework to advise clients on how to set up their privacy management plan.”</p>



<p>“The ‘learn and align’[component structure] provides a good way to frame the settings for our consulting with the management to align with their business objectives and enroll support.”</p>



<p>“The training provides in detail the steps required to set up a data privacy program (right from the start).”</p>



<p>“The training is very useful, how we combine data privacy knowledge and GRC perspective.”</p>



<p>“Found it useful to have understood the privacy framework in the larger context of GRC.”</p>

<p>Create Ceramic App is a new way to create an app using Ceramic, much like Create React App or Create Next App. We built Create Ceramic App to ensure that you know all the parts and packages that go into using our decentralized network—from interacting with data to using a Web3 wallet for user authentication.</p><p>Before you get started with Create Ceramic App we recommend that you read some of our documentation—it clarifies the terms that we’ll use throughout this post. Create Ceramic App will handle the implementation, but reading about <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.3.x/api/classes/devtools.Composite#frommodels">Composites</a>, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/glossary/#dids">DIDs</a>, and other important concepts will help you understand how Ceramic works.</p>     0:00 / 1×    Getting Started <p>Get started with Create Ceramic App by running <code>npx @ceramicnetwork/create-ceramic-app clone</code> . You will encounter a series of prompts, after running the command, that we will explain in a later section.</p> Provided Templates  DID-DataStore <p>This template is a simple implementation of our DID-DataStore package using NextJS and DID Sessions (<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/accounts-evolution-of-3id/">a successor to 3ID Connect</a>). This template will interact with the published BasicProfile DataModel on the Clay Testnet.</p> ComposeDB [Developer Preview] <p>Using a locally created <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.3.x/guides/creating-composites/schema">Composite</a>, which is similar to the BasicProfile DataModel, you can create data for any DIDs that you control. This template also provides access to this data through either the provided ComposeClient or through GraphiQL. This template also provides scripts to handle deploying and updating your Composite and will dynamically run all dependencies that the application requires.</p> Creating App <p>After running <code>npx @ceramicnetwork/create-ceramic-app clone</code> you’ll encounter a simple CLI where you can fill in the project name and choose your template. We’ll just call it ‘sample’ for now.</p><p>We provided templates for DID-DataStore and for the Developer Preview of ComposeDB, both templates have a similar structure so you can focus on the specifics of the two different libraries. We’ll go into details on the differences in the next section.</p><p>Below you’ll find the output of selecting the DID-DataStore template. This template does not cover any DataModel creation and does not create a configuration file, so there’s nothing to note.</p><p>Our ComposeDB template does include creating a Composite (if you’re familiar with DID-DataStore this is roughly equivalent to a DataModel); because of this, we need to have a configuration file generated that contains an Admin DID (here we use a Key DID), this Admin DID is critical for interacting with Ceramic’s restricted admin APIs. The image below shows the three major steps we take to set up your project.</p>  We clone the GitHub Repository that hosts our projects  We generate our Admin DID and its seed  We generate our configuration file with the Admin DID included so your new project can have indexing enabled from the first time you start coding  <p>When we selected the ComposeDB template we also created a new Key DID to authenticate our Composite, as well as a configuration file to allow indexing of our newly-created Composite. The configuration file is saved as <code>composedb.config.json</code> and the seed for the newly generated Key DID is saved as <code>admin_seed.txt</code>. Neither of these files should be included in your version control and both have been explicitly mentioned in the provided <code>.gitignore</code>.</p> Starting the Application <p>Regardless of the template that you use, starting the application is the same. Just use the command <code>npm run dev</code> in your directory like you would with a NextJS application.</p> Idea for a feature? Need more documentation? <p>Please post any feedback on the Create Ceramic App to our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Forum</a>, we'd love to hear from you and discover more about what you're building. If you want to learn and develop more with ComposeDB we recommend checking out <a href="https://composedb.js.org/">the latest docs</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.goldmoney.com/research/the-upside-down-world-of-currency">Authored by Alasdair Macleod via GoldMoney.com,</a></p>



<p>The gap between fiat currency values and that of legal money, which is gold, has widened so that dollars retain only 2% of their pre-1970s value, and for sterling it is as little as 1%. Yet it is commonly averred that currency is money, and gold is irrelevant.</p>



<p>As the product of statist propaganda, this is incorrect. Originally established in Roman law, legally gold is still money and the states’ debauched currencies are not — only a form of credit. As I demonstrate in this article, the major western central banks will be forced to embark on a new round of currency debasement, likely to put an end to the matter.</p>



<p>Central to my thesis is that commercial bank credit will contract sharply in response to rising interest rates and bond yields.&nbsp;This retrenchment is already ending the everything bubble in financial asset values, is beginning to undermine GDP, and given record levels of balance sheet leverage makes a major banking crisis virtually impossible to avoid. Central banks which are already in a parlous state of their own will be tasked with underwriting the entire credit system.</p>



<p>In discharging their responsibilities to the status quo, central banks will end up destroying their own currencies.</p>



<p>So, why do we persist in pricing everything in failing currencies, when that will almost certainly change?</p>



<p>When the difference between legal money and declining currencies is finally realised, the public will discard currencies entirely reverting to legal money. That time is being brought forward rapidly by current events.&nbsp;</p>







 <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/istockphoto-1285637350-612x612.jpg?itok=ZwuIlLzB"></a>Why do we impart value to currency and not money? 



<p>A question that is not satisfactorily answered today is why is it that an unbacked fiat currency has value as a medium of exchange. Some say that it reflects faith in and the credit standing of the issuer. Others say that by requiring a nation’s subjects to pay taxes and to account for them guarantees its demand. But these replies ignore the consequences of its massive expansion while the state pretends it to be real money. Sometimes, the consequences can seem benign and at others catastrophic. As explanations for the public’s tolerance of repeated failures of currencies, these answers are insufficient.</p>



<p>Let us do a thought experiment to highlight the depth of the problem. We know that over millennia, metallic metals, particularly gold, silver, and copper came to be used as media of exchange. And we also know that the use of their value was broadened through credit in the form of banknotes and bank deposits. The relationships between legal money, that is gold, silver, or copper and credit in its various forms were defined in Roman law in the sixth century. And we also know that this system of money and credit with the value of credit tied to that of money, despite some ups and downs, has served humanity well ever since.</p>



<p>Now let us assume that in the absence of metallic money, in the dawn of economic time a ruler instructed his subjects to use a new currency which he and only he will issue for the public’s use. This would surely be seen as a benefit to everyone, compared with the pre-existing condition of barter. But the question in our minds must be about the durability of the ruler’s new currency. With no precedent, how is the currency to be valued in the context of the ratios between goods and services bought and sold? And how certain can one be about tomorrow’s value in that context? And what happens if the king loses his power, or dies?</p>



<p>Clearly, without a reference to something else, the king’s new currency is a highly risky proposition and sooner or later will simply fail. And even when a new currency has been introduced and linked to an existing form of money, if the tie is then cut the currency will struggle to survive. Without going into the good reasons why this is so, the empirical evidence confirms it. Chinese merchants no longer use Kubla Khan’s paper made out of mulberry leaves, and German citizens no longer use the paper marks of the early 1920s. But they still refer to metallic money.</p>



<p>Yet today, we impart values to paper currencies issued by our governments in defiance of these outcomes. An explanation was provided by the great Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises in his regression theorem. He reasonably argued that we refer the value of a medium of exchange today to its value to us yesterday. In other words, we know as producers what we will receive today for our product, based on our experience in the immediate past, and in the same way we refer to our currency values as consumers. Similarly, at a previous time, we referred our experience of currency values to our prior experience. In other words, the credibility and value of currencies are based on a regression into the past.</p>



<p>Mises’s regression theory was broadly confirmed by an earlier writer, Jean-Baptiste Say, who in his&nbsp;Treatise on Political Economy&nbsp;observed:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Custom, therefore, and not the mandate of authority, designates the specific product that shall pass exclusively as money, whether crown pieces or any other commodity whatever.”<a href="https://www.goldmoney.com/research/the-upside-down-world-of-currency#_edn1">[i]</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Custom is why we still think of currencies as money, even though for the last fifty-one years their link with money was abandoned. The day after President Nixon cut the umbilical cord between gold and the dollar, we all continued using dollars and all the other currencies as if nothing had happened. But this was the last step in a long process of freeing the paper dollar from being backed by gold. The habit of the public in valuing currency by regression had served the US Government well and has continued to do so.</p>



 The role of a medium of exchange 



<p>Being backed by no more than government fiat, to properly understand the role that currencies have assumed for themselves, we need to make some comments about why a medium of exchange is needed and its characteristics. The basis was laid out by Jean-Baptiste Say, who described the division of labour and the role of a medium of exchange.</p>



<p>Say observed that human productivity depended on specialisation, with producers obtaining their broader consumption through the medium of exchange. The role of money (and associated credit) is to act as a commodity valued on the basis of its use in exchange. Therefore, money is simply the right, or title, to acquire some consumer satisfaction from someone else. Following on from Say’s law, when any economic quantity is exchanged for any other economic quantity, each is termed the value of the other. But when one of the quantities is money, the other quantities are given a price. Price, therefore, is always value expressed in money. For this reason, money has no price, which is confined entirely to the goods and services in an exchange.</p>



<p>So long as currency and associated forms of credit are firmly attached to money such that there are minimal differences between their values, there should be no price for them either, other than a value difference arising from counterparty risk. A further distinction between money and currencies can arise if their users suspect that the link might break down. It was the breakdown in this relationship between gold and the dollar that led to the failure of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971.</p>



<p>Therefore, in all logic it is legal money that has no price. But does that mean that when its value differs from that of money, does currency have a price? Not necessarily. So long as currency operates as a medium of exchange, it has a value and not a price. We can say that a dollar is valued at 0.0005682 ounces of gold, or gold is valued at 1760 dollars. As a legacy of the dollar’s regression from the days when it was on a gold standard, we still attribute no price to the dollar, but now we attribute a price to gold. To do so is technically incorrect.</p>



<p>Perhaps an argument for this state of affairs is that gold is subject to Gresham’s law, being hoarded rather than spent. It is the medium of exchange of last resort so rarely circulates. Nevertheless, fiat currencies have consistently lost value relative to legal money, which is gold, so much so that the dollar has lost 98% since the suspension of Bretton Woods, and sterling has lost 99%. Over fifty-one years, the process has been so gradual that users of unanchored currencies as their media of exchange have failed to notice it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This gradual loss of purchasing power relative to gold can continue indefinitely, so long as the conditions that have permitted it to happen remain without causing undue alarm. Furthermore, for lack of a replacement it is highly inconvenient for currency users to consider that their currency might be valueless. They will hang on to the myth of its use value until its debasement can no longer be ignored.</p>



 What is the purpose of interest rates? 



<p>Despite the accumulating evidence that central bank management of interest rates fails to achieve their desired outcomes, monetary policy committees persist in using interest rates as their primary means of economic intervention. It was the central bankers’ economic guru himself who pointed out that interest rates correlated with the general level of prices and not the rate of price inflation. And Keynes even named it Gibson’s paradox after Arthur Gibson, who wrote about it in&nbsp;Banker’s Magazine&nbsp;in 1923 (it had actually been noted by Thomas Tooke a century before). But because he couldn’t understand why these correlations were the opposite of what he expected, Keynes ignored it and so have his epigonic central bankers ever since.</p>



<p>As was often the case, Keynes was looking through the wrong end of the telescope. The reason interest rates rose and fell with the general price level was that price levels were not driven by interest rates, but interest rates reacted to changes in the general level of prices. Interest rates reflect the loss of purchasing power for money when the quantity of credit increases. With their interests firmly attached to time preference, savers required compensation for the debasement of credit, while borrowers — mainly businesses in production — needed to bid up for credit to pay for higher input costs. Essentially, interest rates changed as a lagging indicator, not a leading one as Keynes and his acolytes to this day still assume.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, that is why Gibson’s paradox is not a paradox but a natural consequence of fluctuations in credit and the foreign exchanges and the public’s valuation of it relative to goods. And the way to smooth out the cyclical consequences for prices is to stop discouraging savers from saving and make them personally responsible for their future security. As demonstrated today by Japan’s relatively low CPI inflation rate, a savings driven economy sees credit stimulation fuelling savings rather than consumption, providing capital for manufacturing improvements instead of raising consumer prices. Keynes’s savings paradox — another fatal error — actually points towards the opposite of economic and price stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is over interest rate management that central banks prove their worthlessness. Even if they had a Damascene conversion, bureaucrats in a government department can never impose decisions that can only be efficiently determined by market forces. It is the same fault exhibited in communist regimes, where the state tries to manage the supply of goods— and we know, unless we have forgotten, the futility of state direction of production. It is exactly the same with monetary policy. Just as the conditions that led the communists to build an iron curtain to prevent their reluctant subjects escaping from authoritarianism, there should be no monetary policy.</p>



<p>Instead, when things don’t go their way, like the communists, bureaucrats double down on their misguided policies suppressing the evidence of their failures. It is something of a miracle that the economic consequences have not been worse. It is testament to the robustness of human action that when officialdom places mountainous hurdles in its path ordinary folk manage to find a way to get on with their lives despite the intervention.</p>



<p>Eventually, the piper must be paid. Misguided interest rate policies led to their suppression to the zero bound, and for the euro, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc, even unnaturally negative deposit rates. Predictably, the distortions of these policies together with central bank credit inflation through quantitative easing are leading to pay-back time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rapidly rising commodity, producer and consumer prices, the consequences of these policy mistakes, are in turn leading to higher time preference discounts. Finally, markets have wrested currency and credit valuations out of central banks’ control, as it slowly dawns on market participants that the whole interest rate game has been an economic fallacy. Foreign creditors are no longer prepared to sit there and accept deposit rates and bond yields which do not compensate them for loss of purchasing power. Time preference is now mauling central bankers and their cherished delusions. They have lost their suppressive control over markets and now we must all face the consequences. Like the fate of the Berlin Wall that had kept Germany’s Ossies penned in, monetary policy control is being demolished.</p>



<p>With purchasing powers for the major currencies now sinking at a more rapid rate than current levels of interest rate and bond yield compensation, the underlying trend for interest rates is now rising and has further to go. Official forecasts that inflation at the CPU level will return to the targeted 2% in a year or two are pie in the sky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Nero-like, central bankers fiddle commercial banks are being burned. A consequence of zero and negative rates has been that commercial bank balance sheet leverage increased stratospherically to compensate for suppressed lending margins. Commercial bankers now have an overriding imperative to claw back their credit expansion in the knowledge that in a rising interest rate environment, their unfettered involvement in non-banking financial activities comes at a cost. Losses on financial collateral are mounting, and the provision of liquidity into mainline non-financial sectors faces losses as well. And when you have a balance sheet leverage ratio of assets to equity of over twenty times (as is the case for the large Japanese and Eurozone banks), balance sheet equity is almost certain to be wiped out.</p>



<p>The imperative for action is immediate. Any banker who does not act with the utmost urgency faces the prospect of being overwhelmed by the new interest rate trend. The chart below shows that the broadest measure of US money supply, which is substantially the counterparty of bank credit is already contracting, having declined by $236bn since March.</p>







<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2022-11-19_14-00-29.jpg?itok=O0IZnId6"></a></p>



<p>Contracting bank credit forces up interest rates due to lower credit supply. This is a trend that cannot be bucked, a factor that has little directly to do with prices. By way of confirmation of the new trend, the following quotation is extracted from the Fed’s monthly Senior Loan Officers’ Opinion Survey for October:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Over the third quarter, significant net shares of banks reported having tightened standards on C&amp;I [commercial and industrial] loans to firms of all sizes.&nbsp;Banks also reported having tightened most queried terms on C&amp;I loans to firms of all sizes over the third quarter. Tightening was most widely reported for premiums charged on riskier loans, costs of credit lines, and spreads of loan rates over the cost of funds. In addition, significant net shares of banks reported having tightened loan covenants to large and middle-market firms, while moderate net shares of banks reported having tightened covenants to small firms. Similarly, a moderate net share of foreign banks reported having tightened standards for C&amp;I loans.</p>



<p>“Major net shares of banks that reported having tightened standards or terms cited a less favourable or more uncertain economic outlook, a reduced tolerance for risk, and the worsening of industry-specific problems as important reasons for doing so. Significant net shares of banks also cited decreased liquidity in the secondary market for C&amp;I loans and less aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as important reasons for tightening lending standards and terms.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Similarly, credit is being withdrawn from financial activities. The following chart reflects collapsing credit levels being provided to speculators.</p>







<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2022-11-19_14-01-45.jpg?itok=KL0OWYpU"></a>In the same way that the withdrawal of bank credit undermines nominal GDP (because nearly all GDP transactions are settled in bank credit) the withdrawal of bank credit also undermines financial asset values. And just as it is a mistake to think that a contraction of GDP is driven by a decline in economic activity rather than the availability of bank credit, it is a mistake to ignore the role of bank credit in driving financial market valuations.</p>



<p>The statistics are yet to reflect credit contraction in the Eurozone and Japan, which are the most highly leveraged of the major banking systems. This may be partly due to the rapidity with which credit conditions are deteriorating. And we should note that the advanced socialisation of credit in these two regions probably makes senior managements more beholden to their banking authorities, and less entrepreneurial in their big-picture awareness than their American counterparts. Furthermore, the principal reason for continued monetary expansion reflects both the euro-system and the Bank of Japan’s continuing balance sheet expansion, which feed directly into the commercial banking network bolstering their balance sheets. It is likely to be state-demanded credit which overwhelms the Eurozone and Japan’s statistics, masking deteriorating changes in credit supply for commercial demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ECB and BOJ’s monetary policies have been to compromise their respective currencies by their continuing credit expansion, which is why their currencies have lost significant ground against the dollar while US interest rates have been rising. Adding to the tension, the US’s Fed has been jawing up its attack on price inflation, but the recent fall in the dollar on the foreign exchanges strongly suggests a pivot in this policy is in sight.</p>



<p>The dilemma facing central banks is one their own making. Having suppressed interest rates to the zero bound and below, the reversal of this trend is now out of their control. Commercial banks will surely react in the face of this new interest rate trend and seek to contract their balance sheets as rapidly as possible. Students of Austrian business cycle theory will not be surprised at the suddenness of this development. But all GDP transactions, with very limited minor cash exceptions at the retail end of gross output are settled in bank credit. Inevitably the withdrawal of credit will cause nominal GDP to contract significantly, a collapse made more severe in real terms when the decline in a currency’s purchasing power is taken into consideration.</p>



<p>The choice now facing bureaucratic officialdom is simple: does it prioritise rescuing financial markets and the non-financial economy from deflation, or does it ignore the economic consequences of protecting the currency instead? The ECB, BOJ and the Bank of England have decided their duty lies with supporting the economy and financial markets. Perhaps driven in part by central banking consensus, the Fed now appears to be choosing to protect the US economy and its financial markets as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The principal policy in the new pivot will be the same: suppress interest rates below their time preference. It is the policy mistake that the bureaucrats always make, and they will double down on their earlier failures. The extent to which they suppress interest rates will be reflected in the loss of purchasing power of their currencies, not in terms of their values against each other, but in their values with respect to energy, commodities, raw materials, foodstuffs, and precious metals. In other words, a new round of higher producer and consumer prices and therefore irresistible pressure for yet higher interest rates will emerge.</p>



 The collapse of the everything bubble 



<p>The flip side of interest rate trends is the value imparted to assets, both financial and non-financial. It is no accident that the biggest and most widespread global bull market in history has coincided with interest rate suppression to zero and even lower over the last four decades. Equally, a trend of rising interest rates will have the opposite effect.</p>



<p>Unlike bull markets, bear markets are often sudden and shocking, especially where undue speculation has been previously involved. There is no better example than that of the cryptocurrency phenomenon, which has already seen bitcoin fall from a high of $68,000 to $16,000 in twelve months. And in recent days, the collapse of one of the largest crypto-exchanges, FTX, has exposed both hubris and alleged fraud, handmaidens to extreme public speculation, on an unimaginable scale. For any student of the madness of crowds, it would be surprising if the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies actually survives.</p>



<p>Driving this volte-face into bear markets is the decline in bond values. On 20 March 2020, when the Fed reduced its fund rate to zero, the 30-year US Treasury bond yielded 1.18%. Earlier this week the yield stood at 4.06%. That’s a fall in price of over 50%. And time preference suggests that short-term rates, for example over one year, should currently discount a loss of currency’s purchasing power at double current rates, or even more.</p>



<p>For the planners who meddle with interest rates, increases in rates and bond yields on that scale are unimaginable. Monetary policy committees, being government agencies, will think primarily about the effect on government finances. In their nightmares they can envisage tax revenues collapsing, welfare commitments soaring, and borrowing costs mounting. The increased deficit, additional to current shortfalls, would require central banks to accelerate quantitative easing without limitation. To the policy planners, the reasons to bring interest rates both lower and back firmly under control are compelling.</p>



<p>Furthermore, officials believe that a rising stock market is necessary to maintain economic confidence. That also requires the enforcement of a new declining interest rate trend. The argument in favour of a new round of interest rate suppression becomes undeniable. But the effect on fiat currencies will accelerate their loss of purchasing power, undermining confidence in them and leading to yet higher interest rates in the future.</p>



<p>Either way, officialdom loses. And the public will pay the price for meekly going along with these errors.</p>



 Managing counterparty risk 



<p>Any recovery in financial asset values, such as that currently in play, is bound to be little more than a rally in an ongoing bear market. We must not forget that commercial bankers have to reduce their balance sheets ruthlessly if they are to protect their shareholders. Consequently, as over-leveraged international banks are at a heightened risk of failing in the new interest rate environment, their counterparties face systemic risks increasing sharply. To reduce exposure to these risks, all bankers are duty bound to their shareholders to shrink their obligations to other banks, which means that the estimated $600 trillion of notional over the counter (OTC) derivatives and on the back of it the additional $50 trillion regulated futures exchange derivatives will enter their own secular bear markets. OTC and regulated derivatives are the children of falling interest rates, and with a new trend of rising interest rates their parentage is bound to be tested.</p>



<p>We can now see a further reason why central banks will wish to suppress interest rates and support financial markets. Unless they do so, the risk of widespread market failures between derivative counterparties will threaten to collapse the entire global banking network. And that is in addition to existential risks from customer loan defaults and collapsing collateral values. Central banks will have to stand ready to rescue failing banks and underwrite the entire commercial system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avert this risk, they will wish to stabilise markets and prevent further increases in interest rates. And all central banks which have indulged in QE already have mark-to-market losses that have wiped out their own balance sheet equity. We now face the prospect of central banks that by any commercial measure are themselves financially broken, tasked with saving entire commercial banking networks.</p>



<p>When the trend for interest rates was for them to fall under the influence of increasing supplies of credit, the deployment of that credit was substantially directed into financial assets and increasing speculation. For this reason, markets soared while the increase in the general level of producer and consumer prices was considerably less than the expansion of credit suggested should be the case. That is no longer so, with manufacturers facing substantial increases in their input costs. And now, when they need it most, bank credit is being withdrawn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not generally realised yet, but the financial world is in transition between economies being driven by asset inflation and suppressed commodity prices, and a new environment of asset deflation while commodity prices increase. And it is in the valuations of unanchored fiat currencies where this transition will be reflected most.</p>



 Physical commodities are set replace paper equivalents 



<p>The expansion of derivatives when credit was expanding served to soak up demand for commodities which would otherwise have gone into physical metals and energy. In the case of precious metals, this is admitted by those involved in the expansion of London’s bullion market from the 1980s onwards to have been a deliberate policy to suppress gold as a rival to the dollar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Bank for International Settlements, at the end of last year gold OTC outstanding swaps and forwards (essentially, the London Bullion Market) stood at the equivalent of 8,968 tonnes of bullion, to which must be added the 1,594 tonnes of paper futures on Comex giving an identified 10,662 tonnes. This is considerably more than the official reserves of the US Treasury, and even its partial replacement with physical bullion will have a major impact on gold values. Silver, which is an extremely tight market, is most of the BIS’s other precious metal statistics content and faces bullion replacement of OTC paper in the order of three billion ounces, to which we must add Comex futures equivalent to a further 700 million ounces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the winding down of derivative markets alone, the impact on precious metal values is bound to be substantial. Furthermore, the common mistake made by almost all derivative traders is to not understand that legal money is physical gold and silver — despite what their regulating governments force them to believe. What they call prices for gold and silver are not prices, but values imparted to legal money from depreciating currencies and associated credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it may be hard to grasp this seemingly upside-down concept, it is vital to understand that so-called rising prices for gold and silver are in fact falling values for currencies. Some central banks, predominantly in Asia are taking advantage of this ignorance, which is predominantly displayed in western, Keynesian-driven derivative markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps after a currency hiatus and when market misconceptions are ironed out, we can expect legal money values to behave as they should. If a development which is clearly inflationary emerges, it should drive currency values lower relative to gold. But instead, in today’s markets we see them rise because speculators take the view that currencies relative to gold will benefit from higher interest rates. A pause for thought should expose the fallacy of this approach, where the true relationship between money and currencies is assumed away.</p>



<p>In the wake of the suspension of the Bretton Woods agreement and when the purchasing power of currencies subsequently declined, interest rates and the value of gold rose together. In February 1972, gold was valued at $85, while the Fed funds rate was 3.3%. On 21 January 1980 gold was fixed that morning at $850, and the Fed funds rate was 13.82%. When gold increased nine-fold, the Fed’s fund rate had more than quadrupled. And it required Paul Volcker to raise the funds rate to over 19% twice subsequently to slay the inflation dragon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the seventies, the excessive credit-driven speculation that we now witness was absent, along with the accompanying debt leverage in the financial sectors of western economies and in their banking systems. A Volcker-style rise in interest rates today would cause widespread bankruptcies and without doubt crash the entire global banking system. While markets might take us there anyway, as a deliberate act of official policy it can be safely ruled out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We must therefore conclude that there is another round of currency destruction in the offing. Potentially, it will be far more extensive than anything seen to date. Not only will central-bank currency and QE expansion fund government deficits and attempt to compensate for the contraction of bank credit while supporting financial markets by firmly suppressing interest rates and bond yields, but insolvent central banks will be tasked with underwriting insolvent commercial banks.</p>



<p>At some stage, the inversion of monetary reality, where legal money is priced in fiat, will change. Instead of legal money being priced in fiat, fiat currencies will be priced in legal money. But that will be the death of the fiat swindle.</p>

<p>The movement began with a talk by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McNamee">Roger McNamee</a> titled&nbsp;<a href="https://events.iu.edu/ostromworkshop/event/644997-ostrom-workshop-beyond-the-web-salon-series-roger">Saving us from Big Tech: the Gen Z Solutio</a><a href="http://Saving%20us%20from%20Big%20Tech:%20the%20Gen%20Z%20Solution">n</a>. It was the latest in the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a>‘s <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/news-events/events/salon/index.html">Beyond the Web salon series</a>, which on this occasion took place live and in person simultaneously in the&nbsp;<a href="https://computerhistory.org">Computer History Museum</a>‘s Boole room and on the Web via <a href="https://owllabs.com/products/meeting-owl-3">Owl</a> and Zoom, through the Workshop at Indiana University, where people also participated in a room and virtually. You can see the first hour of the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYWOdekAbYQ">here</a>.</p>
<p>The conversation with Roger was super-energized, continued well past the scheduled hour, and onward through breakout sessions on each of the three days that followed at the Museum during <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">IIW</a>, and since then on Signal and Zoom. The conversation informally called itself “Roger and We,” and it vectored toward what it says on the&nbsp;t-shirt design above,&nbsp;<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/52536304690/in/album-72177720304127179/">drawn on a whiteboard</a> during the third of the IIW sessions: End Surveillance Capitalism or ESC. (Also implying ESCape). One of us at the session created this graphic—</p>
<p></p>
<p>—and used it to create this t-shirt at&nbsp;<a href="http://Zazzle.com" title="http://Zazzle. ">Zazzle.com</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>He’s bought a number of them, so far, because when he wore the first to Thanksgiving dinner, other people there also wanted one. In the spirit of freedom and openness, please feel free to use the same graphic (which, if you drag it off, is quite large ), or something like it, to make one or more of your own. Or run with it any way you please. Movements work that way.</p>
<p>This is where I pause and thank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff">Shoshana Zuboff</a> for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697">making surveillance capitalism</a> a full-sized <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22surveillance+capitalism%22">Thing</a>.

<p>Where this goes is up to the group, which is small, growing, and gathering weekly in virtual space while corresponding asynchronously as well.&nbsp;It’s still small but growing.</p>
<p>To succeed, its fire needs to be so large and hot that profiting by tracking people will fail because neither people nor regulators will put up with it. It is also sobering to know that similar efforts to end surveillance capitalism have faltered in the past (which is still now), in spite of the simple fact that spying on people without their clear invitation (not mere “consent”) or a court order is wrong on its face, regardless of the purposes to which that spying is put.</p>
<p>We talked about lots of other stuff during VRM Day, of course. For example, <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/">Don Marti</a> <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/52535739436/in/album-72177720304127179/">led a session</a>&nbsp;on the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/">Private Advertising Technology Community Group,</a> which he encouraged everyone in the room to join. (Please do.)</p>
<p>But the main outcome was ESC.</p>
<p>Now, some background for those not familiar with ProjectVRM.</p>
<p>From its start at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center</a> in 2006, ProjectVRM has had (says <a href="http://the%20immodest%20ambition%20of%20turning%20business%20on%20its%20head%20--%20for%20its%20own%20good,%20and%20for%20everyone%20else's%20as%20well.">here</a>) “the immodest ambition of turning business on its head — for its own good, and for everyone else’s as well.” Perhaps ESC will be the thing to do that, after sixteen years of <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/about/">encouraging</a> countless other efforts, some of which are listed&nbsp;<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work">here</a>. (There is no easy way to keep up with all of them.)</p>

<p>In the first of our series of upcoming member spotlights we interviewed PassiveBolt’s co-founder Kabir Maiga. His company is an Associate Member of DIF and he shares some of PassiveBolt’s work in advancing decentralized access as a Tier1 supplier. </p><p>TRANSCRIPT:</p><p>Limari: Welcome<br></p><p>Kabir: Thanks for having me. <br></p><p>Limari: What I always like to ask people just in the decentralized space is really what's your journey, because decentralized identity, it is relatively new and people have all sorts of interesting stories about how they came into this space. So I just wanted to maybe get your background and how you came to work on what you are developing at this moment?<br></p><p>Kabir: Yeah. Oh, absolutely. So I started out as an engineer, gosh I guess I'm getting old, I graduated almost 14 years ago now. Wow. And yeah, electrical engineer, worked in the automotive industry, worked in investment banking, as a software engineer, went and got a master's degree in business from Ross at the University of Michigan, and really ended up going back into the automotive industry where I got into access control. That's basically keyless entry systems for cars. You're probably familiar with some of the tech that I used to work on, which is touching the vehicle door handle to unlock, not using your phone to control access to your car, things like that. It was a great experience, great team. We worked on tech that eventually has gotten deployed in over 120 million vehicles globally. So a really exciting project. But it's really working on that project I think I had an epiphany or idea which is, the automotive industry at the time, this was the 2016-18 timeframe, seemed to be ahead of the rest in access control, in terms of &nbsp;its technology stack. I think one of the reasons why that was the case is because it had an entire Tier 1 class of companies that basically innovated and supplied OEMs. (Original Equipment Manufacturers) So OEMs never had to worry about designing the latest closure systems, they would just source it from innovative suppliers. So really bringing that type enabling class of company to the rest of access control was what I set out to do, and worked to spin off with my core team out of continental automotive, where I used to work, which is a 50 billion euro automotive Tier 1 one of the leading Tier 1s. I was able to get the blessing to really spin off and start PassiveBolt as a separate company with the express intent of really looking at how do we enable companies that make products and solutions, security solutions for controlling how people get in and out of secure spaces? </p><p>One opportunity that we saw is really providing that tier one base to security industry companies that design access control solutions across the board. In doing that, we quickly realize how fragmented it all is. A lot of it had to do with systems being siloed. Each system is behind its own login. I &nbsp;don't care if you bought a smart safe, to unlock it you need an app, or &nbsp;to unlock your smart lock you added on some door. It doesn't matter what you do. If I sat down and said what would it all look like in five, ten or twenty years down the line, I can imagine owning 100 apps just to access physical spaces. &nbsp;Because as hotels, car rentals, you know all physical spaces became smart, I will just be onboarding and creating digital identities in several different silos and my data living on all of those systems. That's really what got us into decentralized identity, because that clearly was not a future that I wanted to live in. So we really transformed PassiveBolt into a web3 focused company that's really pioneering access control by leveraging an identity meta system. We're creating and establishing basically the identity layer, the missing identity layer in physical space network communications. That's for the security industry more specifically. In other words, we basically want to enable identity wallets, SSI or decentralized identity based wallets to unlock any and all physical spaces. One obvious application of digital identity is in machine to machine interactions, you know, password-less login or supply chain or provenance, etc. IoT is a great opportunity as well, in the sense that we do live in a physical world and access in physical spaces, it means that if I'm leveraging my digital identity to do so, I need protocols in place to allow me or my wallet to talk to physical spaces, right to be able to convey a verifiable credential that shows that I have access to a specific space.</p><p>Limari: Yeah that's very interesting. I think for a lot of people, the &nbsp;issue of identity, it's kind of front and center for them. I think just the general populace are confronted with the problems of that. It's interesting just imagining a world where you need 100 different apps to access everything that you own, all spaces that you own and just how unsustainable that is. I think that some people may be wondering, “How is this different from my keyless entry I already have, or &nbsp;is what you're doing better than what I have. You highlight a very important point in that, as you keep growing this centralized model, it becomes very unsustainable. But I would be interested, I mean, our audience, a lot of them are involved with deep tech. If you did want to go a little bit more in depth on the decentralized aspect of PassiveBolt, feel free to fill some of that in some more, and then maybe, what are some of the interests you have in the decentralized identity community and how it intersects that?<br></p><p>Kabir: Yeah so we've basically created a technology stack from the root, meaning the blockchain layer all the way up to physical devices for physical spaces. So you know the bottom layer is obviously the identity meta system itself so the root of trust. We created a blockchain that is purpose built for digital identity. So really it's effectively a registry, a verifiable data registry for digital identifiers, but specifically addresses the needs of the security industry. We could have gone with an existing platform, or an existing blockchain, I should say. But we wanted a blockchain that's built for and by the security industry, that all manufacturers of physical security systems can leverage. So consider that a common public registry for the security industry. The second layer, and I should say that, first, the bottom layer, was obviously put in, in the public domain, it's a public utility for the security industry. So PassiveBolt obviously conceived of it, built it, but again, it is intended to be governed and maintained by the security industry itself as a whole. &nbsp;To clarify maybe for some of our viewers, by security industry I'm referring specifically to manufacturers of access control systems hardware like locks, etc, or software solutions like physical access control software for issuing key cards to people or mobile keys to people, things like that. The second layer, obviously once you have a registry is now you have to have the software stack to go with it. So &nbsp;there's the identity wallet, and you have the attestation infrastructure, or to use the W3C language, the verifiable credential layer. So we have those two layers above where we basically created protocols that allow the use of verifiable credentials, digital agents and, or wallets, containing wallets, to be able to communicate with physical devices. So in essence, any lock that can do cryptography can be made into a web3 device. </p><p>One thing that was important to us is not imagining every manager of physical space having to rip out their hardware. That might be counterproductive, and the investment would be significant to be able to deploy decentralized identity in terms of physical access. So our solution is really to create an offline way of being able to utilize a verifiable credential to unlock physical spaces and that's what we did. &nbsp;So that layer protocol that we've created at PassiveBolt really allows any and all digital agents to be able to achieve that. Our identity wallet that we created &nbsp;is just one first implementation on top of that blockchain that I mentioned. It allows you to set up your PII &nbsp;to be able to receive verifiable credentials and be able to share them. PII being personally identifiable information. But what's great about this is there was a time where if you wanted access to physical spaces, your only option was to surrender PII somewhere in exchange for a keycard. So here's who I am, put it in a database that you get to store and I get a key card and I can badge into that hotel room or office or whatever. Then we switched to doing it over mobile using mobile keys, but then we never really did fix that identity piece of it. Now I'm logging, I'm registering, I'm surrendering PII to create an account number which is effectively a digital identity into that siloed system. Then I can receive a digital key. In this paradigm, leveraging decentralized identity, you don't have to log into anything of course with your identity while you're self sovereign. Using just your identifier, we have protocol, &nbsp;where you can basically be assigned access to a space, without sharing any PII, without the access provider needing to store any personal information about you. It makes it interoperable. So you can get into, with your identity wallet, you can get into any and all web3 capable physical spaces.<br></p>The team at PassiveBolt<p>Limari: That's amazing. Maybe you can give us just kind of a brief idea, maybe &nbsp;a vision for people someday using this technology, this is how you're going to be able to go through spaces, maybe kind of like a real life use case.</p><p>Kabir: &nbsp;Here's what I want you to be able to do. I want you a couple years down the road, to be able to grab your identity wallet, and book a vacation somewhere using your identity wallet. You publish your need. So looking for a hotel, let's say you're going to New York City, looking for a hotel and a car rental in New York City for these days. You get offers, private offers from hotels and &nbsp;travel service providers, generally speaking, so that they are now able to give you a direct offer via DID to DID communication, which means they're not giving you a rate that's public. So they can be more aggressive to get your business to improve their occupancy rate. You're able to book seamlessly and deal with a direct relationship with a service provider. Then you show up at the airport, I want you to be able to just tap your device and prove your identity. You are who you say you are, and it's verified. Obviously, for government purposes, let's throw in two factor authentication or facial recognition. You get to the plane, you've got your plane ticket that was delivered in that booking that you did with one click and you're able to just tap again, to just prove that you are who you are, and you walk onto the plane with your seat. You land in New York City. I want you to just be able to walk onto the Hertz parking lot or company alpha and just go straight to spot seven B where they told you your vehicle is parked and you tap and it unlocks. You go in, you push a button, it starts, no key exchange no need to interact with anyone perhaps. You drive to hotel beta, at that hotel beta, you walk in, you go to room 402, no stops needed, unless you want to say hello to somebody. If you tap your identity wallet again, the room unlocks and you go in. &nbsp;All of this is possible because from when you did your booking, be it through the wallet or through an aggregator, doesn't have to be through the wallet, you were delivered verifiable credentials through that device, through that wallet. Those verifiable credentials have allowed you to unlock all of those physical spaces along the way. I really emphasize access to physical spaces, because there's a tendency to always focus on virtual spaces like apps, websites and the like. I think there's significant value as we build decentralized identity ecosystems to really capture physical spaces, because that's where we live. This whole journey that I described, your trip from California to New York is you needing to get into all the physical spaces in between to get to your hotel room, and then to maybe that concert later that evening. It's all physical spaces. That's really what we want to help shape and build.<br></p><p>Limari: That's really really amazing and I know that for a lot of people not working within this space, on this technology, some of this is very hard to grasp because we are so shaped by just the centralized system that we are living in today. The fact that we are able to do that without giving away all of this personally identifiable information, it's just amazing that we can have that capability. So one last thing I'm curious to hear your thoughts about is just in terms of the community at DIF, if there's been any work items, like maybe you've had your eye on that you find are interesting here in this space that you think might contribute to what you're doing at PassiveBolt?<br></p><p>Kabir: I think &nbsp;many of the working groups are phenomenal, messaging is one that comes to mind. I think the group that I've been particularly interested in and really participated in every week is the Travel SIG within DIF. The Travel SIG is currently working on travel profiles, which is really a way to simplify how you communicate information data to travel providers. So that experience I had described between California and in New York your ability to do it with a single click, just give them the information they need, authorized access to information, they need to provide you of service, but in a way that preserves PII and preserves privacy, that's key. The work that DIF is doing, I think is to come up with a standard. We have a way we're doing it at PassiveBolt, but working through DIF we’re hoping to have a standardized way of doing it. &nbsp;I think all the great minds you have there, you know &nbsp;people with significant industry experience, travel experience, that we're able to work together with. As technologists, there's nothing better than to really hear direct input from people who've been in the industry for 30, 40 years to make sure that the systems we're designing are taking into account all the different dynamics in the space. So I think that SIG is particularly interesting and work product of a traveler profile schema that will come out of it will be very beneficial, not just to PassiveBolt, but all companies and all entities looking to help us or help everyone really design the traveler experience of the future.<br></p><p>Limari: Just to clarify for our audience who may not be familiar with our open groups at DIF, Kabir is referring to the Hospitality and Travel Special Interest group. It's one of the groups that we have at DIF that anybody can just hop on, and you can join in the discussion there. So awesome. Well, thank you so much. It's been such an interesting conversation. I truly enjoyed learning more about PassiveBolt, what you're doing and how this technology will be applied to travel and to going between spaces, accessing our homes, hotels, etc. So, &nbsp;truly enlightening. Also, maybe if you like to let people know how they can learn more about PassiveBolt.<br></p><p>Kabir: Go to PassiveBolt.com or you can reach out to me if you want to connect Kabir [at] passivebolt.com<br></p><p>Limari: Thank you so much. Once again, I appreciate you taking the time. And thank you everyone who decided to join us today and watch and we'll have many more interviews to come very soon. So thanks.</p><p>Kabir: Thank you</p><p>You can learn more at https://passivebolt.com/ </p><p>If you would like to become a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation join us at https://identity.foundation/<br></p>

<p>Insight: Sharing cybersecurity successes and failures leads to improvement – Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO at the FIDO Alliance, explains why a culture of secrecy surrounding cybersecurity is holding back progress</p>



<p>If your organisation were hit by a cyber attack, would you tell anyone?</p>


 
 


<p>Historically, the answer would be an unequivocal no. Many believe that sharing that you were a target exposes your company’s (or your personal) vulnerabilities, making you more susceptible to further attack or ridicule. But this ‘security by obscurity’ mindset is not only outdated, it hinders the industry’s ability to harden our collective defences, most notably by eliminating our dependence on passwords and other knowledge-based credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this year saw a 5%-7% drop globally in the use of passwords for entry, it is still by far the most popular online authentication method, which is a big problem. Passwords are not only highly insecure, but they also cause major consumer headaches and are costing businesses; 59% of consumers gave up on accessing an online service and 43% abandoned a purchase when asked for a password in the past month. More than 82% of data breaches are caused by weak or stolen login credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits of multi-factor authentication (MFA) are widely reported but many firms have been sheepish about sharing their adoption figures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This may be because the figures weren’t great. Twitter revealed its two-factor-authentication adoption figures last summer, revealing that just 2.3% of accounts had it enabled. Of those, 80% relied on SMS-based backup, the least secure mode. Communicating this doesn’t make Twitter any less secure. Instead, it sets a powerful benchmark for improvement, and gives the industry a reality check that considerable work remains to get more customers using MFA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other organisations to be applauded are Cloudflare and Twilio. The two cloud computing giants recently reported that they were targeted by a near-exact phishing attack. Employees were targeted with a text message from a supposed IT department, directing them to a fake website requesting a password change. Neither Twilio nor Cloudflare’s monitoring systems detected the attack, and, as you’d expect, some employees were caught off-guard and shared credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Twilio fell victim to the attack (along with dozens of other companies), Cloudflare’s employees were protected because they use Fast ID Online (FIDO) security keys which are tied to users. Origin binding also prevented any credentials from being shared. Since the incident, Twilio has followed Cloudflare’s lead, as it shared in its updated incident report. This is a great example of how sharing successes and failures alike leads to two on the whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the FIDO Alliance, we’re working with the world’s leading tech companies and consumer service providers to solve this challenge. Together, we’ve created technology that’s increasingly cited as a ‘gold standard’ by governments, including the US’s cybersecurity body, CISA, and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To best defend against cyber attacks, organisations should take inspiration from the Twilio and Cloudflare story and build in security protocols that are phishing-resistant. These protocols are often implemented with USB keys or built-in biometric authentication on devices, and can be added as a critical layer of security to both an organisation’s own network and information, and for customers accessing its services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the work we do at the FIDO Alliance, creating and implementing new technology, is an important part of moving the world away from passwords and other weak forms of legacy authentication – but it isn’t the most critical piece. Industry-wide commitment to creating intuitive and common user journeys, underpinned by architectural best practices, will enable the kind of cultural shift and mass adoption of this technology that will be required if we want to remove passwords from our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collaboration and transparency are key ingredients that raise the bar for all involved – including for hackers, who need to have a far harder time executing remote attacks.</p>

		<p>by Trinh Nguyen-Phan</p>
<p>The concept of an “ecosystem” has been increasingly adopted in data management, innovation, and business strategy. Yet, more often it is used metaphorically without a specific reference to the literature. As Socrates (470 – 399 B.C.) put it, “The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms.” This is especially relevant to the ToIP Ecosystems Foundry Working Group (EFWG) because our very name is based on this term. So the EFWG has been working for over a year to deliver a white paper called <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Ecosystem-Defining-Digital-Trust-Ecosystem-V1.0-2022-10-13.pdf">Defining Digital Trust Ecosystems (PDF)</a>. The first version of this white paper has now been approved by the ToIP Steering Committee and we are pleased to announce its official release.</p>
<p>The white paper draws on the characteristics of natural ecosystems and human economies to propose a concrete definition of digital trust ecosystems. It also discusses the characteristics of digital trust ecosystems, the challenges of sustaining digital trust ecosystems, and the role of the ToIP Foundation.</p>
<p>Given that multiple disciplines use the term “ecosystem” with an implied reference to its biological root, the EFWG&nbsp; asked a biodiversity scientist, Dr. Autumn Watkinson, to introduce us to ecology as a discipline. Based on her talk, we saw many parallels to the work we do in the EFWG. Surveying the literature in biology, psychology, business strategy, and data management, we discovered interesting convergences and divergences of the concept of “ecosystems” in biology and other disciplines. Interconnectedness and competition are the two most referenced characteristics of natural ecosystems in other disciplines; whereas resilience, diversity, and the sustainability mechanism of natural ecosystems are by and large dismissed. This might be caused by the lack of understanding of what natural ecosystems entail, as the renowned forester and writer Wohlleben said in ‘The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate’:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>
“The forest ecosystem is held in a delicate balance. Every being has its niche and its function, which contribute to the well-being of all. Nature is often described like that, or something along those lines; however, that is, unfortunately, false.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>– (Wohlleben, 2015, p. 113)</p>
<p>We suggested three lessons from nature:</p>
 
 First, ecosystems must optimize the diversity of its membership.&nbsp; 
 Second, ecosystems survive and thrive without clear-cut boundaries and no ecosystem is completely independent of others.&nbsp; 
 Third, and most importantly, Digital Trust Ecosystems must have a built-in mechanism to counteract overexploitation. 
 
<p>As the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> aspires to foster decentralized digital trust, these three lessons are particularly pertinent to support, facilitate, and sustain digital trust ecosystems. This applies not just within one ecosystem, but between different digital trust ecosystems. We believe that this work is fundamental to further work on designing ecosystems governance frameworks. We invite you to read the white paper, join the discussion of digital trust ecosystems, and examine the applications of these concepts to your related work.</p>

 Babelfish: Service Integration in Heterogeneous Environments has been selected for funding as one of the brightest projects for building the Next Generation Internet in Europe 
  
<p><a href="https://www.ownyourdata.eu">OwnYo</a>urData and the <a href="https://www.kybernos.com/esg">Kybernos ESG Data Services GmbH</a> are taking part in ONTOCHAIN, to co-develop a new software ecosystem for trusted, traceable &amp; transparent ontological knowledge</p>
 
<p>WHAT IS ONTOCHAIN?</p>
<p>ONTOCHAIN is a new software ecosystem for trusted, traceable &amp; transparent ontological knowledge management funded by the European Commission as part of the Next Generation Internet initiative (NGI).</p>
<p>ONTOCHAIN empowers internet innovators to develop Blockchain-based knowledge management solutions that address the challenge of secure and transparent knowledge management, as well as service interoperability on the Internet.</p>
<p>The ONTOCHAIN software ecosystem aims to demonstrate its potential in high impact domains, such as eHealth, eGovernment, eEducation, eCommerce, decentralised infrastructures and similar, in order to achieve trustworthy information exchange and trustworthy and transactional content handling.</p>
<p>Babelfish is taking part in ONTOCHAIN to provide service integration in heterogeneous environments. Our project proposes to describe services on a technical, semantic, and governance layer and will implement a component that uses such descriptions to translate interfaces (APIs), data, and data agreements from a foreign (and maybe proprietary format) to an interoperable format understood by the recipient. A registry maintains a list of all services and thus spans up an interoperable data space.</p>
<p>HOW WILL IT WORK?</p>
<p>ONTOCHAIN Open Call 3 was looking for interoperable and sustainable applications that employ Semantic Web and Blockchain concepts, to enhance data quality aspect, as well as the trustworthiness of data communication and handling processes.</p>
<p>Web3 innovators were invited to propose applications covering real needs of end users in vital sectors of the European economy, built on top of the software services of the ONTOCHAIN ecosystem. Applicants could also submit proposals around missing blocks of the ONTOCHAIN infrastructure.</p>
<p>A total of 105 projects applied for the call and the evaluation process resulted in the selection of 14 proposals addressing the following topics:</p>
<p>ONTOCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE</p>
 
 Service Integration (Gateways APIs) for ONTOCHAIN applications 
 Energy-efficient and sustainable hosting infrastructure for the ONTOCHAIN software ecosystem and services 
 
<p>ONTOCHAIN APPLICATIONS</p>
 
 Semantic Digital Logbooks for Companies, Buildings, Cars or similar 
 Decentralised Fact Checking and Data Credibility for Social Content 
 Semantic energy data management 
 Automotive, e.g., electric vehicle charging, road side management, car insurance, communication interoperability 
 Distribution Logistics / Supply Chains Using Trustworthy Semantic Data 
 Data/Digital content /Multimedia marketplace, including social media 
 Decentralised Public Services &amp; Common Goods 
 Other applications aligned with ONTOCHAIN objectives 
 
<p>ONTOCHAIN will support Babelfish through a 10-month programme and provide funding support up to 119.500 Euros. As part of the action, experts in diverse fields will also provide technology development guidance, working methodology, as well as access to top infrastructure, coaching, visibility and community building support.</p>

 From Data to Assets: Transforming Global Supply Chains with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph  Ongoing digital transformation of global supply&nbsp;chains <p>Organizations have been on a journey of digitally transforming their supply chains for a number of years. This journey was accelerated by the COVID pandemic that highlighted the fragility of global supply chain networks, coupled with a rapid increase in consumer demand and e-commerce volumes. Transformation efforts have been taking place on multiple fronts, such as transparency, sustainability, purchasing, warehouse operations, and trade documentation, to name a few. While progress has been made in each of those areas, we’ve seen few leapfrog advances. There are several reasons for that, ranging from a complex landscape of involved players to siloed and poorly interoperable data that prevents organizations to have a holistic understanding of what’s going on in their supply chain networks.</p><p>Even with the slow progression, however, advanced technologies that will enable supply chains to enter and benefit from the metaverse — the fusion of physical and digital worlds — are steadily being&nbsp;adopted.</p><p>In one of <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/business-functions-blog/metaverse-supply-chain-networks">their reports</a>, Accenture found that about two-thirds of supply chain management executives think that metaverse will have a positive impact on their organization. They see metaverse technologies benefiting organizations in multiple ways, from enabling a better alignment of supply and demand through enhanced customer engagement to facilitating more seamless navigation between physical and digital worlds and providing real-time insights that reduce the gap between supply chain planning and execution. But we still have a lot of work to get&nbsp;there.</p> OriginTrail — introducing discoverable and verifiable Web3 assets to supply&nbsp;chains <p>Achieving the vision of fully metaverse-enabled global supply chains requires a strong and paradigm-shifting foundational infrastructure. OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) brings this required radical change in the way supply chains operate by enabling organizations to transform their data into Web3 assets. To make it easier to understand, Web3 assets in the context of supply chains can be a variety of&nbsp;things:</p>  Products or groups of products that are flowing along the supply&nbsp;chain.  Logistics equipment such as shipping containers, trailers, pallets, and other equipment used to handle, transport, and store products.  Business locations where products are manufactured, transported, stored, and&nbsp;sold.  Supply chain events describing what happened to products and equipment — we use the GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard to ensure interoperability.  Trade documents like Bills of Lading (BL), Airway Bills (AWB), CMRs, Credit notes, Proof of Delivery (POD), Purchase Orders, Invoices, and&nbsp;others.  Credentials of trade partners such as facility audits and certificates.  Other relevant supply chain components.  <p>Assets from various supply chain partners on OriginTrail DKG are discoverable, verifiable, and linked, providing a holistic insight into the supply chain network and making it easy to use them in a variety of business applications — anything from track and trace and security monitoring to precise recall management and insurance claims. Additionally, as OriginTrail DKG assets use global data standards such as GS1 EPCIS, W3C Verifiable Credentials, and e-Bill of Lading (eBL), they are interoperable and can be used in any existing IT system that “understands” the standards.</p><p>One concern that usually pops up is data privacy and ownership — most of the supply chain data is of a sensitive nature after all. No worries there, as OriginTrail DKG allows a full spectrum of privacy configurations, ranging from assets that are fully private to assets that are fully public, and everything in between. Assets on OriginTrail DKG also incorporate the concept of ownership, as asset ownership can be verifiably transferred from one supply chain partner to another as required. This opens up a world of exciting opportunities for process improvements and new ways to generate value. For example, no more paper handovers of trade documents (such as Bills of Lading) and fuzzy to non-existent audit trails. Or imagine organizations being able to engage with and understand their customers better by transferring ownership of a product in the form of a Web3 asset to them after purchase. The possibilities are&nbsp;endless.</p><p>What I described above is not theoretical — OriginTrail DKG is already positively impacting supply chains in different industries. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKgqGpZablw&amp;t=26673s">SCAN Trusted Factory</a> uses OriginTrail to safeguard security audits of the largest US retailers such as Disney, Walmart, and Target. <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/healthcare/donated-medicines-and-vaccines/">AidTrust</a> provides trust and transparency in pharmaceutical supply chains. <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2022/june/one-year-on-since-bsi-and-trace-labs-joined-the-innovate-uk-consortium-to-develop-new-digital-solutions-for-the-food-and-trade-industry/">Trusted Bytes</a> looks at enabling UK Customs to achieve comprehensive shipment risk assessments. And many more are on the&nbsp;way.</p> Network Operating System (nOS) — where the magic&nbsp;happens <p>But how do we get from the siloed, fragmented, and poorly interoperable data landscape in supply chains today to discoverable, verifiable, and linked Web3 assets on OriginTrail DKG? Enter Trace Labs’ Network Operating System (nOS), designed to streamline the connection between legacy IT systems (ERP, WMS, LMS, and others) — where data that can be transformed into assets is stored — and OriginTrail DKG.</p>Network Operating System (nOS&nbsp;)<p>nOS allows organizations to create, update, and utilize their supply chain assets on OriginTrail DKG from existing data in their IT systems in a simplified way, without the need to deal with complexities usually associated with decentralized infrastructure (e.g. crypto token management is automated with nOS). This is facilitated with three sets of tools within&nbsp;nOS:</p>  Data ingestion tools, enabling organizations to easily connect nOS to their IT systems and set up automated (API-based) or manual data ingestion, depending on their business requirements. For example, an organization can set up an automated connection to its Transport Management System (TMS), ensuring shipment data is ingested as it becomes available.  Asset creation tools, allowing organizations to transform their data into discoverable, verifiable, and linked assets on OriginTrail DKG. This set of tools also allows the application of different sets of global data standards (e.g. GS1 EPCIS, W3C Verifiable Credentials, eBill of Lading, eCMR, etc.), ensuring created assets are fully interoperable. For example, an organization that has extracted shipment event data from its TMS can transform that data into GS1 EPCIS 2.0 structured assets.  Asset querying tools, providing organizations with an easy way to query for assets on OriginTrail DKG for use in their business applications such as supply chain traceability, credential verification, and others. For example, an organization (or multiple organizations in a supply chain network) that has created GS1 EPCIS 2.0 structured assets can set up the necessary queries to utilize those assets in its track and trace application.  <p>With the help of nOS, turning siloed data into discoverable and verifiable assets on OriginTrail has never been&nbsp;easier.</p> So what’s&nbsp;next? <p>OriginTrail DKG introduces a new, asset-focused paradigm to global supply chains that can be a significant enabler for a variety of other metaverse technologies, ranging from augmented reality and AI to Internet of Things (IoT) and next-generation digital twins. All these technologies require a strong foundation to deliver business value and this is where OriginTrail DKG plays an important role. And with nOS facilitating the transition from siloed data in legacy IT systems to verifiable Web3 assets on OriginTrail DKG, we are on a strong path towards the vision of metaverse-enabled global supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tracelabs.io">Facebook</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/trace-labs/">LinkedIn</a></p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/from-data-to-assets-transforming-global-supply-chains-with-origintrail-decentralized-knowledge-4c2aaa7e622d">From Data to Assets: Transforming Global Supply Chains with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This year we<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/" title=""> started an organisational project to improve our digital resilience</a>. We use the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that enable an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its people and to adopt infrastructures that respond to ever-changing needs and contexts.</p>



<p>Throughout this project we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/mapping-digital-resilience-challenges-in-social-justice-organisations-learnings-from-our-partners/" title="">mapped digital resilience issues</a> that social justice organisations we work with are facing, as well as strategies to approach them. One of the overall findings was that organisations are going through constant change both internally and externally due to factors outside their control. Challenges such as organisational changes, contextual shifts in the region, pandemic effects on human resources and even new tools can result in fundamental shifts to the ways we work internally.</p>



<p>For this reason, The Engine Room will be hosting a Community Call December 8th at 10am ET to create a peer-to-peer space as a way to address this need to share what we’ve learned in the last year. We will be presenting our own learnings from our attempts to adapt to change as well as facilitate a conversation to reflect on challenges and ways to address and adapt to them going forward.</p>



<p>Register <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEqf--tqTwrGdWM339n_53Aci90Gm0kKfoL" title="">HERE</a>.</p>



<p>All are welcome! Whether you’re a practitioner, a civil society organisation working with impacted communities, or just keen to learn more, join us at our Community Call. See you on December 8th!</p>

<p>Industry experts to share insights into how FIDO and related technologies can bring passwordless authentication to IoT</p>



<p>Mountain View, Calif., November 22, 2022 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today announces its latest Authenticate Virtual Summit: <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/securely-onboarding-all-the-things-the-fido-fit-in-iot/">Securely Onboarding All the Things: The FIDO Fit in IoT,</a> sponsored by Daon and Nok Nok. Responding to rising industry demand for more insight into the role of FIDO and passwordless technology in IoT, the free event will offer attendees expert perspectives and education from leading industry organizations and solution providers on strengthening authentication in IoT. The program will take place virtually on December 7 2022, from 8:00am – 12:00pm PT, and will be made available to registrants on-demand following the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lack of IoT security standards and outdated processes, such as shipping with default password credentials and manual onboarding, leave devices and the networks they operate on open to large-scale attacks. As the IoT market continues to grow, <a href="https://internetofbusiness.com/iot-spending-to-hit-1-2-trillion-by-2022-claims-idc/">projected to surpass the $1 trillion mark in 2022</a>, the FIDO Alliance formed the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/working-groups/">IoT Technical Working Group</a> to address these challenges – aiming to provide a comprehensive authentication framework for IoT devices relying on passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched in 2021, the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/intro-to-fido-device-onboard/">FIDO Device Onboard (FDO)</a> specification is the working group’s first output: an open IoT standard which enables devices to simply and securely onboard to cloud and on-premise management platforms. The upcoming virtual summit will delve into this specification and FIDO’s role in IoT with speakers from Intel, Qualcomm, FIDO Alliance and more:</p>

<p>By&nbsp;Chris Ferreira, Senior Program Manager, DIACC. Additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee</p>


 
 
 
<p>I remember the first time I played a video game as if it was yesterday. My older brother spent an entire summer working so he could afford to buy an Atari 2600 game console which was the pinnacle of home gaming entertainment at the time. News of this purchase spread like wildfire and the next thing we knew, we had a room full of kids and adults huddled around a TV playing Pac-Man and Asteroids for hours. From that moment forward, I was a gamer for life.</p>



<p>Today, the video game industry is larger than the movie and music industries combined, drawing in over 2 billion gamers worldwide. The industry generates a staggering amount of revenue annually. In 2020, players <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/gaming-industry-worth/#gref">spent $4.5 billion USD on immersive games</a>, also known as Virtual Reality gaming, alone. When considering console sales, gaming subscriptions, mobile gaming, and micro-transactions (i.e., in-game purchases with real-world money), that revenue figure skyrockets.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>By the end of 2021, the video game market generated more than <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/the-games-market-in-2021-the-year-in-numbers-esports-cloud-gaming">$180 billion USD</a> in revenue and it’s predicted that the global gaming market is set to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/292056/video-game-market-value-worldwide/">reach over $268 billion USD by 2025</a>.</p>



<p>So how does Digital Identity come into play?</p>



<p>Digital Identity can be defined as a digital representation that uniquely identifies a person and can be used to verify their identity when they want to access services. Look at it as a way to prove who you are online without the need for paper documents such as a driver’s license. People who use Google or Facebook profiles to create accounts or login to a particular service&nbsp;already have a form of Digital Identity. When used properly, Digital Identity can even help ensure video gaming is done securely and safely by protecting personal information and virtual treasures from being stolen.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/tencent-uses-facial-recognition-to-ban-kids-gaming-past-bedtime#:~:text=The%20system%20works%20by%20scanning,offline%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20company%20said.">Facial recognition systems are being deployed</a> to prevent young gamers from playing age-gated content and between certain hours of the day. The hugely successful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox">Roblox</a> game has introduced an optional age verification for its users that will combine an ID check with a selfie scan that will be required to access in-game voice chat features and will allow developers to “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/roblox-to-add-opt-in-age-verification-for-players-and-developers/">create new experiences that will rely on identity verification in the future</a>”. Facial recognition technology can provide a much more secure and trusted way of verifying a person’s identity compared to simply using a user name and password. However, these tactics, although stemming from good intentions, are being scrutinized by some privacy groups who have concerns with how securely a person’s data is being stored, where the data is being kept, and by whom the data can be accessed by.</p>


 
 
 

 



 
<p>With an industry that generates such significant global revenue, it’s bound to attract the attention of cyberattackers looking to steal company and gamer data for malicious use. Video game companies are targeted frequently because they don’t need to adhere to the same security and regulatory requirements as other organizations such as banks or hospitals that are mandated to protect client data. As with most people, gamers are exposed to security risks as they often use the same or weak passwords across multiple sites which makes it easy for hackers to obtain their login credentials. It’s an awful feeling to log into your game to see all your virtual items and in-game currency – that took hours, days, and months to accumulate – stolen by an unknown virtual bandit. Or worse, hackers often steal gamers’ personal information and even financial information like credit card details.</p>
 
 
 


<p>Fortunately, game studios have started taking these risks and threats seriously by ensuring that seamless account security mechanisms are in place. Game studios are also increasing their player’s awareness when it comes to their identity management controls so they understand the risks associated with password and account sharing and purchasing game add-ons from unapproved vendors. <a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/should-you-use-2fa-for-my-online-gaming-accounts.html">Two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) is becoming more common practice amongst gamers to improve their security and reduce chances of account takeover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Major game studios are stepping up to do their part to protect their customers’ information while at the same time being more aggressive with their internal operational security measures to prevent their game code from being stolen. Concepts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI) are also coming into play allowing gamers even more control over their personal information’s use. When game studio Midnight Society released their video game DeadDrop, they integrated Digital Identity that was verified via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a>. During the game’s testing period, players were issued digital credentials that allowed them to access the beta through the <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon Blockchain</a> network. Those digital credentials would allow the user to validate their identity and play the game before its release.</p>



<p>For gamers, their data is under constant threat but there are things that can be done to protect themselves from cyber-villains such as:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Using strong passwords or a password manager and avoiding using the same passwords for several accounts to prevent brute force attacks.&nbsp; 



 Being suspicious of emails appearing to be from their game’s studio asking them to login into their game account. No company should ever ask a person to share their password under any circumstances. 



 Using a <a href="https://vpn-services.bestreviews.net/gaming-vpn-seasoned-gamers-secret-weapon/">VPN</a> (Virtual Private Network) to make the computer’s location unclear for added protection. 



 Setting up two-factor authentication to ensure that a hacker can’t access their account even if they manage to steal their password. 



 Only downloading game add-ons from trusted and verified sources.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Digital Identity and video games will continue to be embedded into our social fabric. And much like gamers wanting to protect their virtual characters from countless dangers, the same care should be taken with their real-life personal data. Evolving Digital Identity solutions, policies, and governance will be essential to ensuring gamers’ virtual, and real-world loot, remains safe and sound.</p>

<p>This week I had the opportunity to take part in the GS1 Healthcare Conference in Paris together with BSI’s Global Director for Healthcare, Courtney Soulsby. As usual, GS1 event brought together a lot of people and organizations looking for innovative approaches to solving the industry’s biggest challenges. Speaking with some of the largest players in the space, a few recurring themes were present across the majority of our conversations that showcased how Web3 assets can play a key role in addressing them.</p>Courtney Soulsby, BSI’s Global Director for Healthcare, and Jurij Skornik, Trace Labs’ General Manager at Global GS1 Healthcare Conference<p>While today the Web3 industry might be appearing in the news for a plethora of reasons, I’m certain that the true and biggest opportunities are being seized by those focusing on education and building tangible value. By understanding how we can leverage this technology, we can address some of humanity’s biggest challenges, like those present in the industry that comprises ⅔ of the world’s GDP — supply chains. Here are 3 pain points that were mentioned often in our conversations in Paris and can very effectively be addressed using Web3 technology:</p>  Access to information — actionable knowledge derived from information that is currently scattered across supply chain networks can unlock possibilities of precise alignment of supply and demand; quality/origin claims backed by verifiable data; forward tracking to minimize diversions and gray market sales; and many other high-impact solutions.  Digital twins — creating a Web3 asset representation of a physical product, digital certificate/credential, or even a service — is a game changer. Not only are you able to have a much more precise understanding of asset ownership (chain of custody), but you have a single place to access key information about each product. This can be useful in ensuring product authenticity (counterfeit medicine is a huge problem), precise patient support during complex treatments and pin-pointing critical items in the unfortunate event of&nbsp;recalls.  Expanding the supply chain — no supply chain today ends at the point of sale but rather extends to the consumer, and in the event of circular approaches, can even end up back at the producer. In healthcare, the element of extending the supply chain towards patients is more and more critical. Receiving real-time information about the correct effects of the medicine and medical devices can not only hugely increase the speed of innovation but also save lives. However, a big challenge of handling patient data and providing direct incentives for data sharing exists, both of which Web3 assets can be the right solution&nbsp;for.  <p>The discussions we had also came as a great validation for solutions we’re building at Trace Labs. With the new OriginTrail — decentralized knowledge graph version 6 (DKG V6) — enabling us to describe any supply chain using Web3 assets as building blocks we can tackle all these huge challenges head-on.</p><p>Before signing off — Trace Labs is also releasing a big update to our Network Operating System (nOS) allowing us to address challenges like those above with efficient deployments. Having it entirely transformed to fully exploit the new and more efficient DKG V6, the nOS now allows any user to evolve the data structured according to GS1 and other important data standards into Web3 assets that can be made discoverable (available) and verifiable for plethora of business cases (some solutions built on top of the nOS can be seen here). The nOS also abstracts all complexities with regards to digital assets required to use the public decentralized infrastructure, so all you have to focus on is creating value for your business.</p>Network Operating System&nbsp;(nOS)<p>Subscribe to <a href="https://origintrail.io/">our newsletter</a> to be among the first ones to receive news about the latest technology updates!</p><p>P.S.: The croissants in Paris were amazing,&nbsp;too.</p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tracelabs.io">Facebook</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/trace-labs/">LinkedIn</a></p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/gs1-healthcare-conference-paris-was-more-than-just-croissants-89ad2b7fedd9">GS1 Healthcare Conference: Paris was more than just croissants</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introduction  <p>Soulbonds are evolving NFTs that reflect a Web3 user's on-chain activity. Users can construct, customize and upgrade their Souls (using 220+ hand-drawn traits) to represent adventures they’ve embarked on and tailor the NFT to their unique experience. </p><p>"The Soul becomes their reflection in the decentralized web, a true reflection of their digital identity," the Soulbonds teams says. </p><p>Soulbonds chose to build on Ceramic to significantly improve usability. With Ceramic, users can apply new traits to their NFTs when they obtain on-chain achievements. Leveraging Ceramic to update Soulbonds metadata avoids all costs related to these data transactions.</p><p>"Storing Soulbonds data on Ceramic also offers users a decentralized gateway that allows Soulbonds the same accessibility as IPFS, removing any centralization risk or server damage, and ensures that user content remains permanently available," the Soulbonds team says. </p><p>Ultimately, Ceramic enables Soulbonds to store data in a decentralized way without incurring transaction fees for users.</p><p>Before creating Soulbonds, the team noticed a lack of popular projects that allow the customization of NFTs. Using a centralized server with APIs was one possible solution to create evolving NFTs. Zerion DNA, for example, offers customizable NFTs but it comes at the cost of losing decentralization. The Soulbonds team also considered another option: upgrading NFTs via on-chain transactions; however, this approach would become prohibitively expensive for users frequently updating their data.</p><p>The team chose to build Soulbonds on Ceramic because of its ability to perform off-chain data updates in a decentralized environment. </p> Ceramic Offers Mutability and Decentralization  <p>NFTs are a set of links between blockchain addresses, NFT metadata, and media content. These links could lead to:</p>  Centralized servers of the project company (i.e. CryptoKitties)  Decentralized storage (i.e. Arweave or IPFS)  <p>Decentralized storage solutions like Arweave or IPFS are immutable—this means that changing the stored content is usually impossible for certain use cases, like an ever-evolving NFT. From a security point of view, immutable storage is important, but it limits the number of possible applications (like the ability for NFTs to evolve). On Arweave or IPFS, a change in content means that the link also changes, this requires paying gas fees on blockchains every time. This can be a big issue for NFT projects that allow customization to be done frequently, since they need to use a proxy that will contain the latest version of the NFT.</p><p>Ceramic allows decentralized access to the entire history of changes affecting the Soulbonds NFT (including new features), as well as the most recent version of the metadata. With Ceramic, users do not have to pay for updates or sacrifice decentralization.</p> How Soulbonds Built With Ceramic <p>For Soulbonds, Ceramic stores a sequential stream of metadata along with links to media stored on IPFS.

This comes as experts anticipate advanced phishing attacks will rise next year. “I think social engineering and MFA bypass attacks will continue to grow in 2023, where some other major service providers suffer meaningful breaches like we did this year,” Andrew Shikiar says.</p>

<p>Poor password hygiene is the root cause of more than 80% of data breaches, according to the FIDO Alliance. Efforts to ditch easy-to-guess, phrase-based passwords are gaining more traction with the adoption of passkeys, paving the way for the passwordless future cybersecurity pros dream of. Growing passkey adoption requires widespread availability, industry collaboration and regulatory support, says FIDO Alliance executive director Andrew Shikiar.</p>

 <a href="https://bit.ly/3FhT38G">Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) v1.0</a> with Paul Knowles (Human Colossus Foundation) 
 
 
 Nov. 2 Peter Langenkamp (TNO) presented about a cluster of interoperability centered on <a href="https://eassi.ssi-lab.nl/">TNO EASSI</a>.
 
 "eassi strives to improve the usability of SSI in real life by providing basic functionality that assists in issuing and verifying credentials to and from multiple wallets."

 Find the pockets of interop
 
 Which companies interop with what other companies; build bridges between the pockets 
 
 
 Interop testing
 
 Don't boil the ocean. Start with small targets. Let the question "what are we trying to accomplish with interop?" guide the targets. 
 Interested in a public assessment framework. 
 Bonnie Yau of IDLab mentioned they're working on a framework, starting from (or modelled after) the Aries Agent Test Harness. 
 
 
 Approaches to Localization
 
 BC Gov gave a demo of a localized wallet app with credential localization using OCA. (Link to demo pending) 
 What other approaches? 
 
 
 What does "interoperable" mean to different communities?
 
 Often gets thrown around in marketing jargon but what are some real metrics for defining whether something is "interoperable?" 
 
 
 Wallet UX
 
 There might be some other working groups focused on UX already. There might be some overlap with interop.

<p>This article explains how a programmable framework of impact evaluators can be built on top of Ceramic in order to distribute rewards to a wide range of community contributors—allowing DAOs to distribute funds more effectively to the people that create meaningful value.</p> What is an impact evaluator? <p>Impact evaluators (IE) are not new. The Bitcoin block reward is likely the simplest, and oldest, example of an impact evaluator. It’s an objective function that takes a measure of the world and distributes rewards based on that measure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1soPQ31ZHkQ">Juan Benet defines</a> an impact evaluator as follows:</p> <code>ImpactEvaluator {
  foreach round {
    m := measure(world)
    w := evaluate(m)
    r := reward(w)
  }
}
</code> <p>The IE runs iteratively in rounds, with each round distributing a reward. There isn’t really a limit as to what the IE can measure and reward. However, it’s important that the measure is fairly objective and as non-gameable as possible. The more objective and immutable the IE is the more powerful it can generally become since actors interacting with it can reason about rewards long into the future.</p> Examples in Practice   Bitcoin block reward: Rewards miners based in <code>minerHashRate/totalHashRate</code>  Filecoin block reward: Rewards miners based on storage capacity they add to the network  <a href="https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/summoning-the-money-god-2a3f3564a5f2">RAI PID controller</a>: Rewards all participants based on the market rate of the RAI token  <a href="https://sourcecred.io/">Sourcecred</a>: Rewards contributors on Github, Discord, etc. based on a weighed page rank algorithm  <a href="https://coordinape.com/">Coordinape</a>: Rewards contributors based on the rating and feedback of other contributors  <a href="https://givepraise.xyz/">Praise by GivEth</a>: Rewards contributors based on how much “praise” they received  <a href="https://www.openq.dev/">OpenQ</a>: Rewards developers for closing PRs  <a href="https://jogl.io/">Just One Giant Lab</a>: Community peer reviews   Govrn <p><a href="https://medium.com/govrn/govrn-governance-model-27603e6dedd9">Govrn</a> stands out, from other projects tracking contributions in a social graph, since it allows projects to create an ontology of various types of contributions, which lets the IE of the DAO dynamically evolve over time.</p> Three Modalities of Rewards <p>There are thee main methods of distributing the rewards of an IE.</p> Rewards From DAO Treasuries <p>The <code>r</code> of the IE comes directly from the DAO treasury that is operating the IE. This can be seen as a way to reward the community of the DAO more effectively than running a grant program, or as a more fair continuous airdrop.</p> New Token <p>With a new token, an IE can mimic the Bitcoin reward curve. This can be seen as a fair launch based on the evaluation criteria of the IE.</p> Governance Shares <p>In certain DAO structures, such as Moloch, members hold non-transferable shares. An IE could easily be made to distribute these sort of shares as well. Here a Bitcoin-like reward curve could be used as well, and could be customized for the DAO in question.</p> Verifiable Data on Ceramic <p>Data written to Ceramic (e.g. using ComposeDB, Ceramic’s decentralized graph database) is ideal for creating verifiable contribution graphs. This is due to three main properties:</p>  Hash linked event logs - all data is stored as streams in Ceramic. A stream is an event log that can be independently verified by anyone who runs a node in the network  Timestamps - all streams are periodically anchored into the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof timestamp of when data was created  Attributable - all streams have one account as the controller and all events added to a stream needs to be signed by this controller. In practice the controller is a blockchain account (e.g. Ethereum address)   Trust Graphs and Evaluations <p>The framework for IE’s should be programmable such that developers can create their own IE for whatever actions they want to reward their community for. In order to reason about what this programming framework would look like we need to consider what data goes into the evaluation.</p> Data Apps on Ceramic <p>Some example of DAO-centric apps that can be built on Ceramic’s data layer:</p>  Issue tracking - who opened and closed issues  Project management - planning and management of projects  Personal contribution logs - individuals can state all the contributions they have made and to which projects / DAOs the contribution might be valuable for (this is the approach MetaCred is using)  Governance forums - proposals, discussions, etc.  Contribution evaluation - data similar to Coordinape or Praise  Knowledge graphs - e.g. Lateral’s Discourse Graph, or Foresight institute’s tech trees   Computation Over the Contribution DAG <p>All data in Ceramic is represented as an <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> DAG. An IE would have a specific CID (content identifier) hash that represents the entire contribution graph and runs the computation over this graph. This will make the computation easily reproducible, as long as it is deterministic.</p> Trusted Seed <p>In order to mitigate the issue of sybil accounts adding random or noisy data, an initial set of accounts that the graph is based upon is likely a good idea. This can be a simple list at first, but it should eventually leverage something like <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-builds-passport-on-ceramic/">Gitcoin Passport</a>. In addition to the initial trusted seed, the set of eligible accounts could grow through attestations according to some web-of-trust-like logic in the IE.</p> Evaluation Function <p>Let’s explore what the IE function will run each round.</p> World <p>First we need to measure the world. We can define a completely verifiable world as follows:</p>  Ceramic Data Models - the IE model would select a set of Ceramic models from which to read contribution data  Trusted seed - the set of accounts that root the trust of the contribution graph  Previously distributed rewards - the rewards that have been distributed in previous rounds  Other data - potentially including data from other sources, such as on-chain state   Evaluator <p>The evaluator itself should be a function with the world as parameters, and return a reward as a list of accounts and value. This function should be easy to implement in a general programming language. Something like Javascript (using <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-ses">Secure Ecmascript</a>) or WASM would make sense.</p><p>The world input parameters could be defined as follows:</p> <code>ImpactEvaluatorParams {
  ceramicData: [CID] // a list of CIDs defining the contribution graph DAG
  trustedSeed: [DID] // a list of initially trusted accounts
  previousRewards: CID // a merkle root of previous rewards
  otherData: CID // other verifiable data, e.g. ethereum state
}
</code> <p>The output of the IE, ideally, is easily claimable on-chain. It could be a CSV file for distributing tokens in Safe. These sort of distributions can be quite expensive as the contribution set grows. A better approach is to use some sort of merkle drop, basically putting the rewards in a merkle tree and allowing people to claim rewards as they see fit. <a href="https://github.com/Astrodrop/shrine">AstroDrop</a> is a good example of this that allows you to easily update the merkle tree. A merkle tree can also be represented in IPLD, which is nice for our compute function. The return value would likely need to return an updated trusted seed, as well, to enable growing of the user set using some sort of web-of-trust model.</p> <code>ImpactEvaluatorResult {
  rewards: CID // merkle root of rewards
  newTrustedSeed: [DID] // an updated list of trusted accounts
}
</code> <p>Ideally subsets of the IE function can be reused as modules and are composable.</p> Bringing Results On-Chain <p>The result of the IE needs to be put on-chain every round so that participants can claim rewards. There are a few different approaches to this outlined below.</p>  Oracles - A trusted third party, a set of nodes, or some sophisticated oracle network could be used to put the merkle tree root on-chain. Ideally there is some dispute mechanism that can be used if the oracle misbehaves. Worth noting is that the IE function should be reproducible / deterministic. This means that it’s straight forward for an outside observer to determine if the oracle behaved well or not  Verification game - A verification game like fraud proofs in optimistic rollups or Truebit. These can be quite complicated to implement but possible as a way to reduce trust assumptions  ZKP - In principle the entire IE function can be evaluated in a zk circuit and the proof posted on-chain. This would make the IE’s completely trustless. However, it would be a quite big undertaking to implement provers for every IE. It would be more convenient to rely on some sort of general circuit. Something like <a href="https://github.com/DelphinusLab/zkWasm">zkWasm</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lurk-lang">Lurk</a> could be good candidates   A Practical Approach <p>In order to bring the programmable IE primitive to as many DAOs as possible a good first approach would be an integration with <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Safe</a> using <a href="https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started">Zodiac’s reality</a> module. Reality is a configurable oracle that uses Reality.eth. It could be easily used to put the root of the reward merkle tree on-chain, attached to some custom logic. In practice, every round some off-chain actor would load all Ceramic streams and associated data, run the IE function over this data (e.g. using <a href="https://www.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a>), and make a call to the Reality.eth oracle on-chain. Other actors can run the same computation over the same data and dispute the result if necessary. Final arbitration could be handled by the Kleros court, for example. Note that, in contrast to normal arbitrations that Kleros deals with, here we have a completely objective outcome that the arbiters will need to judge. They can easily run the computation for themselves to see the desired result.</p> Next steps   <a href="https://app.radius.space/grants/a644017a-fd11-4ae4-8e86-0d0293ddd0c1">Apply for the MVP implementation grant!</a> Ceramic and Bacalhau have put together a joint grant to fund the development of an MVP impact evaluator protocol  <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Share your Impact Evaluator ideas on the Ceramic forum</a>  Eventually there might be an IE that rewards apps adding valuable data to the Ceramic network

 RMI Partners with Energy Web to Build Sustainable Aviation Fuel Certificate Registry, as Part of Ongoing Decarbonization Work with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers&nbsp;Alliance  A digital registry for sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) can give corporate fliers, fuel suppliers, the aviation sector, and its investors confidence to aim higher and scale&nbsp;faster. <p>Boulder, CO — November 16, 2022 <br>RMI and Energy Web Foundation today announced that they will build a digital registry for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates that will bring more transparency to emissions reduction claims about air travel. The registry will also support and accelerate the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels that drastically reduce lifecycle emissions from air transport.</p><p>The registry will support ongoing work with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (<a href="https://rmi.org/saba">SABA</a>), a coalition of corporate buyers and aviators committed to decarbonizing aviation, co-founded by RMI and the Environmental Defense&nbsp;Fund</p><blockquote>“RMI is very excited to see this crucial tool to fruition,” said Bryan Fisher, managing director for RMI’s Climate-Aligned Industries Program. “A transparent, easy-to-use registry built on a rigorous accounting approach will lift public confidence in SAF emissions reduction claims, propel investment in SAF production, and accelerate decarbonization of the aviation&nbsp;sector.”</blockquote><p>SAF is a drop-in fuel made with renewable or waste feedstocks that can decrease the lifecycle emissions of flight by up to 99 percent. Currently, SAF production is insufficient to meet demand from corporate flyers that aim to decarbonize flights taken by their employees and&nbsp;goods.</p><p>SAF certificates enable companies and other aviation customers to pay for the environmental benefits (such as emissions reductions) of SAF, even if the physical fuel is not yet available for their flights. Decoupling the environmental attributes of SAF from the physical fuel will democratize access to SAF’s benefits and catalyze SAF supply at scale. A digital registry in which SAFc can be securely and consistently issued, transferred, and retired is critical to ensure that these certificates represent unique and verified emissions reduction claims.</p><blockquote>“This registry is a wonderful opportunity to showcase how technology can bring transparency and trust to complex supply chains like SAF,” said Jesse Morris, CEO at Energy Web. “And by building the registry open source, the SAF industry can help other hard-to-decarbonize sectors understand what’s possible with digital technology.”</blockquote><p>The registry will enable SAF suppliers, airlines, corporate flyers, freight carriers, logistics service providers, and freight shippers to demonstrate and verify that the SAF and SAFc they invest in meets specific sustainability criteria linked to certifications of each fuel’s supply chain. It will support companies’ ability to make auditable claims about their investments in climate disclosures.</p><blockquote>“The development of the SAFc registry represents the first major milestone for the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, making good on our promise to break down roadblocks and create the tools necessary to decarbonize the aviation sector,” said Kim Carnahan, head of SABA’s Secretariat and Senior Director for Net Zero Fuels at Engie&nbsp;Impact.</blockquote><p>The SAFc registry is expected to go live in mid-2023.</p><p>Media inquiries please&nbsp;contact:</p><p>Alexandra Jardine Wall, Strategic Communications Manager for the Climate-Aligned Industries Program, RMI.

<p>The ToIP Foundation is pleased to announce the release of the first public review draft of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0</a>. This document specifies the architectural requirements for the ToIP Technology Stack shown on the left side of the diagram below. (The first generation requirements for the ToIP Governance Stack on the right side were <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/02/01/the-toip-foundation-releases-its-first-official-governance-specifications/">published in January 2022</a>.)</p>







<p>This first public review draft represents over a thousand collective hours of work by members of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Architecture Task Force</a> of the ToIP <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Stack Working Group</a>. It is divided into 12 sections:</p>



 
 Introduction 



 Terminology 



 Motivations 



 Audience, Purpose, and Scope 



 Example Use Cases 



 Reference Architecture Overview 



 Endpoint Systems and the Layered Stack 



 The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol 



 Intermediary Systems 



 Supporting Systems 



 Endpoint System Interoperability 



 Integration with the ToIP Governance Stack 
 



<p>It also includes three helpful Appendices:</p>



 
 Consolidated Requirements — a table of all 30 normative architectural requirements broken down by layer 



 Consolidated Views of the ToIP Stack — a set of diagrams showing different ways of viewing the technology stack as a whole. 



 Evolution of the ToIP Stack — a synopsis of the new living document published by the ToIP Foundation — <a>see below</a>. 
 



 The Hourglass Model 



<p>Of the 17 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a> developed by the ToIP Foundation in 2021, perhaps none is more important than #3, the Hourglass Model. It can be summarized as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In a layered protocol architecture, the most successful design takes an hourglass shape where a single “spanning layer” in the middle connects a family of higher-level application-facing protocols with a family of lower-level transport protocols.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Hourglass Model is widely cited as the key reason for the success of the TCP/IP stack that gave us the Internet. Here is a depiction of the TCP/IP “hourglass” from a <a href="https://www.iab.org/wp-content/IAB-uploads/2010/11/hourglass-london-ietf.pdf">2001 IETF presentation</a> by Steve Deering of Cisco:</p>







<p>As this diagram shows, for the TCP/IP stack, the spanning layer is the IP protocol in the middle. For the ToIP stack, the spanning layer is the ToIP trust spanning protocol, as shown in this figure from section 6.2 of the specification:</p>







<p>The importance of the trust spanning layer is reflected in the fact that 60% (18 out of 30) of the requirements in the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0 are for this layer. The full implications of the Hourglass Model — when applied to establishing Internet-wide decentralized digital trust infrastructure — are further suggested by this diagram from Appendix B of the ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification:</p>







 The Public Review Process 



<p>The release of the first public review draft of the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0 is just the first step in completing the specification. The ToIP Technology Stack Working Group is reaching out to all related industry organizations and stakeholders for feedback. We plan to publish at least one (and possibly several) additional public review drafts before the 1.0 spec is finalized.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">draft specification</a> is available in both PDF and Markdown formats. To provide feedback on the draft specification, please <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">see the instructions on this page</a>.</p>



 Evolution of the ToIP Stack 



<p>The release of the ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification for public review is the next major milestone in a multi-year process of fully defining the ToIP stack. To help audiences outside the ToIP Foundation better understand this planned progression of deliverables, the Foundation has also published a new living document called <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/evolution-of-the-toip-stack/">Evolution of the ToIP Stack</a>. This document explains the four major stages of development as illustrated in this diagram:</p>







<p>The Evolution of the ToIP Stack also includes a mapping of existing technologies and specifications to the ToIP technology stack. Since this mapping will evolve both as the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification and the component technologies/specifications evolve, the ToIP Foundation intends to publish new versions of the Evolution of the ToIP Stack at each major evolutionary milestone. You can track new versions of the document <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/evolution-of-the-toip-stack/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In October, the Human Colossus Foundation <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/oca-v1-launch">released</a> the “Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)” and announced the intent to launch the “Decentralised Semantics Working Group (DSWG)”. The DSWG is where the ongoing active development of OCA and future decentralised semantics standards at the Foundation will occur. A month on, the Foundation is officially launching the DSWG and inviting you to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/geneve-new-technology-meetup-group/events/289662414/">join the kickoff call</a> on Thursday, November 17th, at 17.00 CET.</p><p>Decentralised Semantics is an exciting new data domain spearheaded by the Foundation to enable the structuring of unstructured data with morphologic, semantic, and pragmatic accuracy. It is an essential underpinning of our envisioned Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) and guides tooling development for the DDE Semantic Layer (Layer 1 of the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure</a>). One of the first tools we created for the Semantic Layer is the recently released OCA, an architecture for capturing the metadata necessary to interpret and preserve the meaning of inputted data.</p><p>OCA is the Foundation’s proposed global standard for data capture that promises to significantly enhance the ability to define, manage, and use data in terms of simplicity, accuracy, and allocation of resources. The DSWG will maintain the official<a href="https://oca.colossi.network/"> OCA </a><a href="https://oca.colossi.network/specification/">Technical Specification</a>, generate Source Code for open-access schemas, and create and maintain related datasets and assets to benefit the<a href="https://oca.colossi.network/ecosystem/tour.html"> OCA Ecosystem</a> (a reference implementation of the OCA specification). We also expect to discover further standardisation and tooling needs for Decentralised Semantics through the Working Group.</p><p>Paul Knowles and Ryan Barrett will co-chair the DSWG. Paul is a co-founder of the Foundation and the Head of our Advisory Council. Paul plays an instrumental role in identifying and defining Decentralised Semantics. He is also the inventor of OCA, the brainchild of his over 20 years of experience in roles spanning different stages of the data management cycle. Ryan is an independent Tech Lead/Architect with over 20 years of experience building and designing reliable and innovative software systems. He currently represents the Dutch Ministry of Health as a Technical Architect after playing a leading role in the pandemic Contact Tracing and Vaccination Passport systems.</p><p>The Working Group will meet weekly on Thursday at 5 pm CET. We will release more information about how to join the Working Group and contribute on the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/decentralised-semantics-wg">website</a>. For the kickoff call, we will walk through the DSWG Charter, provide an overview of the current status of OCA, give a brief synopsis of the short-term roadmap, and describe the standard <a href="https://github.com/the-human-colossus-foundation/oca-spec">Request for Comment (RFCs) lifecycle</a> for OCA development.</p><p>To learn more about Decentralised Semantics and OCA before the kickoff, we recommend the following resources:</p>  <p>The New Blog Post - “A quest for accurate data (Part 1)” [<a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/accuratedata1">Link</a>]</p>  <p>The Academic Paper - “Decentralised semantics in distributed ecosystems” [<a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3249/paper4-OSS.pdf">Link</a>]</p>  <p>The OCA Technical Specification [<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/634d55c7cb2c9a43206480c1/1666012626086/HCF+Overlays+Capture+Architecture+%28OCA%29+v1.pdf">Link</a>]</p>  <p>We look forward to meeting you at the Decentralised Semantics Working Group kickoff meeting on Thursday, November 17th, at 17.00 CET!</p>

<p></p>     <p>Increasing demand for batteries in consumer electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and grid support has accelerated the global market. In the U.S. alone, batteries landed in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/11/30/supply-chain-challenge-20-complex-auto-industry-transitions-to-electric/?sh=563ed5cc1192">top 3 imports</a> for September 2021. Globally, EVs are projected to make up <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/26/electric-vehicles-projected-to-make-up-31-of-the-global-fleet-by-2050/">31% of all light-duty vehicles by 2050</a>. This increased demand — in addition to recent proposed legislation such as the EU’s carbon border tax — puts pressure on battery manufacturers, suppliers, and vehicle manufacturers (OEMs) to ensure a safe, secure, efficient, and sustainable global battery value chain.</p>
<p>As demand skyrockets, we’re seeing a surge in new regulations surrounding the composition, manufacturing, usage, and recycling of batteries around the globe. Battery labeling — which includes attaching physical labels to a battery to provide its unique characteristics, such as number of cells, cell chemistry, dimensions, and more — is of particular interest to regulators and battery supply chain stakeholders hoping to increase visibility and efficiency as well as reduce the margin of error in battery recycling, reuse, and repurposing procedures.</p>
                      <p>The European Commission (EC) lays out clear requirements for battery labeling in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02006L0066-20131230&amp;rid=1">Directive 2006/66/EC</a> and amendments to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020&amp;from=EN">Regulation (EU) No 2019/1020</a>. EC regulations specify size and location requirements for the label, stating that all batteries must meet these labeling requirements to be placed on the market in the EU. For example, the EU will require batteries measuring above 2 kWh to provide carbon footprint labeling.</p>
<p>The California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) Lithium-ion Car Battery Recycling Advisory Group also mentioned battery labeling in its <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/2022_AB-2832_Lithium-Ion-Car-Battery-Recycling-Advisory-Goup-Final-Report.pdf">final report</a>, released in March 2022. In this report, the advisory group suggests requiring OEMs in California to attach standardized physical battery labels to help with reuse, repurposing, and recycling efforts. The California Air Resource Board (CARB) is also developing a labeling requirement as part of their proposed <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-cars-program/advanced-clean-cars-ii">Advanced Clean Cars II</a> regulation.</p>
<p>At MOBI, we believe that trusted multiparty track-and-trace systems are needed to effectively manage assets in the value chain, enhance interoperability between stakeholders, and empower consumers to make informed purchasing decisions with confidence. In addition to spurring second-life and recycling use cases, battery labeling is also necessary to enable trusted track-and-trace applications for battery manufacturers, OEMs, and consumers, as peer-to-peer traceability requires that all participants reference a standardized framework for identifying assets as they travel upstream and downstream the value chain. Labeling is a foundational element for recording battery State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) data, managing battery-electric-grid integration, tracking maintenance and repairs, managing recalls, and more.</p>
                          <p>In July 2022, MOBI released the <a href="http://dlt.mobi/standards/">Battery Identification Number (BIN) Technical Specifications</a>, which specifies the format, content, and physical requirements for a globally unique identity of battery packs. The BIN is composed of a Battery Manufacturer Identifier (BMI), a Battery Descriptor Section (BDS), and a Battery Identifier Section (BIS), each of which denotes a battery’s specific characteristics, integrated with a unique and traceable identity. Similar to the vehicle identification number (VIN), the BIN is designed to be a physical indelible identity included on the battery’s physical label. The unique BIN number can be included as an attribute in a digital identity such as the one standardized by MOBI called Battery Birth Certificate, which is based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs</a>) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> standards.</p>
<p>Additionally, in 2021 and 2022, MOBI developed a <a href="http://dlt.mobi/citopia-partstrak/">pilot to demonstrate a traceability flow</a> for maintaining a verifiable chain of custody in the EV battery supply chain with multiple stakeholders. In the demonstration, a Battery Birth Certificate containing BIN information such as the battery’s serial number, energy capacity, and chemical composition was issued by the battery supplier. The battery certificate was linked with the Vehicle Birth Certificate (stored in a vehicle’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twin</a>, or SSDT, as defined in MOBI’s <a href="http://dlt.mobi/standards/">VID Standards</a>) when installed by the OEM. When dealing with faulty batteries that were returned to the supplier, RevocationList2020 from W3C’s VC standard was implemented to revoke the vehicle or battery credentials if the components of the vehicle or battery were changed. The Battery SSDT is designed to be linked to a physical label on the battery, so that the physical label can be resolved to the battery’s digital identity, credentials, and other data. We aim to integrate these capabilities developed during the demonstration in the ongoing <a href="http://dlt.mobi/battery-innovation/">Battery SSDT and the Battery Passport</a> initiatives.</p>
                    <p>MOBI’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Supply Chain Working Group</a> is developing a guideline for the industry to use previously mentioned technology components in battery passports for reuse, repurposing, and recycling traceability. The Supply Chain Working Group contributors include Accenture, AIOI, Anritsu, Arxum, ASJade Tech, Aucnet, Autodata Group, AWS, Blockedge, BMW, CEVT, Dana, DENSO, DLT Labs, DMX, Fifth-9, Ford, Hitachi, Honda, IBM, IOTA, ITOCHU, Marelli, Mazda, Nara Institute, ParkMyFleet, Politecnico Di Torino, Quantstamp, R3, Reply, State Farm, Stellantis, SyncFab, Thirdware, TICO, and Vinturas.</p>
