 “Show me the incentives and I’ll show you the outcome.” <p>Authors: OriginTrail Core Developers</p><p>Date: November 8th&nbsp;2024</p><p>Since the inception of AI in the 1960s, two main approaches have emerged: neural network-based AI and symbolic AI. Neural networks are statistical systems that generate outputs by detecting patterns in training data, while symbolic AI employs deterministic models with explicit knowledge representations and logical connections. Today, transformers within the Large Language Model (LLM) group dominate neural networks, while knowledge graphs are the leading technology in symbolic AI for representing structured knowledge.</p><p>Used alone, each approach has limitations. Neural networks are probabilistic and can produce unwanted outputs (hallucinations), risk intellectual property issues, exhibit biases, and face model collapse with a growing amount of AI-generated (training) data online. Symbolic AI, meanwhile, is constrained by its rule-based reasoning, limiting creativity and user experience. Hybrid neuro-symbolic systems combine the strengths of both, leveraging neural networks’ usability and creativity while grounding them in knowledge graphs. This approach can enhance reliability, mitigate biases, ensure information provenance, and promote data ownership over IP&nbsp;risks.</p><p>OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), together with <a href="https://neuroweb.ai">NeuroWeb (the AI — tailored blockchain</a>) is surfacing as one of the key components of the symbolic AI branch, enhancing knowledge graph capabilities with the trust of blockchain technology, and powering, Collective Neuro-Symbolic AI.</p><p>This RFC addresses the following key development milestones to further enhance the Collective Neuro-Symbolic AI and will serve as a basis for one of the most extensive roadmap updates to&nbsp;date:</p>  DKG V8 Testnet results and learnings,  DKG Core and Edge Nodes Economics,  Collective Programmatic Treasury&nbsp;(CPT),  DKG V8 Mainnet launch in&nbsp;December  <p>After reading the following OT-RFC-21, you may leave your comment here: <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/47">https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/47</a></p> “Show me the incentives, and I’ll show you the outcome.” <p>The quote by Charlie Munger speaks to the importance of setting the right incentives in any system. As the DKG network matures in scalability and adoption, the incentives can become more refined in their implementations and more aligned with supporting the key metric — growth of usage of the DKG&nbsp;network.</p><p>There are multiple roles in the OriginTrail ecosystem that are incentivized with both TRAC and NEURO. TRAC is incentivizing Core node operators and TRAC delegators while NEURO incentivizes Neuroweb blockchain (Collator) node operators, NEURO delegators, and knowledge publishers (henceforth best represented by DKG EDGE node operators) for incentivized paranets.</p><p>The establishment of Collective Programmatic Treasury (detailed in a dedicated section below) will give the most active DKG paranets, by volume of new knowledge assets published to the DKG, an opportunity to take part in building the future of the technology.</p><p>The incentives updates and novelties will be released as a part of the DKG V8 mainnet&nbsp;release.</p> DKG V8 testnet results and learnings <p>In the first 5 weeks since the DKG V8 Testnet launch, the community has deployed over 500 V8 core nodes, which as part of the incentive program submitted over 3.7 terabytes and 13.7B lines of core node operational logs, and over 8 million Knowledge Assets published. These have proven very valuable inputs for the core developers who have introduced several optimizations to the DKG based on the submitted telemetry, including performance boosts on the new paranet syncing features, testing curated paranets, and other performance updates.</p>Chart of log lines submitted by V8 Core Nodes telemetry<p>The number of nodes on the V8 testnet highlights another key insight: even with a fixed reward budget of 100k TRAC, which was allocated to test the behavior of V8 Testnet Core Nodes, achieving an economically viable node count requires the full implementation of the DKG delegated staking feature. Delegated TRAC acts as a market mechanism to balance the node count according to the rewards available in the network at any time. This underscores the critical role TRAC delegators will play in maintaining stability and economic balance within the V8 DKG ecosystem.</p><p>As the initial phase of the V8 testnet wraps up, advancing V8 features and validating them requires an environment where all economic incentives are active to support the full deployment of the DKG V8. Key V8 components, such as the Edge Node and Core Node, will now continue to be deployed and optimized on the V6 mainnet, with the V8.0 mainnet launch set for December this year. This launch will initiate the Tuning Period, during which V8 will gain enhanced performance with features like Batch Minting, Random Sampling, and a new staking interface, all backed by real economic incentives.</p><p>In addition, synergistic effects between publishers (represented by DKG Edge Nodes, once the V8 network is deployed) and Core DKG Nodes will be fostered through horizontal scaling. This approach aims to refine network signaling, enabling an optimal network size by aligning the number of nodes more precisely with network&nbsp;demands.</p><p>The details in the following chapters of this RFC create a level playing field to prepare for updates on existing incentives on the DKG Core node and access to Collective Programmatic Treasury&nbsp;(CPT).</p> DKG Core and Edge Nodes Economics <p>The DKG V8 has been designed with major scalability improvements at multiple levels, with a prototyped implementation tested in collaboration with OriginTrail ecosystem partners from data-intensive sectors.</p><p>The major advancement that DKG V8 is making is in expanding the OriginTrail ecosystem’s product suite to two key products:</p>  DKG Core Node V8 — highly scalable network nodes forming the network core, persisting the public replicated DKG  DKG Edge Node V8 — user-friendly node applications tailored to edge devices (phones, laptops, cloud,&nbsp;etc)*  <p>*The expansion to more devices is intended to be based on ecosystem builders’ capacity and market&nbsp;needs.</p> Internet scale with DKG Edge&nbsp;nodes <p>Edge nodes enable the DKG to reach every part of the internet we know today — <a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/dkg-v8-scaling-verifiable-internet-for-ai-to-any-device-for-anyone-on-any-chain">any device, any user, any chain</a>. Being a light-weight version of the DKG node, Edge nodes can support both accessing the private and public knowledge on the DKG as well as publishing new knowledge.</p><p>Having this capability, DKG Edge node is a very useful&nbsp;tool:</p>  for paranet operators to enable knowledge miners to publish new knowledge onto their paranets;  for solution builders as a flexible interface for their neuro-symbolic AI products that can access both private and public parts of the&nbsp;DKG;  for DKG Edge node operators that want to start publishing to the DKG so they could transform their DKG Edge node into a DKG Core&nbsp;node.  <p>The continuation of V8 development focuses on teams looking to deploy their paranets &amp; Edge nodes on DKG Mainnet to generate substantial usage. Therefore, the DKG Edge Node Inception Program budget of 750k TRAC is dedicated to builders launching paranets on both the V6 and V8 mainnet, with up to 100k TRAC per builder available as reimbursement for TRAC used for publishing to a particular paranet.</p><p>More details on how you can apply for the DKG Edge Node Inception Program can be <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/dkg-v8-upcoming-version/v8-dkg-edge-node/dkg-edge-node-inception-program">found&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Horizontal scaling with DKG Core&nbsp;nodes <p>The backbone of the DKG network in V8 is formed of DKG Core nodes, whose purpose is to ensure secure hosting of the public DKG and facilitate network communication in a decentralized fashion. DKG Core nodes are incentivized through competing for DKG publishing fees in TRAC tokens, which are distributed among the best performing nodes in the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The success of a Core node in capturing fees in DKG V6 is currently a function of 3 factors: (1) node uptime and availability, (2) total TRAC stake delegated to a node, and (3) network hash distance (enabling efficient knowledge content addressing). <br>Several learnings have been acquired in V6 through the period of the system running in production, most notably on how to improve scalability and further fine-tune the incentive system for DKG growth, by updating the relevant parameters in the tokenomics formula.</p><p>Particularly, the community of node operators has been indicating the hash distance factor as the most problematic one, causing randomization and impacting the system in an unpredictable and asymmetric way (the nodes with the same amount of stake and uptime could perform differently in terms of rewards due to a different hash ring network position).</p><p>On the other hand, the builders’ feedback is that the friction to contributing to the DKG needs to be significantly lower, specifically in terms of publishing price per knowledge asset (addressed with scalability) and accessibility to publishing through available nodes, expressing the need for an approach similar to blockchain RPC services, which allow sending transactions to the blockchain without running a blockchain node.</p><p>Therefore V8 introduces an updated Core node incentive system with the following factors:</p>  Node uptime &amp; availability, in positive correlation, as nodes need to prove their commitment of hosting the DKG by submitting proofs to the blockchain (through the new V8 random sampling proof&nbsp;system),  TRAC Stake security factor, in positive correlation — the more stake a node attracts, the higher the security guarantees and therefore the higher chance of rewards (same as in&nbsp;V6),  Publishing factor, in positive correlation — the more new knowledge has been published via a specific core node (measured in TRAC tokens), the higher the chance of&nbsp;rewards,  Node fee (formerly “ask”), in negative correlation — the nodes with lower fees are positively impacting the system scalability, and therefore have a higher chance of&nbsp;rewards.  <p>The illustrative incentive formula is therefore:</p><p>where the specific functions are to be validated on both the testnet (for technical functionality) and mainnet (for market functionality) during the V8 Tuning&nbsp;period.</p><p>This addition creates further alignment of Core nodes with the ecosystem growth as Core nodes that take up roles of driving adoption will become more successful. Importantly, it also creates an aligned horizontal scaling approach, since additional Core nodes in the DKG become required with growing adoption. This creates a positive self-reinforcing feedback loop: new adoption leads to new nodes, which leads to increased scale, which unlocks further adoption. We can imagine core nodes almost acting as a “solar panel” that allows publishers to capture TRAC fees from the network so they could use it for their publishing needs.</p> Network security via&nbsp;staking <p>TRAC delegators are using their TRAC to secure the DKG network by delegating it to selected Core nodes. In exchange for a delegation (and increasing the core node’s chance of capturing rewards), the node operator splits a part of the captured rewards with the delegators. When selecting the core node to support, the delegators take all the key elements of a successful Core node into account which will, from DKG V8 onwards, include the amount of knowledge added to the&nbsp;DKG.</p> NEW: Those who use it, will build it: 60MM TRAC Collective Programmatic Treasury&nbsp;(CPT) <p>To achieve that those who use the network have incentives to build it in the future, the future development fund will be deployed as a 60MM TRAC Collective Programmatic Treasury (CPT). The Collective Programmatic Treasury will be implemented with a programmatic release schedule emitting TRAC to eligible builders. The release schedule will follow the most famous example of emissions in the cryptocurrency space, that of the Bitcoin halving with minor alterations. The TRAC released from Collective Programmatic Treasury will be dedicated to (both conditions should be fulfilled) those&nbsp;who:</p>  use TRAC tokens for publishing knowledge (paranets spending the most TRAC for publishing knowledge), AND  have been confirmed eligible for incentives by the community (paranets who have completed successful IPOs and are deployed on NeuroWeb).   The schedule <p>As mentioned above, the schedule draws inspiration from likely the most influential schedule process in Crypto, Bitcoin halvings. The halvings principle dictates that half of the outstanding amount is to be distributed in each following period in equal amounts throughout that period. While BTC halvings are set at 4 years, our schedule proposal is to set this period for 2 years in the case of TRAC. That said, the emissions schedule would be as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>The Collective Programmatic Treasury will be deployed on the NeuroWebAI blockchain and will allow paranet operators to trigger Collect reward transactions which will calculate the amount of rewards they are eligible for and pay it out accordingly.</p> The distribution <p>The distribution amounts will be tied to the core principle of “Those who use it, will build it”. The metric which will, therefore, define the amount of TRAC that a builder (represented by their paranet) will receive, is tied to their TRAC spending for creating knowledge on the DKG. A simple example would be as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Paranet A spent 1,000&nbsp;TRAC  Paranet B spent 2,000&nbsp;TRAC  Paranet C spent 3,000&nbsp;TRAC  <p>Collective Programmatic Treasury amount for the period: 600&nbsp;TRAC</p>  Paranet A: 100 TRAC&nbsp;reward  Paranet B: 200 TRAC&nbsp;reward  Paranet C: 300 TRAC&nbsp;reward  <p>*all numbers are placeholders, just exemplifying the relationship between the spent and received amounts..</p><p>The Collective Programmatic Treasury will be observing DKG network usage on the innovation hub of OriginTrail ecosystem, the NeuroWebAI blockchain, thus applying only to NeuroWebAI hosted paranets.</p> The eligibility &amp; humans in the&nbsp;loop <p>Not every paranet on NeuroWebAI is by default eligible for the TRAC dev fund emissions. In order to achieve that status, a paranet must have been voted in via the IPO process, gaining support by the NeuroWebAI community through a NEURO on-chain governance vote. In this way, the community collectively decides on the dev fund &amp; NEURO incentive emissions, transparently implementing the “humans in the loop” system via on-chain governance.</p><p>The Collective Programmatic Treasury (CPT) is expected to be implemented in March&nbsp;2025.</p> DKG V8 release&nbsp;timeline <p>November</p>  DKG V8 testnet layer 1 completed  OT-RFC-21 release  DKG V8 Edge node Inception program&nbsp;start  <p>December</p>  DKG V8.0 Mainnet and Tuning period&nbsp;launch  Neuroweb collator&nbsp;staking  <p>January 2025</p>  DKG V8.1, Tuning period&nbsp;ends  <p>February 2025</p>  Neuroweb TRAC Bridge made available  <p>March 2025</p>  DKG V8.2 release — Collective Programmatic Treasury   <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-21-collective-neuro-symbolic-ai-cc71cf03ee6a">OT-RFC-21 Collective Neuro-Symbolic AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Younger generations see passwords as outdated and are opting for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, a FIDO-backed technology offering more secure, passwordless authentication. With increasing support from popular apps and services, young users are helping to drive this transition towards safer, FIDO-endorsed security solutions.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Consumer expectations are changing, and this data should serve as a clear call to action for brands and organizations still relying on outdated password systems,” noted Andrew Shikiar, CEO at FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>“Consumers are actively seeking out and prefer passwordless alternatives when available, and brands that fail to adapt are losing patience, money, and loyalty – especially among younger generations.”</p>



<p>“When consumers know about passkeys, they use them. Excitingly, 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and services already support passkeys. As the industry accelerates its efforts toward education and making deployment as simple as possible, we urge more brands to work with us to make passkeys available for consumers. The pace of passkey deployment and usage is set to accelerate even more in the next twelve months, and we are eager to help brands and consumers alike make the shift,” Shikiar concluded.</p>

<p>How key industries are preparing for eIDAS with DIDComm</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1361.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">successful formal verification of DIDComm</a> paves the way for tremendous DIDComm adoption. To help provide an understanding of this important technology, we’ve outlined some of the industries where DIDComm can play an important role.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about DIDComm, visit <a href="http://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm.org</a> or join us for a meeting of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-usergroup?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm users group</a>. All are welcome!&nbsp;</p><p>In the evolving landscape of digital communication, the need for secure, private, and efficient data exchange has never been more critical. This is especially true for the businesses, governments, and individuals who will be affected by eIDAS regulation in the European Union as they seek to protect their information while also enhancing user experiences. This blog explores the concept of DIDComm, its relationship with eIDAS, and how it stands to revolutionize five key industries.</p> What is DIDComm? <p><a href="https://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> (Decentralized Identifier Communication) is an open standard for secure and private communication using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs are a type of digital identifier that allow for verifiable, self-sovereign identities. Unlike traditional communication protocols, DIDComm enables peer-to-peer communication without relying on centralized authorities, tools, or platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Key technical aspects of DIDComm include:</p>  Use of DIDs for addressing and authentication  End-to-end encryption for message confidentiality  Decentralized architecture, allowing direct communication between parties, including the devices humans use such as phones, laptops, and tablets.  Support for various transport protocols (HTTP, Bluetooth, NFC, etc.)  <p>This technology leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure data integrity, privacy, and security. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where trust and security are paramount, such as in financial transactions, healthcare data sharing, and cross-border communications.</p> Understanding eIDAS <p><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation?ref=blog.identity.foundation">eIDAS</a> (Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services) is a regulation by the European Union aimed at creating a single, standardized digital identity framework across member states. eIDAS enables secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens, and public authorities. It also ensures that electronic signatures, seals, and other trust services are recognized across all EU member states. By fostering trust and security in the digital economy, eIDAS is a key enabler of cross-border digital services and is central to the EU’s Digital Single Market strategy.</p> DIDComm and eIDAS: A Powerful Combination <p>The combination of DIDComm's decentralized, secure communication with eIDAS's standardized, legally recognized digital identity framework opens up new possibilities across various industries. Like OID4VC, the communication protocol that is expressly mentioned in eIDAS, DIDComm can be used for exchanging verifiable credentials and initial login. However, DIDComm goes beyond that. Using DIDComm, organizations can leverage eIDAS-compliant identities for ongoing secure, private communication, while also providing a flexible infrastructure that can adapt to future changes in regulatory requirements.</p><p>In addition to the standards and specifications explicitly required by legislation, it is important to enable collaboration and communication using adjacent technologies. The best results will be obtained by using the right combination of technologies integrated seamlessly together.</p> 1. Finance: Secure Cross-Border Transactions <p>In the finance sector, the need for secure, efficient, cross-border transactions is a constant challenge. Traditional methods involve multiple intermediaries, each adding cost, delay, and potential points of failure or vulnerability. With DIDComm, financial institutions can dramatically streamline cross-border transactions by engaging in direct, encrypted communication to verify identities and transaction details, bypassing the need for intermediaries.&nbsp;</p><p>The reduction in intermediaries not only cuts down on transaction times and associated fees, it minimizes the potential points of failure and security vulnerabilities. This approach ensures that sensitive financial data is handled with the utmost privacy, meeting the rigorous security standards expected in the finance industry while enhancing the user experience and making it easier to do business. Furthermore, customers benefit from a more efficient, transparent process, enhancing trust and satisfaction with financial services across the EU.</p><p>Example: A European bank conducting a transaction with a bank in another EU country could use DIDComm to securely exchange verified credentials for the transaction. By integrating eIDAS-compliant digital identities and DIDComm, the banks can communicate with the relevant stakeholders on trusted channels to ensure that the parties involved are authenticated and that the transaction is legally binding across borders. This not only reduces transaction times and costs but also enhances security and privacy by limiting data exposure to unnecessary parties.</p> 2. Industrial Machinery: Automated Event Notifications <p>In industrial settings, the efficient operation of machinery is crucial to maintaining productivity. Timely notifications about the status or needs of machinery, such as maintenance requirements or operational events, can significantly reduce downtime and improve overall efficiency and security.</p><p>By leveraging DIDComm combined with eIDAS-compliant digital identities, the system ensures that only authorized personnel receive and can act on this information. This approach not only improves efficiency by ensuring that the right people are notified in real-time, but also enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive operational data. The use of DIDComm in this scenario ensures that communication is encrypted and tamper-proof, providing a trustworthy and streamlined method for managing industrial operations across large and complex environments.</p><p>Use Case: Imagine a large warehouse in Germany where various pieces of industrial machinery are operating. When a specific mechanical event occurs, such as a temperature spike in a critical component, the machinery can automatically trigger a notification. Using DIDComm, this notification can be securely communicated to interested parties, such as the maintenance team, the machinery manufacturer, and the warehouse management system.</p><p>Read More: <a href="https://gaia-x.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SSI_White_Paper_Design_Final_EN.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Gaia-X Secure and Trustworthy Ecosystems with Self Sovereign Identity</a> (Gaia-X)</p> 3. Travel: Seamless and Secure Traveler Verification <p>The travel industry relies heavily on the secure verification of travelers' identities, whether for boarding flights, crossing borders, or checking into hotels. The challenge is to ensure that this verification process is both secure and efficient, enhancing the overall travel experience while protecting personal data.</p><p>Using DIDComm, the traveler can securely share their eIDAS-compliant digital identity with the airline, airport authorities, and border control via their mobile device. This digital identity is verified in real-time, and the traveler is seamlessly cleared through each checkpoint without the need to repeatedly present physical documents.</p><p>DIDComm ensures that the traveler’s data is encrypted and only accessible by the intended parties, reducing the risk of identity theft or unauthorized access. Additionally, this process improves the user experience by speeding up the verification process and reducing wait times. The use of secure, decentralized communication also allows for more flexible travel arrangements, such as automated hotel check-ins or renting a car, where the traveler’s verified digital identity can be securely communicated directly to service providers.</p><p>Use Case: Consider a scenario where a traveler from France is flying to another EU country. Upon arrival at the airport, they need to go through multiple identity verification steps—at the airline check-in counter, security checkpoints, and immigration control. Traditionally, this involves presenting physical documents like a passport, which can be cumbersome and slow.</p><p>Read More:</p>  <a href="https://www.goodeintelligence.com/report/travel-digital-identity-seamless-powered-by-digital-identity/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Travel Digital Identity – Seamless Travel Powered by Digital Identity</a> (Goode Intelligence)  <a href="https://www.the-prism-project.com/th-prism-download?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Biometric Digital Identity Travel and Hospitality</a> (Prism)  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-301989815.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Aruba Makes Steady Progress In Launching New Digital Travel Credential</a>   4. Supply Chain Management: Secure and Transparent Tracking <p>Supply chain management involves coordinating numerous stakeholders, often across different countries and regulatory environments. Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of goods and documents as they move through the supply chain is critical.</p><p>Integrating DIDComm into supply chain management enhances transparency, security, and efficiency across all stages of the supply chain. By enabling secure, encrypted communication between manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers, DIDComm ensures that all parties have access to accurate and verified information in real time. This is particularly valuable when supply chains are not running smoothly. Communicating about part acceptance, quality measurement, and delivery schedules can benefit from standards based secure communication.&nbsp;</p><p>The use of eIDAS-compliant digital identities further strengthens trust, as each stakeholder's identity and credentials are authenticated and legally recognized across borders. This reduces the risk of fraud, errors, and delays, leading to a more reliable and efficient supply chain. Ultimately, businesses benefit from improved operational efficiency and reduced costs, while customers receive products that are securely tracked and delivered with greater transparency.</p><p>Use Case: A manufacturer in France could use DIDComm to securely communicate with suppliers and logistics providers across the EU, using eIDAS-compliant digital identities to verify the credentials of each party involved. This secure communication can include encrypted data about the origin, handling, and delivery and acceptance of goods, ensuring transparency and trust throughout the supply chain. By using DIDComm, supply chain managers can reduce the risk of fraud, improve efficiency, and ensure compliance with various regulatory requirements.</p><p>Read More:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/implementing-digital-product-passports-using-decentralized-identity-standards-f1102c452020?ref=blog.identity.foundation#id_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImIyZjgwYzYzNDYwMGVkMTMwNzIxMDFhOGI0MjIwNDQzNDMzZGIyODIiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.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.bm7Jvv1wmsXegIryD6DKQTTfFQuv95yj4yIQBTXodoMY-Odo1ADwkYW03Q9kdzfLcnV274AHDCHP7iNvSsknkN8YxI6fruqy4sYNcHm3XEb_0PNNZHD6IV7rkKQXfhz6ZbdEkDONErEgL_5mni2uw1CVuGhIfUSlt_32jSdmCfHw5kFNjGX2vL2cE1CGEb5uM7DvyIy5yghOi9ef3dbMUlMdAETwLQR6fQ8dDAS6cQVO4m7XRiolaoo9S5j5807vs5MNYoUROLjhkP8b0aYwRe1ZTYvay9QCMa-W20d3ORS23NwCmAUNOjM9KgC0h_otHlz-z6jWGzax6IkbflBjfg">Implementing Digital Product Passports using Decentralized Identity Standards</a> (Spherity Blog)  <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/digital-product-passports-and-supply-chain-compliance/">EU Digital Product Passports and Enabling Compliance in the US Pharmaceutical Supply Chain</a> (DIF Blog)  <a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralized-identity-use-case-spotlight-supply-chains/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Identity Use Case Spotlight Supply Chains</a> (Indicio Blog)   5. Government Services: Secure Citizen-to-Government Interactions <p>Governments are increasingly moving towards digital services to improve efficiency and accessibility. However, ensuring that these services are secure and that citizens’ data is protected is a significant challenge.</p><p>Implementing DIDComm for citizen-to-government interactions revolutionizes how public services are accessed and utilized. It becomes more convenient for citizens to share information and their communications with government entities are encrypted and protected from unauthorized access. The integration of eIDAS-compliant digital identities ensures that these interactions are not only secure but also legally recognized across EU member states. This results in a more efficient public service system, where processes such as applying for permits or accessing social services are streamlined, reducing administrative burdens and enhancing the overall user experience for citizens.</p><p>Use Case: A citizen in Italy could use their eIDAS-compliant digital identity to securely communicate with government agencies via DIDComm. This could include applying for permits, submitting tax information, or accessing public services. DIDComm ensures that all communications are encrypted and that the citizen’s data is only accessible by the intended government agencies. This use case demonstrates how DIDComm can enhance the security and privacy of digital government services while providing a better user experience by simplifying and streamlining interactions with public authorities.</p><p>Read more:&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3543434.3543638?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Enhancing European Interoperability Frameworks to Leverage Mobile Cross-Border Services in Europe</a> (Association for Computing Machinery)   Preparing for eIDAS and beyond <p>DIDComm represents a powerful tool for enhancing security, privacy, and efficiency across various industries that are preparing for an eIDAS future. By enabling secure, decentralized communication and integrating legally recognized digital identities, these technologies are set to revolutionize how businesses, governments, and individuals interact in the digital world.&nbsp;</p><p>As these technologies continue to develop and gain adoption, we can expect to see significant improvements in the way sensitive data is handled, trust is established, and user experiences are delivered across borders.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID AB/Connect Working Group</a>&nbsp;recommends approval of the following specification as an OpenID Implementer’s Draft:</p>
 
 OpenID4VP: <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-22.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-22.html</a> 
 
<p>This would be the third Implementer’s Draft of this specification.</p>
 This version has 3 major changes: 
 
 
 Introduces the Digital Credentials Query Language; this is an alternative to Presentation Exchange 
 Introduces the transaction data mechanism that enables a binding between the user’s identification/authentication and the user’s authorization, for example to complete a payment transaction, or to sign specific document(s) using QES (Qualified Electronic Signatures). 
 Removes the client_id_scheme parameter and instead makes the client id scheme a prefix on the client_id; this addresses a security issue with the previous solution. 
 
<p>The editors &amp; chairs would greatly appreciate implementor feedback on the new Digital Credentials Query Language and we expect to further evolve the language based on feedback received.</p>
 
 An Implementer’s Draft is a stable version of a specification providing intellectual property protections to implementers of the specification.

<p>Since launching AutoGreenCharge, an app aimed at reducing carbon emissions from electric vehicles (EVs), many early users and corporate partners have asked us to explain how it works — especially how it uses Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Today, we’ll break down what AutoGreenCharge does and how it helps EV drivers, fleet owners, and anyone interested in decarbonizing EV charging and the grid as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Understanding Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs)</p><p>First, let’s talk about electricity markets and EACs. These certificates are used to track and trade the environmental benefits of renewable energy. EACs represent the “green” qualities of renewable electricity, such as how it was produced (wind, solar, etc.), where it was generated, and when it was created. For every 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable electricity, one EAC is issued. These certificates can be sold separately from the actual electricity, so people or businesses can support renewable energy without being directly connected to a renewable power&nbsp;plant.</p><p>​​When someone wants to claim they’ve used renewable electricity, they “retire” the certificate in a registry, ensuring that only one person or business can take credit for that specific green energy. Governments and companies worldwide have been using EACs for years to help make their energy use&nbsp;cleaner.</p><p>Different regions have their own versions of&nbsp;EACs:</p>  Europe uses Guarantees of Origin (GOs), which prove electricity came from renewable sources.  North America uses Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), similar to GOs, but often certified by a trusted third&nbsp;party.  Other countries, like Australia and Japan, have their own systems that work in a similar&nbsp;way.  International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-RECs) are used in many emerging economies and track renewable energy across&nbsp;borders.  <p>EACs can be bought and sold on various platforms, and once purchased, they can be retired to claim a decrease in emissions.</p><p>How AutoGreenCharge Works</p><p>AutoGreenCharge simplifies the process of matching EACs to EV charging sessions. It takes into account where and when you charge your car, how much electricity you use, and then automatically selects and purchases EACs to offset any non-renewable energy in that session. Since most EV charging sessions use less electricity than a full MWh (the standard size of an EAC), AutoGreenCharge splits the certificates into smaller pieces to match your charge. This process is verified by Energy Web’s Worker Node network, which ensures everything is tracked accurately.</p><p>AutoGreenCharge also has a new feature for enterprise: “Bring Your Own EAC.” This allows companies to use EACs they’ve already purchased. If they don’t want to handle it themselves, the app can take care of buying and matching the right certificates for them. For example, the first certificates purchased by Energy Web for the app were high-quality wind RECs from the&nbsp;U.S.</p><p>Addressing Common Questions</p><p>One AutoGreenCharge tester asked the following: “How do you know I am not charging my vehicle using a diesel generator?”</p><p>First, we should note that while it is possible to run a diesel generator to charge a vehicle, it’s a fairly rare occurrence as it doesn’t make economic sense. Charging an EV with a diesel generator is expensive, and buying EACs to greenwash it would be even more costly. However, we can consider this scenario as an example to demonstrate how AutoGreenCharge works. If the app doesn’t have any further information about the physical grid connection of the charging station in use, it will assume that none of the electricity used was renewable. So in this scenario, an EAC would be matched to the full charging session volume to make sure it’s covered by 100% renewables.</p><p>EACs give control to each individual and organization to contribute to the success of renewable facilities by attracting more investments into a greener grid which will replace emitting electricity generators over time. AutoGreenCharge makes every charge event supportive of renewable energy — at least somewhere in your EAC&nbsp;region.</p> Limitations of EACs&nbsp;Today <p>While EACs are great for individual action supporting renewables, they have some limitations. For example, they usually don’t specify the exact time of electricity generation — just the year. They also don’t always account for physical grid limitations, meaning you could buy an EAC from another region even if it doesn’t match the electricity connection where you’re&nbsp;located.</p><p>Still, EACs are currently the most widely used system for tracking renewable energy. Efforts are already underway to make EACs more detailed. AutoGreenCharge supports several types of emerging protocols, like <a href="https://future-energy-lab.de/projects/dive-en/%20https://mobility.unternehmertum.de/en/trusted-green-charging-1-0">Trusted Green Charging and DIVE</a>, which provide a more accurate environmental impact for specific charging&nbsp;events.</p><p>We’re excited about the future of AutoGreenCharge and welcome feedback!

<p>Global FIDO Alliance study reveals latest consumer trends and attitudes towards authentication methods and their perceived online security</p>



 
 Passkey familiarity growing – Just two years after passkeys were first announced and started to be made available for consumer use, awareness has risen by 50%, from 39% familiar in 2022 to 57% in 2024 



 Password usage stagnates as consumers favor alternatives – The majority of those familiar with passkeys are enabling the technology to sign in. Meanwhile, despite passwords remaining the most common way to log in, the number of people using passwords across use cases declined as alternatives continue to rise in availability 



 Waning password patience is costing sales and loyalty, especially among younger consumers – &nbsp;42% of people have abandoned a purchase at least once in the past month because they could not remember their password.​ This increases to 50% for those aged 25-34 versus just 17% of over 65s 



 Online scams and AI alarming consumers – Over half of consumers reported an increase in the number of suspicious messages they notice and an increase in scam sophistication, driven by AI. Younger generations are even more likely to agree, while older generations remain unsure how AI impacts their online security 
 



<p>29 October 2024 – The <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today publishes its fourth annual <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-findings-consumer-trends-and-attitudes-towards-authentication-methods/">Online Authentication Barometer</a>, which gathers insights into the state of online authentication and consumer perceptions of online security in ten countries across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key findings&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research revealed promising consumer momentum building around passkey adoption and clear signs people are recognizing the limitations of passwords and are choosing passwordless alternatives, like passkeys, where available. In the two years since passkeys were first announced, global awareness has jumped by 50%, rising from 39% familiar in 2022 to 57% in 2024. Awareness is driving adoption too – the majority of those familiar with passkeys (62%) are using them to secure their apps and online accounts.</p>



<p>The data also revealed the cost to organizations still relying on legacy password sign-ins – especially among younger generations. 42% abandoned a purchase in the last month due to a forgotten password, rising to over half of those under 35. Similarly, over half of consumers (56%) have given up accessing a service online because they couldn’t remember a password in the last month, rising to 66% of those under 35.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey revealed other clear signs that password usage and trust are stagnating globally as more secure and user-friendly passwordless alternatives become available. Overall, the number of consumers entering a password manually across use cases decreased again from 2023, while biometrics ranked the authentication method consumers consider the best login experience and the method they consider most secure for the second year running.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When consumers were asked about how they have improved account security in the last year, numbers continued to decline among those who increased the complexity of a password, while those choosing biometrics and using authenticator apps have steadily risen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys at two: the road to mainstream&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumer expectations are changing, and this data should serve as a clear call to action for brands and organizations still relying on outdated password systems. Consumers are actively seeking out and prefer passwordless alternatives when available, and brands that fail to adapt are losing patience, money, and loyalty – especially among younger generations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When consumers know about passkeys, they use them. Excitingly, 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and services already support passkeys. As the industry accelerates its efforts toward education and making deployment as simple as possible, we urge more brands to work with us to make passkeys available for consumers. The pace of passkey deployment and usage is set to accelerate even more in the next twelve months, and we are eager to help brands and consumers alike make the shift,” comments Andrew Shikiar, CEO at FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, passkeys have seen strong adoption in high-growth, digitally advanced markets like China and India, which ranked top globally with 80% and 73% enablement, respectively. The UK followed close behind in third place, with adoption levels at 66%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Younger consumers most attuned to online scams and AI threats&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumer concerns about online security were also revealed to be high – and again, it is younger consumers most attuned to new threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over half of consumers (53%) cited an increase in the number of suspicious messages they noticed in recent months, driven mostly by SMS (53%) and email (49%). Similarly, 51% detected an increase in the sophistication of threats and scam messages, likely driven by AI-enhanced attacks. Zooming in on demographic data suggests older generations are at greatest risk: 54% and 61% of 18-24 and 25-34-year-olds respectively noticed scams getting smarter, while just a third of 55-64-year-olds and 25% of 65+ said the same. Similarly, 20% of people over 55 said they were unsure about the impact AI has on their online security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes to editors&nbsp;</p>



 
 Research for the FIDO Alliance’s Online Authentication Barometer was conducted by Sapio Research among 10,000 consumers across the UK, France, Germany, US, Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India, and China.&nbsp; 
 



<p>About FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.&nbsp;</p>

 Some practical tips to use AI with your&nbsp;team <p>The use of large language models (“LLMs”) such as ChatGPT can be a controversial topic. People have strong opinions about them for all kinds of reasons, from concerns around data privacy to the propagation of bias and inequality. The amount of energy used to train LLMs, and the amount of water used to cool data centres on which cloud-based versions run, is a particular concern. Our project with <a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk/">Friends of the Earth</a> around <a href="https://experiments.friendsoftheearth.uk/blog/harnessing-ai-environmental-justice">Harnessing AI for environmental justice</a> starts to unpack some of the environmental complexities of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>However, LLMs can be really useful as well, so in this post, we’re going to take a nuanced look at how various types of LLMs can be used together to improve both process and outcomes. We believe this is in keeping with the <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/spirit-of-wao">Spirit of WAO</a> and our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16">five focus areas</a>, we believe in dialogue that leads to action. At WAO we’ve had a number of conversations around our personal use of AI and how we prefer to use it in our collective work.</p>WAO’s 5 focus areas, cc-by&nbsp;WAO Why use&nbsp;LLMs? <p>Having used them regularly as part of our daily work for over 18 months at this point, we can say that using LLMs is useful for us in a number of concrete&nbsp;ways:</p>  Speed — outsourcing ‘grunt’ work to LLMs means that we can spend time doing more creative work. A good example of this is using the optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities of some LLMs to recognise virtual sticky notes from project <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/pre-mortem/">pre-mortem</a> sessions we run with clients. It can then turn these into text, categorise them, and produce a spreadsheet. What would take perhaps an hour can be done in a couple of&nbsp;minutes.  Situational perspectives — Asking LLMs to perform a ‘red/amber/green’ or RAG analysis of work can also be useful. It’s easy to get carried away with personal interests or to miss an important part of a client brief. By asking LLMs to check your work using the RAG format against what has been requested, we can check that our work fits with what’s required. It can also help us think through problems: on Doug’s <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/08/17/house-purchases-climate-change-and-ai/">personal blog</a> he discussed how he used an LLM in the process of deciding not to go through with a house purchase. The AI helped calculate things such as cumulative risk of flooding over time, using formulae he might not have otherwise known how to&nbsp;use.  Text synthesis — LLMs are excellent at synthesising information quickly and efficiently. This is true of the recently-launched <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/">Google NotebookLM</a> which allows users to share up to 50 data sources, synthesise and then query them. One important point, however, is that we need to be thoughtful and focused in checking the accuracy of synthesis and summarisation work because LLM’s are also great at hallucinating.   Three ways to approach LLMs sustainably  Start local <p>There’s a lot to unpack around the use of AI and the environmental impacts. As a tech and environmental activist, I was hesitant about using some of the popular, browser-based LLMs for a variety of reasons. I recently wrote up <a href="https://www.laurahilliger.com/leadership/captain-planet-and-ai-earth-fire-wind-water-and-heart/">a quick, Captain Planet themed overview</a> of some of the climate crisis issues that this kind of technology contributes to. Together with WAO members, I’ve discussed and debated various privacy, bias and attribution issues that are baked into our technology choices.</p><p>Having started to use AI across a lot of contexts and looking into the impacts that the use of AI has, we made the decision to use locally installed models and tools to help reduce our climate impact whenever possible. Locally installed models might not be updated as frequently as ChatGPT, but the climate benefits are huge. The processing happens locally, as does the storage, so your queries and conversations aren’t stored in big data centres and they remain private to&nbsp;you.</p> Use multiple&nbsp;models <p>There are many generative AI models, some of which are smaller and some which are larger. A good place to see the diversity of these models is <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>, a slightly awkwardly-named AI community. Here you can find the latest versions of models, along with datasets, and implementations of AI for various purposes.</p><p>It can be complicated to use the command line to install, configure, and run LLMs locally. However, as macOS users one of the tools we’ve been playing with is <a href="https://recurse.chat/">RecurseChat</a> which simplifies the use of multiple, local AI models within an easy-to-use app. It’s straightforward to install and has a privacy policy that doesn’t keep us up at night worrying about where our data is&nbsp;going.</p> Conduct experiments <p>When AI image generation first hit the scene, we were excited about its possibilities. Together, we made art projects like <a href="https://www.laurahilliger.com/writing/times-solitary-dance/">Time’s Solitary Dance</a> or the <a href="https://www.laurahilliger.com/design/psychops-for-mental-health-awareness-month/">PsychOps for Mental Health Awareness month</a>, which I made pairing AI generated images with the fabulous <a href="https://remixer.visualthinkery.com/">Remixer&nbsp;Machine</a>.</p><p>While we certainly had fun playing with image generation, we now default to simply searching for images (or asking <a href="mailto:bryan@visualthinkery.com">Bryan Mathers</a> to draw them for us&nbsp;;) There is an incredible emission cost to image generation, so we think carefully before asking generative AI to make something for&nbsp;us.</p>This graphic, from p.156 of the <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HAI_AI-Index-Report-2024.pdf">Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024</a> shows how ‘image generation’ has a much greater impact on CO2 emissions than, for example, ‘text classification’ or ‘question answering’/<p>Being environmentally conscious involves uncovering a great many complexities within our world. For example, when talking about the overall consumption of energy and water people tend to be quite alarmist. After a conversation with one of our gaming buddies about the annual energy use of a beer fridge, we calculated that it was the equivalent of prompting ChatGPT 4 over 2,200 times. Similarly, we calculated that you could prompt over 300 times for the same water usage as washing a car with a hose. While we recognise that using AI is an additional resource use, we try to put it in the context of wider consumption patterns.</p> Go forth and prompt&nbsp;together <p>If you are working alone and making use of LLMs, be sure and let people know what your “little robot friend” had to say. At WAO we let each other know when something we’re pasting into a chat is AI generated or if we’re about to prompt an LLM on something. Transparency is an important part of the&nbsp;process.</p>This AI Transparency statement was included in <a href="https://medium.com/we-are-cast/embrace-the-horseducks-and-other-takeaways-from-the-charity-digital-ai-summit-9842bca0f7f8">the recent CAST post</a> about the Charity Digital AI Summit and is CC-BY Kester&nbsp;Brewin<p>Part of <a href="https://ailiteracy.fyi/">AI literacy</a> is being able to spot common foibles of LLMs. For example, we’ve come to dislike the words ‘delve’ and ‘foster’ because of their overuse by ChatGPT. Once you start noticing particular models tend towards certain words or phrases, you start seeing them everywhere. This is another reason transparency is so important.</p><p>Using a local model and screen sharing while coworking with your team is a great way to learn about AI together. You can use AI prompting and team conversation to bounce ideas around and find some <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/finding-unexamined-assumptions-through-systems-thinking-and-ambiguity-17c6e98c670f">productive ambiguity</a>. Another benefit of this process is, of course, the laughter. AI responds with some pretty hilarious things sometimes, so why not improve your team dynamic by making fun of AI together.</p><p>Do you need help with this kind of thing?<a href="https://weareopen.coop"> Get in touch</a> with&nbsp;WAO!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/cooperating-through-the-use-of-ai-404809763f94">Cooperating through the use of AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This topic was presented at IIWXXXIX Fall 2024 on October 29, 2024.</p>

 

<p>My name is Christopher Allen. In 2016, in advance of the ID2020 conference at the United Nations in New York, I wrote <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, the article that described the ten precepts of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and provided the name that defined our ecosystem. Eight and a half years later, I ask the SSI community to reflect on a difficult question, one that challenges the very foundation of SSI. Has our ecosystem strayed from our principles? Have we in the SSI community lost our moral compass?</p>

<p>I speak not only in response to the argument <a href="https://rileyparkerhughes.medium.com/why-verifiable-credentials-arent-widely-adopted-why-trinsic-pivoted-aee946379e3b">last year at IIW</a> that “SSI didn’t work” but also to underscore a graver issue: that perhaps in our pursuit of mainstream adoption we’ve sacrificed the very principles that set SSI apart.</p>

<p>In a world increasingly threatened by authoritarian encroachments, with troubling examples growing by the day, we face the urgent need to protect freedom. Russia and China flout international borders and expand their influence through intimidation and repression. This rise of authoritarianism is undermining human freedom across Europe, especially in Hungary, with worrying echoes in Italy, the Netherlands, France, and across the EU. The number of refugees and stateless people are rising every year.</p>

<p>Closer to home, we also face disconcerting overreach, such as the Texas Attorney General’s request for DMV records of people who changed their names, an alarming step towards state-enabled discrimination against trans people. If Trump is re-elected, it’s chilling to imagine what might become acceptable next.</p>

<p>These are ominous signs of an escalating trend toward pervasive surveillance and control, not only over our private lives but also over the core of human dignity itself. SSI was meant to stand as a bastion against these encroachments, defending personal autonomy and integrity. It imagined a world where people, not institutions, controlled their identities, without fear of overreach, manipulation, or coercion.</p>

<p>However, instead of holding the line on decentralization, we’ve compromised by adopting watered-down specifications such as “did:web” that diminish the resilience and independence of self-sovereign identities.</p>

<p>Instead of insisting that Legally-Enabled Self-Sovereign (LESS) Identity enforce strict data minimization for both businesses and governments, we have allowed over-identification to proliferate. Further, we have failed to effectively counter the overblown threats posed by the so-called ‘Four Horsemen of the Digital Apocalypse’ — software pirates, organized crime, child pornographers, and terrorists — while also overlooking the far greater risk of tyranny and its potential for real harm against those powerless to defend themselves.</p>

<p>These compromises have left us vulnerable, eroding SSI’s unique value proposition compared to the centralized approaches of government. As a result, centralized government approoaches such as Apple and Google’s mDL/mDoc standards and federated corporate identity efforts are now winning the market battle against our SSI ecosystem.</p>

<p>This is the real reason the SSI ecosystem may be faltering: not due to market forces, but because we have failed to unequivocally commit to upholding the core values of decentralization and privacy and to resisting compromises that undermine human dignity. By doing so, we have become indistinguishable from the very systems we set out to disrupt.</p>

<p>The question is not whether SSI has “worked” in the marketplace. It is whether we have remained true to its ethical foundation and core principles, as envisioned from the start.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

 1. What are BPoS NFTs? 
<p>A: BPoS NFTs are unique tokens that represent staked ELA on the main chain network. They allow users to retain asset liquidity while securing the network, offering flexible options like trading and collateralizing staked ELA.</p>
 
 
 2. How do they function within Elastos? 
<p>A: Users first stake ELA on the main Elastos Blockchain, locking it in the BPoS model for a chosen period, during which their stake contributes to network security and governance. Following this initial lock period, users can mint a BPoS NFT on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) representing their locked ELA and the corresponding locked period yet still earning continuous rewards.</p>
<p>This NFT, based on the ERC-721 standard, represents the staked ELA and can be freely traded, transferred, or collateralized on the ESC without requiring the user to un-stake. As a result, the user retains liquidity while still maintaining their staked position in the network. This innovative approach to staking on Elastos allows assets to remain in circulation within decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or marketplaces, granting users greater flexibility.</p>
 
 
 3. How secure are BPoS NFTs? 
<p>A: The BPoS NFTs on Elastos are designed with security in mind by leveraging the ERC-721 standard and OpenZeppelin’s open-source, audited code. Here’s a breakdown of key security features:</p>
 
 NFT Contract: The BPoS NFT contract, following the ERC-721 standard, is immutable and ownerless, meaning no one can alter it post-deployment. Only the NFT holder has the authority to transfer their NFT. 
 Claim Contract: The claim process requires users to sign their staked transaction ID and target ESC address, ensuring authenticity. The claim contract checks signatures before NFT creation, preventing unauthorized minting. 
 
<p>By combining these mechanisms, BPoS NFTs maintain strong security through verified code and strict transaction protocols, reducing risks of tampering and unauthorized claims.</p>
 
 
 4. Which wallet supports BPoS NFTs on Elastos? 
<p>A: Currently, Web3 Essentials is the only compatible wallet for managing BPoS NFTs on Elastos. This wallet supports the staking, trading, and transfer functions of BPoS NFTs on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC), making it essential for users wanting to maintain flexibility with their staked assets.</p>
<p>For a complete guide on setting up and using Web3 Essentials with BPoS NFTs, you can follow the step-by-step instructions <a href="https://elastos.info/tutorial/how-to-use-bpos-nfts-on-elastos-a-step-by-step-guide/">here</a>.</p>
 
 
 5. What are the different options present on the BPoS NFT tab in the Essentials wallet? 
<p>A: In the BPoS NFT tab, the Send, Receive, and Destroy functions have specific roles:</p>
 
 Send: Allows users to transfer their BPoS NFT to another wallet, maintaining the staked position but changing ownership. 
 Receive: Enables a wallet to accept the BPoS NFT, continuing the staking status in the new owner’s control. 
 Destroy: This function permanently removes (or “burns”) the NFT and converts it back into its original staking status, i.e. only voting rights on the Main Chain without a corresponding NFT representing ownership of such voting rights. Noting that the staked ELA remains locked until the lock period ends. 
 
<p>For more detailed instructions, visit the Elastos BPoS NFT guide <a href="https://elastos.info/news/unlocking-ela-introducing-elastos-bpos-nfts/">here</a>.</p>
 
 
 6. Will I get my staked ELA back after I minted an NFT and sent it to a new wallet? 
<p>A: No, when you mint a BPoS NFT and send it to a new wallet, the new owner of the NFT gains control over the staked ELA on the main chain. This means they can choose to hold, transfer, or destroy the NFT, managing the staked ELA as they see fit. Additionally, they will also receive the rewards associated with the staked ELA.</p>
 
 
 7. Will I be able to destroy a BPoS NFT even though my wallet does not have a main chain address? 
<p>A: No, the Essentials app will not allow you to destroy or claim if your wallet does not have a corresponding Elastos main chain address.</p>
 
 
 8. What is the Elastos consensus model, and how does BPoS integrate with it? 
<p>A: Elastos operates using a multi-layered consensus mechanism called Elastic Consensus, which combines Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW) and Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) to secure the network and provide utility.</p>
 
 Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW): AuxPoW leverages Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure, allowing Bitcoin miners to secure both Bitcoin and Elastos simultaneously without extra energy costs. Approximately 50% of Bitcoin’s hash rate (about 293.69 EH/s) is used to secure Elastos, providing it with substantial security and network-wide trust. 
 Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS): In BPoS, users lock ELA on the Main Chain to secure the network and validate transactions. Validators must hold 80,000 staking rights to participate in block validation and share rewards with stakers. This incentivizes participation and contributes to the network’s stability. 
 
 
 
 9. How do BPoS NFTs unlock the value of staked ELA? 
<p>A: Traditional staking locks assets, limiting liquidity. BPoS NFTs solve this problem by converting main chain staking rights into ERC-721 standard NFTs that represent ownership to claim the underlying staked ELA and its accumulating rewards.</p>
 
 Staking and Minting:
 
 Users stake ELA tokens on the Main Chain using the Essentials Wallet. 
 Once staked, they can mint BPoS NFTs on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC). The NFT represents both the staked ELA and the accumulating APY rewards. 
 
 
 Trading and Transfer:
 
 BPoS NFTs can be freely traded or transferred on the ESC, allowing users to unlock liquidity without ending their staking position or interrupting rewards. 
 
 
 Burning and Claiming Rewards:
 
 NFT holders can burn NFTs at any time to claim APY rewards. 
 The staked ELA remains locked until the lock period ends, at which point it can be withdrawn by BPoS NFT holder and their corresponding main-chain address. 
 
 
 
 
 
 10. What is the BeL2 Arbiter Network, and how will BPoS NFTs be used within it? 
<p>A: The BeL2 Arbiter Network is an upcoming layer in the Elastos ecosystem that will enable new financial applications such as BTC-based loans, stablecoin issuance, and dispute resolution services.</p>
 
 Collateralization in the BeL2 Arbiter Network:
 
 Arbiter Entry: Users can stake ELA BPoS NFTs as collateral to participate as nodes in the BeL2 network. 
 Earning BTC and dApp Rewards: BPoS NFT arbiter nodes earn percentage-based BTC and decentralized application (dApp) rewards, alongside Main Chain ELA staking rewards, for supporting time-based transactions and dispute resolution services that reflect the value of their collateral. 
 
 
 Decentralized Financial Services:
 
 The BeL2 network supports native BTC services, ensuring decentralized loans are completed, maintaining stablecoin pegs, liquidating assets based on market conditions, and providing dispute resolution services. 
 This creates a secure, decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems without moving BTC off the mainnet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 11. What are the key advantages of Elastos BPoS NFTs? 
<p>A: The key advantages include:</p>
 
 Flexible Liquidity: Users can trade or transfer staked assets and their rewards as NFT receipts without waiting for the lock period to end. 
 Bitcoin-Backed Security: With a significant portion of Bitcoin’s hash rate securing Elastos, the network benefits from high levels of trust and reliability. 
 New Financial Tools: BPoS NFTs can be used as collateral for loans and arbitration services in the BeL2 network, creating new earning opportunities. 
 Simple Wallet Management: Users can manage NFTs through the non-custodial Essentials Wallet, ensuring full control over staked assets. 
 
 
 
 12. How can I mint, claim, and manage BPoS NFTs using the Essentials Wallet? 
<p>A: To mint, claim, and manage BPoS NFTs, follow these steps:</p>
 
 Minting:
 
 Enter Your Votes: Stake ELA on the Elastos Main Chain using the Essentials Wallet and allocate your voting power. 
 Initiate the Minting Process: Confirm the minting transaction to create a BPoS NFT. 
 Wait for Confirmations: Wait for 6 block confirmations on the Main Chain. 
 Switch to Elastos Smart Chain: Move to the ESC to complete the claim process. 
 
 
 Claiming:
 
 Automatic Check for Claimable NFTs: On the ESC, Essentials will automatically search for any claimable BPoS NFTs tied to your wallet address. 
 Claim the NFT: Click “Claim” to transfer the minted BPoS NFT to your wallet. 
 
 
 Managing:
 
 Transfer the NFT:
 
 Select “Send” and enter the destination address to transfer the NFT to another wallet. 
 
 
 Destroy the NFT:
 
 Choose “Destroy” to convert the NFT back into a vote on the Main Chain, regaining its original staking status. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13. Are there future plans for BPoS NFTs within the Elastos ecosystem? 
<p>A: Yes, future plans include:</p>
 
 Integration into Marketplaces: BPoS NFTs will be incorporated into platforms like <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> for trading. 
 Use in the BeL2 Arbiter Network: They will serve as collateral within the BeL2 network for BTC-based loans and dispute resolution services. 
 Network Security Rewards: Opportunities to help secure the network in return for BTC rewards.

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, you may not need to remember a password ever again.</p>



<p>Apple thinks 249 of my passwords need attention. Some of them have been reused. Some of them have been caught up in data breaches. Some are just bad passwords.</p>



<p>That’s why, for the past 11 years, a group called the FIDO Alliance has been working to kill passwords — or at least make us less reliant on them. FIDO, short for Fast IDentity Online, wants to make signing into your accounts not only more secure but also, as the name implies, faster and easier. Since its members include Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and other architects of our online experience, the FIDO Alliance is in a position to accomplish this, too.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve realized it or not, FIDO’s efforts have already transformed the way you sign into everything online. You may have noticed a few years ago, for instance, that a lot more sites started requiring <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/MFA">something called multifactor authentication</a>, which adds an extra step to the login process, like texting a code to your phone so the site can verify you are you. That was FIDO’s doing.</p>



<p>But after years of making logging in more difficult but more secure, the alliance <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-launches-comprehensive-web-resource-to-accelerate-passkey-adoption/">recently began a major push</a> to get platforms and people alike to adopt a technology that may just kill passwords altogether: passkeys.</p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/intel/bulletins/legal-juridique-eng">FINTRAC Special Bulletin on money laundering and sanctions evasion in the legal profession </a>is a clear reminder that safeguarding our financial systems—and upholding security—requires both vigilance and innovation. At the core of these efforts lies a powerful tool: digital verification of client identification. This technology is crucial in preventing the misuse of legal services for illicit activities like money laundering and sanctions evasion.</p>
  



<p>While most legal professionals work with integrity, the bulletin underscores that a few actors may unwittingly (or intentionally) facilitate financial crime. This crime threatens the integrity of our financial system and erodes the public’s trust in our legal system, where the majority are acting in good faith. </p>



<p>So, where does DIACC fit in? How does digital verification help mitigate these risks?</p>



<p>DIACC’s Role in Strengthening Digital Verification</p>



<p>Our work—anchored in the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF)</a>—is focused on enabling secure, privacy-respecting digital trust and verification services that support consumers, businesses, and governments. These services are essential in a world where digital interactions are the norm, and ensuring information authenticity is critical to preventing fraud and criminal activities.</p>



<p>The Law Society Profile: Supporting Legal Sector Security</p>



<p>One of the most exciting initiatives DIACC has undertaken is the development of the PCTF Law Society Profile. Working closely with the Federation of Law Societies of Canada (FLSC) and essential interested parties, this project highlights how the legal sector can play a pivotal role in combating money laundering. By establishing auditable criteria to mitigate risk and build assurance for client verification, the PCTF Law Society Profile enables legal professionals to confidently select trusted services that verify their clients’ identities, providing evidence of investment in alignment with stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements.</p>



<p>This certification process helps legal professionals choose services one step ahead of fraudsters, ensuring transparency and security as they navigate high-value or high-risk transactions.</p>



  
<p>As the <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/trusted-list/">trusted list of DIACC PCTF Certified Providers</a> grows, DIACC also launched its <a href="https://directory.diacc.ca/">Member Services Directory</a>, a directory of services offered by DIACC members, certified providers, and applicants. And, let’s face it, digital verification can be hard to explain, so we’ve launched a growing <a href="https://diacc.ca/digital-trust-stories/">Big Book of Digital Trust Stories</a>. Our Digital Trust Stories explain the mechanics and benefits in simple language to help people and organizations understand the benefits of digital trust and verification.  These are just some of the tools DIACC develops to help ensure legal professionals can access the digital trust tools they need.</p>
  



<p>Addressing Risks in Financial and Legal Transactions</p>



<p>The findings from FINTRAC serve as a call to action. Legal professionals—particularly those involved in high-risk sectors like real estate or corporate structuring—are in a unique position of trust. Digital verification can play a crucial role in mitigating risks by adding layers of security that protect against misuse.</p>



  
<p>By adopting robust digital client verification solutions, legal professionals can:</p>



 
 Mitigate real estate and corporate transaction risks, ensuring transparency around beneficial ownership.<br> 



 Strengthen KYC processes, ensuring that clients are who they claim to be.<br> 



 Safeguard solicitor-client privilege by securing client access to sensitive legal processes. 
 
  



<p>DIACC and the Path Forward</p>



<p>The need to protect our financial integrity has never been more apparent. DIACC’s commitment, mission, and vision align directly with the challenges identified in the FINTRAC bulletin. Our role is to ensure that digital trust and verification tools are practical, accessible, and secure across industries, particularly in high-risk areas like the legal profession.</p>



<p>We are proud to partner with industries, governments, and professionals who share our vision for a future where transparency, security, and trust are central to every transaction.</p>



<p>DIACC is an open and transparent <a href="https://diacc.ca/membership/diacc-members/">community of leaders</a> dedicated to one issue: the responsible adoption of digital trust and verification practices. </p>



<p><a>Contact DIACC</a> to collaborate and build a future where transparency, privacy, security, and trust are at the forefront of every transaction.</p>

<p>It’s immensely satisfying to see the growing recognition of the vital role digital identity plays in eCommerce and secure online transactions across industries and government. DINZ’s involvement at the highest levels is paying off. Earlier this month, DINZ, our NZTech Group colleagues at&nbsp;<a href="https://fintechnz.org.nz/">FinTechNZ</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://fintechnz.org.nz/regtech-nz/">&nbsp;RegTechNZ</a>, along with DINZ members&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hgmlegal.com/">HGM</a>,<a href="https://www.minterellison.co.nz/">&nbsp;MERW</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/">PaymentsNZ</a>&nbsp;API Centre, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sushlabs.com/">Sushlabs</a>&nbsp;joined a roundtable with Minister Bayly. This followed our meeting with Minister Collins in August and focussed on fostering innovation in financial services. Workstreams are now underway, and we’ll report back to Minister Bayly in December.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With today’s latest news that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-overhaul-anti-money-laundering-regime">Government will introduce a single supervisor and a new funding model</a>&nbsp;in a major overhaul of New Zealand’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism, if you have thoughts on the digital identity aspect of this discussion,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">we’d love to hear from you</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the regulatory front, we’ve met with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) to reinforce our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/08/07/dinz-supports-nztechs-biometrics-concerns/">well publicised views</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Submission-Biometrics-Code-Exposure-Draft-May-2024.pdf">proposed biometrics code of practice</a>, with&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/10/23/biometrics-update-dinz-and-nec-webinar-in-review/">media also showing interest</a>&nbsp;in our biometrics mahi.

 How to gaining additional perspectives by focusing on boundary judgements, interrelationships, and feedback&nbsp;loops Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><blockquote>“There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know.” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">Donald Rumsfeld</a>)</blockquote><p>In my recent post on the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-the-strategic-uses-of-ambiguity-c403bff44029">strategic uses of ambiguity</a> I explored how, when used thoughtfully, it can be a powerful tool in complex environments.</p><p>Then, in my <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-51d6e4f9df0b">Introduction to Systems Thinking</a> series I explained that by reflecting on boundary judgements, understanding interrelationships, and engaging with multiple perspectives we can gain deeper insights into the systems we navigate.</p><p>In this follow-up, written in collaboration with Laura Hilliger, I aim to demonstrate how ambiguity can be used alongside systems thinking in a ‘playful’ way to shine light on our assumptions.</p> Ambiguity and System Boundaries This diagram is explained in the post <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-the-strategic-uses-of-ambiguity-c403bff44029">On the strategic uses of ambiguity</a><p>While ambiguity and systems thinking might seem like opposing concepts, when combined deliberately, productive ambiguity becomes a potent tool for exploring complex&nbsp;systems.</p><blockquote>Productive Ambiguity — this represents ambiguity that is beneficial or intentional in generating positive outcomes because it helps people shift their view. For example, as part of a strategy where leaving things unsaid or open to interpretation can lead to more flexible and adaptable solutions. (<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-the-strategic-uses-of-ambiguity-c403bff44029">On the Strategic Uses of Ambiguity</a>)</blockquote><p>Drawing boundaries around systems is essential for analysis. However, these boundaries often rest on assumptions that may go unexamined. Introducing productive ambiguity allows us to ‘play’ with the boundaries, questioning what we include or exclude and why. Productive ambiguity opens up space for new interpretations and challenges our assumptions in ways that are&nbsp;useful.</p> 🛝🌳⛲ Example: Park Revitalisation Project <p>Let’s say you’re working on a project to revitalise a local park. The initial assumption might be that only park users and local authorities are the relevant stakeholders. This is the boundary. However, by embracing productive ambiguity, you might ask: “Could nearby schools, local businesses, or community groups influence or benefit from this project in ways we haven’t considered?”</p><p>This open-ended question uncovers a wider boundary than had been included in the initial planning — such as schools using the park for outdoor learning or local businesses benefiting from increased foot traffic. The approach reveals hidden dynamics and helps develop a project that serves a broader and more diverse community.</p><p>Reflecting on boundary judgements isn’t just about defining the limits of a system. Rather, it’s about acknowledging that these limits can obscure important elements. By introducing productive ambiguity into our boundary judgements, we can challenge rigid definitions and explore what might be hidden just beyond&nbsp;them.</p><p>Productive ambiguity encourages us to ask, “What if our assumptions about this boundary are incomplete?” This approach allows us to ‘play’ with the system’s edges, revealing blind spots that a strict boundary might&nbsp;conceal.</p> Understanding Interrelationships Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In systems thinking, understanding the interrelationships within a system is essential because these connections are complex and often hard to identify.</p><p>Productive ambiguity can help us explore these interrelationships by allowing us to entertain multiple interpretations of how components might interact. This, in turn, leads to insights that wouldn’t have emerged through a linear approach.</p> 🛝🌳⛲ Example: Park Revitalisation Project <p>Returning to our park project, imagine that a local school starts using the park for outdoor activities. Asking open-ended questions helps bring in some productive ambiguity. What kinds of facilities or services might schoolchildren like to have? Let’s say they suggest an ice cream stand. By entertaining this idea, we begin to explore the wider interrelationships: What infrastructure would support this? We might need to consider water supply, electrical outlets, waste management, and accessibility for vendors and customers. As we dig deeper, we start to see how various systems — utilities, transport, local regulations — interconnect with the park in ways that weren’t immediately obvious.</p><p>By ‘playing’ with productive ambiguity, we can imagine alternative scenarios and question established cause-and-effect relationships. This exploration can uncover hidden feedback loops and leverage points — small changes that can have significant impacts.</p><p>For instance, something as simple as adding an ice cream stand might lead to greater foot traffic, which in turn could spark local businesses’ interest in park events or influence how the park is maintained. Productive ambiguity therefore helps us see beyond the obvious and consider connections that might influence the system in unexpected ways.</p> Engaging with Multiple Perspectives Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Bringing in diverse viewpoints is a crucial aspect of systems thinking, and productive ambiguity serves as a powerful tool for uncovering these perspectives. It opens the door to diverse interpretations, encouraging new perspectives and exposing areas where thinking may have become too&nbsp;narrow.</p> 🛝🌳⛲ Example: Park Revitalisation Project <p>For instance, in the project to revitalise a local park, productive ambiguity could be introduced by presenting different possible uses for the space — such as turning it into a sports facility, a community garden, or a children’s play area — without making a definitive decision upfront. This uncertainty encourages people to imagine how these options might affect their lives or the community, drawing out diverse perspectives. As a result, the project might reveal multiple perspectives which have been overlooked, such as local businesses seeing the park as a venue for markets or under-represented groups desiring a space for cultural events. This approach helps encourage a richer, more inclusive and diverse vision for the park’s&nbsp;future.</p><p>By introducing some ambiguity into these discussions, we encourage others to challenge their assumptions and share insights that might not otherwise come forward. This collective ‘play’ with ideas can uncover areas of the system that need further attention. It also helps us avoid the trap of thinking that any one perspective is the only valid&nbsp;one.</p> Using Feedback&nbsp;Loops Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>An essential part of systems thinking involves <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-77eb29d510a4">feedback loops</a>: positive loops tend to reinforce certain behaviours, while negative loops work to maintain balance by counteracting them. Considering these loops alongside productive ambiguity can reveal how uncertainty either helps uncover hidden aspects of the system or, conversely, makes them more difficult to&nbsp;detect.</p> 🛝🌳⛲ Example: Park Revitalisation Project <p>Again, using the park project as an example, the more ideas community members share about the park’s potential, the more excitement builds. This creates a positive feedback loop where new ideas inspire further participation. However, if the discussions remain too vague, some community members may grow frustrated with the lack of direction, creating a negative feedback loop that stalls the project. Here, productive ambiguity ensures that ambiguity leads to curiosity and exploration rather than confusion or paralysis, guiding the feedback loop toward uncovering blind spots rather than reinforcing them.</p><p>By understanding how feedback loops interact with productive ambiguity, we can steer systems toward more insightful outcomes. The key is to maintain just enough uncertainty to encourage exploration without allowing it to drift into confusion. This helps ensure that feedback loops support the uncovering of hidden system dynamics rather than obscuring them.</p> Conclusion <p>By integrating productive ambiguity into systems thinking practices, we enhance our ability to identify and address assumptions being made. Productive ambiguity allows us to ‘play’ with systems — testing boundaries, exploring interrelationships, and engaging with diverse perspectives. This helps reveal hidden elements, uncover predominant perspectives, and gain deeper insights.</p><p>Embracing productive ambiguity doesn’t mean creating unnecessary confusion. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of systems and the value of multiple interpretations. The approach challenges fixed assumptions, encouraging us to develop more flexible, inclusive, and insightful strategies for navigating complex systems. Through productive ambiguity, we move beyond rigid boundaries and engage with the richness that systems — and the people within them — offer.</p><p>Do you need help with this kind of thing? <a href="https://weareopen.coop">Get in touch</a> with&nbsp;WAO!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/finding-unexamined-assumptions-through-systems-thinking-and-ambiguity-17c6e98c670f">Finding Unexamined Assumptions Through Systems Thinking and Ambiguity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) NFT system on Elastos allows users to mint, claim, manage, and redeem ELA-backed <a href="https://esc.elastos.io/address/0x06D49BB1F338420E1d8577829C079DCB4cb5eF25/transactions">ERC721 NFTs</a>, unlocking liquidity for Smart Chain utility whilst supporting the mainchain network’s security. Want to learn more about BPOS NFTs? <a href="https://elastos.info/news/unlocking-ela-introducing-elastos-bpos-nfts/">Learn here!</a> Today, we will walk you through the process of creating and using BPoS NFTs across the Elastos Main Chain and Smart Chain using the <a href="https://elastos.info/essentials-the-super-wallet/">Essentials Wallet.</a></p>
 
 Step 1: Minting a BPoS NFT on the Elastos Main Chain 
<p>1. Enter Your Votes: Start by logging into your Elastos wallet and accessing the staking section on the Elastos Main Chain. Choose how you want to allocate your voting power with the staked ELA. For a guide on BPOS voting, please see here.</p>
<p>2. Initiate the Minting Process: After selecting your votes, confirm the minting transaction to create a BPoS NFT.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Wait for 6 Block Confirmations: The transaction will take some time to be confirmed by the network. You must wait for 6 blocks to be produced by the Elastos Main Chain before proceeding.</p>
<p>4. Switch to Elastos Smart Chain: Once confirmed, move over to the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) to complete the claim process.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Step 2: Claiming Your BPoS NFT on Elastos Smart Chain 
<p>1. Automatic Check for Claimable NFTs: On the Elastos Smart Chain, Essentials will automatically search for any claimable BPoS NFTs tied to your wallet address. You will receive a notification once a claimable NFT is found.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Manual Check for NFTs: If you don’t receive a notification, you can manually check by going to the NFT claim section in the wallet.</p>
<p>3. Claim the NFT: Click “Claim” to transfer the minted BPoS NFT to your wallet. After the claim is successful, the NFT will appear under the “Collectibles” section of your wallet homepage.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Step 3: Managing Your BPoS NFT 
<p>Once the BPoS NFT is in your wallet, you can perform several actions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Transfer the NFT to Another Wallet:</p>
 
 
 
 Navigate to the BPoS NFT in the “Collectibles” section. 
 Select “Send” and enter the destination address to transfer the NFT. 
 
 
 
<p>2. Destroy the NFT (Convert Back to a Vote):<br>
If you want to stop using the NFT and return to staking directly on the Elastos Main Chain:</p>
 
 
 
 Choose “Destroy” from the options. 
 When destroyed, the BPoS NFT will be converted back into a vote and returned to the Main Chain, where it will regain its original staking status. 
 
 
 
<p>3. Future Utility: Upcoming BPOS NFTs plans include incorporating into Elacity’s marketplace for trading and the BeL2s Arbiter network for collateral, as well as opening opportunities to help secure the network in return for BTC rewards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unlocking Value 
<p>This BPoS NFT system provides users with flexibility, offering the ability to mint NFTs from staked tokens, claim them, and transfer or destroy them as needed. With these NFTs acting as new assets and voting receipts, users can engage with Elastos more dynamically—staking, earning rewards, and participating in governance, all while maintaining liquidity.</p>
<p>By following this guide, you can now confidently navigate the Elastos BPoS NFT ecosystem, unlocking new ways to maximize your staking rewards and explore opportunities within the BeL2 network.

<p>VRM Days always happen the day before <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">IIW</a> starts, twice each year. Usually, we have about 50 registered and 30 showing up. (Some are online, though we’d rather have their bodies in the room.)&nbsp; For the<a href="https://vrmday2024b.eventbrite.com/"> VRM Day this coming Monday</a>, we’re expecting more than 100 people. So, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I91DJZKRxs">Sheriff Brody said in Jaws</a>, we need a bigger room.</p>
<p>And we have one. So that’s good. Logistics will be challenging, but we’re on top of them.</p>
<p>IIW is also close to sold out. Last I checked, there were just nine tickets left.</p>
<p>Here is copy from our Eventbrite page as it now stands:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Main Thing</p>
<p>At this VRM Day, Ben Moskowitz, VP Innovation and Ginny Fahs, Director of Product R&amp;D at&nbsp;<a title="https://www.consumerreports.org/" href="https://www.consumerreports.org/">Consumer Reports</a>&nbsp;will lead discussion of some of their early R&amp;D concepts around a new approach to customer service: one in which personal AI agents represent customers’ best interests.</p>
<p>This is CX (Customer Experience) re-imagined and re-implemented in ways that are no less real and human but far more intelligent, mutually informative, and useful than what all of us have experienced thus far in the Digital Age. CR is looking for feedback and collaboration as they move forward. They plan to participate in IIW as well.</p>
<p>As usual, everyone who wants to share what they’re working on in the VRM space will have time to present, discuss, and prep for IIW.</p>
<p>Schedule</p>
<p>Morning:</p>
 
 9am – Noon. Consumer Reports presentation and discussion (on the above) 
 
<p>Lunch</p>
 
 Noon – 1:30 (Sports Page or Zareen’s (diagonal across the intersection) 
 
<p>Afternoon</p>
 
 Adrian Gropper on HIE of One, Medical AI Assistant (MAIA) and personal AI in health care 
 Joe Andrieu on the Digital Fiduciary Initiative 
 Cryptid / KwaaiNet demo 
 Iain Henderson on Data Pal 
 Richard Whitt on GliaNet Alliance 
 Customer Commons on IEEE P7012 
 Paul Trevithick (Mee.Foundation) on Private Advertising 
 
</blockquote>
 
 
<blockquote><p>Discussion on any or all of the above</p></blockquote>
 
 
<blockquote><p>Listing planned IIW sessions</p></blockquote>
 
 
<p>Subject to change, of course.</p>
<p>Since we have a lot to cover, please be there at 9am sharp, and be back from lunch at 1:30.</p>
<p>Note that there are only three lunch places nearby. Cucina Venti is good but relatively expensive and service is slow. Sports Page is makes good sandwiches and has lots of picnic tables. It’s where most of us usually go. Haven’t tried Zareen’s, behind the Sports Page, where Sunny Bowl and other restaurants used to be. It has “familiar &amp; innovative halal spins on Indian &amp; Pakistani cooking.”</p>

		<p>The U.S. Department of Justice’s final rule on Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has significant implications for public universities and community colleges regarding web content and mobile app accessibility. Finalized in April 2024 and effective from June 2024, the rule adopts Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA as the new standard for digital accessibility. This means that covered entities must ensure their digital platforms, including websites and mobile apps, comply with specific requirements for captioning and audio descriptions.</p>
<p>The compliance deadlines are set for 2026 and 2027, depending on the local government population size. While there are limited exceptions for archived web content and preexisting social media posts, password-protected content must also meet these standards. All state and local government entities across the United States and their third-party contractors and software vendors must comply. The rule impacts a wide range of public services, from municipal offices to schools, libraries, and museums.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Overall, the new rule represents a significant step towards improving digital accessibility in higher education, requiring institutions to take proactive measures to accommodate all users, including those with disabilities. While this sounds daunting, the key to success with these updated guidelines are early preparation and clear understanding of them and what they mean.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Working with an experienced partner like Edge to facilitate the transition to full compliance is key. Edge can help you take swift action to meet these new requirements. Compliance not only mitigates legal risks but also positions institutions as leaders in inclusive digital services. The potential return on investment in accessibility beyond legal compliance is astronomical, serving a broader audience and enhancing overall user experience for all your students, current and potential.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		 Time is of the essence with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

<p>Staking cryptocurrency assets typically means locking them away for months, leaving users unable to take advantage of new opportunities—a common frustration in the crypto space. But what if the Elastos ecosystem allowed users to unlock staked Mainchain ELA without unstaking? With Elastos BPoS NFTs, users can convert their staked assets and APY rewards into NFT receipts on the Elastos Sidechain’s (ESC) open market.</p>
<p>The Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) NFT system offers a novel solution by combining Bitcoin-backed ELA staking security, ELA APY rewards, and tokenized liquidity through ERC-721 standard NFTs. This system allows users to stake ELA with validators and mint BPoS NFTs, representing their staked assets and accruing Mainchain rewards. These NFTs can be traded, collateralized, or transferred using Smart Contracts. Let’s explore how BPoS NFTs work, the Elastos consensus model, and the essential role these NFTs will play in the upcoming BeL2 Arbiter network.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding Elastos’ Dual Consensus Model 
<p>Elastos operates using a multi-layered consensus called <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastic-consensus-technical-overview/">Elastic Consensus</a>, combining Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW) with Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) to secure the network and provide utility.</p>
 1. Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW): Bitcoin-Backed Security 
 
 Bitcoin’s Security: AuxPoW leverages Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure, allowing Bitcoin miners to secure both Bitcoin and Elastos simultaneously without extra energy costs. 
 293.69 EH/s of Bitcoin’s total 580.74 EH/s hash rate reinforces Elastos, giving it nearly 50% of Bitcoin’s security. 
 Benefits of AuxPoW:
 
 Energy Efficiency: Elastos inherits Bitcoin’s security without additional energy consumption. 
 Network-Wide Trust: This shared security protects the Elastos Mainchain and sidechains, making the entire ecosystem highly reliable. 
 
 
 
 2. Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS): Securing the Network with Validators 
 
 Long-Term Staking: Users lock ELA on the Mainchain to secure the network and validate transactions. 
 Incentivizing Participation: <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastos-ela-bitcoin-merge-mining-economic-model/">Users earn 2-3% APR</a>, with higher rewards for longer lock periods. Validators must hold 80,000 staking rights to participate in block validation, sharing rewards with stakers. 
 
<p>This hybrid consensus model ensures that Elastos is anchored in Bitcoin’s security, while BPoS validators provide a second layer of decentralized governance and stability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Elastos BPoS NFTs Unlock the Value of Staked ELA 
<p>Traditional staking locks assets, limiting liquidity. BPoS NFTs solve this problem for Elastos and by converting its mainchain voting rights into ERC-721 standard NFTs that represent the ownership to claim the underlying staked ELA and its accumulating rewards.</p>
 How BPoS NFTs Work 
 
 Staking and Minting:
 
 Users stake ELA tokens on the Mainchain using the Essentials Wallet. 
 Once staked, they can mint BPoS NFTs on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC). 
 The NFT represents both the staked ELA and the accumulating APY rewards. 
 
 
 Trading and Transfer:
 
 BPoS NFTs can be freely traded or transferred on the Elastos Smart Chain. 
 This allows users to unlock liquidity without ending their staking position or interrupting rewards. 
 
 
 Burning and Claiming Rewards:
 
 NFT holders can burn NFTs anytime to claim APY rewards. 
 The staked ELA remains locked until the lock period ends, at which point it can be withdrawn by the original staker. 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 BeL2 Arbiter Network: Unlocking New Financial Applications 
<p>In the upcoming <a href="http://Bel2.org">BeL2</a> arbiter network, BPoS NFTs will act as collateral for BTC-based loans, stablecoin issuance, and dispute resolution services. Arbiter nodes using these NFTs as collateral will earn BTC-based and dApp rewards, in addition to Mainchain ELA rewards.</p>
<p>This decentralized financial infrastructure will allow users to participate in Bitcoin-native dApps without moving BTC off the mainnet, creating an easy integration between Bitcoin security and BeL2 DeFi applications, such as the upcoming Harvard student-led teams “<a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/launch-new-bretton-woods-project-harvard-bitcoin-stablecoin/">New Bretton Woods (NBW)</a>” project, incubated by the Harvard Innovation Labs.</p>
 Collateralization in the BeL2 Arbiter Network 
 
 Arbiter Entry: Users can stake ELA BPoS NFTs as collateral to participate as nodes in the BeL2 network. 
 Earn BTC and dApp Rewards: BPoS NFT arbiter nodes earn percentage-based BTC and dApp rewards, alongside Mainchain ELA staking rewards, for supporting time-based transactions and dispute resolution services that reflect the value of their collateral. 
 Decentralized Financial Services: The BeL2 arbiter network supports Native BTC services, ensuring decentralized loans are completed, maintaining stablecoin pegs, liquidating assets based on market conditions, and providing dispute resolution services, offering a secure, decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 So What are the Key Advantages of Elastos BPoS NFTs? 
 
 Flexible Liquidity: Trade or transfer staked assets and their rewards as NFT receipts without waiting for the lock period to end. 
 Bitcoin-Backed Security: 293.69 EH/s of Bitcoin’s hash rate secures the Elastos Mainchain, providing trust and reliability. 
 New Financial Tools: Use BPoS NFTs as collateral for loans and arbitration services in the upcoming BeL2 network. 
 Simple Wallet Management: Manage NFTs through the non-custodial <a href="https://elastos.info/essentials-the-super-wallet/">Essentials Wallet</a>, ensuring full control over staked assets. 
 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>The Elastos BPoS NFT system offers a groundbreaking solution by combining Bitcoin’s security with NFT liquidity. Users can mint, trade, or burn NFTs anytime, claiming APY rewards without interrupting their staking period. The ability to unlock staked ELA after the lock period ensures long-term rewards while maintaining flexibility.</p>
<p>With the upcoming BeL2 Arbiter Network, BPoS NFTs will serve as collateral for BTC-based loans and dispute resolution services, creating new earning opportunities. This innovative design reflects Elastos’ commitment to decentralization, offering secure and scalable financial tools for the future of blockchain-based finance.</p>
<p>With ELA’s fixed supply of 28.22 million, Bitcoin merge-mining security, and a 4-year halving cycle, participants benefit from both scarcity and sustainability. The Elastos BPoS NFT system sets a new standard for DeFi innovation by offering liquidity, security, and long-term value for users.</p>

<p>A subgroup of OpenID Foundation board members and key staff have been working to update the “OpenID Process” document based on issues raised by some board members to ensure the document aligns with how the Foundation currently works. This update addresses those original issues and also identified a significant number of mainly editorial issues and improvements that were possible. It also highlighted inconsistencies and&nbsp;other issues that required coordinating revisions&nbsp;with the “Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy,” so that has been added to the scope and improvements proposed. Full details including material changes made can be <a href="https://openid.net/proposed-revisions-oid-process-doc-and-ipr-policy/">referenced here</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The changes were unanimously approved&nbsp;by the board at the September 12, 2024 board meeting. Approving these changes also required a 21-day review and 14-day vote of the membership with a 30% quorum requirement.</p>
 
 
<p>I am pleased to announce that the update Process Document and IPR Policy were approved by the membership this past Saturday, October 19, 2024 with 34% member participation, greater than the 30% quorum requirement for the vote.</p>
 
 
<p>The voting results were:</p>
 
<p>Approve – 106 votes</p>
<p>Object – 1 vote</p>
 
<p>Abstain – 21 votes</p>

<p>Digital Identity NZ (DINZ), through its Policy and Regulatory Subcommittee, has provided feedback to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) for the proposed open banking regulations and standards under the Customer and Product Data Bill. This collaborative submission reflects insights from DINZ members across New Zealand’s digital identity sector, representing both large and small organisations.</p>



<p>DINZ fully supports the Bill’s goal to unlock the value of customer data, fostering competition and innovation. However, our submission highlights specific areas where the proposed rules could be enhanced to better achieve these objectives.</p>



<p>Empowering Customers through Open Banking</p>



<p>DINZ appreciates the Bill’s focus on giving customers control over their data, which can drive a more competitive and dynamic marketplace. However, we raised concerns around the prioritisation of the banking and electricity sectors, believing that a broader scope of competitive third-party providers is essential for success. Additionally, affordability is crucial, as the cost of third-party services could hinder widespread adoption.</p>



<p>Data Security and Privacy</p>



<p>Maintaining data security is a key focus for DINZ. While the Bill requires transparency from data holders and accredited requesters, we recommend aligning with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 to safeguard consumers’ data without unnecessarily disclosing sensitive information. This ensures robust protection and trust.</p>



<p>Learning from Australia’s Open Banking Journey</p>



<p>Reflecting on Australia’s slow uptake of open banking, DINZ cautions against over-reliance on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) as a singular solution. A more holistic approach is needed to address identity, verification, and consent challenges in the context of open banking. Colin Wallis, Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ says:</p>



<p>“DINZ supports the general direction indicated in the discussion paper, however it considers that not enough attention is being directed to the reasons behind the slow take-up in Australia. Additionally unintended consequences may arise from its seemingly over reliance on the DISTF as the magic bullet to resolve all the digital identity, verification, attribute exchange and consent – as much as we would all like that.”</p>



<p>DINZ is committed to working with MBIE to ensure a secure, efficient, and inclusive open banking framework that benefits all Kiwis.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance is aware of passkey lock-in, and it’s actively working to address that:</p>



<p>With all relevant operating systems now natively supporting <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, companies have been increasingly adopting them as an alternative to passwords. Relying on passkeys minimizes the risk of getting hacked, as users don’t have access to their cryptographic keys, and intercepting them is significantly more challenging. However, those switching between different service providers may prefer traditional passwords, as there’s currently no easy way to import or export passkeys. To minimize the friction separating distinct platforms, the FIDO Alliance is working on a solution that makes moving passkeys between them a breeze.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">published</a>&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/say-goodbye-to-passkey-lock-in-fidos-new-specs-enable-secure-transfers/">Neowin</a>) a working draft encompassing specifications that would make moving passkeys between providers possible. When implemented, users would be able to securely import and export their passkeys, making switching platforms less challenging. Read more of the article.</p>

<p>Digital communities are collections of individual entities that are connected together. They can be modeled as graphs, with the individuals being nodes and their relationships being edges.</p>

<p>Traditionally, identity models have focused on the nodes, but in <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-1/">Musings of a Trust Architect: Edge Identifiers &amp; Cliques</a>, I suggested that both private keys and public-key identifiers could be based on the relational edges, and that when you combined a complete set of edges you could create a cryptographic clique, where the group was seen as an entity of its own, with the identities of any participants hidden through the use of a Schnorr-based signature.</p>

<p>My first look at cliques focused on the technical definition, which requires that cliques be “closed”, meaning that there’s a relationship between every pair in the group and that those pairwise edges form the clique identity among them.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>However, creating closed graphs becomes increasingly difficult as the graph size grows. There are some alternatives which I discuss here: open cliques and fuzzy cliques. The entities forming a clique also don’t have to be people, as I discuss in cliques of devices.</p>

 Open Cliques 

<p>Cryptographic cliques don’t have to be fully closed. Open cliques are also possible. (In graph theory these technically are not called “cliques”, but I’m going to continue to use the term for cryptographic identifiers that are based on edges.)</p>

<p>While the concept of a fully connected clique provides clear value in graph theory, such structures can become computationally intensive, especially as the group size increases. Open cryptographic cliques, which are not completely interconnected, may then be used instead.</p>

<p>Open cliques support different sorts of modeling, for groups where not everyone is connected and where the relationships are fluid. They also allow for easier growth: a clique can organically add a new member when a single participant creates a relationship with them, without the need to define the new member’s relationship to everyone in the clique (especially as most of those relationships would not exist).</p>

<p>For example, Bob might not actually have a close or independent relationship with his mother-in-law, Anna, while Mary’s best friend from college, Beth, might join the clique when she stays with the family, despite the fact that she only has a real relationship with Mary. (However, more relationships, and thus edges, might develop over time!)</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>While open cliques may lack the complete interconnectedness of their closed counterparts, they offer a realistic representation of the evolving nature of dynamic social relationships.  One of the main questions regarding them is when and how to recognize new edges as an open clique evolves, and thus when and how to rotate the clique’s overall keys.</p>

 Fuzzy Cliques 

<p>As discussed in the appendix to this article, there are currently two major Schnorr-based MPC signature systems that could be used as the foundation of cliques: FROST and MuSig2. Each comes with its own advantages and limitations, but one of the advantages of using FROST is that it allows for the creation of fuzzy cliques, thanks to its ability to create threshold signatures (with <code>m of n</code> agreement required to sign where <code>m≤n</code>).</p>

<p>This allows group decisions or representations to be based on a subset (threshold) of members rather than requiring unanimity, as would be required when using MuSig2 in its native form. Using thresholds to define group interactions adds a degree of “fuzziness” or flexibility to the representation of those groups and their actions, at the price of higher latency and the fact that the theoretical implications are not as well studied.</p>

<p>There’s one other catch: fuzzy cliques are the one situation where the Relationship Signature Paradigm can’t be used. Though we still create the relational edges, to allow any pair of participants in the clique to make joint decisions, the clique keys are created by the individual participants, not the edges, ensuring that we have thresholds of participants making decisions, not thresholds of edges (which would quickly become confusing!).</p>

<p>Even for a triadic clique, the privacy implications of using a threshold key to represent the clique are notable.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>Imagine that the participants generated two FROST keys for the triadic clique, one that had a 2-of-3 threshold and one that had a 3-of-3 threshold. If every one agreed, they could all sign with their share fragments of the 3-of-3 private key, and anyone could compare it to the 3-of-3 public key and know that the group was in perfect consensus.</p>

<p>But what if you only required the consensus of two members of the group? After all, Joshua probably won’t be making a lot of decisions for a while. Theoretically, you could just sign with one of your relational edge keys, such as the Mary-Bob relational edge key. That demonstrates the consensus of two members of the clique and supports accountability: you know which two participants signed.</p>

<p>But, if you instead sign with the 2-of-3 threshold key for the clique you get to take advantage of the aggregatability that’s baked into Schnorr. With it, no one knows which two people signed (or indeed, if two or three people signed). They just know that at least the threshold of people within the group signed. It’s a powerful privacy enhancement that really shows off the power of fuzzy cliques.</p>

<p>Fuzzy cliques allow for real-world decision-making dynamics, where different sorts of decisions might require a single person’s agreement, a majority’s agreement, a super-majority’s agreement, and everyone’s agreement. This creates a model for fully decentralized decision-making that’s resilient and fault tolerant, all while supporting both individual privacy and group accountability (which still allowing for individual accountability using relational edges).</p>

 Cliques of Devices 

<p>Thus far, I’ve largely presumed that relational edges and cryptographic cliques are created by people. But, that doesn’t have to be the case: independent nodes in a graph can be entities of any type, including devices.</p>

<p>In my first article, I touched upon the idea that a clique could define not just a group, but also a singular person’s identity. This could be done using devices. Imagine that a person has a few devices that together form the basis of his digital identity: a hub of information that contains his credentials; a biometric ring that verifies his physical identity, primarily to unlock that hub; and a coordinator that allows a clique-identity to communication with the network. The following diagram shows how our old friend Bob could be defined as an open clique including devices:</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>Using the clique-of-cliques model, this then might be the identity that’s linked in with Mary and Joshua to form their triadic nuclear-family clique:</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>Though these examples suggest a clique where devices and real people are mixed together, that’s not the only option. Another example might be a fuzzy clique made up of three automated factcheckers, which are all devices. Together, any two can issue a finding of “TRUE” or “FALSE”:</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>Again using the clique-of-cliques model, these fact checkers could then interact with other identities, such as Dan and Ty, who write together.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>The Fact Checkers interact with the authors’ edge relationship (known by their joint pseudonym, “James”), to sign off on the validity of their work. Thanks to the aggregatability of Schnorr signatures, no one knows (or cares) that the Fact Checkers are three devices or the authors are two people!</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Cliques offer a powerful new model for identity control (and more generally, for control of many sorts of digital assets). But, using closed cliques has drawbacks.</p>

<p>Two other models offer different utility:</p>

 
   Open Cliques allow for the modeling of more realistic social situations while simultaneously reducing compuational costs, but create new questions for theoretical understanding and in figuring how to maintain public and private keys for the clique. 
   Fuzzy Cliques open up the possibilities for authorizations, agreements, and other decisions to be made by portions of a group rather than the group as whole, but they depend on either FROST or some other (theoretical) threshold signature system, and they disallow the creation of a clique using relational edges. 
 

<p>In addition, cliques don’t have to be made up only of people:</p>

 
   Cliques of Devices show how cliques could also include AIs, oracles, fact checkers, hardware wallets, biometric rings, and other computerized programs, and that they could interact either as parts of cliques or as separate entities! 
 

<p>These possibilities are just the beginning. I think that edge identifiers and cliques could be a powerful new tool for expanding the design of identies online.</p>

<p>How could you use them? How would you expand them? What would you like to see next?</p>

 Appendix: FROST &amp; MuSig 

<p>There are currently two major Schnorr-based signature systems, FROST and MuSig2, both of which support Multi-Party Computation (MPC) signing.</p>

<p>FROST is a Schnorr-based multisig system that originated in a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">2020 paper</a>. As of 2024, it’s just coming into wide use thanks to projects such as <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/frost.html">ZF FROST</a> and wallets such as <a href="https://stackwallet.com/">Stack Wallet</a>.</p>
 
   🟢 Possible efficiency improvements for larger cliques. 
   🟢 Supports thresholds (m of n).
     
       🟢 Privacy for thresholds. 
       🛑 Limited accountability for thresholds. 
       🛑 Can’t build clique from edges if using thresholds. 
     
   
   🛑 More rounds for signing. 
   🟨 Allows Distributed Key Generation or Trusted Dealer Generation. 
 

<p>MuSig2 is a Schnorr-based multisig system that dates back to 2020 (when MuSig2 was introduced) and before that 2018 (when MuSig1 was introduced). It’s been well-studied and is detailed in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0328.mediawiki">BIP 328</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0390.mediawiki">BIP 390</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0373.mediawiki">BIP 373</a>, providing strong integration with Bitcoin, especially since its recent <a href="https://x.com/n1ckler/status/1843311745860849940">merge into libsecp256k1</a>.</p>
 
   🛑 No thresholds (n of n).
     
       🟨 But can mimic thresholds with Taproot trees 
     
   
   🟢 Full accountability for signatures. 
   🟢 Fewer rounds for signing. 
   🟢 Can always build clique from edges. 
 

<p>Two of the features of Schnorr-based signature systems that best support edge identifiers and cryptographic cliques are aggregation and MPC.</p>

 
   Aggregation. Schnorr signatures are aggregatable. They’re mathematically added together, producing a final multisig that’s the same size as an individual signature would be. As a result, signatures are indistiguishable: you don’t know how many people signed or who signed, simply that a signature is valid (or not). 
   MPC. Multi Party Computation means that each participant has a secret (here, a key share), which they can use together without revealing that secret. It’s what allows individuals to jointly create an edge-identifier key and then for edges to jointly create a clique key.

 Mike Leszcz, OpenID Foundation Operations Director 
<p>This was a hybrid event with some CMF and ecosystem members participating in person in Santiago. OIDF was very fortunate to have founding member and long-time board member, John Bradley with Yubico, representing OIDF in person. The goal of the workshop was to introduce OIDF and OpenID specifications with a focus on FAPI 2.0 to the ecosystem as Chile will require FAPI 2.0 when the Chilean Open Finance System goes live.</p>
<p></p>
 OIDF Standards Overview 
<p>Victor Andrade, Senior Analyst with the CMF, opened the workshop welcoming approximately 190 participants. Gail Hodges, OIDF Executive Director, kicked off the agenda with a brief introduction to OIDF including how the Foundation operates including with other ecosystems and then highlighted how to get involved.</p>
<p>Mark Haine, OIDF Technical Director, presented an overview of current OpenID specifications including recommendations for new vs. existing ecosystems. This introduced a deeper dive into <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-security-profile.html">FAPI 2.0</a>, delivered by Domingos Creado who represents OIDF certification team and is a valued FAPI Contributor. Domingos discussed key technical details from FAPI 2.0, including how it builds on <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0.html">FAPI 1.0</a> and is intended to be easier to implement. Domingos also confirmed that FAPI 2.0 is on track to be a Final Specification by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>At the request of the CMF, the workshop also included a high-level overview of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals Framework (SSF)</a> specification that improves API efficiency and security by providing privacy-protected, secure webhooks. It is in use by some of the largest cloud services to communicate security alerts and status changes of users, continuously and securely to prevent and mitigate security breaches. It is currently leveraged by two applications – the Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol (CAEP) and Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC) to achieve this result. Shared Signals WG co-chairs, Atul Tulshibagwale, CTO at SGNL, and Sean O’Dell, Senior Staff Security Engineer at Disney, provided this overview and addressed SSF questions.</p>
<p>Joseph Heenan, OIDF Specifications Specialist and Certification Director as well as a FAPI 2.0 Editor, provided an overview of the <a href="https://openid.net/how-to-certify-your-implementation/">OpenID Certification Program</a>. This included the value of certification including how ecosystems that mandate FAPI and FAPI certification are achieving high security within their ecosystems as well as enabling interoperability. He noted that FAPI 2.0 conformance tests and certifications are currently available with a number of OP and RP certifications from the <a href="https://connectid.com.au">ConnectID</a> private ecosystem in Australia. Joseph highlighted a number of other conformance test suites for other OpenID specifications are currently in development and will be made available for certifications once in production.</p>
 Ecosystem Engagement 
<p>The workshop then turned to ecosystem engagement, facilitated by OIDF Operations Director, Mike Leszcz. Mike spoke about the ecosystems that OIDF has partnered with in recommending or mandating FAPI adoption and FAPI certifications. He noted that OIDF is also supporting some ecosystems that are in the process of going live with their open finance/open data ecosystems.<br><br>This overview introduced the strong partnership that OIDF has had with <a href="https://openfinancebrasil.org.br">Open Finance Brazil</a> (OFB) the last several years as OFB mandates FAPI adoption and certifications with annual recertifications required. We were privileged to have Elcio Calefi, CIO at OFB and OIF board member present, “Technology in Finance – Innovation, Security and Inclusion”, highlighting OFB’s journey from including FAPI into the Brazilian open finance regulation and then operationalizing the mandate for FAPI adoption and certification.<br><br></p>
 Questions Answered 
<p></p>
<p>After a lunch break, OIDF presenters and workshop participants reconvened for a Q&amp;A session that addressed hot topic such as the lifecycle of the standards, the use of mTLS, the implementation of refresh tokens, the practical aspects of changing the scope of authorizations or grants, among others. Other topics during this session included:</p>
 
 Certification costs and OIDF’s recommendations regarding the implementation of certification processes. 
 Adaptations to the applicable profile(s) for Chile and OIDF’s position on possible deviations that a local implementation may have from the plain vanilla standard. 
 OIDF recommendations regarding the use of RAR / PAR, especially in replay attack threat scenarios. 
 Questions on DCR single profile. 
 Inclusion of data finality principles and their relationship to the FAPI standard. 
 Questions on how OIDF has approached to embedded finance for FAPI compliance, in particular where authorizations come from or are managed by third parties. 
 
<p>John Bradley, representing OIDF and an author on a number of the specifications being discussed, took the lead on many of the topics during the Q&amp;A session with support from the workshop presenters. The Q&amp;A session allowed additional time for the Chilean Open Finance System participants to dive deeper into the workshop topics.<br><br>OIDF thanks our colleagues at the CMF for their support and coordination of these two important events in support of the Chilean Open Finance System.<br><br>Links to the session recordings and workshop deck can be found on the OpenID Foundation’s <a href="https://openid.net/presentations-media/">Presentations and Media page</a>.</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance Working on Making Passkeys Portable Across Platforms:</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are an industry standard developed by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium, and were integrated into Apple’s ecosystem with iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, and macOS Ventura. They offer a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional passwords, allowing users to sign in to apps and websites in the same way they unlock their devices: With a fingerprint, a face scan, or a passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.</p>



<p>The draft specifications, called <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF)</a>, will standardize the secure transfer of credentials across different providers. This addresses a current limitation where passkeys are often tied to specific ecosystems or password managers.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is delighted to announce the formation of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ipsie/">Interoperability Profiling for Secure Identity in the Enterprise (IPSIE) Working Group</a>. This WG aims to tackle key challenges that underlie identity security in today’s enterprise environments.&nbsp;</p>
 The Core Challenge 
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) within the enterprise is a multifaceted endeavor, as indicated by the growing <a href="https://idpro.org/body-of-knowledge/">Body of Knowledge</a> maintained by <a href="https://idpro.org">IDPro</a>. There is a broad range of specifications that are relevant to securing the many IAM functions that underpin operations. Some of these are OIDF standards – like <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI</a>, and <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals</a> – while others are maintained in different standards bodies. For example, IPSIE has already identified the IETF’s <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/about/">OAuth 2.0</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scim/about/">System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM)</a> as relevant to their initial scope (below). But these specifications are written to support many contexts and use cases; they contain optionality that reduces the likelihood that independent implementations will interoperate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPSIE Working Group will develop secure-by-design profiles of these existing specifications with a primary goal of achieving interoperability across enterprise implementations.</p>

<p>J.R. Rao of IBM and Akila Srinivasan of Anthropic Elected to the OASIS Open Project's TSC Leadership</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 15 October 2024 – The <a href="https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/">Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI)</a>, an OASIS Open Project, announced the formation of its <a href="https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/TECHNICAL-STEERING-COMMITTEE.md">Technical Steering Committee (TSC)</a>, which is responsible for the overall technical health and direction of the project. The TSC will advise the Project Governing Board (PGB), oversee releases, and manage the efforts of the project’s three initial workstreams along with their respective chairs, contributors, and maintainers. The TSC will promote initiatives that align with CoSAI’s mission to promote secure-by-design AI systems.</p>



<p>J.R. Rao from IBM and Akila Srinivasan from Anthropic have been elected co-chairs of the TSC. They will play a central role in steering the direction of the workstreams to ensure that they contribute to the overall goals of CoSAI. J.R. and Akila bring a wealth of experience and leadership from their respective organizations and will be instrumental in driving CoSAI’s technical direction.</p>



<p>“Securing AI, openly and collaboratively, will be critical for inspiring trust and enabling its acceptance by consumers and enterprises alike. As TSC co-chair, I am committed to guiding CoSAI’s three workstreams to establish best practices and frameworks that enhance the security of AI systems,” said J.R. Rao, TSC co-chair, of IBM.</p>



<p>“As co-chair of the CoSAI TSC, I’m committed to developing frameworks and controls that help us attest to the trustworthiness and integrity of AI models,” said Akila Srinivasan of Anthropic. “By fostering transparency and control, we empower organizations to build secure and responsible AI systems that protect users and pave the way for a safe and innovative future.”</p>



<p>The TSC has launched <a href="https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/WORKSTREAMS.md">three workstreams</a> aimed at advancing the security of AI systems and will oversee their efforts to establish best practices, governance, and frameworks for AI security:</p>



 
 Software Supply Chain Security for AI Systems: <br>This workstream focuses on enhancing AI security by addressing the challenges of third-party model risks, provenance, and AI application security. It builds upon widely recognized security frameworks like the SSDF and SLSA, extending them for AI development. 
 



 
 Preparing Defenders for a Changing Cybersecurity Landscape: <br>Designed to equip defenders with a comprehensive framework, this workstream will focus on identifying necessary security investments to counter emerging AI-driven offensive capabilities. 
 



 
 AI Risk Governance: <br>This workstream will develop a comprehensive risk and controls taxonomy, checklist, and scorecard for assessing, managing, and monitoring the security of AI systems across industries.

 Gordian Envelope 

<p>Gordian Envelope, Blockchain Commons’ privacy-preserving data-interchange format for data at rest and (using GSTP) data on the wire, remains one of our top priorities. This quarter, we worked to make it more accessible and explored new cases for its usage.</p>

<p>Videos. We produced a trio of videos to offer an introduction to Gordian Envelope: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDI5ihfTB2Y">a teaser</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vcLCFKQvik">an overview</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFxStP3ATkw">a look at extensions</a>. They’re must-watch viewing if you’re interested in adopting a data-storage and data-interchange format that actually focuses on privacy.</p>

<p>Presentations at W3C TPAC (Technical Plenary and Advisory Committee): We’ve worked extensively on using Gordian Envelope to store digital assets such as seeds and SSKR shares. At <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/09/TPAC/">TPAC 2024</a> this year, we presented some new thoughts on using various Envelope and CBOR alternatives in the rechartered DID group, where Christopher is an Invited Expert. We also discussed using Gordian Envelope for some specific DID use cases, which we hope to explore more. There’s more in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/09/24-did-minutes.html#t04">the minutes</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s6tf0VOKdIr3Gf_t7ROypyeg07Lk_myoOFby6AL4I7g/edit#slide=id.g2f88dfb0fe1_53_0">the slides</a>.</p>

<p>dCBOR &amp; Unicode. Gordian Envelope is built on dCBOR, our deterministic CBOR profile. In Q3, we updated our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">dCBOR Internet-Draft</a> to v11. This was to incorporate Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC), to ensure that Unicode strings, used for all text in Gordian documents, will always be deterministic.</p>

 Seed Recovery 

<p>The safe storage and recovery of seeds has long been a focus at Blockchain Commons, because it’s the heart of <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a>. Our August 7th Gordian Developers Meeting focused on the topic and gave community members the ability to talk about their own efforts.</p>

 
   
    <p>BIP-85. Aneesh Karve presented on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/08-07/presentation-bip85.pdf">BIP-85</a>. This is a methodology for deriving many secrets from a single seed.</p>
   
   
    <p>SSKR for Ledger. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/08-07/presentation-bip85.pdf">SSKR</a> has been one of Blockchain Commons’ most successful releases because it allows developers to safely use Shamir’s Secret Sharing. Aido has incorporated SSKR into <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/08-07/presentation-lst.pdf">Ledger Seed Tool</a>, which now allows you to shard your Ledger secrets yourself (without depending on Ledger Recovery and Ledger’s privacy-busting KYC-compliant partners).</p>

<p>Our Gordian Developer community is one of our most important resources to ensure that we’re doing work that meets the needs of wallet developers. <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers">Sign up</a> for our Gordian Developer announcements to get the latest info on our upcoming meetings!</p>

 FROST 

<p>FROST is an up-and-coming multisig method that takes advantage of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Schnorr-based signatures</a> and Multi-Party Computations (MPCs) for key generation and signing. It’s an important new technology for creating keys that are more resilient and more secure. We’ve been supporting it for more than a year now.</p>

<p>FROST Implementers Meeting. Our second FROST Implementers Meeting occurred on September 18th. It gave people working on FROST specs, libraries, and cryptography the ability to talk about their most recent challenges. We’ve got a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting2/">full record</a> of the event, including videos, slides, summary, and transcript. It was great to bring the community together and plan for the future!</p>

<p>FROST in Gordian. We’ve been doing our own work with FROST! Our Rust and Swift Gordian stacks are switching to fully BIP-340 compliant Schnorr signatures. We’ve also been experimenting with FROST support, to allow the FROST signing method using the Trusted Dealer model. We’re waiting on an updated release of the secp256k1 Rust crate so that we can publish our own Rust crates and Envelope-CLI, but we hope to have our full reference implementation available within the month.</p>

<p>Stack Wallet. We did some light review of the <a href="https://stackwallet.com/">Stack Wallet</a> this quarter, which is the first wallet we know of that incorporates FROST. We’d love to see a security review of its FROST design, but from what we can see from usage, it not only implements FROST, but the ability to change thresholds on the fly, which is one of FROST’s rea2lly amazing capabilities.</p>

<p>We will have a FROST Developer’s Meeting on December 4th that will provide advice &amp; support for wallet developers who want to implement FROST. We’ve already scheduled Stack Wallet to give a presentation, since they’ve already done it!</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-13-projects-worldwide/">The Human Rights Foundation</a> for their support of our FROST work in 2024.</p>

 Reference Upgrades 

<p>Our reference apps and libraries suggest best-practices and offer examples on the uses of our specifications.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Gordian SeedTool for iOS 1.6.2. We released a minor update of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool for iOS</a> that makes our card entropy compatible with other sources, that allows the export of SSKR Envelopes in UR format, and that resolves a few other incompatibilities.</p>

<p>Swift 6 Stack Upgrade. We also upgraded our entire Swift stack to Swift 6. This allows us to take advantage of the Swift 6 concurrency model, remove unnecessary dependencies on forked libraries, and convert the tests of some modules to the new Swift Testing framework. This work can already be found in our Swift libraries, but we’re waiting to release a new Seedtool for iOS until we have other new features to deploy.</p>

<p>More Envelope Signatures in Rust. Fully BIP-340 compatible signatures are just one of our expansions to our Envelope Rust reference libraries. You can now also do Ed25519 signing (again, as soon as we’re able to release our new crates).</p>

 Developer Pages 

<p>Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/">Developer Pages</a> are intended to help wallet developers to use our specifications (and other important standards like FROST). If there’s anything you’d like to see that isn’t on the pages, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/issues">please let us know</a>. This quarter, we made some major updates.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Stack Organization. Our biggest upgrade was a reorganization of the website to focus on the technology stacks that we offer. We have a core stack (which is our fundamental techs like dCBOR and Envelope), a user experience stack (which makes it easier for users to transmit and view data), and a crypto stack (which does the heavy lifting of things like sharding seeds). This is how it all fits together!</p>

<p>New Envelope Pages. Last quarter, we did work on the Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol. This quarter, we incorporated that into our developer pages, with new content for <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/gstp/">GSTP</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/esc/">Encrypted State Continuation</a>, plus updates to our look at <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/csr/">Collaborative Seed Recovery</a></p>

 What’s Next? 

<p>Our most exciting work planned for Q4 my be our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">December 4th FROST Implementers Meeting</a>. If you are considering incorporating FROST into your own work, please be sure to sign up for our announcements-only <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers">Gordian Developers list</a> to receive notifications on the meeting.</p>

<p>Or, our most exciting Q4 work may be our new work on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-1/">cliques</a>, which we think is an innovative new way to look at identity. We’ve released the first article on the topic, with a few more to come.</p>

<p>We’ll generally be talking with members of the identity and credentials community in Q4, including a presentation at the W3C Credentials Community Group, planned for October 22nd.</p>

<p>We’re also looking to roll out our work on FROST and Ed25519 signing, which just requires the official deployment of an updated secp256k1 Rust crate.</p>

<p>There are more projects under consideration! We’re thinking about producing a “Gordian Companion” to offer a reference for storing SSKR shares. We’re looking into more grants, as funding continues to be poor for many of our partners. (You can help by becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor for us</a> at any level!) And of course we’re looking forward to 2025!</p>

<p>Background:</p>



<p>From the beginning, we have asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. We ask that you do so again this year. The power of that diversity continues to shine through in the new working groups this year, particularly as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti, equity, and inclusion in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Council has identified several areas where diversity, along with expertise in the digital identity space, could help us better serve the community. Nominations from organisations involved in kaupapa Māori, civil liberties, and the business and service sectors are particularly encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as their viewpoint is extremely valuable and relevant to the work we perform.

<p>“<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a>,” the secure authentication mechanism built to replace passwords, are getting more portable and easier for organizations to implement thanks to new initiatives the FIDO Alliance announced this month.</p>



<p>At the FIDO Alliance’s Authenticate Conference in Carlsbad, California, on Monday, October 14, researchers are announcing two projects that will make passkeys easier for organizations to offer—and easier for everyone to use. One is a new technical specification called <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP)</a> that will make passkeys portable between digital ecosystems, a feature that users have increasingly demanded. The other is a website, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/home">Passkey Central</a>, where developers and system administrators can find resources like metrics and implementation guides that make it easier to add support for passkeys on existing digital platforms.</p>



<p>“To me, both announcements are part of the broader story of the industry working together to stop our dependence on passwords,” Andrew Shikiar, CEO of the FIDO Alliance, told WIRED ahead of Monday’s announcements. “And when it comes to CXP, we have all these companies who are fierce competitors willing to collaborate on credential exchange.”</p>

<p>Every click, share, and like adds value to others. Every online interaction you make generates valuable data that fuels advertising, shapes consumer insights, and drives the growth of tech giants. Yet, despite being constant producers of digital capital, most of us are neither recognised nor compensated for our contributions. Your online activities are not trivial—they are digital assets with significant value. Content is king, and distribution is queen. Digital empowerment means controlling both. You are the creator; you must own and profit directly from the value you generate online. Let’s dive in.</p>
<p>Traditionally, human labor has been viewed as a liability—a cost to be minimised. As automation increasingly replaces routine jobs, many people will feel displaced. Companies, understandably, seek greater productivity to stay competitive, favoring machines that don’t require salaries or breaks. So, where do humans fit in the future? We must shift from seeing ourselves as physical liabilities to recognising that we are digital assets in the online world. To achieve this, we need to capture the value that is our birthright.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Silicon Valley would be nothing without your data. Machines lack the creativity, empathy, and originality that are inherently human—AI even trains on these traits, but where is the value back? Authenticity is your strength. Recognise your unique human value. You can thrive where machines cannot by turning your talents into digital assets. Technology is a tool that empowers you, while you remain the creator—shaping a digital future where your strengths and individuality truly thrive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Distribution, at its core, is the process of delivering goods from owners to consumers. Traditionally online, this has been facilitated by third-party servers and platforms that act as intermediaries between you and your audience. We connect to external servers because they provide the infrastructure and reach needed to share our content and thoughts widely. However, this reliance often comes with&nbsp;dependence, loss of control, and unfair revenue sharing, as these intermediaries may impose strict terms and conditions and dictate how and where your data is shared.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.ela.city/">Elacity</a>, built on the <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos SmartWeb</a>, offers a global marketplace for selling, leasing, and sharing content. Smart contracts—self-executing blockchain agreements—automate digital rights management, access control, and royalty payments. Content is encrypted using decentralized identities, with licensing terms embedded as tokenized rights for trading. Every time your content is sold, smart contracts enforce your terms, ensuring access for the buyer and immediate payments. Let automation work for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let’s imagine owning fractional rights to an AI model, where every subscription instantly pays you. Picture buying a song directly from your favourite artist or renting a movie through a global marketplace. Envision robotics-as-a-service: self-driving cars, 3D printing, healthcare support, and smart locks—all leased directly from owners, with instant access and payments for everyone involved. This is digital participation.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Shifting focus from smart contracts for rights management to data distribution. The encrypted data you own still needs to be stored and managed. Imagine building your own distribution hub—storing data locally while making it available globally, streaming directly from your home. You can create and control communities, with access, security, and payments enforced by smart contracts on your blockchain. This is 100% independent, decentralised distribution—where you own both the content and the distribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By hosting a NAS-like station at home, connected to the Elastos SmartWeb network, you can store, process, communicate, and stream your content globally as an independent “Channel” on a decentralised, interconnected network. Instead of relying on third-party cloud servers, you distribute your content directly from your own property, whether as an individual or an organisation. Blockchain technology ensures that access, decryption, and playback rights are validated first, guaranteeing ownership and security. Alternatively, you can monetise your resources by renting out available storage space and computational power to others, creating a service where everyone can support the network.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine millions of nodes cross-communicating, each owning their narratives, building authentic followers, and, for the first time, truly owning their digital selves. With Elacity on Elastos, smart contracts govern access and payments for your encrypted digital assets, creating a fully decentralised and automated system for security, privacy, and monetisation. This ensures that rights are honored and payments are fulfilled. Royalties are on autopilot, distributed instantly to all stakeholders across millions of smart contracts each time anyone globally interacts to purchase access rights for diverse assets and channels. This is the Elastos SmartWeb: a new internet layer—more open, secure, and user-centric.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Distribution hubs or “Channels” can be public, privately owned by groups, or managed individually. You have the freedom to collaborate with others to expand your reach. Whether you join community hubs with shared profits and collective decision-making or operate your own hub, you set the rules and create specialised environments. This approach fosters a sense of community and shared success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By offering decentralised rights management and distribution, Elastos allows you to focus on what you do best—creating. You can own, distribute, and trade your digital assets, directly influencing the broader economy. Elastos sets the stage for the future of distribution, while Elacity launches the SmartWeb party, turning your online presence into real value and empowering you to control your economic destiny.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We must advocate for fair and inclusive digital policies, setting a new standard for transparency, inclusivity, and opportunity in the digital economy. Everyone should benefit from their contributions and recognise the shifting landscape of automation. Elastos stands for pure integrity, while Elacity sets new standards for fairness, ensuring your voice matters in the evolving digital world. Own your rights. Control your distribution. Now is the time to transition from being undervalued to becoming an empowered digital asset owner, with the freedom to reach a global audience on your terms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Own. Distribute. Prosper. Join Elacity today. Embrace direct distribution, automate your rights management, and unlock your full potential in the digital economy. Take back control of your digital life. <a href="http://elastos.info">Explore Elastos</a> and <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> today, and become part of the movement to restore the internet to its rightful owners—you.

<p>The FIDO Alliance has published a working draft of a new set of specifications for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications/">secure credential exchange</a> that, when standardized and implemented by credential providers, will enable users to securely move passkeys and all other credentials across providers. The specifications are the result of commitment and collaboration amongst members of the FIDO Alliance’s Credential Provider Special Interest Group&nbsp; including representatives from: 1Password, Apple, Bitwarden, Dashlane, Enpass, Google, Microsoft, NordPass, Okta, Samsung and SK Telecom.</p>



<p>Secure credential exchange is a focus for the FIDO Alliance because it can help further accelerate passkey adoption and enhance user experience. Today, more than 12 billion online accounts can be accessed with passkeys and the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/statistics-sources/">benefits are clear</a>: sign-ins with passkeys reduce phishing and eliminate credential reuse while making sign-ins up to 75% faster, and 20% more successful than passwords or passwords plus a second factor like SMS OTP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this rising momentum, the FIDO Alliance is committed to enabling an open ecosystem, promoting user choice and reducing any technical barriers around passkeys. It is critical that users can choose the credential management platform they prefer, and switch credential providers securely and without burden. Until now, there has been no standard for the secure movement of credentials, and often the movement of passwords or other credentials has been done in the clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance’s draft specifications – <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications/">Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF)</a> – define a standard format for transferring credentials in a credential manager including passwords, passkeys and more to another provide in a manner that ensures transfer are not made in the clear and are secure by default.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once standardized, these specifications will be open and available for credential providers to implement so their users can have a secure and easy experience when and if they choose to change providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The working draft specifications are open to community review and feedback; they are not yet intended for implementation as the specifications may change. Those interested can read the working drafts <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications/">here</a>, and provide feedback on the Alliance’s <a href="https://github.com/fido-alliance/credential-exchange-feedback">GitHub repo</a>. Drafts are expected to be updated and published for public review often until the specifications are approved for implementation.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance extends a special thank you to its members in the Credential Provider Special Interest Group and its leads for driving and contributing to this important specification.</p>

<p>40 Speakers from Various Sectors Highlight Key Industry Trends</p>



<p>The Summit featured more than 40 speakers from sectors such as banking, government, telecom, enterprises, defense, eCommerce, solution vendors, online service providers, and manufacturers. Speakers represented leading organizations including Google, Lenovo, Samsung, ETDA Thailand, NTT Docomo, Mercari, Visa, SBI Bank, TikTok, iProov, Okta, TWCA, RSA, OneSpan, Thales, and VinCSS. One of the key themes of the 2024 Summit was the adoption of passkeys and the push towards achieving a passwordless experience across platforms. Here are some notable lessons shared:</p>



<p>Google: Demonstrated passkeys as the key to providing personalized experiences that users love. Cases from X, Amazon, Roblox, Kayak, WhatsApp, Zoho, and 1Password were shared. Roblox reported, “Passkeys are a significant security and usability upgrade for all of our users. In the six months since our launch, we have seen millions of users adopting passkeys to enjoy a simpler, faster, and more secure login experience.” Kayak noted a “50% reduction in average sign-in time with passkeys. With passkeys available on most devices, we’ve phased out traditional password logins and eliminated passwords from our servers.” 1Password highlighted that “in 2023, more than 1 million passkeys were created and saved by our users, and trial users who interact with passkey features are roughly 20% more likely to convert to paying customers.”</p>



<p>Samsung: Presented on passkeys on Galaxy mobile devices. Samsung launched the Passkey Provider Service at the end of 2023, providing a convenient user experience with the passkey as the default provider on Galaxy mobiles. Users can easily log in with fingerprint authentication and manage passkeys at a glance. Samsung ensures safe passkey synchronization across multiple devices logged into a Samsung account, including utilization with Samsung Knox Matrix. Statistics from the seven-month record of Samsung Passkey Provider include 7,672,861 cumulative registrations, 1,000,000 average new monthly registrations, and 850,000 average monthly authentications. Plans are in place to expand passkey usage for home appliance connectivity, such as TVs.</p>







<p>NTT Docomo: Highlighted the advantages of passkeys as an ideal authentication method—simple, frictionless user experience with biometric authentication, taking just 4-7 seconds compared to up to 30 seconds for SMS OTPs. They emphasized that passkeys are the only practical phishing-resistant authentication method.</p>



<p>Visa: Introduced Visa Payment Passkey for cardholder authentication in modern e-commerce. Traditional consumer authentication methods reduce fraud but often add friction, whereas biometric authentication with passkeys reduces both fraud and friction, leading to a 50% lower fraud rate.</p>



<p>TikTok: Reported success with passkeys, noting that over 100 million users registered within a year of implementation, with a 97% login success rate and a 17x faster login experience. There was also a 2% reduction in SMS OTP logins, as users who adopted passkeys chose them over other methods, improving app performance and reducing costs.</p>







<p>Workshops, Panel Discussions, and Networking Opportunities</p>



<p>This year’s Summit offered morning workshops on Passkeys and FDO (FIDO Device Onboard), allowing participants to delve deeper into implementing FIDO solutions. Attendees had the chance to work with FIDO experts to learn about integrating FIDO authentication into their services, understand technical specifications, and explore best practices. Experts also discussed the impact of emerging technologies like AI and post-quantum computing (PQC) on the authentication ecosystem while highlighting vulnerabilities related to human elements that can be addressed through implementing passkeys and FIDO’s efforts on future-proofing security.</p>



<p>Networking sessions, including a gala dinner, provided attendees a venue to relax and connect with peers from different parts of the world and sectors, fostering collaboration on developing solutions tailored to regional needs. Many participants enjoyed and respected the local culture while finding value in exchanging ideas and experiences about overcoming specific challenges in their respective sectors.</p>







<p>Celebrating Progress and Looking Forward</p>



<p>The FIDO APAC Summit 2024 showcased the significant progress towards convenient and secure FIDO-based passwordless authentication in the region.

While many schools recognize the potential of student internships in their Cybersecurity programs, they often struggle with the management and training required to integrate these students into their Security Teams. Building Student-Led SOCs in Higher Education led by Ed Wozencroft, Vice President for Digital Strategy, Chief Digital Officer, and CIO, NJIT, and Matt Clemmons, Managing Director, Splunk Services, TekStream, showcased how Louisiana State University (LSU) formalized its Student Led SOC program to create a framework that trains students to become productive members of a real-world Security Team alongside partner TekStream Solutions. Attendees saw how university-built partnerships with peer institutions and the State of Louisiana support cybersecurity initiatives and cultivate a skilled workforce in the state. The session also explored how this model is currently rolling out in New Jersey and ways institutions can participate.</p>
 Success with the Student Experience 
<p>Attendees of this breakout session received an up-close look at how Thomas Edison State University (TESU) moved from the original Ellucian Portal to the new myEdison Experience and how this new technology provides a single sign-on (SSO) approach to all student systems. August “Chip” Stoll, Senior Director, Enterprise Applications, and Christine Carter, Director of Graduate Admissions, Recruitment, and Enrollment Technology, from TESU talked about how they set up the system, some of their customized cards, their launch of Experience this past June, and their plans for governance as they roll it out to additional constituencies.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
	 
		                                            
		  
	  
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		 Modernize the Student Experience 
<p>Nishika Gupta, Assistant Vice President, IT, Bergen Community College, and Patricia Clay, Associate Vice President &amp; CIO, Hudson County Community College, led a dynamic discussion about improving on-campus processes so institutions can focus on student retention and engagement. They explored cutting-edge technologies, proven methodologies, and best practices tailored to the unique needs of today’s learners. Whether an institution is spearheading digital transformation efforts or seeking to stay ahead of the curve in higher education innovation, the session provided an opportunity to be part of a collaborative group who is helping shape the future of education.</p>
 Elevating the Institution’s Global Profile 
<p>In an increasingly competitive global educational landscape, institutions must leverage technology to enhance student support and engagement. The session, Elevating the Institution’s Global Profile Through Student Support Applications and OIT Support, led by Angela Sen, Developer/Analyst I, Software and Application Services, Office of Information Technology, Princeton University, highlighted the critical role of student support applications and the Office of Information Technology in advancing a university’s global profile. By adopting and optimizing these technologies, universities can enhance student satisfaction, academic performance, and institutional reputation on the global stage.</p>
 Innovation in Procurement 
<p>Dan Miller, AVP for EdgeMarket, introduced attendees to the EdgeMarket Higher Education Ecosystem RFP and how this solution is changing the game for higher education procurement. He shared how this strategic approach is designed to simplify the procurement process, foster collaboration between members and solution providers, and drive better outcomes for institutions. The session introduced the Business Capability Model and the Business Outcomes Framework and how they can connect solution investments to tangible business results and align solution portfolios with the operational needs of higher education institutions. Miller shared that by leveraging these powerful tools, institutions can access a streamlined procurement pathway that empowers them to make more informed and effective system selections.</p>

<p>Since the mid-1990s, I’ve been advocating for the creation of secure digital infrastructures that protect human rights, civil liberties, and human dignity online. My mission has always been to decentralize power and give individuals control over their digital lives, from my early work co-authoring the TLS standard to my recent efforts supporting DIDs and Verifiable Credentials.</p>

<p>We now stand at another crossroads in digital identity. The current paradigm, where an individual’s private key is the cornerstone of their identity, has served us well but it also has significant limitations—especially as we move toward a more interconnected, collaborative digital world. Fortunately, advances in cryptography allow us to rethink single-key self-sovereign identity systems, suggesting the possibility for new options such as edge identifiers and cryptographic cliques.</p>

 The Single Signature Paradigm 

<p>Identity management has long  centered on the use of single-signature cryptographic keys. Operating on a straightforward principle, this “Single Signature Paradigm” requires the possession of a unique private key for cryptographic signatures, allowing actions such as authentication, data encryption, and transaction validation.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>The security of this model hinges on the confidentiality of the private key: a compromise  of the key means a compromise of security. To reduce this threat, standards often require private keys be stored in specialized hardware, providing a fortified environment. This model is the cornerstone of security strategies endorsed and required by entities such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), European Union government standards, and various international standards groups such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>

<p>There has been very limited success in strengthening this fundamental methodology through protocols such as key rotation. Meanwhile, the Single Signature Paradigm has many flaws, the most serious of which are Single Point of Compromise (where a key can be stolen) or Single Point of Failure (where a key can be lost). If anything, these problems are worsening, as demonstrated by recent side-channel attacks that can extract keys from older hardware. Other issues include scalability limitations, hardware dependency, operational inflexibility, and numerous legal, compliance, and regulatory issues.</p>

<p>There are fundamental limits to what can be achieved within the confines of a Single Signature Paradigm, making the need for evolution  clear.</p>

 The Keys to Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The Single Signature Paradigm is problematic for many use cases surrounding digital assets, but particularly so for the management of digital identities, because identities are both central to our digital experience and largely irreplaceable. You can’t just create a new identity to replace a compromised one without losing credentials and connections alike.</p>

<p>When I first conceived of my ideas for the personal control of digital identity, known today as self-sovereign identity, I didn’t want to be limited by the Single Signature Paradigm. Instead, I modeled self-sovereign identity to be an identity that existed in a social context, not an isolated identity defined by singular keys. I wrote some on this in <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the key principles of living systems theory is the concept of the membrane. This is not just a physical barrier but a selective boundary that controls the exchange of energy, matter, and information between the system and its environment. The membrane allows certain things to pass through while restricting others, thereby maintaining the system’s integrity and autonomy. It’s a delicate balancing act: the system must allow enough interaction with the environment to sustain itself while ensuring that it isn’t overwhelmed by external forces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though I meant for it to be something that would protect the individual, self-sovereignty doesn’t mean that you are in complete control. It simply defines the borders within which you can make decisions and outside of which you negotiate with others as peers, not as a petitioner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implementing practical solutions that encapsulate this interconnectedness has historically been challenging due to the dominance of the Single Signature Paradigm. This has led to self-sovereign identity systems that actually adhere to the Single Signature Paradigm, which in turn causes the to overemphasize individualism, which was not my intent.</p>

<p>It’s not the only way.</p>

 Relational Edge Identity 

<p>Living systems theory suggests that identity isn’t just about oneself, but about one’s connections to the rest of society.</p>

<p>Consider the process of a child’s identity formation. They may be named “Joshua” upon birth, suggesting a unique, nodal form of identity. But, there are many Joshuas in the world. To truly define the child’s identity requires <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/linked-local-names.md">linked local names</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/petnames.md">pet names</a>) that define relationships. The father and mother say “my child”, attesting to the relationship between each of them and the child. A sibling says, “My brother’s child” and a grandparent says “my grandchild”.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>Though unidirectional descriptors are useful to help identify someone, each link is actually bidirectional, creating an edge between two individual nodes of identity:</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>At this point we must ask: does the node really define identity or is it the edges? The most complete answer is probably that an identity is defined by an aggregation of edges sufficient to identify within the current graph context: “Joshua, who is filially linked with Mary, who is filially linked with Anna.”</p>

 Relational Edge Keys 

<p>We can model the interconnectedness of edge-based relationships in an identity system by using <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Schnorr-based</a> aggregatable multisig systems that support Multi-Party Computing (MPC), such as MuSig2 or FROST (see the Appendix in the next article for more on the technology and the differences between the two systems). Schnorr-based systems are an excellent match for edge identity because their peer-based key construction technique matches the peer-based model of an identity graph: two users come together to create a joint private key.</p>

<p>To create a relational edge key, the two identities (nodes) connected by an edge each generate a private commitment. These commitments are combined in a cryptographic ceremony to form the edge’s private key. The associated public key then effectively becomes an identifier for this two-person group, indiscernible from a single user’s public key thanks to Schnorr.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>Leveraging the Multi-Party Computation (MPC) of MuSig2 or FROST allows for the creation of a private key that doesn’t exist on a single device. It exists only in a distributed cryptographic construct, colloquially called a “fog”. Through unanimous consent, users can use this “fog” to sign collectively, allowing (even requiring) joint agreement for joint actions.</p>

<p>This relational-edge identity model begins to resolve the issues with current self-sovereign identity models by recognizing identity as being about more than just a single self-sovereign person. It also offers substantial benefits including better security, trust, resilience, and verification due to full keys existing only in this distributed cryptographic “fog”. Finally, it allows relationships to dynamically grow and change over time through the addition or removal of edges in a graph.</p>

 Clique Identity 

<p>Edge identity is just the first step in creating a new model for identity that recognizes tthat personal digital identity is founded in relationships. The next step is to expand pairwise relationships by forming a clique, specifically a triadic clique.</p>

<p>A clique in graph theory is “a fully connected subgraph where every node is adjacent to every other node.” Thus, in a complete graph, no node remains isolated; each is an integral part of an interconnected network. This concept is core to understanding the transition from simple pairwise relationships to more complex, interconnected group dynamics.</p>

<p>In our example, there is an obvious triadic clique: the nuclear family of Mary, Bob, and Joshua.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>Remember that the term “nuclear family” comes from the word “nucleus”.That’s a great metaphor for a tight, strongly connected group <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/dyads-triads-the-smallest-teams/">of this type</a>. A triadic clique fosters strong social cohesion and supports a  robust, tightly-knit network.</p>

<p>Cryptographically, we form a triadic clique by generating a relational edge key for each pair of participants in the group. This represents the pair’s joint decision-making capability. Once these pairwise connections are in place, the trio of edges participates in a cryptographic ceremony to create a shared private key for the whole group, which in turn creates a clique identifier: the public key. This identifier represents not just an individual or a pair but the collective identity of the entire triadic group (and, once more, their decision-making capability).</p>

<p>Although my examples so far suggest that nodes in a clique are all people, that doesn’t have to be the case: I’ll talk about cliques of devices as one of three variations of this basic formula in my next article.</p>

 Why Cliques of Edges? 

<p>As noted, a clique is formed by the pairwise edges jointly creating a key, not by the original participants doing so. There are a number of advantages to this.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it builds on the concept of identity being formed by relationships. Call it the Relationship Signature Paradigm (or the Edge Signature Paradigm). We’re saying that a group is defined not by the individuals, but by the relationships between the individuals. This is a powerful new concept that has applicability at all levels of identity work.</p>

<p>Individually, we might use the Relationship Signature Paradigm to create an individual identity based on edge-based relationships. My relationship to my friends, my relationship to my company, my relationship to my coworkers, my verifiable credentials (which are themselves relationships between myself and other entities), and my relationship to my published works together define the “clique” that is me. Crucially, this identity is built upon the relationship with other participants, not the participants themselves.</p>

<p>At a higher-level, we can also use this paradigm to form a clique of cliques, where each member is not a participant or even an edge, but instead a clique itself! Because we already recognized cliques as being formed by relational groups when we defined a first-order clique as a collection of edges, we can similarly define a clique as a collection of cliques (or even a collection of edges and cliques), creating a fully recursive paradigm for identity.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>There is one clique-based design where the Relationship Signature Paradigm can’t be used: fuzzy cliques, which is another variation of clique identity. But more on that in the next article.</p>

 Higher Order Graphs 

<p>There is no reason to limit cryptographic cliques to three edges.&nbsp;However, the larger the group is, the harder it is to close the graph: as the number of nodes (n) in a clique increases, the number of edges grows following the formula <code>(n*n-1)/2</code>, which is the number of unique edges possible between <code>n</code> nodes.</p>

<p>A “4-Clique” (or K4), for example, is a complete graph comprising 4 nodes, where each node is interconnected with every other node, resulting in a total of <code>(4*3)/2 = 6</code> edges.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>This pattern continues with larger cliques:</p>
 
   K5 = <code>(5*4)/2 = 10</code> edges; 
   K6 = <code>(6*5)/2 = 15</code> edges; 
   K7 = <code>(7*6)/2 = 21</code> edges; etc. 
 

<p>In practice, as the number of nodes in a clique increases, the complexity of forming and maintaining these fully connected networks also escalates: each additional connection requires its own key-creation ceremony with every existing member of the graph.</p>

<p>Complete graphs, or closed cliques, have valuable applications across various disciplines, from computer science to anthropology, but they aren’t the only solution for cryptographic cliques. I’ll talk more about the alternative of open cliques as another variation of the clique identity model in my follow-up article next week.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The Single Signature Paradigm has been at the heart of the digital world since the start. It’s always had its limitations, but those limitations are growing even more problematic with the rise of digital identity.</p>

<p>Relational edge keys and closed cliques offer a next step, modeling how identity is actually based on relationships and that many social decisions are made through the edges defined by those relationships.</p>

<p>Other advantages of using clique-based keys and identities include:</p>

 
   Decentralized Identity Management. Peer-based edge and clique identifiers are created collaboratively, bypassing third-party involvement, thus supporting self-sovereign control and improving anonymity. 
   Identity Validation. Peer-based identifiers help to authenticate social identities, creating trust. 
   Resilience Against Single Points of Failure: Distributing control among multiple parties in a clique guards against single points of failure. 
   Secure Group Decision Making. Relations or groups can securely and irrevocably made decisions together. 
   Enhanced Privacy in Group Interactions. Aggregatable Schnorr-based signatures keep the identities of the members of a relationship or a clique private. 
 

<p>Cliques can be quite useful for a number of specific fields:</p>

 
   Blockchains. The use of aggregatable signatures creates smaller transactions on blockchains. 
   Collaborative Projects. Collaborative projects and joint ventures can use clique keys to authenticate shared resource usage and other decisions. 
   Financial Fields. Dual-key control is often required in financial fields, and that’s an implicit element of relational edge keys. 
   Internet of Things (IoT) &amp; Other Smart Networks. Relational edge keys can ensure secure and efficient communication among diverse devices that have paired together. 
   Medicine &amp; Other Sensitive Data. When data is sensitive, cliques can ensure all parties have agreed to the data sharing terms, maintaining both security and collaboration integrity. 
 

<p>By leveraging cryptographic cliques for group identification and decision-making, we open a wide array of opportunities. These are just the beginning: open cliques, fuzzy cliques, and cliques of devices can offer even more opportunities, as I discuss in my next article in this series (which also talks a little bit about the cryptography behind this).</p>

<p>CAP Standard Has Transformed Emergency Communication and Continues to Save Lives </p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 7 October 2024 – This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) being established as an OASIS Open Standard. CAP, part of the EDXL suite of standards, provides an open, non-proprietary message format for delivering all-hazard alerts and notifications. Over the past two decades, CAP has become a model of global collaboration and a fundamental component of emergency communications systems worldwide. Its use across multiple platforms has helped save countless lives through timely, reliable messaging. Today, 87% of the world’s population lives in a country with at least <a href="https://alert-hub.s3.amazonaws.com/cap-sources.html">one national-level CAP news feed</a> for emergency notifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CAP enables a consistent message to be disseminated simultaneously over a variety of communication pathways, including radio, television, mobile phones, emails, and other media. This all-hazards, all-media format ensures that critical alerts (e.g., weather events, earthquakes, tsunami, volcanoes, public health crises, power outages, fires, child abductions, and more) reach the public swiftly and efficiently, regardless of the medium.</p>



<p>“As we celebrate 20 years of CAP, I’m incredibly proud that it has become the backbone of emergency communication worldwide, recognized by the UN as the standard for the Early Warnings for All program. The success of CAP is a testament to the dedication and collaboration of so many over the years, and I extend my sincere thanks to everyone who has played a part in making it the global standard it is today,” said Elysa Jones, chair of the <a href="https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=aca4a7b8-5c48-48f0-b87c-018dc7d3efaa">OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee</a> (EMTC). “CAP’s ability to deliver consistent, interoperable alerts through multiple channels has made it indispensable for disaster management. We’ll continue to evolve CAP to ensure it serves communities in need.”</p>



<p>The CAP community will commemorate this significant anniversary milestone at the <a href="https://cap-workshop.alert-hub.org/2024/index.html">CAP Implementation Workshop</a> from 22-24 October in Leuven, Belgium. OASIS is a co-sponsor of the event, which will focus on the use of CAP and its consistent use throughout the world. OASIS and the EMTC will continue to work with nations and organizations to explore future advancements in global emergency alerting.</p>



<p>The fundamental need for CAP was identified by the Partnership for Public Warning (PPW) in response to the 9/11 attacks when there was no consistent method for informing the nation. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami highlighted the urgent need for improved emergency alert communication across the globe. With the support of Eliot Christian, longtime CAP advocate and former chief architect of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Information System (WIS), and Elysa Jones, chair of the OASIS EMTC, along with EMTC members, CAP was officially adopted by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 2007 as ITU-T Recommendation X.1303. Since then, many international organizations like the WMO, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) have embraced CAP as an essential standard for emergency alerting. In 2021, the Call to Action on Emergency Alerting set a goal to achieve 100% CAP implementation by 2025, an initiative that has since been integrated into the UN’s Early Warnings for All initiative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OASIS and its partners are committed to increasing global CAP adoption. Participation in the EM TC is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OASIS-OPEN-MEMBERSHIP-AGREEMENT_2024_TC.pdf">membership in OASIS</a>, with interested parties encouraged to join and contribute to shaping the future of alerting.

  <p>The Global Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) Summit in Cairo was the world's first summit dedicated to DPI. Bringing together a diverse ecosystem of experts. The summit featured insightful keynotes, engaging discussions, and practical focus panels where participants shared real-world DPI implementation experiences. Success stories spanned across national digital identity, payments, government services, and data exchange initiatives. However, discussions highlighted challenges, particularly in cross-governance data exchange and the interoperability layer, signaling a need for improved solutions to ensure a seamless DPI ecosystem across sectors and borders.</p><p>At the summit, discussions emphasized the need to start thinking about implementation of DPI, beyond service oriented use cases such as finance, public services, and governance. These sectors have benefited from DPI adoption, but as noted during the summit, there remains much work to do in improving its application across industries.</p><p>One of the key discussions revolved around the evolution of DPI. First iteration of DPI&nbsp; provided the initial frameworks for public digital infrastructure, focusing on secure and efficient digital services. However, the future version promises to shift the focus towards interoperability, with a higher emphasis on connecting different systems and ensuring they work together seamlessly. This is a critical development as governments and organizations look to build more integrated, accessible, and collaborative infrastructures. This trend is welcomed by HCF as it goes in the direction the Foundation has been promoting since its creation in 2020, a total interoperability within and across ecosystems.</p><p>Data exchange was a recurring theme during the event.In particular, the necessity of cross&nbsp; borders governance frameworks was raised and discussed. While there has been much progress within individual countries or regions, many experts admitted that the global community still lacks a clear pathway to enable effective cross-governance data exchange. The complexities of regulatory frameworks, governance structures, and varying legal standards pose significant challenges. At present, there seems to be no clear consensus on how to tackle this issue, highlighting the urgent need for collaborative innovation. HCF witness these complexities in the projects we are involved (see <a href="https://humancolossus.squarespace.com/config/pages/5eaecb2534916624d94cccf4/content">Governance Periscope blog post</a> of Sep.16). There is not one single digital governance framework that will capture the world’s diversity.&nbsp;</p>





















  
  














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                

            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>HCF was pleased to see a strong emphasis on inclusion and the need for vendor-agnostic solutions, ensuring that digital public infrastructure is accessible to all, regardless of geography or socio-economic status. This aligns with HCF’s mission of building decentralized, scalable infrastructure that works for everyone, not just for those in advanced economies or within specific vendor ecosystems.</p><p>HCF’s vision for a digital infrastructure that scales horizontally was widely accepted at the summit. The need for a common infrastructure that can be applied across various industries and sectors was highlighted as critical for the next phase of DPI development. This closely aligns with HCF's work, which focuses on enabling cross-sector digital infrastructure that is decentralized, scalable, and interoperable.</p><p>The first DPI summit was a great success, setting the stage for the continued development of global digital public infrastructures. The next DPI Summit is scheduled for November 4-6, 2025, and it promises to build on the momentum from Cairo, with even more insights and innovations expected to emerge.&nbsp;</p><p>HCF is excited to continue contributing to these important discussions, helping shape the global DPI ecosystem and ensuring that it meets the needs of people across all sectors and regions.</p><p>In conclusion, the Global DPI Summit in Cairo highlighted the critical role DPI will play in shaping the future digital economy, and HCF’s work in decentralized infrastructure aligns perfectly with this vision. We look forward to further collaborations and innovations in the years to come.</p>

<p>The internet isn’t dying. It’s already dead, taken over by bots and AI. Let’s bring it back to life for real people. The internet in the early days was a boundless frontier teeming with human connection, creativity, and unfiltered authenticity. It was a place where communities blossomed around shared interests, where originality thrived, and every voice could find an audience.</p>
<p>Today, that vibrant space is less than 50% of the internet. We’ve drifted into an era where bots outnumber real users, corporate algorithms dictate our experiences, and genuine human interaction is suffocated under increasing layers of automation. The essence of the internet—that which made it a rebellious tool for unity and expression—is fading away.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The transformation didn’t happen overnight. Slowly but surely, the internet morphed into a sterile version of itself—a curated environment dominated by corporate interests and government oversight. The organic growth of communities gave way to controlled ecosystems where user engagement is meticulously engineered. Social media platforms, once the epicenters of human interaction, have become echo chambers filled with recycled content, inflammatory bias, and automated posts.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that bots and automated accounts now constitute <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/security/press_release/bots-now-make-nearly-half-all-internet-traffic-globally">49.6%&nbsp;of overall web traffic</a>, and 65% of these bots are malicious.&nbsp; On platforms like Twitter, it’s estimated that bots make up around 15% of all accounts. These automated participants flood timelines with repetitive messages, manipulate trending topics, and distort public discourse. They create a dense fog that obscures the line between genuine human expression and automated noise. The fakery is gross and superficial.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The corporate control of the internet extends beyond social media. Search engines, content platforms, and even news outlets are influenced by algorithms designed to maximize profit and personal agendas, often at the expense of user experience. Personalized ads follow us relentlessly, and content is filtered through the lens of what will keep us clicking, not what informs or enriches us. This has led to a fundamental erosion of trust.</p>
<p>Users are either hypnotized or increasingly skeptical of the content they consume, unsure whether it’s genuine or manipulated. Fake news proliferates, and the ability to engage in open, honest dialogue diminishes. The internet, once a tool for enlightenment, has become a battlefield of misinformation. However, the core purpose of blockchain technology is to reinstate trust, and new layers are forming.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastos-decentralised-internet-bitcoin-secured/">Elastos is a decentralized internet</a> designed to restore digital sovereignty to individuals. Unlike the current internet, which relies on centralized servers, Elastos uses blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks to let users own their data and digital identities.</p>
<p>With Elastos, you have a digital shield protecting your online activities. Holding your own “freedom key”, you control your privacy and security in a new safe zone. Your data isn’t stored on corporate servers; it’s securely encrypted and accessible only by you and who you let in, verified using blockchain technology. This marks a significant shift in how we interact with the digital world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elastos creates a new digital commons—a decentralized platform where communities form organically without centralized gatekeepers. Developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) that operate securely and privately. Content creators can share work directly with audiences, free from algorithmic suppression or monetization schemes favouring platforms over individuals.</p>
<p>By decentralizing the internet’s infrastructure, Elastos frees users from the monopolistic grip of large tech companies. Users become active participants in a network valuing privacy, security, and autonomy. This change reclaims the internet as a safe space for genuine human connection and empowerment—a true rebirth of the authentic Internet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Building on Elastos’ decentralized infrastructure, <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> provides access control systems which allow owners, creators and communities to <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elacity-smartweb-decentralised-drm-runtime/">regain control over their digital environments.</a> This platform fosters a rebirth of authenticity for direct interaction directly, securely, and profitably with audiences.</p>
<p>Elacity is more than a marketplace; it’s a blockchain-governed platform where everyones’ rights are safeguarded using tokenized rights in decentralized wallets, and where genuine engagement is rewarded. In its upcoming v2 release, anyone can create an Elacity channel—a special economic environment for communication. This marks a platform for a creative explosion!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users can be independent, set up business models like “Buy Now” or “Subscribe” to their property, or establish token-gated access—for example, “hold 28 ELA to enter.” Users gain access only if they meet owners’ specific terms enforced through smart contracts, bringing privacy and trust back online. This mechanism also produces a blockchain-powered AI bot filter for this new internet layer.</p>
<p>Central to Elacity is non-custodial ownership. Creators retain full control over their digital assets, free to license, sell, or share without handing over ownership to intermediaries. Elacity functions as a world computer marketplace, a new economy for creativity powered by blockchain technology and smart contracts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elacity’s decentralized Digital Rights Management (dDRM) system lets you set terms for how your content is used and monetized. Transactions are secure, immediate, and transparent, eliminating delays typical of traditional platforms. This new era of creative empowerment extends beyond individual creators to community builders and social environments.</p>
<p>By removing intermediaries and implementing transparent systems, Elacity lays the foundation for a digital renaissance—an internet where creativity thrives and authenticity is celebrated, all whilst bots and corporate control is denied!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The internet is at a crossroads. We can either continue down a path of automation, corporate control, and detachment, or we can forge a new way forward—one in which individuals reclaim their digital sovereignty, creators flourish without intermediaries, and communities thrive through real, meaningful connections.</p>
<p>Take back control of your digital life. <a href="http://elastos.info">Explore Elastos</a> and <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> today, and become part of the movement to restore the internet to its rightful owners—you.

		<p>As a vital part of the higher education ecosystem, community colleges play a key role in responding to the economic, demographic, technological, social, and environmental shifts impacting New Jersey. To discuss these current challenges and the strategies for helping transform education to better support student success, the New Jersey Council of County Colleges (NJCCC) held their inaugural Opportunity Summit on June 11-13, 2024 in Atlantic City. Along with community college leaders, faculty, and staff, the Summit welcomed partners from high schools, college, universities, unions, community-based organizations, state and local government, and the public workforce system.</p>
<p>The three-day event focused on NJCCC’s Opportunity Agenda which is centered around equity, collaboration, opportunity, and innovation. “We’re in a time of rapid change and our colleges are working diligently to respond to these changes and keep on the cutting edge of helping more students earn degrees and credentials that will help them lead quality lives,” says Aaron R. Fichtner, Ph.D., President, New Jersey Council of County Colleges. “We felt it was important to bring colleges together to share insights and information, while also hearing from national thought leaders about the challenges many of us are confronting in higher education.”</p>
<p>Expanding Education and Workforce Partnerships<br>
The first day of the Opportunity Summit focused on the Opportunity Agenda where state and national experts shared unique insights into navigating the evolving world of education. The second day was the NJ Pathways to Career Opportunities Summit and discussed ways to expand innovative education and workforce partnerships. In partnership with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the NJ Pathways to Career Opportunity Initiative has joined together government, industry, union, and education partners to build stackable education and training opportunities.</p>
<p>The third day highlighted the Community to Opportunity Initiative which provides holistic support to community college students and addresses food insecurity, childcare issues, and mental health and wellness. “This event was uniquely structured and offered the opportunity to attend one or two days or all three,” says Maria Heidkamp, Chief Innovation and Policy Officer, New Jersey Council of County Colleges. “We had five hundred attendees in total and many colleges had teams of five or six people representing different areas, including leadership, academic affairs, student services, data services, and workforce development. We heard through feedback that they appreciated being able to come to one conference together and participate as a team.”</p>

		<p>Building Pathways to Equity and Economic Prosperity<br>
New Jersey’s community colleges continue to help a diverse group of students achieve their academic goals and have worked within their organization and collectively with other institutions to expand instruction, build partnerships with high schools, four-year colleges and universities, nonprofits, and businesses; and improve student outcomes. To meet this core mission and effectively address equity challenges, community colleges within the state have committed to following four action pillars outlined in the Opportunity Agenda. Dr. Fichtner explored these pillars with Summit attendees and how these collective priorities can help promote equitable academic, social, and economic mobility for the greater community:</p>
<p>Pillar 1: Helping all high school students access pathways to postsecondary and career success. Strategies include ensuring all high school students have the opportunity to earn at least six college credits while in high school and understand their options for further education and a career.</p>
<p>Pillar 2: Fostering student success and completion in postsecondary education and training. To achieve this mission, there is a commitment to make community college tuition-free through an expansion of the Community College Opportunity Grant (CCOG) program. There is also a drive to invest in a statewide student success initiative targeting low-income and underrepresented students, student parents, justice-impacted students, students with disabilities, veterans, and others.</p>
<p>Pillar 3: Building transparent, seamless, and stackable pathways that respond to the changing economy. In collaboration with four-year institutions, state leaders, and technologists, New Jersey community colleges aim to revitalize general education and address the implications of AI for students, staff, and faculty. Strategies also include ensuring all students can complete paid internship work experience, embedding workforce credentials in community college programs, and building statewide and regional pathways connecting students to credentials, degrees, and lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Pillar 4: Helping adults attain the credentials they need for career mobility and labor market success. To achieve this goal, strategies include funding noncredit programs for low-income students and developing a consistent, statewide approach to Credit for Prior Learning (CPL)/Prior Learning Assessment (PLA).</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
	 
		                                
		  
	  
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“The Opportunity Agenda was released publicly in March, and we were able to do a larger public rollout at the Summit,” says Fichtner. “To get the buy-in and support of all eighteen community colleges in New Jersey, it took several months of discussion around which pillars to select,” adds Heidkamp. “We reached a consensus around these action pillars and the strategies that support them. The community recognizes that technology is advancing and what that means for the workforce. Colleges are also identifying that there are large equity gaps. The point of the Agenda is to build upon the current momentum happening within community colleges around holistic student support and workforce development and determine how we can capitalize on what is already underway to shape our focus going forward.”</p>
<p>Fichtner adds, “We’re making a series of bold efforts to help our eighteen community colleges continue to make strides in equity, access, and success. Each pillar iIs part of a broader strategy and we want to empower institutions as they innovate and evolve to meet the rapidly-changing world that we live in.”</p>
<p>In addition to sharing details of the Opportunity Agenda, day one of the Summit included the session, Amid AI Revolution: Opportunities for Community College Innovation, presented by Dave Cole, Chief Innovation Officer, State of New Jersey, and Developing Community College AI Programs: Lessons from an AI Pioneer on Equity, Academics, Industry Partnerships, and Degrees, presented by Dr. Madeline Burillo-Hopkins, Vice Chancellor Workforce Instruction and President Southwest College, Houston Community College.</p>
<p>Expanding Innovative Education and Workforce Partnerships<br>
The second day kicked off with a breakout session, Reckoning with Relevance: 2024 State of the Sector, led by Dr. Tara Zirkel, Director, Strategic Research, EAB, followed by The Success of the New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities Initiative, presented by Dr. Michael McDonough, President, Raritan Valley Community College, and Catherine Starghill, Esq., Vice President, New Jersey Council of County Colleges and Executive Director, New Jersey Community College Consortium for Workforce and Economic Development. “Day one invited nationally known speakers who spoke on very timely and important topics,” says Heidkamp. “Day two was a mix of national speakers and presenters who highlighted some of the workforce projects going on at our colleges.”</p>
<p>Additional sessions included Education Pathways and The Future of Work presented by Charlotte Cahill, Associate Vice President, Education, Jobs for the Future, and Industry and Pathways: The Intersection of Education and Workforce Development, led by Amanda Winters, Program Director, Post-Secondary Education, National Governors Association; Keith Witham, Vice President of Education Philanthropy, Ascendium Education; and Paul Fain (Moderator), Journalist, Work Shift and The Job, and The Cusp Podcast. The afternoon session, New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities: Centers of Workforce Innovation Highlights, included representation from a variety of industries, including aseptic processing and biomanufacturing, film and television production, esports production, and robotics and automation.</p>

<p>Holistic Student Supports<br>
Day three of the Opportunity Summit explored a variety of topics, including enhancing institutional access through online learning, transforming the local workforce ecosystem, and flexible work arrangements. Attendees could also learn more about AI in teaching, integrating grant offices into finance and procurement, and SNAP employment and training. “After sending out a request for presentations, we added sessions to the Summit agenda by a selection committee,” explains Linda Scherr, Chief Academic Officer, New Jersey Council of County Colleges. “Along with invited keynotes and plenary sessions, we wanted to give faculty and staff within the community an opportunity to share best practices and insights with their peers. It was a great blend of topics and presenters and led to unique collaborations that may not have been previously possible.”</p>
<p>Heidkamp adds, “Along with giving us an opportunity to officially kick off the Opportunity Agenda, this event allowed us to connect with several organizations we hope to partner with moving forward. Many are social justice groups, like the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice and the United Way. We also had business groups, like the Statewide Hispanic Chamber, the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, and the Council on Humanities. These are all partners that are reflected in the four pillars and we look forward to joining forces and creating a stakeholder group who can help move the needle in a positive direction.”</p>

		<p>Memorable Event Highlights<br>
Throughout the Summit and the Holistic Student Supports Convening, national and state thought leaders shared their perspectives on key issues facing higher education and how all organizations can work together to ensure students and workers are prepared to thrive in an innovative economy. “There were so many great moments throughout the three-day event,” reflects Fichtner. “I really enjoyed Dr. Chauncy Lennon’s presentation, Pathways: Equity and Access to High Quality Industry Credentials and Associate Degrees. He did an excellent job framing where we are in higher education and our society and what actions we will need to take going forward.”</p>
<p>“The lunch panel, Serving New Jersey’s Justice-Impacted Individuals, discussed the work that our colleges are doing to serve justice-impacted students,” continues Fichtner. “Governor McGreevy was a part of this session and the presentation had many great speakers and inspiring moments. It highlighted three amazing programs that are helping individuals who are either in prison or are on probation and giving them opportunities to succeed.”</p>
<p>The session, Developing Community College AI Programs: Lessons from an AI Pioneer on Equity, Academics, Industry Partnerships, and Degrees, led by Dr. Madeline Burillo-Hopkins, Vice Chancellor, Workforce Instruction and President Southwest College, Houston Community College, was among Heidkamp’s favorites of day one. “Dr. Burillo-Hopkins has helped lead the efforts at her college to develop AI associate degrees, as well as bachelor’s degrees in AI and robotics. She was very energetic and passionate about the subject and encouraged attendees to embrace this rapidly growing trend.”</p>
<p>Putting on such an event involves a great deal of planning and moving parts, but overall NJCCC feels it was a great success. “I think we were able to maximize the range of topics and engage people across many issues,” shares Heidkamp. “We continue to receive tremendously positive feedback and there is already momentum and encouragement to prepare for next year.” Fichtner adds, “From our conversations with college presidents and leaders, there was a real excitement about being together with colleagues from across the state. Many community colleges said they appreciated having an opportunity for their teams to spend time together off campus and listen to national experts and partners explore different topics that are pertinent to everyone in the education space.”</p>
<p>The Important Role of Community Colleges<br>
Community college graduates play a vital role in the success of the state’s key industries, including manufacturing, technology, health care, education, and renewable energy. “NJCCC serves 240,000 students, where half of all undergraduate students in public higher education and forty percent of all college students in New Jersey are at a community college,” says Fichtner. “Our colleges are comprehensive institutions that serve a wide variety of purposes and help people advance their lives and gain family-supporting careers. We want to make sure that everybody in our community has opportunities, which is where our relentless focus on equity comes into play. We also place priority on helping high school students earn college credit and become inspired to continue their journey after graduation.”</p>
<p>“We see students at many different stages of their lives,” adds Scherr. “They may come to community college for one goal, and then come back later for further career development. We want to be their partner for life and be an anchor institution for our communities. A conference like the Opportunity Summit allows us to showcase this mission and identify how we can work together in a coordinated fashion to help students gain the knowledge and skills necessary to make an impact in the workforce.”</p>
<p>Heidkamp says businesses are increasingly turning to community colleges to be their academic and workforce partners. “The value of community colleges continues to gain recognition and we’ve done a great deal in recent months to show the important role these institutions play in New Jersey. Historically, there was some stigma attached to community colleges, but thankfully, that viewpoint is changing and more people are recognizing the unique service they can provide in creating a skilled workforce, advancing the state’s innovation economy, and enriching the community for all.”</p>

		  Key Changes required to<br>
Protect Your Federal Financial Aid 
<p>For higher education institutions offering financial aid to students, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) means an institution is required to meet compliance standards pertaining to the security and protection of financial information, and to provide transparency related to how personal information is used and shared. Failure to meet these standards carries significant risk for institutions, including restrictions or loss of eligibility for Title IV funding. In July 2024, Edge security, privacy, and compliance experts hosted a webinar focused on key changes to GLBA compliance requirements, how these revisions increase the compliance burden for many organizations, and key steps for meeting the new standard and maintaining compliance to receive federal financial aid support.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>GLBA Compliance<br>
In the last 10 years, GLBA has become increasingly integrated with higher education and higher education technology. This act regulates the protections that must be in place to protect student financial information for institutions that issue or handle student aid through Title IV programs, or who use the Student Aid Internet Gateway system. Since 2018, the Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) at the U.S. Department of Education has encouraged higher education institutions to work toward adopting NIST SP 800-171, and later in 2020, has indicated this may be included in future compliance requirements.</p>
<p>More recently in May 2024, NIST updated the content of SP 800-171 standard to Revision 3, changing the specific controls required to achieve compliance. These changes mean that higher education institutions will need to re-assess compliance if they are currently implementing an earlier revision of NIST SP 800-171 to meet the upcoming GLBA requirement. “For member institutions using the EdgePro virtual CISO (vCISO) service, they are already aware of the GLBA requirements, and we have strategies in place to bring their organization onto the NIST 800-171 standard,” explains Dr. Dawn Dunkerley, Edge’s Principal vCISO. “The changes for Revision 3 will change ongoing work and will require updates to policies and procedures that are already developed.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
         
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Other institutions that are currently compliant with GLBA may not yet be working towards compliance with NIST SP 800-171,” continues Dunkerley. “This can be a great opportunity to be proactive and receive an assessment to identify any gaps to NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3 compliance. The EdgePro vCISO can be another asset to help with documentation, make recommendations for technologies, and create processes for immediate adoption, implementation, and operational improvements within the organization.”</p>
<p>Withdrawn and Consolidated Controls<br>
Even those institutions who are already tracking compliance with NIST SP 800-171 will need to make adjustments in order to stay compliant for the upcoming GLBA requirement. Revision 3 makes several changes that will impact institutions in both administration and in substantive control requirements. On the administrative side, there will be updates required to domain and control numbering schemes, titles, and specific language. “Each control was renumbered, so if you have a system security plan, it will require touch labor on each specific control,” says Dunkerley. “Several controls have been withdrawn and some existing controls have been consolidated and combined with other existing controls. There are also three new domains added, including nine individual controls that focus more on depth and proving control implementation, versus simply defying activities that should be done. The framework now has a helpful supplemental document that is a guide for assessors and allows an institution to look at each control and ask questions such as, how would an assessor test me on this; what is the interview they might conduct; what is a possible technical test; and what artifacts would they be looking for from a documentation perspective?”</p>
<p>All of the controls listed in the new revision have been re-numbered, re-titled, and the descriptions of requirements have been expanded to make requirements clearer. Any documentation that specifically references the NIST SP 800-171 Revision 2 controls will need to be updated in kind, and updated control descriptions will need to be reviewed to ensure that the control implementation in practice matches the clarified descriptions. “The updated and clarified control language may help institutions implement controls more effectively and the assessment guide is helpful for understanding how each would be tested,” says Dunkerley. “Institutions that have already implemented these controls should decide whether to keep each control in place or remove the relevant requirements from policies and enforcement practices.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“The new substantive controls changes focus on not only performing activities to achieve compliance but proving that you do. This may include documented processes, logs, interviews, or a technical analysis with an auditor. By following the supplemental document, an institution can get into an auditor’s mindset as they’re reviewing their policies and procedures. Navigating the new landscape of GLBA compliance can be challenging, but we are here to help institutions understand these requirements, develop strategies for safeguarding financial information, and ensure compliance every step of the way.”</p>

Three new domains have been added in Revision 3, which will require new controls to be implemented that were not tracked in previous versions of the NIST SP 800-171 standard. “One of the more exciting pieces in these updates is the addition of new domains,” shares Dunkerley. “They are planning, system and services acquisition, and supply chain risk management. There can be several policies and procedures that fall underneath each of these, but the two main artifacts specific to this particular framework are the system security plan (SSP) and the plan of action and milestones. The SSP is a living document that shows where an organization is in compliance with the control set. There is a SSP template that shows each control, and an institution is either compliant, non-compliant, or it doesn’t apply.”</p>
<p>An institution can use this document to track progress and determine which actions are required to become compliant. The new set of controls for system and services acquisition is associated with following proper practices and procedures for internal development. “We must ask ourselves; how do we engineer security into the things we are building?” says Dunkerley. “If we have a situation where something is not supported by the vendor, what are the practices that are required to minimize the risk to ourselves? How are we dictating to an external provider what security requirements they are required to follow and how will they be held accountable? Each institution must have vendor risk management procedures in place that have active monitoring of their critical vendors.”</p>
<p>Designed for higher education to measure vendor risk, the Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Tool (HECVAT) is a questionnaire framework that helps assess the information, data, and cybersecurity policies that are in place to protect sensitive institutional information. “Edge likes to use this tool in conjunction with other automated tools before a vendor is brought into our ecosystem,” explains Dunkerley. “We look for a company to share their security practices and documentation, network diagrams, risk assessment results, and how they mitigate any vulnerabilities.”</p>
<p>Substantive Control Changes<br>
In response to the latest trends in the cyber threat landscape, 11 new controls have been added to the existing domain structure and should be implemented to work towards compliance and improve institutional security. These controls may require new policies, documentation, and practices to achieve compliance. “The new substantive controls changes focus on not only performing activities to achieve compliance but proving that you do,” explains Dunkerley. “This may include documented processes, logs, interviews, or a technical analysis with an auditor. By following the supplemental document, an institution can get into an auditor’s mindset as they’re reviewing their policies and procedures. Navigating the new landscape of GLBA compliance can be challenging, but we are here to help institutions understand these requirements, develop strategies for safeguarding financial information, and ensure compliance every step of the way.”</p>

		<p>With enrollment still struggling to bounce back from a downward trend, and closures and consolidations in the news, the need for innovative strategies in higher education has never been greater. Edge’s AVP and Chief Digital Learning Officer, Joshua Gaul, recently led a webinar to discuss these recent trends and what actions can be taken to navigate the evolving educational landscape. Whether an organization is looking to launch new online initiatives or enhance existing ones, employing strategies that build digital learning capacity can help boost enrollment and institutional resiliency and success.</p>
<p>A Closer Look at Campus Closures<br>
During a span of time between July 2004 and June 2020, nearly 12,000 campuses abruptly closed, leaving many students unsure about their path forward to finish their education. According to research conducted by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association (SHEEO) and the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center who analyzed 467 of these campus closures, 78% were for-profit two-year and four-year institutions, and over 20% were non-profit two-year and four-year institutions. “Even prior to 2020, many of these institutions had operating deficits or thin liquidity,” explains Gaul. “The arrival of the pandemic exacerbated these issues and many colleges were forced to merge or close. The majority of these schools were smaller campuses with less than a thousand students, but many had over two thousand students before the pandemic. Around 70% of the students experienced an abrupt closure and over half of them did not re-enroll.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Affected by a $6 million deficit and a drop in enrollment, Cabrini University was among the institutions that was forced to close. Founded in 1957, the University began with 43 students and offered four major programs. Growing to over 1,700 students and 30 programs in 2021, the institution later saw a decline in enrollment in 2022. Cabrini recorded a decline of approximately 1,000 students, or half the student body, in less than a decade, forcing staff cuts and course changes. These issues combined with the financial strain led Cabrini to officially close its doors in June 2024.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>The College of Saint Rose in Albany, New York closed in May 2024 after program cuts, a 37% drop in freshman enrollment, and a financial gap of over $11 million. Over the past three decades, the Board of Trustees at Saint Rose had tripled the size of the campus, spending more than $12 million to purchase 68 properties, and another $100 million to renovate and build new facilities on that land. As enrollment dropped, the private institution cut expensive programs, but the budget deficit continued to grow, and the college had to close earlier this year.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>In the fall of 2012, Bloomfield College in New Jersey had 2,044 students enrolled, but that number had dropped to just over 1,000 students a decade later. The public college was recognized as the only four-year college that is a Predominantly Black Institution, Hispanic Serving Institution, and Minority Serving Institution. As the pandemic continued and Black and Hispanic populations struggled with the fallout, enrollment numbers continued to drop. In order to keep the campus open, Bloomfield merged with Montclair State University in July 2023.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				    
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>“Mergers and acquisitions in higher education are not uncommon,” says Gaul. “For example, Northeastern University in Boston absorbed Mills College in California. Additionally, schools like Otterbein University and Antioch University announced a partnership, but not a full merger, as part of an effort to create a national university system with various shared services. If we look at the most common factors contributing to these closures or mergers, we see declining enrollment, demographic shifts, and financial instability.”</p>
<p>Gaul continues, “Many colleges and universities were facing financial difficulties even before the pandemic, and about one third of institutions were operating at a deficit in 2019. The pandemic exacerbated these issues leading to enrollment declines, as well as a questioning of the value proposition of higher education, which was probably the most damaging thing. An institution’s market position, how it’s perceived in its target markets, its financial position, and its ability to manage resources effectively are paramount in determining the institution’s future sustainability. And helps determine what type of investments and strategic decisions make sense for an institution.”</p>
<p>The Segmentation of Higher Education<br>
According to journalist and author Jeffrey Selingo, there are six segments of higher education institutions, each facing different levels of risk following the pandemic:</p>
 
 Powerhouses (3%): Globally focused, prestigious public and private institutions that are primarily focused on research and knowledge creation. Their top concerns include research funding and attracting top talented faculty and students. 
 Elites (3%): Highly selected, well-resourced liberal arts colleges who maintain selectivity around undergraduate education. They are not as focused on tuition revenue and student demand, but more about their positioning within the job-focused world to prepare students with the training and advanced skills they need to succeed. 
 Strivers (10%): Private and public institutions who are looking to reach Elite or Powerhouse status but are more dependent on tuition revenue or state funding to make that transition. 
 Regionals (30%): Private colleges that are generally small, tuition-dependent institutions who are heavily reliant upon a student body who is regional, if not highly localized. 
 Compass Institutions (14%): Regional public universities that are dependent on local student markets and state funding. 
 Community Colleges (40%): Focused locally and on the adult student market and are increasingly offering four-year degrees. Well positioned to take advantage of a workforce-focused approach to higher education. 
 
<p>With the higher education landscape changing immensely in the last decade, institutions are tasked with creating strategies for building sustainability. “Today’s institutions will need to focus on three key areas moving forward,” says Gaul. “This includes improving organizational culture, enhancing digital infrastructure, and developing new educational and economic models.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Driving Cultural Change<br>
Organizational culture comprises values and behaviors that shape performance where institution leaders must identify problematic aspects of the current culture and understand what changes are needed. “Internal audits can help initiate discussions about cultural strengths and weaknesses,” says Gaul. “Self-evaluations can go beyond what HR requires every year to evaluate their staff and explore more in depth how an organization handles different aspects of its culture. Leaders play a crucial role in transforming unhealthy academic cultures and must clearly articulate the organization’s purpose to motivate engagement in the cultural change process. Changing culture requires acknowledging the need for change, identifying specific behaviors and values that need to shift, and building buy-in.”</p>
<p>“You can’t force a culture shift, it is through changes in underlying values and behaviors,” continues Gaul. “Creating a positive and productive environment is challenging, but it’s essential for unit performance and satisfaction. Oftentimes, getting an outside perspective can tell a story that you’re not used to reading. Through a service like Edge’s Enterprise 360 (E360) Assessment, an institution can gain a holistic look at the entire technology infrastructure and identify which processes, procedures, and policies may be standing in the way of scalability and survival. Through business process modeling and conversations with an entire team, we can tell a story that allows us to make informed suggestions on ways to improve your operation and digital transformation readiness.”</p>
<p>The E360 Assessment looks at every moving part of an institution’s technology ecosystem and pinpoints which medium and long-term changes could have the biggest impact along the digital transformation journey. “Edge can help the transition by providing the support of thought leaders and a research-driven approach to change management that puts people at the center of the process.&nbsp; While a change is a thing you do, a transition is a psychological step that everyone involved makes together, and we can help guide an institution throughout this evolution.”</p>

		<p>The Need for Digital Infrastructure<br>
In the 21st century, sustainability relies heavily upon technology as robust digital infrastructure enables higher education institutions to adapt to evolving challenges, enhance learning experiences, and maintain operational continuity. “Steps taken outside the walls of an organization’s data center can lead to greater strength and sustainability on the academic side as well,” explains Gaul. “To start, it’s important to monitor and measure digital system performance and track those key metrics like conversion rates, customer satisfaction scores, student surveys, and lead times to identify areas for improvement in your digital transformation journey. Each institution should explore how their tools are supporting them and evaluate current processes and technologies to determine which changes will have the biggest impact on their business operations.”</p>
<p>During an evaluation, institutions often find the tools and technologies they are using either overlap or are not being used effectively. “Oftentimes, schools find they have three different tools doing the same thing or are only using 30% of a tool’s capabilities,” says Gaul. “We want to help institutions invest in essential tools and systems and implement necessary tools like an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, customer relationship management (CRM) system, or a project management system that can help them compete in a digital age. In driving digital transformation at your organization, you will need to train employees on these new systems and tools and develop a strong organizational change management strategy that includes various training methods to ensure employee adoption and productivity.”</p>
<p>“Building a service management framework is key to providing system support and identifying and managing incidents effectively. In addition, an institution should implement robust security measures and prioritize data security by implementing proper protocols and authentication measures to protect against cyber risks and data breaches. Digital transformation is an ongoing process that requires continuous improvement, investment, and adaption, and Edge can provide support every step of the way.”</p>
<p>Adopting New Education Models<br>
In the past, the college campus was a physical place where a student enters after graduating high school and leaves when a degree is completed. Over the years, the higher education experience has evolved and the parameters have changed. “The fiscal and democratic realities of today call for the development of pathways and services for learners throughout their lifetime; beyond just those four years,” says Gaul. “This doesn’t mean institutions must discard all the elements of their legacy model, but they will need to add new solutions and innovations. We look at a future where higher education has more flexible pathways and an immersive hybrid option may become more common. By mixing and matching in-person and online courses, students have more flexibility to pursue work, internships, co-ops, or undergraduate research off campus.”</p>
<p>“An immersive hybrid approach can turn the standard model of the student life cycle into something more progressive and innovative,” continues Gaul. “We will begin to see new credentials alongside legacy degrees that are industry recognized certificates that give students on-ramps into jobs before they earn a degree. By asking for input from industry leaders about the key credentials and skill sets they most desire, colleges and universities can help prepare their students more effectively.”</p>
<p>“Some schools are also offering a shortened track to a degree. For example, the University of Minnesota at Rochester offers a year-round, two-and-a-half-year bachelor’s degree program in health sciences in partnership with Google Cloud. Every student is assigned a coach, as well as a mentor from the Mayo Clinic, and gains research experience, a paid internship, and a digital portfolio to track their learning. This model can help cut down costs for students, while offering the same amount of courses and credits in a condensed period of time, helping them get out in the workforce sooner with real-world experience and expertise.”</p>
<p>Another growing trend seen in the higher education community is partnerships between colleges and universities and their local community colleges. Together they build programs where students explore academic options and complete core courses at the community college, and then later transfer to the state school for their junior year. “Lifelong learning is redefining higher education as a platform for continual learning, and new approaches to education, like a seamless transfer program, gives students greater flexibility and provides institutions with creative ways to improve their retention,” says Gaul. “To maintain relevancy and a competitive advantage, more institutions need to be open to building quality competency-based education courses and providing students with ongoing opportunities to gain business-ready skills.”</p>
<p>Gaul reminds institutions that no one education model will be the magic bullet for solving the higher education fiscal crisis, but diversifying revenue streams and academic models can begin to shift the legacy economic model for many campuses. “Higher education was already changing long before the pandemic and how students viewed education was evolving too. Institutions that were already prepared to innovate survived and are flourishing, while those that did not shift their model likely closed.”</p>
<p>“The faculty and students are an integral part of the transition, they are the lifeblood of your institution,” adds Gaul. “You must take their perspectives into account when pushing these large-scale changes. Academics should also always lead technology; technology should not be the one fueling the academic mission. Edge’s team of experts is here to help you drive digital transformation and provide insight into the complicated nature of the business behind higher education so your organization not only survives, but can stand out and thrive for many years to come.”</p>

		<p>Designed to create a structured approach to understanding and improving various aspects of higher education institutions, the Higher Education Reference Models (HERM) provide standardized business and data architectures in areas such as administration, academic processes, and technology integration. These models share best practices that can help improve the value and efficiency of an organization’s architecture teams and facilitate collaboration and the exchange of architectural knowledge within the sector. Originally launched in 2016, the models are curated and managed by the Council of Australasian University Directors of Information Technology (CAUDIT) HERM Working Group.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Higher Education Reference Models<br>
A peer of international associations such as EDUCAUSE, UCISA, and EUNIS, CAUDIT brings together universities, further education, and research institutions from across Australasia and the South Pacific and helps these organizations access services that foster leadership, collaboration, and best practice. “The origin of the CAUDIT Enterprise Architecture Community of Practice began with the strategy and architecture teams at Charles Sturt University, who received a grant to develop an enterprise architecture from what was then DEETYA, the Australian Government’s Department of Employment, Education, Training &amp; Youth Affairs,” explains Nigel Foxwell, Manager Enterprise Architecture, Strategy, and Delivery, Technology Solutions, James Cook University. “The grant was extended on the condition that the outcomes of the work were shared back to the higher education community and CAUDIT was nominated as the overarching body to receive and coordinate that sharing.”</p>
<p>This nomination led to the inaugural CAUDIT Enterprise Architecture in Higher Education Symposium, held at Charles Sturt University’s Bathurst campus in November 2006. The event seeded the CAUDIT Enterprise Architecture Community of Practice, with the Symposium becoming the established annual community meeting, held in-person through 2019, and held online since 2020. “Several CAUDIT member universities had undertaken consultancy engagements with a leading consultancy known as enterprisearchitects.com, now named FromHereOn (FHO),” says Foxwell. “Over the years, FHO attended and contributed to the annual CAUDIT Enterprise Architecture in Higher Education Symposium events. Over the course of a decade, FHO began to see consistency emerging in the anchor models they were creating through their work with many different university clients in Australia and internationally. Working with Anne Kealley, then CEO of CAUDIT, these models were shared with CAUDIT in 2016, to be prepared for release as the first version of the HERM.&nbsp; We are grateful that Greg Sawyer, current CEO of CAUDIT, continues to provide amazing leadership support for the HERM.”</p>
<p>Receiving the FHO models catalyzed formalization of the CAUDIT Enterprise Architecture Community of Practice as a formal group under the wider CAUDIT structure and the first meetings of Higher Education Reference Models Working Group (HERM-WG). The HERM-WG is co-chaired by Nigel Foxwell and jeff kennedy, Enterprise Architecture Manager, Organisational Performance &amp; Improvement, The University of Auckland (Yes, this is the proper appearance of jeff’s name). “The HERM was then delivered into the care and custodianship of the HERM-WG under the CAUDIT Enterprise Architecture Community of Practice and work began in earnest partnership between FHO and the HERM-WG to prepare the initial models for release as Version 1 of the HERM,” explains Foxwell. “The first-release HERM comprised the Business Capability Model and the Data Reference Model, both supplied as posters supported by spartan descriptive catalogs. The ongoing work of the HERM-WG, which meets weekly for ninety-minute workshops, has seen the coverage, completeness, and internationalization of the HERM mature and progress over five version releases. Today, the HERM is being used by more than a thousand institutions throughout the world.”</p>
<p>Aligning IT Strategies with Institutional Goals<br>
The HERM serves as a guide for institutions to benchmark their practices, implement improvements, and align with industry standards and emerging trends in higher education. These resources can act as a foundation to fast-track the development of business and data architecture, as a benchmark to identify similarities and unique features within the institution, and as a tool to effectively communicate and engage with stakeholders. “The adoption of these models can provide a common language that bridges and unites different stakeholders and perspectives within and between institutions and jurisdictions,” says kennedy. “The HERM can provide a ready-to-use framework that aids sensemaking in the complex environment of higher education and can connect strategy with execution, particularly through business capabilities serving as the missing link.”</p>
<p>Although the HERM is cared for and extended by groups of enterprise architects, and Enterprise Architecture practices are typically located within IT, the HERM is a fully featured enterprise reference model that can be applied throughout an organization—it’s not just an “IT Thing.” For example, the introduction of the Business Model Canvas provided tools that support scenario planning and strategic modeling. “Mapping traditional IT services and initiatives to business outcomes and broader institutional goals can be challenging,” says Foxwell. “The HERM can assist with achieving those mappings and helping to better understand and communicate the value of IT in the higher-education context.”</p>
<p>“From an IT-specific perspective, business capabilities play a crucial translation role in helping to understand the connections between investment in technology services, the digital products those services enable, the business capabilities making use of those digital products, and the resulting quality of customer experience,” continues Foxwell. “The HERM represents a consistent view of an institution that is highly stable over a long period of time, withstanding organizational restructuring, continual process improvement, and technological change. Other IT-with-the-business connections can be established by techniques such as placing storytelling overlays on the business capability model. This could include suitability for robotic process automation, technology fitness and business value of application portfolio segments, and readiness to benefit from artificial intelligence (AI).”</p>

		<p>Standardizing Business Architectures<br>
Through a business continuity lens, HERM can provide structured frameworks and best practices that ensure the resilience and stability of institutional operations. By defining and standardizing key processes and functions, using these reference models can create consistency, making it easier to prioritize critical functions and resources, manage changes, and recover from disruptions. “Using the HERM as a guidepost can help an institution understand the footprint of significant business-change initiatives, and project that footprint upon the DRM to understand the manifest of data integrations required and any attendant data-quality issues that might need to be addressed,” explains kennedy. “Referencing this framework can also help understand and communicate stories as diverse as strategic objectives mapping, solving business process issues, directing CapEx investments, and assisting with public records management.”</p>
<p>The value of the HERM continues to be enriched by the global higher education enterprise architecture community and special interest groups including CAUDIT, UCISA, European University Information Systems (EUNIS), and EDUCAUSE members through the Enterprise Business and Technical Architects (Itana) community group. “We have seen the HERM in action and how these frameworks can help drive strategic success,” says Foxwell. “For example, a research-intensive university used a health-assessment overlay on the HERM business capability model to inform their strategic decision-making and investment planning for their future research ecosystem. For another university setting out on a Robotic Process Automation journey, the evaluation of the workload types in each HERM business capability underpinned the areas of interest analysis and implementation-governance framework.”</p>
<p>“Mapping the HERM business capability footprint of a transformation program to reimagine the shape and delivery of its curriculum and signature pedagogies enabled another university to focus its investment in areas that contributed the greatest benefit to achieving the desired outcomes,” adds kennedy. “Numerous institutions have utilized the DRM to conduct a rapid startup of data governance and data management initiatives and used it as the foundation for Business Intelligence initiatives. These models have also been used to undertake enterprise-wide assessments of data assets to provide valuable insights to new senior IT leadership. In another instance, an institution used the HERM business capability model to analyze the likely effects of uplifting the digital skills of their people and enabled them to pinpoint where the effects of the necessary investment would show up and articulate the resulting benefits in terms of customer experience, stronger learning outcomes, and more-impactful research.”</p>
<p>Foxwell says the new Application Reference Model was partly developed and tested in a live scenario where a collaborating university was building a multi-year application roadmap for their research division. “This is a great example of how the models can be deployed to support and guide strategic investment in specific areas. The university has since extended this approach through combining application and business capability models to identify strategic investments in other areas such as human resources, core curriculum delivery, and student support functions.”</p>
<p>Promoting Global Collaboration<br>
The HERM continues to evolve through the commitment of a growing network of constructive and enduring international collaborations who are dedicated to the ongoing development and use of the models. “The earliest of these collaborations can be traced back to 2013 and the connections established between the CAUDIT community and the EDUCAUSE Itana group,” explains Foxwell. “Later, the global pandemic forced the EUNIS Congress 2020 to move online, affording the opportunity for us to participate in that event and the privilege to meet for the first time with colleagues in the UCISA and EUNIS communities. The relationships formed there with the leadership of the UCISA Enterprise Architecture Special Interest Group have proven to be valuable and enduring, with the CAUDIT and UCISA teams having now held more than fifty online meetings and workshops together. CAUDIT and UCISA have also partnered and co-hosted the global launch of the HERM alongside its Version 2.6 release in November 2021.”</p>
<p>CAUDIT has established joint statements of collaborative intent to further the HERM together with EDUCAUSE, UCISA, EUNIS, and Higher Education Information Technology South Africa (HEITSA). “The heartbeat of the international collaborations is provided by each association’s own local Enterprise Architecture community, and the approaches differ for each group,” says kennedy. “The HERM-WG partners with EDUCAUSE on weekly Itana core and Itana Business Architecture Working Group sessions. The working group also connects with UCISA through monthly and on-demand meetings and by sharing access to our collaboration environments. In addition, the HERM-WG regularly meets with EUNIS and holds workshops on topics of mutual interest. Every suggestion and every piece of feedback we receive is logged and triaged through the HERM-WG assessment and evaluation process, and this ensures global perspectives and diverse viewpoints are held up and considered carefully against the HERM.”</p>
<p>Foxwell says international collaboration has improved and strengthened the HERM immeasurably and has led to a richer exchange of best practices, enhanced innovation, and more effective solutions tailored to diverse educational environments. “The collective expertise, curiosity, and generosity of the many people engaging with the HERM and contributing their suggestions, provocations, and thoughtful scrutiny about its applied use and potential futures is nothing short of amazing. Weaving together diverse viewpoints has helped foster a truly global and widely road-tested HERM that is ready for use and able to facilitate day-to-day enterprise architecture activities just as readily as it can serve as the foundation for generational digital transformation. The HERM has therefore been tested and developed across many different regions of the world and has proven to be useful and applicable for all.”</p>
<p>“Through the coordinated efforts of our EUNIS colleagues, the HERM has been translated into several languages other than English, including Catalan, Croatian, Finnish, French, German, Norwegian, and Latvian,” continues Foxwell. “The effort and academic energy required to translate the reference models into another language has also provided substantial benefits to the clarity and global consumability of the HERM. In addition, joining forces has made the HERM distribution available for each higher-education association to provide direct natural syndicated access to its members. We’ve also seen HERM-inspired papers published at The Open Group, including Spanish Higher Education Enterprise Architecture Initiative and Capability Map and the School Reference Model.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Adapting to Meet Strategic Initiatives<br>
Since the HERM models are comprehensive, contemporary, and curated for use as a reference architecture, the framework does not require continual updating in response to technological change or strategic-direction shifts. “Even through changes in the higher education sector and various curriculum delivery models, the HERM has not needed major revisions to cope,” shares kennedy. “This includes different learning modal like massive open online courses (MOOC), multi-model teaching, fully online, hyper-flex and the emergence of consumer-facing artificial intelligence. The HERM is adaptable to various university strategic options from hyper-personalized to large-scale inclusivity. For example, the HERM Business Capability model has been used to represent the signature differences in many important business capabilities for each of the Gartner 4U models of universities in the future. The Business Capability Models are relatively stable devices and if somebody from the University of Auckland in 1883 or The University of Glasgow in 1451, for example, encountered the models back in their own time then this lens would likely be perfectly relevant!”</p>
<p>“The Recipe Cards introduced with Version 3.0.0 of the HERM provided the ability to express institution-specific motivations, business outcomes, and future institutional goals using powerful enterprise-storytelling techniques,” continues kennedy. “The selection of recipe cards included with the HERM distribution included Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, &amp; Belonging and Student Success, each of which will be expressed and achieved in quite different ways from one institution to another. In looking at the Business Model Canvas, it is more playful, adaptable, and flexible than other elements of the reference model and is designed to support scenario-based planning and the evaluation of what-if scenarios. They can adapt to represent the stakeholders, resources, and drivers that surround different types of institutions.”</p>
<p>Later this year, a Technology Reference Model (TRM) will be introduced with the release of HERM Version 3.1.0. “The TRM is probably the most volatile domain across the architecture stack,” explains Foxwell. “The TRM is broadly positioned as a structure of technology services, rather than of devices, things, or specific implementations, and it is expected to adjust over time in response to market shifts, technology convergence, and the ongoing dynamic and rapid shifts in new-and-emerging technologies.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Meeting Diverse Needs<br>
To ensure the models remain relevant and effective for institutions with diverse needs, their usage is continually tested in the field and questions about their content, structure, or application are funneled through the HERM working group. “We are able to review any feedback to identify necessary changes and improvements, but also ratify the models where changes are not necessarily in line with the global nature of the reference models,” explains Foxwell. “The working group is diligent in ensuring that any feedback we take on as change proposals are supported by relevant references to provide context for their scope and content. It is also important to ensure that as we improve the models, that we maintain the best level of detail for our content and provide a consistent vocabulary within and across the models. The level of detail is important as increasing specificity can rapidly lead to a decrease in usefulness, and if our vocabulary is inconsistent, the value of our definitions also decreases rapidly.”</p>
<p>“The Recipe Cards allow different lenses to be applied over and above the Business Model Canvas and can communicate motivations or outcomes of importance to individual institutions,” continues Foxwell. “The HERM is designed to ensure consistency in how its structures are leveled so that the optimum balance between completeness and usability with theoretical perfection is maintained. The HERM-WG maintains detailed supporting references for all change proposals as part of its responsibility for handling all feedback and suggestions.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>The HERM serves as a guide for institutions to benchmark their practices, implement improvements, and align with industry standards and emerging trends in higher education. These resources can act as a foundation to fast-track the development of business and data architecture, as a benchmark to identify similarities and unique features within the institution, and as a tool to effectively communicate and engage with stakeholders. “The adoption of these models can provide a common language that bridges and unites different stakeholders and perspectives within and between institutions and jurisdictions. The HERM can provide a ready-to-use framework that aids sensemaking in the complex environment of higher education and can connect strategy with execution, particularly through business capabilities serving as the missing link.”</p>

		<p>Imagining the Future<br>
In thinking about the future, kennedy says there are many new features being considered for future releases. “We are looking forward to the imminent release of V3.1 which will include the Technology Reference Model (TRM). This is an important companion to the Application Reference Model, which is also getting important improvements following feedback. Our next major release Version 4.0.0 will introduce additional new features and will take the next steps in migrating the HERM distribution to an open-access platform that ensures fully open and equitable access to the HERM is provided. Our community feedback also tells us that the concept of value streams is gaining prominence in strategic discussions. By providing a view on value streams in the context of the HERM, we would hope to demonstrate another way the business capabilities can be organized to address specific areas of focus for HE institutions.”</p>
<p>“The concept of a service reference model is also gaining significant traction,” continues kennedy. “Services have been a focus for some Australian, New Zealand, and UK institutions as they look to define their value to students and faculty. It is a tricky area with a long history of the service management terminology tied very closely with IT services, but there is a broader context around the growing interest in Enterprise Service Management that may be closely aligned to the HERM.”</p>
<p>Foxwell adds, “Lastly, with the explosion of AI everywhere and the ease of access to these tools, the working group can imagine a future where the next most valuable accelerator to higher education is a tool that can be interrogated using the reference models as its base model. It would be amazing for architects of all kinds, amongst others, to be able to provide an institution’s list of applications and have the HERMbot allocate them accurately to the appropriate application and technology HERM items. Or perhaps provide a list of processes and their brief descriptions while identifying the range of associated business capabilities. The opportunities are extensive, and we may be already behind some existing EA tool vendors thinking in this area. There is much promise for routine and everyday Enterprise Architecture activities for the use and application of artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>“We continue to see great uptake of the HERM in Europe and there are many active users there. The EUNIS EA community has been particularly active and supportive and continues to educate and advocate around the models. They will also demonstrate their collaboration, advocacy, and advanced use of the HERM at their second EA Week workshop event, held this year at The University of Southern Denmark. Building awareness is key and we look forward to continuing to connect with new institutions and share our excitement about the opportunities the HERM can help unlock.”</p>
<p>How to Get Started<br>
Edge will continue to promote and employ the HERM and work with members to increase awareness and adoption, and show how to leverage the frameworks in strategic and operational analysis, planning, and decision-making. “We are very excited about the opportunities that will arise from Edge’s support of the HERM and helping extend our reach to new institutions,” shares kennedy. “Promoting the HERM through EdgeMarket is terrific and we hope this will support institutions of all sizes to leverage EA thinking in their strategic and operational objectives.”</p>
<p>For institutions interested in using the HERM, getting started could be as simple as mapping a strategy document to the BCM or using the DRM as a map for data-governance responsibilities. “Full implementation is not necessary to take advantage of these models,” says kennedy. “For those using an EA tool, the models should be able to be imported very quickly. Otherwise, you can start by creating a set of spreadsheets to capture basic information using the catalogs as starting points. For example, the open-source Essential Architecture Services has a launchpad offering that contains the HERM as a ready-to-use, out-of-the-box set of artifacts. Adopting the HERM as part of an EA Tools implementation will reduce the time-to-value and can provide immediate, cost-effective benefits.”</p>
<p>“If you want to learn more about the frameworks, we encourage you to get hold of the HERM and explore what’s in the box,” continues kennedy. “You can also connect with or form a local Enterprise Architecture in Higher Education (EAinHE) community of practice. We commend the Enterprise Architecture communities that are established and thriving within UCISA, EUNIS, EDUCAUSE/Itana, and CAUDIT. The HERM Working Group welcomes and invites thoughts, feedback, and suggestions about any changes that will make the HERM more valuable to the institutions that use these resources to help standardize quality, enhance curriculum development, and improve student outcomes through best practices and strategic alignment.”</p>

<p>As space operations become increasingly complex, the need for effective threat intelligence sharing is more crucial than ever. The increase in data transmission across space networks brings both opportunities and heightened risks, as cyber threats increasingly target critical space infrastructure. Protecting these assets demands a coordinated and proactive approach to threat intelligence sharing. To address this, the OASIS global standards body is working with Space ISAC to form the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/tc-satis">Space Automated Threat Intelligence Sharing (SATIS) Technical Committee (TC)</a>. The group will formally launch on Oct 9, but initial members include NSA, Northrup Grumman, Cyware, MITRE, Peraton, and Carnegie Mellon University. SATIS will build on existing frameworks like <a href="https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=59ce39b8-2acd-486f-a521-018dc7d971ee">Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)</a> and <a href="https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=638b6cf0-58d2-4878-81c2-018dc7e4008a">Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)</a> to help secure space operations against evolving threats…</p>

<p>Imagine standing at the base of a mountain, watching an unstoppable <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/world-debt-clock.html">avalanche of debt</a> cascading towards you. This is the precarious situation the global economy faces today. National debts are accumulating at unprecedented rates. In the United States, the national debt crossed $35 trillion in July 2024, a staggering figure that took 200 years to reach $1 trillion but now grows by <a href="https://www.schiffgold.com/commentaries/1-trillion-per-100-days-is-this-the-year-the-debt-bubble-explodes">$1 trillion every three months.</a> Unchecked inflation acts as the silent thief, eroding the value of our hard-earned money. The dollar has lost at least 25% of its value in the past four years due to inflation and interest rate hikes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Families worldwide are grappling with rising living costs as their savings lose value, and the dream of financial security slips further out of reach. The combined market capitalization of major tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Google, Meta, and Tesla stands at $14 trillion—less than 10% of the $175.3 trillion owed by the U.S. government when including entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. Influential figures like Elon Musk and Ray Dalio foresee a sovereign debt crisis worse than the 2008 financial meltdown, however, this time it’s a melt-up as currencies are destroyed to prop up a failing system and wealth is wiped globally.</p>
  
<p>The urgency of the situation cannot be overstated. The escalating debt isn’t just an economic threat; it’s a debt as a precursor to conflict. History has shown that severe economic instability often leads to social unrest, political polarization, and even geopolitical conflicts. The Federal Reserve made more emergency loans in 2023 than during the 2008 financial crisis, indicating the severity of the current financial stress. The world is witnessing increasing finger-pointing and blame, creating fertile ground for division and discord.</p>
  
<p>The debt crisis isn’t just about numbers; it’s a deep generational theft burdening our youth with debts they didn’t create. No political election or administration can pay off the worlds $305 trillion&nbsp;debt; only extensive use of the printing press can temporarily address it. Young people are entering a world where opportunities are scarce, unable to buy homes or start families—a loss of future prospects and generational equality. This unfair burden diminishes their hopes for a stable and prosperous life.</p>
  
<p>This atmosphere has given rise to a populism trap, where charismatic leaders offer simplistic solutions to complex problems. They capitalize on public discontent, exacerbating divisions rather than healing them. Interest payments on national debts have become the largest government expense, surpassing costs like defence and social security. Instead of promoting unity and constructive dialogue, this finger-pointing deepens societal rifts and distracts from finding real solutions.</p>
  
<p>Is there a way out of this looming catastrophe? Yes, there is. A Native Bitcoin Stablecoin is a beacon of hope in a sea of financial turmoil. This novel solution proposes a transition from Fiat-Based Instability to a new Bitcoin-Backed Stable Solution, positioning Bitcoin as a way out of an inherently flawed system. Bitcoin, often hailed as digital gold, has a fixed supply that cannot be manipulated—no government can print Bitcoin to cheat the system—making it a reliable store of value.</p>
  
<p>But what if holders could unlock liquidity without selling their bitcoins? By collateralizing their Bitcoin holdings, they can issue stablecoins backed by Bitcoin itself. This stablecoin is secured algorithmically by blockchain miners, ensuring that its peg cannot be broken—unlike the old Bretton Woods system, where in 1971, President Nixon severed the US dollar’s tie to gold due to mounting debt, unleashing a wave of money printing and manipulation that led us to the crises we face today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Bitcoin Standard metaphor suggests that Bitcoin, much like gold in the original Bretton Woods Agreement, can anchor a new, trustworthy financial system free from manipulation by centralized institutions. With China, the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury bonds, rapidly selling off its holdings, and BRICS countries increasingly buying gold instead of U.S. debt, the global financial landscape is shifting. The Bitcoin-backed stablecoin offers the best of both worlds: stability through a pegged value and the strength of Bitcoin as a store of value. It acts as a volatility shield, protecting users from the wild price swings commonly associated with cryptocurrencies while providing a secure and trustworthy alternative to fiat currencies.</p>
  
<p>As more people flock to Bitcoin as a store of value, the issuance of stablecoins opens the door to the world of decentralized finance and rights management. Through smart contracts, entire economies can enter into a new world which operates under blockchain protocols, providing transparency and trust in an environment where trust is scarce. This represents a new paradigm for smart economies—a means to replace the failing debt-based system through creative destruction. This shift lays the foundation for a new global financial order, one based on those who accumulate Bitcoin early and offers society a system everyone can verify and trust. By embracing this Bitcoin-Backed Stable Solution, we can transition from Fiat-Based Instability to a future where financial sovereignty is in the hands of the many, not the few.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So where are we on this journey? In a exciting development, a team of Harvard students and alumni has launched the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/harvard-students-launch-new-bretton-woods-project-to-tackle-global-debt-crisis">New Bretton Woods Project (NBW)</a> to tackle the global debt crisis head-on. Incubated at <a href="https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/">Harvard Innovation Labs</a>, NBW is developing a Native Bitcoin stablecoin using the <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-bitcoin-financial-freedom/">BeL2 infrastructure</a>. This initiative reframes Bitcoin not just as a store of value but as the foundation of a decentralized financial system. Jacob, the Lead Member of NBW at Harvard University, stated: “Our goal is to create a ‘New Bretton Woods’ system anchored in Bitcoin, bringing stability through the utility of a stablecoin. This stablecoin lets users avoid Bitcoin’s price swings while keeping the benefits of holding Bitcoin.”</p>
  
<p>The NBW project aims to reshape global finance by building a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin, NBW provides stability while preserving Bitcoin’s decentralization and security. This stablecoin allows users to bypass Bitcoin’s price volatility while retaining the potential for long-term gain, making it practical for daily use. What’s more it it will be build on BeL2, an interoperability protocol which uses $ELA arbiters to allow Bitcoin and EVM networks to talk to each other without bridging assets, avoiding security concerns related to wrapped coins like WBTC. Sasha Mitchell, Head of Operations at BeL2, added: “Financial empowerment comes from both freedom and stability. By offering a stablecoin backed by Bitcoin on the BeL2 platform, NBW gives people a way to protect their wealth and access new financial opportunities, especially in times of economic volatility.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implications of adopting a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin extend far beyond individual benefits. This shift could transform national economies, ushering in an era of sound money, transparency, and fairness. Imagine a new bitcoin-based Bretton Woods, where Bitcoin serves as the foundation for a stable, decentralized global currency. The global debt crisis is an existential challenge that demands bold and creative solutions. It’s time to move beyond the failing fiat system and embrace the potential of a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin. Projects like the New Bretton Woods offer a tangible path toward a more equitable and transparent economic future. This is the next big step for Bitcoin—a stable, unmanipulated currency for everyday spending, backed by the strongest asset of our era.</p>

<p>DIF is thrilled to announce <a href="https://pinata.cloud/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Pinata</a> as a Gold sponsor of the DIF 2024 Hackathon! Pinata is bringing challenges that use decentralized file storage in digital identity solutions.</p> About Pinata <p>Pinata, the Internet’s File API, provides simple-to-use decentralized storage solutions for enterprises and individuals. Building on the secure foundation of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which enables content authenticity by design, their tools abstract away the complexity typically associated with decentralized storage and management. Further, it offers robust features for scalable, responsive applications. This includes a global CDN (content delivery network) to boost load times and simple access control options.</p><p>Pinata's technology is widely used in decentralized applications, and its architecture makes it a perfect foundation for decentralized identity applications and solutions.</p> The Challenges <p>Pinata presents three challenges that highlight the role of decentralized storage in enabling decentralized identity solutions:</p> 1. Verifiable File Storage <p>Associate files with users via verifiable credentials. Both files and verifiable credential metadata can be stored publicly or privately using Pinata's immutable Files API. This challenge invites you to demonstrate your creativity in using immutability and verifiable content hashes to solve real-world problems.</p> 2. Proof of Personhood Credentials <p>In this open-to-interpretation challenge, we want to see creative solutions to personhood credentials that leverage immutable file storage. Participants can use private file storage through Pinata's Files API or public file storage through Pinata's IPFS pinning service.</p> 3. Identity-Based Access Controls for Private Files <p>Build an identity-based access control system for retrieving files stored privately on Pinata's Files API. This challenge should focus on private file storage through the Files API, not IPFS, as IPFS is a public network.</p> Prizes: <p>Prizes total $10,000, broken down as follows:</p>  Grand Prize: $5,000  Per-Challenge Prize: $1,500 (1 for each of the 3 challenges above)  Honorable Mentions: 5 x $100   Why Participate in Pinata's Challenges?

<p>Virginia, US&nbsp;– 30 September 2024&nbsp;– the Board of Directors of Kantara Initiative has announced that Dr Carol Buttle is to join the organization in the newly created role of Chief Technology Officer (CTO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carol joins from the UK government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology">Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT)</a> where she was Head of Certification and Assurance. She brings with her unrivalled expertise in designing trust frameworks and identifying the implications of specific regulations and standards designed to support personal data privacy and security. Carol has input regularly into the development of identity trust frameworks across the globe.&nbsp; As demand for identity certification extends into new markets and territories, she will ensure that Kantara maintains its role as leaders in identity assurance, offering challenge and guidance to support all our members, clients, and partners.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Standards are everywhere,” said Carol. “We all seek assurance that the products we use, the medicines we consume – even the restaurants we visit – meet the appropriate standards and will not cause us harm. It is no different with identity. I see my role not just about certification and approvals. It is about how I can steer the wider industry to improve for the good of individual citizens, and particularly the most vulnerable.”</p>



<p>We asked Kantara Executive Director, Kay Chopard, about what she sees as the greatest impact of the new role. “Our investment in a Chief Technology Officer demonstrates significant commitment to the future of the industry as a whole, particularly with regard to the potential for international growth and greater interoperability across sectors and territories. Carol’s appointment follows on from the recent arrival of UK-based auditors James Keenan and David Nutbrown as our Head of Certification Delivery and Head of Regulatory Compliance, respectively. Their expertise greatly strengthens our existing operations and will secure confidence in the future direction of certification and identity assurance.”</p>



<p>Commenting on Carol’s appointment, Kantara Board Chair Andrew Hughes stated: “Carol’s appointment brings a real depth of regulatory and operational expertise to our leadership. It underpins the valuable contribution we already make through our Work Groups and certification programs. Carol brings with her thorough knowledge and expertise of UK requirements and how they might apply in the US. This will benefit those Kantara members who are engaged with US Federal Agencies or those wishing to become certified under the UK Digital Identity &amp; Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF).”</p>

 By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanhsaxe/">Dean H. Saxe</a> 
<p>I am happy to announce the formation of the <a href="https://openid.net/cg/death-and-the-digital-estate/">Death and the Digital Estate Community Group</a> (DADE CG).&nbsp; DADE CG has been created as a space for the OpenID Foundation and identity community to develop an understanding of how individuals can manage their digital estate in the event of disablement or death.</p>
<p>Before we dive deep into DADE, the problem space, and the outputs of DADE – all of these things will come in the next few weeks – I want to share some history of how I found myself working on this passion project.&nbsp; In November 2010, a close friend of mine passed away unexpectedly.&nbsp; His passing rocked my world. We were close in age – both under 40 – with young children and plans for the future.&nbsp; Our plans to climb Mt. Rainier together never came to pass.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following months and years, I spent a lot of time thinking about death and how I, and others, could manage our credentials for online services in order to allow our friends and family to gracefully manage our digital footprint after death.&nbsp; Initially, I spent time considering a dead man’s switch – a mechanism that would release access to a set of credentials to a defined individual or individuals after a fixed period of time where the owner didn’t check in to the service. The solution seemed unwieldy and impractical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I let this idea sit on the back burner for years.&nbsp; In those intervening years my career moved into the realm of identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I saw the rise of stronger authentication factors, and a move toward digital identity documents such as mDLs, the issue became more pressing.&nbsp; In 2022, recognizing the inevitability of passkeys and the impact that passkeys would have on the ability of family and loved ones to gain access to their deceased loved one’s accounts it became clear we had to resolve this gap.</p>
<p>In 2022 at EIC in Berlin, Germany came a late night conversation with Andrew Shikiar, Khaled Zaky, Tim Cappalli, and Vittorio Bertocci.&nbsp; I shared my crazy idea, we discussed the issue earnestly and agreed that action was needed.&nbsp; Tim – in a way that only Tim could – named it “Dean’s Death Service”.&nbsp; Life happened and, yet again, this idea remained on the back burner.</p>
<p>Nearly 18 months later at Authenticate 2023 and Internet Identity Workshop XXXVII, with the identity community still mourning Vittorio Bertocci’s passing, I leaned on the community to help move the idea of DADE into real action.&nbsp; People shared with me stories of their friends and loved ones’ difficulties managing the deceased’s digital estate.&nbsp; Others shared their own methods for trying to preserve their digital estates in advance of their passing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll be honest – I’m not comfortable with talking about death.&nbsp; I’m not sure most of us are.&nbsp; As identity practitioners, it is up to us to define the use cases, the risks, the privacy implications, and – most importantly – the benefits of standardized mechanisms to allow individuals to choose how their digital estate is managed during disablement or after death.&nbsp; The work we do enables the systems that power modern identity.&nbsp; We must consider how that identity persists in a digital form after death.</p>
<p>Finally, I must extend my appreciate and gratitude to the people who helped make this a reality: Ian Glazer, Mike Kiser, <a href="mailto:kaliya@identitywoman.net">Kaliya Identity Woman</a> Young, Arynn Crow, Nishant Kaushik, George Fletcher, Gail Hodges, Teresa Wu, Pamela Dingle, Tim Cappalli, Andrew Shikiar, Khaled Zaky, Eve Maler, Andi Hindle, Jeremy Grant. Thank you all for the discussions, stories, feedback, that helped get DADE CG off the ground..&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://openid.net/cg/death-and-the-digital-estate/">Death &amp; the Digital Estate Community Group</a>.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks I’ll take care of background administrivia to get the group bootstrapped.&nbsp; Please join the <a href="https://lists.openid.net/mailman/listinfo/openid-digital-directives?_ga=2.117139654.1983570972.1727465548-1651822361.1725045986">DADE CG mailing list</a> to keep up with the latest information about DADE CG.&nbsp; I look forward to our shared work!</p>

<p>In our recently published <a href="https://islstaging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Worldwide-Web-of-Human-Surveillance-Identity-Resolution-and-Customer-Data-Platforms.pdf">research on the worldwide web of commercial surveillance</a>, we took a close look at the global infrastructure connecting and correlating personal information across platforms, devices, and even from physical world sources like point-of-sales systems. The connectivity is, in a word, staggering. At some point, however, there is a first-party relationship with a data subject. From that starting point, personal information is systematically being shared with countless entities including data brokers. In such a hyper-interconnected infrastructure, how can a single publisher make promises about where customer data is going? Moreover, how could a user possibly consent to the sharing of their data with thousands of recipient organizations?&nbsp;&nbsp; But the complexity and unknowability of system behavior isn’t just with these hyper-interconnected marketing networks. As we touched on in <a href="https://youtu.be/AcLposwveNU?si=rHpEOL8QnBEXew13">a recent podcast with Zach Edwards</a>, very large platforms (like Google, Facebook, X) are just as complex and opaque as the identity resolution and customer data platform networks. Software is increasingly a leaky, hyper-connected, unpredictable sieve of personal data sharing. In this blogpost, we take a closer look at the opacity and leakiness of the “big dogs”–large online platforms with hundreds of millions and billions of users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1. Types of Commercial Identity Resolution&nbsp; 
<p>I’ve been digging into this more since the publication of our research on identity resolution and customer data platforms and have revised my framing of identity resolution. To wit, I observe three co-existing types of commercial identity resolution architectures or systems happening in the world:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The first one I call distributed by design. This is the LiveRamps, The Trade Desks, mParticles, etc. of the world. These systems enjoy the power of massive data aggregation with [too] little of the risk and responsibility, as they are designed to be third-parties relative to the data subject. These platforms are architected to ingest and process (resolve) personal information from a disparate array of services and devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 The second one I call company-centric.&nbsp; This is the “big dog” platforms with millions or billions of users; the universes unto themselves. A company-centric identity resolution can also be distributed by design in the sense that it provides numerous small pieces of functionality which can be embedded as third-party resources into other companies’ apps and websites, allowing the big dogs to collect data external users despite not necessarily having direct relationships with them. Microsoft is a good example of this. It’s also true that company-centric identification schemes can and are ingested by distributed systems like LiveRamp. The lines implied by these two categories are fuzzy.&nbsp; 
 The third one I call standardized.&nbsp; This is the hiding-in-plain-sight globally coordinated efforts in <a href="https://unifiedid.com/">Unified ID 2.0</a> and <a href="https://euid.eu/">European Unified ID</a>. Note that these efforts are championed primarily by distributed by design identity resolution and customer data platforms. Scanning the <a href="https://unifiedid.com/partners">partners of just the Unified ID 2.0 standard</a> is enough to give one pause: these are the platforms that want to know who you are and what you’re doing at all times. Notably absent are the big dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>A brief word about national/governmental identification schemes, like India’s Aadhaar and the US Internal Revenue Service’s id.ME: these systems operate somewhat like a big dog company-centric identification system, orchestrating personal information across their own services, with the exception that we don’t expect these systems to be either ingesting or sharing data with external, commercial platforms<a>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Internet Safety Labs (ISL), we rate “big dog” platforms as critical risk “data aggregators”<a>2</a>. We do so for the following two reasons:&nbsp;</p>
 
 These corporate entities monetize personal information, either through ownership of advertising platforms, the selling of audience information, or other monetizing behaviors, and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 These entities run multiple consumer products and services with inadequate transparency of how personal information flows across product lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>The remainder of this post takes a closer look at Google and Facebook (Meta) personal data strategies and why they’re so risky.&nbsp;</p>
 1.1 GAIA and Narnia: Google’s Universal Identification and Cross-Product Personal Data Aggregation Grand Plan&nbsp; 
<p>In the wake of the recent Google search antitrust case in the US, Jason Kint published <a href="https://x.com/jason_kint/status/1821554841786683554">a long thread</a> on a recently unsealed <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.533508/gov.uscourts.vaed.533508.1132.2_1.pdf">325-page Google strategy document</a>. The document titled “Display, Video Ads, Analytics and Apps” contains a coordinated and synthesized set of business strategies describing how Google can:&nbsp;</p>
 
 More effectively coordinate the extraction of user information,&nbsp; 
 Better leverage user data across all of their AdTech, and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 In general, increase ad revenues across its entire portfolio of products and services: “make it easier to add monetization to other Google O&amp;O [owned and operated] properties.”<a>3</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>The document also covers how Google doesn’t make as much money from sites it doesn’t own and would like to assert its control to make them more like sites it does own, thereby increasing revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly every product line’s strategy contained in the document mentions the use of “GAIA signals” or “GAIA data”. GAIA is Google’s proprietary “universal ID”<a>4</a>. The plan clearly outlines how they can better utilize the massive trove of personal information joined by their GAIA “universal IDs”, amassed across their various owned and operated (O&amp;O) properties, like Gmail and Chrome to name two of the largest. This highlight from page 126 (section on “Smart Campaigns”) makes clear Google’s intention to share user information across all its properties to enrich their advertising services (project Narnia and Narnia2):&nbsp;  But it’s not enough to join user data across Google properties; they also indicate an intention to join external data sources, such as streaming and TV ad networks (pg 150):&nbsp;  The second highlighted section above describes the ingesting of external customer data and resolving the data (i.e. identity resolution) to Google’s GAIA IDs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the document describes an organization-wide, orchestrated plan to amass and unify user data (via GAIA IDs) to better leverage Google ads (Narnia 2.0) for both internal and external properties.&nbsp; How can Google users understand–nevermind consent– to the use of their personal information in this wide-reaching way?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1.2 Facebook Admits Unknowability of User Data Processing&nbsp; 
<p>One of my favorite references for explaining why the world needs software safety labels is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvmke/facebook-doesnt-know-what-it-does-with-your-data-or-where-it-goes">this story about two Facebook architects explaining how it’s virtually impossible for Facebook to know where user data is going</a>. The complexity and dynamism of software is making it so it’s not a bounded system—and it’s never the same river twice.&nbsp;&nbsp; The story came out two years ago and I recently read <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21716382/facebook-data-lineage-internal-document.pdf">the discovery document</a> written in April 2021 and it is really good. This excerpt outlines the fundamental problem of the unknowability of Facebook software’s behavior:&nbsp;  And this:   The discovery document contains fascinating information on what Facebook must do to track personal data usage within its system [implement Curated Data Sources and a Purpose Policy Framework], and it’s a massive undertaking: 450-750 engineer years over three calendar years. And even that’s not enough. It also requires “heavy Ads refactoring and adoption work in warehouse.”&nbsp;  Let’s go back to that “closed form system” described by the Facebook engineers. It comes from mathematics’ “closed-form expression”, describing an equation comprised of “constants, variables and a finite set of basic functions connected by arithmatic operations and function composition.”<a>5</a> If we look at realtime bidding as one example of a programmed system, we see that it is necessarily dynamic and unbounded. The participants (buyers) in the realtime bidding network are dynamic; also the ad inventory itself is dynamic. Realtime bidding is, by design, never the same river twice. The system is not a closed form system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Machine learning (ML) is another example: virtually all of the ML technologies generating much recent hype are also not closed form systems by design. They are constantly changing based on the training set, based on ongoing learning, and based on dynamic rule-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 2. Have We Agreed to Be Always Known and Tracked Online?&nbsp; 
<p>To summarize the situation: industry has developed techniques (distributed by design and company-centric) to interconnect and aggregate personal information such that we are always known and tracked online. As noted in the earlier mentioned research paper, there are at least $9T (as in trillion) worth of industries that want to know who we are and what we’re doing at all times. It’s unlikely that we can stop this financially motivated juggernaut of universal identification. So what’s to be done?</p>
 2.1 To Do List&nbsp; 
 
 Consent is dead. It’s impossible and the more we pretend like it’s possible to have informed consent when it comes to the unbounded nature of software, the more we are lying to ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 Privacy policies protect companies but not the people who use technology. Know how you’ve consented into the worldwide web of commercial surveillance? It’s through this phrase found in many privacy policies: “…and we [may] share your data with our marketing partners.”&nbsp;
 
 We need more exposure of actual measured software behavior (ala ISL’s App Microscope: https://appmicroscope.org/app/1579/).&nbsp; 
 
 
 One day, it will be possible for systems to generate machine-readable records of processing activities–a kind of passport stamp showing how your data was processed (used by first party, shared and used by third parties). This will be a landmark moment in empowering people through transparency of actual system behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Data broker regulation is inadequate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 If a platform has your data, it should de facto have a first party relationship with you, and as such, you are entitled to all the proactive data governance rights allowed to you. In other words, nothing about me, without me. Data brokers aren’t and never have been just 3rd parties.&nbsp;
 
 Note that these data rights are unexercisable if people don’t know that they’re actually in a relationship with a particular platform. Thus, there also needs to be a requirements for these platforms to proactively notify all data subjects for which they hold information.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Is the selling of personal information safe for humans and humankind? We’ve agreed as a society that certain things are sacrosanct and the selling of which unacceptably degrades and devalues them (such as votes, organs, children). We need to have a much deeper think about whether or not personal information should fall in that category.&nbsp; 
 Are data broker laws effective in their current form? It seems clear to ISL that all actual data brokers are not currently registered in the states requiring registration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Privacy and safety experts–and perhaps regulatory experts–need to get more aware of and involved in the two universal commercial identification standards (<a href="https://unifiedid.com/">Unified ID 2.0</a> and <a href="https://euid.eu/">European Unified ID</a>) pronto.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Identity resolution platforms and customer data platforms demand substantially more regulatory attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 Minimally, the massive troves of personal information are ripe for data breaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Maximally, the public needs assurances that platforms that are amassing this data are held to accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>At the Digital Trust Hui Taumata in August, Juliana Cafik, Microsoft’s Identity Standards Architect, delivered a thought-provoking keynote on global digital identity frameworks. With over 27 years of experience, Juliana provided valuable insights into how trust frameworks enable secure, interoperable digital transactions worldwide.</p>



 

 



<p>What are Digital Trust Frameworks?</p>



<p>Trust frameworks establish rules for:</p>



 
 Ensuring secure digital interactions 



 Verifying identities in both public and private sectors 



 Applying region-specific levels of assurance for various transactions 
 



<p>Global Examples of Trust Frameworks</p>



<p>eIDAS (European Union)</p>



 
 Goal: Enable cross-border identity verification for 80% of EU citizens by 2030 



 Focus: Electronic signatures, digital wallets, and consistent identity proofing across member states. 
 



<p>DIACC (Canada)</p>



 
 Focus: Economic growth through the adoption of digital identity 



 Approach: Public-private collaboration to ensure compliance and usability 
 



<p>New Zealand’s Unique Position</p>



<p>Juliana praised New Zealand’s approach, emphasising these key elements:</p>



 
 Focus on Safety: New Zealand uniquely integrates safety into its trust framework 



 Key Framework Pillars: Identity management, privacy, security, data management, and facilitation 



 Collaborative Potential: Strong public-private partnerships can enhance adoption 
 



<p>Challenges and Opportunities</p>



 
 Global Challenges: Trust frameworks are complex, evolving alongside technology and regulations. 



 Opportunity for New Zealand: Learning from other countries’ implementations, New Zealand can lead in trust framework innovation.

<p>In today’s digital landscape, data breaches and cyber threats are rapidly evolving. At a recent conference, Marc Airo-Farulla, Regional Sales Director of <a href="https://www.entrust.com">Entrust</a>, discussed the importance of identity-centric security solutions as the cornerstone for enterprise data protection. He highlighted how identity management is reshaping cybersecurity strategies and shared insights on how organisations can safeguard their data effectively.</p>



 

 



<p>Shifting Threat Landscape</p>



 
 Traditional security methods are no longer enough: Perimeter defences like firewalls fail to address evolving threats. 



 Phishing remains a top concern: 85% of security breaches stem from phishing attacks, often exploiting employee vulnerabilities. 
 



<p>The Role of Identity Access Management (IAM)</p>



 
 Identity is now the frontline defence: Managing user access, including employees and contractors, is critical to mitigating risk. 



 Fragmentation challenges: As more systems and technologies are introduced, IAM becomes harder to manage and protect, leading to vulnerabilities. 
 



<p>Zero Trust Frameworks</p>



 
 Adopt a zero-trust mindset: Zero trust means no user or device is trusted automatically, even within the organisation’s network. 



 Data security first: Protecting sensitive data is key, ensuring minimal access and maintaining strict oversight of who has access to what. 
 



<p>Real-World Breach Examples</p>



<p>Marc shared a cautionary tale of an Australian e-subscription company that collapsed after a cyberattack. Within two months, the business was wiped out, emphasising the dire consequences of inadequate cybersecurity.</p>



<p>The Future of Security with <a href="https://www.entrust.com">Entrust</a></p>



 
 Investing in live identification solutions: Entrust has been at the forefront of developing future-proof security systems, like their partnerships with Onfido for live identification. 



 Securing digital assets: Using tools like hardware security modules (HSM) can safeguard critical business data. 
 



<p>Best Practices for Enterprises</p>



 
 Educate and train employees: From C-suite executives to the newest team members, everyone needs to understand the importance of security measures. 



 Limit data collection: Only store what is necessary, minimising the risk in case of a breach. 
 



<p>Identity-centric security solutions are the future of enterprise protection. By shifting the focus to identity management and implementing zero-trust frameworks, organisations can better protect their digital assets and reduce the risk of devastating breaches.</p>



<p>Thanks to Entrust for this insightful talk, and for supporting the Digital Trust Hui Taumata in 2024.</p>

<p>Observed annually on 16 September, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_16#Target_16.9:_Provide_universal_legal_identity">International Identity Day aligns with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16.9</a>, which aims to provide legal identity, including birth registration, to all people by 2030. While most of us can easily prove our identity, for millions around the world, the lack of legal identity remains a significant barrier to accessing even the most basic services.</p>



<p>If you’re reading this, the chances are that you have a legal identity and can prove it. But without one, life is vastly different. Without legal documentation, children may miss out on vaccinations and education, adults are unable to secure formal employment, access healthcare or welfare, vote in elections, start a business, use banking services, travel abroad, register their children’s births, or even claim inheritance or pensions. In effect, you don’t officially “exist.”</p>



 The Global Picture: Millions Left Behind 



<p>In 2021, the <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0040787">World Bank’s ID4D Global Dataset</a> reported that <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099020824141510923/p176341192f2c50e11bc5619be95c4fb2ed?_gl=1*1uivyea*_gcl_au*MjU0NDc3MDU5LjE3MjY2MjA3NjU.">over 850 million people worldwide had no way to prove their identity</a>. Around 540 million of these individuals were in Africa, and half of all women in low-income countries lacked identification. Although progress has been made since then, it is difficult to determine how much progress has been achieved until the next dataset is published.</p>



<p>Globally, civil registration programmes are being increasingly integrated with healthcare systems to ensure children are enrolled early. National birth registration initiatives have been launched or accelerated in countries like Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Papua New Guinea. This issue is not confined to low-income nations, as high-income countries, including <a href="https://ministers.dss.gov.au/media-releases/15276">Australia</a>, are also making strides in streamlining identity processes. A recent pilot in New South Wales, for instance, allowed parents to register the birth of their baby across federal and state government agencies using a single account. This “tell us once” approach eliminates the need for parents to interact with multiple government agencies—reducing up to seven separate interactions.</p>



 The Challenges Closer to Home 



<p>Whilst Aotearoa New Zealand may seem far removed from these global statistics, <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/blog/designing-proof-of-identification-that-works-for-everyone">we are not without our own identity challenges</a>. Certain groups in our population struggle to prove who they are, including rural communities, blind and deaf citizens, former refugees, unhoused people, those who have escaped domestic abuse, and individuals recently released from prison. These groups often remain legally invisible. This raises the question: can Aotearoa help address this before 2030, or will we run out of time to meet the goal?</p>



 Take Action and Learn More 



<p>International Identity Day serves as a reminder that the right to identity is fundamental. Without it, people are denied basic human rights. For a deeper understanding of this global issue and the progress being made, we recommend listening to the ID16.9 podcast, which offers valuable insights into the state of identity inclusion around the world. The podcast is available on Spotify, Apple, Google, or at<a href="https://id169.com/episodes"> ID16.9 podcast</a>.</p>



<p>As we move towards 2030, it is clear that achieving universal legal identity is not just about meeting a target set by the UN. It’s about unlocking access to opportunities, dignity, and human rights for everyone. Let’s continue to push for meaningful change, both here in Aotearoa and globally.</p>

 White label service to enable travel agencies to bring the benefits of decentralization to travel suppliers and consumers 
 Agreements traded via Bitcoin-denominated Smart Contracts facilitated through Elastos’ BeL2 protocol&nbsp; 
 Partnership highlights opportunity for Real World Asset (RWA) to eliminate friction and inefficiencies in the travel sector 
 
<p>Singapore: September 24, 2024 – Elastos today announced a partnership with the Real World Asset (RWA) application (dApp), BukProtocol, to extend decentralization to the travel sector, direct in native Bitcoin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>BukProtocol converts travel booking and other agreements into tokenized, fully transferable ‘Dynamic Assets’ which can subsequently be monitored, exchanged or traded, in the event of cancellation or itinerary change. Tokenization covers all aspects of the travel experience, from travel to accommodation but can potentially extend to other travel-related services such as hospitality, guides or local attractions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through Elastos’s <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a> protocol, the tokenization process will be completed directly in native Bitcoin, to maximize the integrity, security and liquidity of resulting Smart Contracts.&nbsp; Travel is notoriously unpredictable, with itineraries, schedules and routes subject to change at the last minute often due to unforeseen incidents, the consequences of which can range from unused accommodation to multiple reimbursement claims.<br>
Tokenization – and the transparency offered by decentralization – has the potential to mitigate much of the resulting friction faced by travelers and suppliers alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date, over 2.2 million properties have been on-boarded onto the BukProtocol system, including rooms from brands such as The Hilton Group, Marriott and Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts. BukProtocol is available as a white label service for travel suppliers and agencies to better manage their bookings and inventories, which can subsequently be traded across Web2 or Web3 marketplaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arulprakash">Arul Prakesh</a>, Founder and CEO of BukProtocol, explains that the Elastos partnership is about much more than reaching new audiences for its dApp.</p>
<p>“While a presence within the Elastos ecosystem will certainly boost our visibility and reach, what’s really compelling is BeL2’s potential to complete the entire tokenization process directly in Bitcoin, a token that most of our audiences are familiar and comfortable with. Bitcoin denomination also maximizes the liquidity – and ‘tradability’ – of resulting assets; a crucial consideration for users,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elastos’s<a href="http://Bel2.org"> BeL2</a> Protocol enables the tokenization of any travel-related experience – from a journey to accommodation – based on terms defined in a Bitcoin-assured Smart Contract. Thanks to the protocol, this process can be completed without bridging, wrapping or otherwise interfering with the Bitcoin layer; this both assures the integrity of the currency and avoids network congestion and additional fees that would otherwise result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-hargreaves-18a6701?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name">Jonathan Hargreaves</a>, Elastos’ Global Head of Growth, describes the partnership as the perfect intersection between Bitcoin tokenization and Real World Assets (RWA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>“BeL2’s unique ZK-proof process – ensuring complete interoperability while leaving the Bitcoin layer entirely untouched – means that Bitcoin’s integrity is fully leveraged throughout the tokenization process.&nbsp; In practice, this means that members of the travel community can trade assets (Smart Contracts) directly with each other, completely eliminating the need for intermediaries and the inefficiencies that inevitably result.&nbsp; The BUK Protocol is really demonstrating the practical – and exciting – opportunities that can emerge from decentralization; within a sector that’s characterized by unpredictability and sub-optimized inventories,” says Jonathan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;About BukProtocol</p>
<p>Buk Protocol is a solution stack to create secondary markets for Dynamic Assets <br>
We are enabling flexibility and liquidity for RWAs by allowing users buying event tickets, hotel room bookings, airline bookings and other industries which associate an expiration date to their assets and services</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Docusign?</p>



<p>Docusign’s mission is to bring agreements to life by accelerating the process of doing business and simplifying people’s lives. With its Docusign IAM platform, Docusign unleashes business-critical data that is trapped inside of documents and disconnected from business systems of record, costing businesses time, money, and opportunity. Using Docusign IAM, companies can create, commit, and manage agreements easily. Focusing on the ‘commit’ capability, where identity verification is more relevant, Docusign’s extensive portfolio of identity verification solutions make it simpler for stakeholders to commit to agreements through advanced, AI-enabled identity verification solutions and multiple levels of authentication. Supporting capabilities such as Phone authentication, ID verification, biometric detection, and FINTRAC-compliant-workflows, not only can signers easily confirm their identities, but senders (i.e. businesses) can also securely capture and store the identity information provided during the agreement completion process. This ensures that all parties are who they claim to be, and agreements are enforceable.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Over the last few years we’ve seen the highest volumes of fraudulent cases ever on record (Cifas, Fraudscape 2024). Therefore, it’s understandable why we’re starting to notice drastically higher levels of regulatory scrutiny, and more requirements being imposed on businesses in terms of introducing strong identity verification methods for digital interactions. This scrutiny isn’t just in mature markets, but also in emerging ones where the rapid-adoption of new technologies that’s accompanying fast-paced growth, is necessitating urgent regulatory oversight. Therefore, having trustworthy digital identity for both existing and emerging markets is essential for secure, efficient, and inclusive digital economics. For emerging-economies specifically, widely available identity verification tools that are easy to use can help promote secure, sustainable and long-term economic growth that ensures equitable access to increasingly digital services.</p>

<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>The local and international benefits of digital identities are transformative, in the sense that they can help enhance the security of increasingly digital interactions, improve the efficiency of these interactions, and also make them more accessible across various sectors. For example, the adoption of digital identities can further enhance trust in online interactions, making it easier for consumers to engage in e-commerce transactions. This will likely lead to the expansion of the digital economy in Canada, where secure and convenient online shopping experiences will become safer and, therefore, more adopted. Globally, this could drive the growth of e-commerce, particularly in developing economies where digital identities can securely bridge the gap between offline and online markets. That’s where Docusign’s portfolio of identity verification solutions comes in. Our extensive portfolio offers enhanced signer identification and authentication capabilities built into any agreement workflow, enabling organizations to transact a full range of agreements with increased trust and ease of use.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada has introduced a series of anti-fraud initiatives that have made a significant impact on combating various forms of fraud across the country (public awareness campaigns, industry collaboration (‘Canadian Bankers Association’s Fraud Prevention Month’), strong legislative frameworks (FINTRAC), etc.). These initiatives have made significant progress in reducing fraud, increasing awareness, and improving recovery efforts locally. By advocating for similar initiatives internationally, Canada can influence the global development of digital identity systems to ensure other countries can reap similar benefits. Through innovation, collaboration, and advocacy, Canada can help ensure that digital identity becomes a force for good in the global economy.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Focused on securing the online agreement space for everyone, Docusign joined the DIACC to help shape the future of digital identity in Canada and contribute towards developing a more secure, inclusive and beneficial digital agreement ecosystem for its Canadian customers. Being able to collaborate with like-minded industry leaders and drive innovation across the country makes DIACC membership a valuable investment for Docusign.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Agreements are based on intention and identity: organizations need to be able to trust that signers are who they say they are. The standard practice of verifying a signer’s identity is to send a link to the signer’s email address. But agreement value, sensitivity, business risk, regulation, or legal requirements can drive the need for enhanced identification. The challenge is to deliver stronger verification, while keeping the overall experience user-friendly. That’s where Docusign Identify comes in. Identify provides a portfolio of enhanced signer identification and authentication capabilities built into the agreement workflow, enabling organizations to transact a full range of agreements with increased trust. These solutions include: * ID Verification: FINTRAC-compliant digital identity proofing of participants in agreements workflows via biometric checks such as AI-enabled liveness detection, verification of passports, driver licenses, or permanent resident cards * Phone Authentication: multi-factor authentication via text message or phone call * ID solutions for digital signatures: meet requirements for UK and EU electronic identification, authentication and trust services (eIDAS) compliant Advanced (AES) and Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) * Network of trust service solutions: Easy access to our tightly-integrated global network of trust service providers for region-specific compliance To learn more, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.docusign.com/en-ca/products/identify">www.docusign.com/en-ca/products/identify</a></p>

<p>The world is increasingly dominated by privacy breaches with the annual cost of cybercrime predicted to reach <a href="https://www.bluefin.com/bluefin-news/biggest-data-breaches-year-2024/">10.2 trillion by 2025</a>, not to mention the centralised control of digital platforms and user manipulation. <a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos</a> offers a solution—a decentralised internet, secured by the very network that powers the world’s most trusted digital currency, Bitcoin. Just as Bitcoin provides financial freedom and sovereignty, Elastos brings those same principles to the world of data, identity, and digital ownership. By <a href="https://elastos.info/news/ela-queen-of-bitcoin/">merge-mining with Bitcoin</a>, Elastos guarantees us that it’s protected by Bitcoin’s miners, delivering a specific layer of security and trust. This unique integration allows Elastos to inherit Bitcoin’s decentralisation, security, and freedom while adding its distinct value to the future of the internet. No Elastos isn’t dying, and here are 6 core reasons why Elastos is the next-generation decentralised Internet, secured by Bitcoin!</p>
 1. Reclaim Your Digital Sovereignty 
<p>Take back control of your digital life with Elastos, where you own your data, identity, and assets—free from corporate control. At its core, Elastos taps into the desire for freedom—the same emotional appeal that made Bitcoin a global movement. We are increasingly trapped by big tech companies that control our data and content, Elastos emerges as the platform that offers true digital sovereignty. We already trust Bitcoin to secure their financial transactions, and now, Elastos builds a decentralised internet with the same security and trust as Bitcoin, giving us full control over their data and digital assets.</p>
 2. Simple, Secure, Decentralised 
<p>Elastos is secured by Bitcoin miners, meaning Bitcoin-backed security, so you can immediately relate to its reliability. The platform provides a Bitcoin-level security system for your data and content, making sure that your digital assets are as secure as your Bitcoin. Elastos brings Bitcoin’s security to the decentralised internet, so your data is as secure as Bitcoin. While the technology behind Elastos is complex, its value is simple: Elastos is a new, decentralised internet that allows you to control your data and identity as securely as you control your Bitcoin.</p>
 3. The Next Digital Revolution 
<p>Elastos is where Bitcoin’s security meets the decentralised internet, opening the full potential of blockchain for digital freedom. Elastos is part of the next digital revolution, one that mirrors the transformation brought by Bitcoin in the world of finance. Elastos and Bitcoin together form the ultimate decentralised duo—Bitcoin secures your finances, while Elastos secures your digital life. Merge mining with Bitcoin gives us a unique advantage, ensuring that Elastos is powered by the world’s most trusted decentralised network.</p>
 4. Empowering People, One Story at a Time 
<p>Elastos gives us the tools to own your digital life, powered by the same miners securing Bitcoin. Elacity, a project on Elastos building the next generation of digital ownership through a decentralised marketplace for Digital Capsules, had a creator earn $5,600 in less than 24 hours monetising a video on Elastos. This is just the start and Elastos has the potential to empower millions of people who want to reclaim control over their digital identities, content, and data. Much like Bitcoin has given financial freedom to millions, Elastos provides the tools for users to take back their digital freedom and realise their digital worth. When you use Elastos to escape the centralised control of big tech and build direct relationships with your audiences, you begin to realise your true digital worth.</p>
 5. The Future of Digital Security 
<p>Elastos is unbreakable—secured by Bitcoin’s miners, it is the safest decentralised platform for the digital future. Elastos is the new internet, offering a future where you have total control over your data, identity, and digital assets. Elastos is one of the most secure decentralised networks in existence, making it an inevitable part of the future due to Bitcoin miners securing Elastos. Bitcoin-level security reinforces Elastos’ strength and drastically increases its probability of success against those without.</p>
 6. Evolving with the Digital World 
<p>As the digital world evolves, Elastos remains the most trusted and secure decentralised platform—powered by Bitcoin miners. As Elastos grows, and integrates new features like the Bitcoin Elastos Layer2 protocol, <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>, <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity dDRM</a> and beyond, it not only adapts to the evolving digital landscape, but it leads it. Elastos is a solution to the privacy crises of today, offering users a way to secure their digital lives against threats like data breaches and surveillance. With its Bitcoin-backed security, Elastos represents freedom from centralised risks—ensuring that it stays relevant in a world that increasingly values privacy and control.</p>

 Partnering with YeloPlay and BeatFarm Elastos shows the potential of the New Age of Bitcoin 
 Creators and Artists can eliminate intermediaries, reduce fees, retain ownership and drive immediate revenue 
 
<p>Singapore September 20th 2024 – Elastos, a SmartWeb ecosystem provider, today created the World’s first live music inscription at its <a href="https://lu.ma/aw0flgk4">Asia OnChain Real World Assets (RWA) event</a> at Token 2049. Elastos, part of the Group supported by the Singapore headquartered Elastos Foundation, used its <a href="https://escription.io/">eScription</a> technology to create a recording that was not only inscribed live to Bitcoin and the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) but now remains available to artists and fans for all time as a minted collectible of the occasion. This is a significant example of the New Age of Bitcoin, where artists and creators can eliminate intermediaries, reduce fees and drive immediate revenues, while retaining an immutable record of their work.</p>
<p>This first recording was supported by Elastos partners, YeloPlay, a Web3 platform with a catalog of Indian and Sri Lankan soundtracks, film scores, and hits and BeatFarm, a transformative music industry platform focused on the development of new inscription technology and blockchain-based music consumption models. Today’s demonstration is a significant moment in showing the potential for Bitcoin and the Bitcoin infrastructure to deliver a new economic model. The song being inscribed is “Back to the start” composed and performed by Mike De Zilva, Kat Sonata and Charth Fernando.</p>
<p><a href="https://beatfarm.io/">BeatFarm</a> enables this inscription by inscribing an Ordinal on Bitcoin and an eScription on ESC, which is attractive to Bitcoin holders as it maintains the benefits of the currency’s security and integrity to protect their investment. For creators and artists, it means Bitcoin owners can easily use their currency without bridging, wrapping or otherwise interfering with the Bitcoin layer. The inclusion of ESC is important, as it avoids network congestion and additional fees that would otherwise result, allowing users to establish Smart Contracts on their own terms, ultimately becoming an attractive alternative way to commercialize content.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Growth, Elastos explains: “This is a key moment for Web3 models and the music industry as for the first time an instantaneous record of a performance can be created and monetized using Bitcoin and crypto technologies. This gives artists ownership rights and control, as well as a direct relationship with their fans cutting out intermediaries and their fees. This approach has the potential to transform how music is made, consumed and stored, empowering everyone to enjoy and cherish the creative product.”</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of the <a>Elastos BIT Index</a> is that BRIC nations and the Global South are moving quicker to embrace Bitcoin. For example, 24% of tech-savvy Indian consumers and 26% of UAE respondents use Bitcoin every day as their currency of choice compared to the global average of 18% while only 11% of Germans, 13% of UK respondents, 14% of South Koreans and 15% of US tech-savvy consumers are prepared to do the same. Furthermore, 91% of Nigerians and 90% of Indians see a time when Bitcoin could become a type of ‘default’ current compared to only 70% in Germany and 73% in the UK and South Korea, and 75% in the US. Therefore, it is perhaps no surprise that YeloPlay, whose back catalogue includes material from some of Sri Lanka’s most famous artists such as Roshan de Silva, Mariazel Goonathilaka, Nalin Perera, Mike De Zilva, Shane Vincent, and Joel Fernando, has participated in this project.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves continues: “Although today’s first live inscription signals both a technological and creative revolution, it also enables cultural renaissance where artists from anywhere in the world, such as these Sri Lankan and Indian artists supported by YeloPlay, can experience new artistic and economic opportunities.&nbsp; It means every community can promote and share a unique cultural record by preserving it on the Bitcoin infrastructure forever.”</p>
<p>Beatfarm’s Co-Founder, Alex Panos shared:&nbsp; “Crucial to this revolution, BeatFarm is providing artists the tools and resources to control their content, collaborate, and take advantage of new ways to connect with their super fans in ways which we haven’t seen before, supporting communities and social media movements who want to share musical culture.”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MikeDeZilva?t=gr0B5293Ps8lb_PidF3C7g&amp;s=09">Mike de Zilva</a>, Founder and CEO of YeloPlay, describes completion of the live eScription as a milestone for the creative and music industries:</p>
<p>“The World’s first live eScription, literally, signals the moment when artists regained control over their creations – it’s massive. And it’s not limited to content, Bitcoin-backed eScriptions will enable artists to develop and define completely new relationships with their audiences, incentivising super fans, for instance, with exclusive content, access and experiences. All on the artist’s terms,” says Mike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About BeatFarm</p>
<p><a href="https://beatfarm.io/">BeatFarm</a> is a Web3 music distribution platform that enables artists to mint and inscribe their music onto multiple blockchains simultaneously, while also connecting directly with their superfans. BeatFarm aims to democratize music distribution by leveraging blockchain technology to provide artists with unprecedented control over their work and direct access to their fans.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is delighted to announce that it is one of 15 parties to a <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNIST/bulletins/3ae9367">Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)</a> with the National Cybersecurity Council Center of Excellence. This project will accelerate digital identity adoption in the United States. Its first use case supports financial institutions to meet their Know-Your-Customer requirements using <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/digital-identities-mdl">Mobile Drivers License (mDL) technologies and standards</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation and its members are passionate about the role that standards play in catalyzing ecosystems. We are grateful to NIST for the opportunity to engage in this project and for its continuing contributions to industry standards, including their active participation in OpenID Foundation Work Groups.</p>
<p>In this case, we are excited to test the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/specifications/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a> family of specifications, especially <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-sd-jwt-vc-1_0.html">OpenID for Verifiable Presentations</a>, to support financial use cases. This effort directly complements <a href="https://openid.net/nist-800-63-feedback-sessions/">our work with the California DMV</a>, which employs two upcoming Hackathons to test a variety of public and private sector mDL use cases.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to further collaboration with the other 14 parties, among whom are many valued members of OIDF, including Idemia, Spruce ID, Mattr, the California DMV, and Sustaining Board Members Microsoft and Block/TBD.</p>
<p>We encourage members of the Financial Services community who are interested in this work to complete <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2LNQVS2">this survey</a>, powered by our friends at the Secure Technology Alliance, which aims to understand FinServ awareness and attitudes towards Mobile Drivers Licenses.</p>

 Development vs Engagement in a Collaborative Setting <p>Our new Mozilla Foundation-funded Friends of the Earth ‘Green Screen’ project has the express aim of developing a set of AI principles that the climate movement can use. The project involves desk research and a gathering of experts to influence and contribute to these principles, creating a co-designed starter for ten that others can build upon. We will then take what we’ve learned to report for <a href="https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk">the Friends of the Earth policy&nbsp;site</a>.</p><p>Part of this involves setting up an online roundtable to gather insights from a diverse range of experts. In our project kickoff call last week, we realised that clarifying the ambitions and aims of such an event is something we do instinctively.</p><p>We’re big fans of <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/expertise/community-calls/">community calls</a>, but the roundtable we will be putting together is something slightly different. In this post, we’re going to give you a few things to think about when you’re gathering people together to co-design a policy or set of best practices — or when you’re more on the development side of the continuum.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO The Development-Engagement continuum <p>First off, there’s tons of value in getting people together and working collaboratively towards something. There is also a lot of nuance in such an endeavour, so it’s best to understand what your long term goal for the project might be. We like to determine where on a continuum between ’development’ and ’engagement’ a particular project might&nbsp;sit.</p><p>Development is the side of the continuum that focuses on the final output of the project. This could be, for example, a report, article, or set of recommendations. Engagement, on the other hand, can serve as a launchpad for building community. While there may be outputs along the way, the main goal is to find and engage with people who are interested in a particular topic. As it happens, we’ve written extensively about <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/How-to-build-a-CoP.pdf">how to build a community of practice</a> in this short (and free!) resource.</p><p>If you’re mostly focusing on development, as we are with our Friends of the Earth (FoE) roundtable, you will need a different kind of preparation and facilitation than if you’re focused on a longer term community- building initiative.</p><p>Of course, many projects have an eye on both the short term and the longer term, and so are looking to do development and engagement. However, it’s important to understand that community building requires designated moderation, facilitation and a place to interact. If there is no one to actively manage and engage the community, it can become stagnant!</p> Co-designing for Development <p>It’s important to note that every collaborative effort does not need to lead to a fully fledged community. For example, with our FoE Green Screen project, the focus is very much on the set of principles that other organisations can build&nbsp;upon.</p><p>If you find yourself looking to engage a group of people around a particular project, like policy development or a set of principles, you should have a think about how your co-design event fits into the “project management triangle”.</p><p>Let’s take each point in&nbsp;turn.</p>PM triangle cc-by Laura Hilliger for&nbsp;WAO 1. Funding <p>How much funding is available for the co-design piece of your project? Can you afford to pay people to participate?</p><p>If you can pay people for their input, you absolutely should. Even a small portion of your overall budget can work, offering people a one-time fee or goodwill payment shows them that you value their contribution. However, we know that sometimes remuneration is not possible.</p><p>If there isn’t enough funding to pay people for their time, make sure you plan to spotlight their contribution in other ways. You can issue badges to contributors, ensure all contributors are named in final outputs and publicly thank people when you share the final&nbsp;outputs.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO 2. Scope <p>Based on the funding available, what is the scope of the collaboration? How can you ensure that you are building collaboratively?</p><p>Will you host a single event? You might also have three events or five of them. You might set a six month timeline for your project. Be clear about what you’re asking of people as you are asking them to participate. Are you inviting them to the first of a series of events or a singular event? Is there prep work or ‘homework’ involved? How will their contributions be attributed?</p><p>Together with other contributors, you’ll need to establish procedures to receive feedback and inputs, as well as how you will process them to create iterations. As always, documentation goes a long way and writing openly about the scope and decisions made along the way will help contributors understand the&nbsp;plan.</p> 3. Time <p>How much time and effort can you ethically ask others to put in? How much time are you putting&nbsp;in?</p><p>Depending on your budget, you’ll need to figure out how much time you need to complete your policy, principles, best practices or whatever the output actually is. You’ll also want to think about how much time you require from the people you’d like to&nbsp;invite.</p><p>If you are looking for open contributions to your project, it’s best to try to minimise the amount of time other people will need to participate. Help contributors give good insight quickly by asking specific questions and giving people the opportunity to give feedback via email or a voice&nbsp;text.</p> Bringing things&nbsp;together <p>The three sides of the project management triangle play together to shape your co-design event. Depending on your parameters, it might make sense to do some of the development work on your own and then ask for input and feedback. Alternatively, you might want to get everyone involved from the beginning and co-design the entire project through a series of events. Be adaptable and flexible as you begin to work with others and refer back to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">the 5 principles of open</a> to remind yourself of what it means to work&nbsp;openly.</p><p>Knowing where you sit on the ‘development/engagement’ continuum and mapping out your funding, scope and time will help you plan a codesign event that leads to great outputs and strengthened relationships.</p><p>Need help figuring out how to design your co-design initiative? <a href="https://weareopen.coop">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-a-co-design-event-39492530daad">How to build a co-design event</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-lambert-gb/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Nick Lambert</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dock</a>, has been a driving force in the digital identity space for over a decade, consistently working towards empowering individuals with control over their personal data. His decentralized identity journey began at MaidSafe, where as COO he spearheaded the SAFE Network, an ambitious project aimed at creating an autonomous data network that prioritizes user privacy and data sovereignty. At Dock, Nick continues his mission to revolutionize digital identity, focusing on solutions that streamline processes and reduce friction for both individuals and organizations.</p><p>Nick joined us to share his insights on the evolving landscape of decentralized identity. He discusses the <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/dock-and-cheqd-form-alliance-to-accelerate-global-adoption-of-decentralized-id?ref=blog.identity.foundation">recently announced blockchain merger with Cheqd</a>, Dock's unique approach in the market, and key sectors for growth in the coming years. Nick emphasizes that the collaborative approach in decentralized identity, with shared standards and toolsets, accelerates innovation towards user empowerment, with industry players "all pointed in roughly the same direction."&nbsp;</p><p>Your journey from MaidSafe to founding Dock reflects a long-standing interest in digital identity and personal data control. How did these experiences shape your vision for Dock?</p><p>It started back around 2012. I was a technology marketer and wasn't very familiar with decentralized technology. We were a startup looking to decentralize web services: enabling users to store their own data and provide it back to social media networks or other service providers. This introduced me to relevant decentralized technology, and also the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>It made me realize how important it is that we control our own data, whether that's documents we store, music, or academic files, and to be able to control it on our own device. You also don't want companies removing your access to it, which they can do and have done, even by mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>When I left MaidSafe and saw Dock, it made sense that the most important type of data you have is your identity data. Identity takes many forms, but it seemed like a critical area with work still to be done. Dock was an opportunity to take a narrower view (than MaidSafe) and ensure we could provide people with the ability to control their own identity. And for the last twelve years, that's what's really got me out of bed in the morning.</p><p>Your path perfectly captures how long-term builders and leaders in the space become focused on giving people control over their identity data. Can you elaborate on that?</p><p>Absolutely. It's such a big problem, but what's encouraging about the identity space is that it's a more focused challenge compared to something like decentralized storage. With identity, there's a much larger group of people working on the problem with, for the most part, an agreed-upon set of tools and standards. It's almost like a movement of companies and organizations solving it together.</p><p>We might have minor disagreements about implementation details, but we're all pointed in roughly the same direction. That's what makes it feel solvable. We're not all trying to work in isolation - we're collaborating, building on each other's work, and moving towards a common goal.</p><p>This approach is crucial because giving people control over their identity data is too big and important a problem for any one company to solve alone. By working together, sharing standards, and building interoperable tools, we're making real progress.&nbsp;</p><p>How does Dock's approach to verifiable credentials and digital identity differ from other solutions in the market?</p><p>We have a big focus on the business aspect. It's easy to fall in love with the technology, but it's the problems it solves that ensure technology is adopted and builders can make their solutions operate effectively as a business. We focus on tools that can enable business models.</p><p>An essential part is an online trust registry. Just because something's in a system or blockchain doesn't mean it's true. You need a linkage between real-world verification of a company or individual and their representation within a system. Trust registries (and the appropriate business partners) provide this, and having them programmatically exist inside your system is key.</p><p>Once you have that, it enables businesses to think about how they wish to monetize the credentials. This is important because it's very hard to get businesses to change unless you can point them to a specific business model. We're enabling credential issuers to turn what today is a cost center into a revenue source. When you combine that with our ecosystem enablement and the rest of our stack, it makes us differentiated in the market.</p><p>You've been at the forefront of communicating the business value of decentralized identity, including popularizing the term "reusable identity." Tell us your perspective on the evolution of narrative over time.</p><p>At the start, many focus their communications on the tooling -- that it's decentralized, uses certain types of cryptography, etc. You put that all over your website, thinking people will care. But the only people who care are others building those solutions.</p><p>The companies that will use and pay for these solutions are looking for solutions to problems. They don't care whether it's decentralized or what type of cryptography you're using - they just want a problem fixed.</p><p>We've made a conscious effort with our communications to focus more on the benefits we can provide. We try to understand the specific problem a group of prospects and customers are having and how we can fix it. Then we build the narrative around that. This has been the biggest shift we've had, and we're starting to see some success from it.</p><p>When discussing decentralized identity with investors, what aspects do you focus on to convey its potential value?&nbsp;</p><p>Investors are typically looking for returns within a defined time period. They're looking for things like size of opportunity and potential market growth. They also want to see something that doesn't completely disrupt existing businesses. Evolutionary changes that complement existing businesses in a relatively easy-to-integrate way are often more interesting to investors.</p><p>We also talk about market drivers pushing adoption, like eIDAS regulations, mobile driver's license initiatives in the US, World Bank investments in digital identity, LinkedIn's use of Microsoft Entra ID for credentials, and Google's recent release of the Credentials API. These developments indicate the level of adoption we're likely to see, which excites investors.</p><p>What are some common questions or misconceptions about decentralized identity that you encounter, and how do you address them?</p><p>One common misconception is that identity only refers to government-backed identity, like a driver's license. In reality, we're talking about identity in a much broader sense. It can be anything from a website's understanding of who you are to your access to their system. Fundamentally, it's about control over your data.</p><p>Another misconception about <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.identity.foundation">decentralized identity</a> is that every single aspect of it must be decentralized. What we're really talking about is the decentralized consumption of data - the presentation and verification. This typically happens in a wallet where the individual has control. They're presenting a credential given to them by a third party to another entity, who can verify it without knowing who they're verifying or what they're verifying. That's the important part of decentralization. Of course, you'll still have centralized entities issuing those credentials.</p><p>The recent merger between Dock and cheqd is significant news. What was the vision behind this decision?</p><p>Keep in mind it's a blockchain merge rather than a full company merger; the legal entities are remaining separate. We're migrating all of our chain-related elements (like revocation registries, DIDs, testnets) over to Cheqd.</p><p>The vision behind this is to allow Dock to focus on what differentiates us in the market: our issuing and verification platform, API, and our various platform features. Not all of these innovations take place at the blockchain layer but above it. As a small team, managing the entire stack was becoming a challenge.</p><p>We feel our strengths lie in the areas above the chain, and Cheqd is highly competent in the blockchain area. This allows us to focus on what really interests us and where we think we can make the most difference for our customers.</p><p>Additionally, being part of the Cheqd ecosystem with other great projects feels like a big step towards interoperability with a number of other providers. This addresses a concern I had about Dock potentially isolating itself on its own chain.</p><p>Your partnership with the University of Arkansas involves anonymous cyber incident reporting. How does this project demonstrate the capabilities of verifiable credentials?</p><p>The University of Arkansas, Little Rock is involved with some Department of Defense and energy-related projects. They're building what they call ET-ISAC (Emerging Threat Information Sharing and Analysis Center). They needed a way for people to report things anonymously, like a whistleblowing service, without fear of reprisal.</p><p>Using Dock's technology, they've created a system where someone can become a member and use that membership credential to access the reporting tool in a way where the system knows they're a member but doesn't know who they are. This is achieved using zero-knowledge proof technology.</p><p>A member of ET-ISAC receives a credential, which they can use to create a QR code in a wallet on their phone. They can then scan that QR code to gain access to the site and report an incident anonymously.</p><p>It's a unique use case that demonstrates the versatility of <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.identity.foundation">verifiable credentials</a> and zero-knowledge proofs in solving real-world problems.</p><p>What use cases for decentralized identity have you found to be particularly impactful or promising?</p><p>Our current focus is on KYC (Know Your Customer) and biometrics companies. We see this as a market that's ready for innovation, especially with regulations like <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/eidas-2?ref=blog.identity.foundation">eIDAS 2.0</a> and mDL coming into play. We can make their verification checks portable, which is what <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/reusable-kyc?ref=blog.identity.foundation">reusable KYC</a> is all about.</p><p>There's a good value transfer throughout the KYC process:</p>  Companies can make their verifications portable and generate new revenue streams.  Individuals get more control over their data and can short-circuit painful onboarding processes.  Relying parties (verifiers) don't have to start from scratch and can benefit from previous verification checks.  <p>Beyond that, I'm excited about Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM). Many large corporations, especially in the US, have different divisions that often act as separate entities. Regulations sometimes prevent them from sharing information about individuals across these divisions. This leads to tremendous pain for both the company and the individual.</p><p>Imagine if they could give individuals control over their information, allowing them to consent and decide what they want to release to another business unit within the same corporation. This could solve many problems for large companies and enable individuals to manage their own information seamlessly.</p><p>The challenge with CIAM is that it's a slow-moving, risk-averse industry. They're just getting used to passkeys, so introducing verifiable credentials and different applications for managing those credentials might take some time. However, the potential is enormous, and I'm excited to see what happens in the next year or two.</p>

   Issuer permissions are the mechanism that Velocity Network introduces to enable relying parties (and wallets) to determine if an issuer is an authoritative source for a particular credential. After requesting the ability to issue on the Network, the request is reviewed by Velocity Network to ensure that the issuing service parameters are within the remit of the organization’s business activities.

<p>This white paper is intended for ISRM and IT staff tasked with deploying and maintaining multi-factor authentication (MFA) sign-in processes.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>Many enterprises aiming to secure their workforces have deployed SMS and application-based one-time passcodes (OTPs) as an additional factor of authentication to passwords. This whitepaper is aimed at these organizations that are now considering a move to FIDO authentication with passkeys. While this whitepaper focuses on OTPs specifically, the discussion and recommendations can be generalized to any system using phishable second factors including application-based OTP and push notifications.</p>



<p>This whitepaper compares OTPs as an additional authentication factor to passwords and passkeys in terms of security, user experience and ease of deployment. And it provides general guidance about migrating from OTPs to passkeys in order to improve user experience while strengthening the organization’s overall security posture. The guidance within this paper will cover key steps for moving towards passkeys, including planning, use case identification and documentation, pilot considerations, as well as deployment and training guidance. This document targets low-assurance use cases, including internal authentication, external authentication and third party and B2B authentication strategies. Given that organizations typically implement OTPs as the second factor to passwords, for this document all references to OTPs should be assumed as being used as a second factor to passwords.</p>



<p>This document will not cover specific vendor technologies or implementations. For guidance on moderate or high assurance use cases please refer to additional <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">whitepapers published by the FIDO Alliance</a> [1]. As this document is a part of a series of whitepapers, it is recommended that the reader start with the <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/June-26-FIDO-EDWG-Spring-2023_Paper-1_Introduction-FINAL.docx.pdf">introductory document</a> [2].</p>

 2. OTP MFA vs Passkeys: Why Choose Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys offer several benefits to security, user experience, and ease of deployment when compared to OTPs.</p>



<p>2.1 Security </p>



<p>OTP-based MFA has been widely adopted to mitigate the risk of credential stuffing and reuse. SMS and authenticator application-based OTP are the most commonly deployed solutions due to their relative low-cost and ease of deployment across a broad set of users and use cases. The relative simplicity of this type of MFA, however, leaves it vulnerable to social engineering and many MFA bypass toolkits, because no bidirectional communication exists between the secrets generator and the validating identity provider (IDP), meaning that an OTP can be intercepted and used by a third party without the knowledge of the end user or IDP.</p>



<p>Additionally, OTP-based MFA requires trust in a device that an organization may not manage nor have visibility into its security posture. This means that organizations are relying on end-users to maintain the security of their own device and their ability to discern phishing attempts. While user training can help to address some of these attacks, historic guidance like checking for secure connections and familiar URLs, still relies on an ever-vigilant user base.</p>



<p>Passkeys provide phishing-resistant, replay-resistant sign-ins that reduce the cognitive load on users and strengthen organizations’ overall security posture. This is achieved because passkeys implement a cryptographic challenge-response protocol scoped to the relying party’s domain. The authenticators then rely on secure behaviors, like biometric proofs or PINS to unlock the credentials on the authenticator while retaining a user-friendly experience. With passkeys, an organization can have a strong first-factor of authentication for passwordless scenarios OR a strong second factor for traditional MFA workflows.</p>



<p>2.2 User Experience</p>



 
 Passkeys improve the user experience over passwords and OTPs in several ways, including: 



 Passkeys work even when there is poor cell coverage whereas SMS OTPs require mobile network connectivity. For example, a user can have wireless access on an airplane but are not permitted to use SMS. In this instance, the SMS OTP cannot be delivered whereas passkeys can be used to authenticate. 



 <a href="https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#autofill-ui">AutoFill UI</a> enables seamless integration within browsers on mobile devices and on desktops. 



 <a href="https://resources.yubico.com/53ZDUYE6/at/6r45gck4rfvbrspjxwrmcsr/Forrester_Report_Total_Economic_Impact_of_Yubico_YubiKeys.pdf?format=pdf">Up to four times faster login</a>, no need to wait for code delivery [3] 



 Protection against mis-keyed passwords and codes 



 Passkeys build on common behaviors for authentication like biometric proofs (face or fingerprint). 
 



<p>2.3 Ease of Deployment</p>



<p>For some micro, small, and medium sized businesses without large, dedicated support staff, end-user deployment of dedicated<br>authentication hardware tokens can create roadblocks. This includes both OTP hardware tokens or FIDO security Keys. Historically, the ease of deployment of SMS/App based OTPs made them a more favorable option. Procurement, logistics, and configuration are a constant battle fought by operations and IT teams. With updates to the FIDO2 ecosystem to expand the authenticator landscape, this problem is alleviated and allows the use of many different devices as passkey stores.</p>



 
 All of this comes together to mean that the deployment of passkeys is much easier and less costly compared to SMS OTP for a few reasons: 



 There is no SMS integration required. Enterprises will not need to configure or maintain interfaces with mobile carriers or third-party SMS vendors which reduces deployment complexity. 



 Enterprises will not have to pay per-transaction fees associated with SMS OTP therefore reducing the total cost of ownership for authentication. 



 FIDO authentication uses passkeys. Passkeys are simple to implement across a range of devices and applications. 



 SMS OTP rely on carrier-specific APIs or third-party vendor APIs that are not standardized which increases risk of vendor lock-in and lack of interoperability. 



 No time-synchronization is needed. Passkeys avoid the time-synchronization requirements of SMS time-bound OTPs (TOTPs). Codes don’t need to be entered within a short time window, and deliverability issues with SMS do not result in login failures. 
 



<p>FIDO authentication with passkeys has been embraced by operating system (OS) and browser providers. This existing OS support from most major vendors means that, in most cases, existing hardware in the enterprise, such as laptops, phones, and tables, can be leveraged to deploy FIDO with passkeys without costly updates and replacements.</p>



<p>In some cases, enterprises use shared, single user devices such as iPads. For these use cases, a passkey stored in the integrated platform authenticator may not be appropriate, since any user of the device has access to the credential. In these cases, organizations should use roaming authenticators (hardware security keys) to generate and store passkeys for use on the shared device. This offers the same ease of use and convenience. Keep in mind, there may be an additional cost to purchase and manage these hardware keys for users. In many cases using hardware keys there may be a need to issue users a second hardware key as a backup to reduce the risk of the user being locked out of their account(s).</p>



 3. Deployment Strategy for Migration from OTP to Passkeys 



<p>3.1 Identifying the Deployment Model</p>



<p>Planning for a successful passkey deployment requires organizations to consider the needs of the user and the computing devices they use in their role to maximize the utility of passkeys for staff. At a minimum, organizations should consider the following questions when planning a passkey deployment in order to make passkeys accessible to the broadest audience possible:</p>



 
 What kind of computing devices are used? 



 Are your users working on laptops or desktop computers? Mobile devices? Tablets? 



 Are the devices single user devices or multi-user (e.g., shared) devices? 



 Are the devices provisioned by the company or are users using their own personal devices at work? 



 Are there limitations on using USB ports, Bluetooth, or NFC? 



 Are there limitations on access to the internet? 



 Are your users commonly wearing gloves or masks which limit the use of on-device biometrics? 
 



<p>Based on the answers to the previous questions, organizations can choose one of a few types of authenticators to store user’s passkeys. The flexibility of passkeys means that organizations can mix and match as their security posture and UX needs dictate. Other documents in this series go into more detail on each type of authenticator.</p>



<p>3.2 Deployment Testing</p>



<p>After determining the deployment model and deploying a FIDO server with applications integrated, it is recommended that organizations use pilot groups to test registration, authentication, and recovery processes (see below) with users. Then use the feedback from the pilot to improve processes and address issues raised by the pilot population before embarking on a broad rollout of passkeys.</p>



 3.3 User Experience 



<p>3.3.1 Registration</p>



<p>Enterprises should implement a reliable registration process to ensure that users are correctly and securely associated with their passkeys, as stated in earlier FIDO whitepapers. The registration experience is critical to consider because it is a user’s first interaction with passkeys. Here are a few elements to consider when it comes to designing the registration experience:</p>



 
 Identity Proofing – Physically or remotely having the user prove their identity at the start of the registration process is recommended to ensure a strong, abuse resistant process. This may involve SMS OTP for the final time. 



 Self-service registration – Users use their existing credentials to bootstrap a new passkey. 



 Supervised registration – work with IT/helpdesk for registration. This reduces the risk associated with self-service models that are vulnerable to phishing the original creds. 



 Pre-provisioned credentials – high effort, high assurance, but a mechanism is needed to get the credential into the user’s hands. 



 Remote users – self-service or pre-provisioned, but a mechanism is needed to provide the PIN to the user to unlock the device the first time. 
 



<p>3.3.2 Sign-In</p>



<p>The first step in designing a FIDO deployment with passkeys is to understand the user base, common work paradigms, and available devices – phones, tablets, laptops, desktops. This step is critical because enabling user-friendly workflows that work with the user’s existing devices is core to developing a successful rollout.</p>



<p>Common users’ environments and equivalent suggestions include:</p>



 
 Environments with users who primarily operate on mobile devices or tablets – Look into built-in unlock capabilities. 



 Mixed device environments or environments that rely on a variety of SaaS tools – Leverage SSO provided by IDP or build flexible login workflows. 



 Shared accounts – FIDO RPs can be configured to allow for more than one credential to be associated with a login. Investigate<br>cross device hybrid authentication or roaming authenticators. 
 



<p>3.3.3 Recovery</p>



<p>Any authentication process is only as strong as its weakest point, which is why recovery processes have often been abused by attackers to compromise systems. Synced passkeys are durable credentials that can survive device loss and unintentional wiping by restoring from a passkey provider and reduce the need to perform account recovery to establish new credentials for the user. With passkeys, users are expected to lose their credentials less frequently. However, there may be cases where passkeys, or access to the passkeys, is lost, thus requiring account recovery.</p>



<p>For passkey implementations utilizing device-bound passkeys that cannot be backed up or recovered, account recovery should be performed using the backup authentication method, such as using a backup authenticator, to bootstrap enrollment of a new authenticator. In the event that a backup authentication mechanism is not available, organizations must provide alternative pathways to recovery. Organizations should take a risk-based approach to designing and implementing account recovery systems. The specific implementation details will vary widely depending upon organizational requirements. In general, recovery mechanisms should never depend on weaker factors than the credential that the user is trying to recover. In the case where passkeys need to be re-registered, organizations should design mechanisms, either automated or manual, to prevent the use of passkeys no longer registered to that user.</p>



<p>For passkey implementations where synchronized passkeys are used, be sure to document the bootstrapping/enrolment process for new devices as well as building a risk averse process (including identity proofing) for full provider account recovery or replacement. While these catastrophic events should be low, it may still be necessary to have users go through this process. Knowing the proper process ahead of time will insulate organizations against manipulations and stop work events.</p>



<p>For additional considerations around account recovery, please see the FIDO Alliance’s <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FIDO_Account_Recovery_Best_Practices-1.pdf">Recommended Account Recovery Practices for FIDO Relying Parties</a>. [5]</p>



<p>3.4 Admin Considerations:</p>



<p>Monitoring of implementation and adoption metrics are critical to ensuring the success of the deployment and ensuring that the security benefits of FIDO authentication with passkeys is realized. Below are recommendations for metrics and processes that are indicative of the success of enterprise passkey migrations.</p>



<p>3.4.1 Monitoring and Visibility into Utilization</p>



<p>Admins are strongly encouraged to use groups or other segmentation structures to allow graceful transition of subsets of users and applications to passkeys. Pilot populations should be carefully constructed and should be composed of a variety of end user types and levels in the organization. Monitoring the usage of items below, both before and after the migration, will provide critical insights into the effectiveness of the program and guide important adjustments.</p>



 
 Device enrollment:
 
 How long did it take the user to enroll their first device? 
 
 



 Security events:
 
 Where was the device at time of onboarding? 



 What, if any, identity proofing approaches were used to ensure that the correct user was onboarded? 



 If manager, IT support, or peer approval workflows were used, who provided attestation? 



 Are there any time of day or device location anomalies that did not previously exist? 
 
 



 User authentication:
 
 Was the user able to successfully authenticate? 



 Are there any observable changes in their daily authentication patterns that would suggest problems or added friction? 



 Does analysis of day-of-week and time-of-day suggest any issues? 
 
 



 Key management:
 
 Are keys being used as expected and only from known devices? Some authenticators support device attestation which provides key provenance and assurance of the identity of the authenticator. If the source of the passkey is an important security control for your implementation, be sure to verify if your chosen authenticator solution supports this kind of attestation. 



 How many keys are associated with an individual’s account? Normal guidance would be to expect the number of passkeys associated with a user’s account to be close to the number of devices that a user leverages. For example, if your users use Android phones &amp; Windows laptops then you should expect to see two to three passkeys associated with a users’ account, one stored on each platform authenticator, and possibly one backup from a security key. In this scenario if an account had five to six passkeys registered, then it would be time to investigate and potentially remove excessive keys. Every organization’s definition of excessive may vary, and should be defined based on observations from their environment. Additionally, depending on your deployment, consider the number of applications that you have enabled for passkey authentication. If you deployed passkeys as credentials for an SSO integration, your users may only have one passkey per device. If you deployed passkeys on an application-specific basis, there may be one passkey per device per application. Organizations are recommended to monitor the number of keys associated with each user and use this data as context for informing passkey management. 
 
 



 Whose keys are associated with administrative/service/break-glass accounts? In the same way that it is best practice to segregate administrative access from normal user access, generating a separate set of passkeys for administrative accounts is also recommended. If they are shared, be sure to include rotation, monitoring, and good cleanup practices. 



 How will passkeys be removed?If an employee leaves the company or moves into a different role, their accounts should be disabled, deleted, or access should be evaluated and vetted. In situations where this is not reasonable due to legal requirements, passkeys should be promptly removed to prevent unauthorized account access as part of the disablement process. Similarly, if a user reports a device missing or stolen, any passkeys associated with those devices should also be removed. 



 Compatibility assurance:
 
 Do any combinations of applications and endpoint platforms show unusual changes or decline in authentication events? 



 Are all invocation methods for passkey authentication continuously functioning, including after upgrades? 
 
 
 



 Next Steps: Get Started Today 



 
 Enterprise organizations should consider migrating to FIDO authentication where possible. 



 Use FIDO standards. 



 Think about what your relying parties are supporting as well as your own enterprise security requirements. 



 Passkeys are far more secure than traditional OTP mechanisms. 



 Passkeys are far more secure than passwords. Look for the passkey icon on websites and applications that support passkeys.

<p>By Eric Drury</p>



<p>If you’re in the digital trust space, like me you might be encouraged by the number and variety of inspiring developments—appearing on an almost weekly basis—which illustrate the momentum that responsible technology is gaining in the drive towards a more trustworthy and sustainable future.</p>



<p>One of the latest and more interesting initiatives comes—yet again—from the Kingdom of Bhutan in the form of <a href="https://gmc.bt/">Gelephu Mindfulness City</a> (GMC). GMC is the Kingdom’s unique version of a smart city. They call it a Special Administrative Region, integrating economic growth with mindfulness, holistic living, and sustainability.</p>



<p>How does digital trust fit into GMC?</p>



<p>In October of last year, Bhutan launched the world’s first self-sovereign national digital identity system, <a href="https://www.bhutanndi.com/">Bhutan NDI</a>. And as a pillar of digital public infrastructure (DPI), a digital identity system forms the basis for trusted interactions between individuals, government, and business.</p>



<p>The NDI system, which Bhutan is currently rolling out nation-wide, will be part of the core infrastructure that provides cutting-edge digital connectivity for GMC. As such, this is an exciting opportunity to further cement the viability of emerging SSI and other trust technologies for implementation at population scale.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP is proud to have contributed to Bhutan’s NDI system both formally and informally.</p>



<p>Drummond Reed, one of ToIP’s founding board members, provided inspiration—and a road map of sorts—for the development of SSI systems via the book he co-authored called ‘<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity – Decentralized Digital Identity and Verifiable Credentials</a>’. Drummond and other ToIP members also provided expertise and input for Bhutan’s National Digital Identity Act, the <a href="https://parliament.bt/uploads/topics/16920885498838.pdf">NDI Act of Bhutan</a>, relying heavily on the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/02/01/the-toip-foundation-releases-its-first-official-governance-specifications/">ToIP governance metamodel</a> which was developed by the ToIP’s Governance Stack Working Group led by Scott Perry.</p>



<p>For an in-depth case study on the Bhutan NDI program, refer to <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Case-Study-Bhutan-NDI-National-Digital-Identity-ToIP-Digital-Trust-Ecosystems-V1.0-2024-05-21.ext_.pdf">Bhutan NDI, Digital Trust Ecosystem</a>, written by DHI’s Pallavi Sharma and Eric Drury, co-chair of ToIP’s Ecosystem Foundry Working Group.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP and Gelephu Mindfulness City further align in that both espouse the intertwining of governance and technology as a core enabler of digital trust.</p>



 
 From a governance perspective, GMC blends robust policies that ‘build trust and accountability with mindful incentives designed to empower both residents and businesses alike to reach their fullest potential’. 



 From a technology perspective, Gelephu Mindfulness City will be built on a foundation of ‘world-class infrastructure seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art technology with sustainable practices’. 
 



<p>In support of GMC, the Kingdom is convening the first <a href="https://www.bhutan-innovation-forum.org/">Bhutan Innovation Forum</a> (BIF), a global initiative uniting international leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs to support Bhutan’s vision of a Mindfulness City.</p>



<p>The BIF takes place in less than two weeks, October 1-3, 2024. ToIP members Drummond Reed and Eric Drury are honored to be invited to attend, representing the ToIP community and continuing the engagement with Bhutan’s digital trust community.</p>



<p>Drummond and Eric will appear on panels to promote the principles of digital trust and will share their experience and expertise on all things digital trust, including the emergence of cross-border digital trust networks.</p>



<p>ToIP is thrilled to once again walk the path with Bhutan towards a more sustainable, trustworthy, and equitable digital future. We look forward to sharing our learnings after the Forum so that the entire digital trust community benefits.</p>

  <p>As we enter the second half of 2024, a time full of global digital governance initiatives, we're excited to share our progress at the Human Colossus Foundation from the governance perspective. This update encapsulates the recent strides of the Swiss E-ID, G20 Digital Public Infrastructure, UN Development Program, and the inaugural event for European Digital Independence.</p> Distributed Governance  Progress update <p>In the summer of 2023, the Human Colossus Foundation published Part 1 of the HCF Distributed Governance Model<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.07280">[1]</a>. The model, though abstract in concept, tackles governance through the lens of the Principal-Agent problem. The core idea is to view information systems (i.e. technology) as agents serving users (i.e. humans) -whether individuals, businesses or any sovereign organisation with a decision power.&nbsp;</p>





















  
  














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                

            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>In today's hyper connected digital society, we lose control over information. It has become challenging to know what happens to the data we share and even more difficult to assess the accuracy of the data we use. Part 1 addressed this need for control and accuracy by introducing a governance framework integrating digital technology with existing (non-digital) frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>While Part 1 lays the conceptual foundation, Part 2 turns theory into action. By collaborating directly with the key players in digital transformation across various sectors, we are building the technology stack that will demonstrate the crucial role of data authenticity and integrity in shaping a digital governance model. This practical approach is a prerequisite to our future work on AI governance for example.</p><p>Therefore, Part 2 develops a concept into a reality we shape through multiple projects. We are well underway and excited to share the progress here.</p> <br>Switzerland’s E-ID - a Sovereign Digital Legal Identity

  <p>Sep.10 -Bern The Swiss parliament's high chamber (States Council) agreed to the design principles of the Swiss E-ID by a clear 43 against 1 vote<a href="https://www.parlament.ch/de/services/news/Seiten/2024/20240910100146714194158159026_bsd059.aspx">[2]</a>. Together with the low chamber (National Council), they will iron out the remaining differences and pave the way for parliamentary approval in 2024. This agreement further confirms the readiness of the legislative basis for introducing the Swiss E-ID<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-politics/parliament-gets-closer-to-finalising-new-digital-id-scheme/87522181">[3]</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>HCF Contribution: Digital independence requires technological independence. The Human Colossus develops an Open-Source distributed technology stack to implement applications based on a distributed governance model. Creating these technologies and making them accessible to everyone requires developing an ecosystem of tools to harmonise data across multiple stakeholders (possibly millions) and ensure interoperability across different jurisdictions. The Foundation is creating some of these tools as part of the digital healthcare <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136962">NextGen EU Horizon project[6]</a> with funding from the EU, Switzerland and UK to integrate sensitive health data (including genomics) in personalised medicine for cardiology. <a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/heart-patients-set-to-receive-treatment-tailored-to-their-genetic-and-health-inf">The press release of the European Society of Cardiology provides more information [7]</a>.</p>

  <p>HCF Contribution: In 2023, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) published a <a href="https://www.governance4id.org">Legal Digital Entity Framework[7]</a>. Within that framework, UNDP develops the model governance assessment for data exchanges that respect the country's (i.e. sovereign entities) existing governance and fundamental Human Rights principles. The Human Colossus Foundation is part of a UNDP Advisory Board that provides its expertise in developing this work.</p>





















  
  



 


   Current Work at the Foundation: <p>The above initiatives provide input for the continuous development of the core HCF technologies. They help to demonstrate the essential relevance of accurate data for digital governance. From a governance perspective, we can summarise them as follows:</p>  <p>The 'Ambient Infrastructure' is a reputation-based authentication system built upon the decentralised key management infrastructure KERI (Key Events Log Receipts Infrastructure). Launched in 2023 as part of the <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/decentralized-key-management-infrastructure-for-ssi-by-the-human-colossus-foundation/">EU Horizon 2020 eSSIF-Lab project[9]</a>, the Ambient Infrastructure is now advancing in NextGen, an EU Horizon project focused on personalised cardiovascular medicine.</p>  <p><a href="https://oca.colossi.network">Version 2.0 of the OCA specification[4]</a>  supporting the OCA ecosystem. Decentralised semantics architectures are significant developments for digital governance to&nbsp; ensure the respect of different sovereign digital governance.</p>  <p>OCA Ecosystem v1.0. Community based solutions and tooling including extensions (i.e. overlays not part of the core specification). The Human Colossus Research and Technology Councils have open a dedicated focus group to collect community requirements.</p>  <p>This ecosystem, featuring a suite of tools and protocols, ensures consistent and interoperable&nbsp; data flows across multiple stakeholders and jurisdictions.</p> Conclusion <p>The Human Colossus Foundation has a busy autumn ahead. If you would like to help map a distributed governance framework into real-world applications, the HCF Research Council invites you to join its new Focus Group.</p><p>Joining this group will provide you with the opportunity to work closely with our team, share your expertise, and help shape the future of digital governance.

 Part 3: Identifying leverage&nbsp;points <p>This is the third in a series of posts about Systems Thinking, an approach that helps us make sense of complex situations by considering the whole system rather than just the individual pieces from which it is constituted.</p><p>This series is made up&nbsp;of:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-51d6e4f9df0b">Part 1: Three Key Principles</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-77eb29d510a4">Part 2: Understanding Feedback&nbsp;Loops</a>  Part 3: Identifying Leverage Points (this&nbsp;post)  <p>In the first post, we laid the groundwork by exploring the foundational principles of Systems Thinking. We then explored feedback loops in the second post, examining how they drive system behaviour and contribute to stability or&nbsp;change.</p><p>In this concluding post, we turn our attention to Leverage Points — those critical areas within a system where a small shift can lead to profound changes. By understanding and identifying these points, you can uncover powerful opportunities for intervention, allowing you to drive meaningful and lasting change within complex&nbsp;systems.</p> 1. What are leverage&nbsp;points? <p>“When we must deal with problems, we instinctively refuse to try the way that leads through darkness and obscurity. We wish to hear only of unequivocal results, and completely forget that these results can only be brought about when we have ventured into and emerged again from the darkness.” — Carl&nbsp;Jung</p><p>Leverage points are specific areas within a system where a small change can produce a significant impact on the entire system. These points often require careful analysis and a deep understanding of the system’s structure and behaviour, as they are not always immediately obvious. Identifying leverage points can be challenging because they are often hidden beneath the surface of the system’s visible components.</p><p>For example, in the world of technology, offering short, simple, clear (e.g. no legalese) ‘Terms and Conditions’ might be a leverage point. By helping users understand exactly how your organisation uses their data, you might improve customer satisfaction, increase trust, and reduce misunderstandings — all by making it easy for people to understand your company’s policy on&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Leverage points, therefore, offer a way to create meaningful change by focusing on areas where even minimal effort can lead to substantial results. Recognising these points requires stepping back and viewing the system holistically, understanding not just the individual parts but how they interact and influence each&nbsp;other.</p> 2. The role of paradigms in leverage&nbsp;points <p>“Inquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole.” — John&nbsp;Dewey</p><p>Paradigms are the underlying beliefs and assumptions that shape how we understand and interact with a system. These paradigms represent some of the most powerful leverage points, as changing a paradigm can fundamentally alter the way a system operates. Shifting these beliefs requires questioning what is often taken for granted and being open to new perspectives.</p><p>To go back to our Terms and Conditions example, a paradigm shift from prioritising user convenience to emphasising data privacy can serve as a transformative leverage point. Traditionally, many tech companies have focused on creating products that are easy to use, often at the expense of data privacy. However, as the paradigm shifts towards valuing privacy, we see significant changes in how technologies are designed and deployed.</p><p>This shift has been significantly driven by policy changes, such as the implementation of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR has forced companies to rethink how they collect, store, and manage user data, prioritising privacy by design. As a result, this new perspective has encouraged the development of more secure products, the adoption of stricter data management practices, and an overall increase in consumer trust. The influence of GDPR illustrates how policy can drive paradigm shifts, leading to widespread changes not just in product development but also in corporate strategies, legal frameworks, and consumer expectations. This example demonstrates the profound impact that changing a paradigm, supported by regulatory measures, can have on an entire&nbsp;system.</p><p>By addressing paradigms, especially through supportive policies, you are working at the root of the system’s behaviour. Changing the underlying beliefs that drive a system can lead to widespread and lasting change, making paradigm shifts one of the most effective leverage points in Systems Thinking.</p> 3. Small, incremental changes as leverage&nbsp;points <p>“Of any stopping place in life, it is good to ask whether it will be a good place from which to go on as well as a good place to remain.” — Mary Catherine Bateson</p><p>Small, well-placed actions can serve as powerful leverage points within a system. These might involve slight adjustments in policy, processes, or resource allocation. The key is to identify where these small changes can have a disproportionately large impact, leading to significant shifts in the system without the need for extensive interventions.</p><p>For example, in the context of data privacy, implementing a small but strategic change, such as requiring explicit user consent for data sharing, can have a profound impact. A great example of this is the introduction of GDPR-compliant consent forms across digital platforms in the EU. This seemingly minor policy change has led to a significant increase in user awareness and control over their personal data, contributing to greater trust in online services. The increased transparency and control have demonstrated how a small, well-placed policy change can lead to substantial benefits for both users and organisations, highlighting the power of incremental changes at the right leverage&nbsp;points.</p><p>The success of such small interventions lies in their ability to trigger widespread behavioural changes without the need for drastic overhauls. By carefully identifying and implementing these changes, we can achieve meaningful and lasting impacts across various&nbsp;systems.</p> 4. Communication as a leverage&nbsp;point <p>“We are changed not only by being talked to but also by hearing ourselves talk to others, which is one way of talking to ourselves. More exactly, we are changed by making explicit what we suppose to have been awaiting expression a moment before.” — Geoffrey&nbsp;Vickers</p><p>Communication within a system can serve as a crucial leverage point. The way information is shared and understood can significantly influence the system’s behaviour, impacting everything from decision-making processes to overall system efficiency. Improving communication channels, ensuring transparency, and making sure all stakeholders are heard can lead to more effective decision-making and positive outcomes.</p><p>For instance, in our work at We Are Open Co-op, practicing open communication and transparency is central to our project management approach. By sharing progress, challenges, and decision-making processes openly with all stakeholders, we foster a culture of trust and collaboration. This openness extends to how we handle privacy; by being transparent about how we collect, use, and protect data, we build confidence among our partners and clients. Implementing tools that enable open documentation and communication, such as public repositories or shared workspaces, not only keeps everyone informed but also reinforces accountability and integrity in our practices. This small adjustment in how information is shared and protected can lead to significant improvements in project outcomes, ensuring that tasks are completed effectively while respecting privacy concerns.</p><p>The power of communication as a leverage point lies in its ability to unify and align the various components of a system. By enhancing the flow of information and ensuring that all voices are heard, you can create a more cohesive, responsive, and effective system.</p> 5. Feedback Loops as Leverage&nbsp;Points <p>“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think.” — Gregory&nbsp;Bateson</p><p>Feedback loops, as discussed in the second post, can also act as leverage points within a system. By altering how these loops operate, you can influence the system’s overall behaviour. Identifying and adjusting these loops — whether reinforcing (positive) or balancing (negative) — can be a powerful way to steer the system toward desired outcomes.</p><p>For example, in the context of data privacy, feedback loops between user behaviour and data management practices can be effectively leveraged to enhance privacy protection. By providing users with real-time feedback on how their data is being used and giving them the ability to adjust their privacy settings, you create a positive feedback loop. As users become more aware of how their data is handled, they are often motivated to take greater control over their privacy settings. This increased control leads to further trust in the platform, encouraging users to engage more actively with privacy tools. Over time, this feedback loop can significantly strengthen overall data protection practices, leading to better compliance with regulations and higher user satisfaction.</p><p>This example highlights how adjusting feedback loops can lead to substantial changes in system behaviour with relatively simple interventions. By strategically modifying these loops, you can achieve desired outcomes more effectively and sustainably.</p> Conclusion <p>Leverage points offer powerful opportunities to influence complex systems with relatively small, strategic actions. By identifying where these points lie and understanding how to use them effectively, you can create meaningful and lasting change within any system. Whether you are looking to improve organisational processes, drive social change, or enhance personal decision-making, the principles of Systems Thinking can help you navigate complexity with greater clarity and&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>This post, along with the previous two in this series, provides an introduction to the foundational principles of Systems Thinking and their practical applications. These insights are drawn from my studies toward an MSc in Systems Thinking in Practice through the Open University, and they are just the beginning of what Systems Thinking can&nbsp;offer.</p><p>If you’re interested in applying these principles to your work, We Are Open Co-op is here to help you implement effective systemic interventions tailored to your unique challenges. Thank you for following this series — your journey into Systems Thinking doesn’t have to end here. Continue to explore, apply, and refine these concepts, and watch how they can transform the way you approach complex problems.</p> References   Ackoff, R.L. (1974).

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of IndyKite?</p>



<p>Backed by leading venture firms and based in San Francisco, IndyKite is building a new category of data management and digital identity services by capturing, connecting and controlling data across the enterprise and surrounding ecosystem. With an identity-centric approach to data, IndyKite enables companies to achieve higher trust in their data products, AI and applications with enhanced visibility, data governance and granular access controls. Leveraging knowledge graph technology and machine learning, IndyKite delivers a powerful operational data layer to enable developers with flexible APIs through a growing open-source ecosystem. Learn more at [www.indykite.com](http://www.indykite.com/)</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Digital identity is a core enabler of applications and services and will only become more important in the future. Digital identity not only applies to humans, but also to all devices, applications, systems, AI, digital products and even individual data points. Securing these identities is paramount, but even more important, is understanding how they drive and enable user experience, functionality and data mobility across the organization. At IndyKite, we see digital identity as the starting point for enabling businesses to build modern solutions, deliver incredible customer experiences and ensure trustworthy AI.</p>

<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Modern organizations around the world are undermined by siloed data and disconnected identities. The advent of AI tools is increasing pressure for leaders to address data challenges in the organization to ensure future viability. IndyKite enables organizations to capture, connect and control their data in a flexible and dynamic way, to drive better decisions, security, machine learning and AI and solve challenges.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada holds a place of global influence as a leading voice in many sectors. By pioneering a secure and accessible digital identity framework, Canada has ensured the sustainability of its modern economy into the future and created a blueprint for other nations to follow.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>As digital identity is a an essential part of the future, it needs modern approaches and frameworks that enable innovation, without being restricted by legacy thinking. DIACC is an ideal forum for public and private sector leaders to discuss, design and accelerate these approaches to ensure digital trust into the future.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Powered by graph technology, the IndyKite platform increases visibility, trust and control of your data. This enables data pipelines to get the right data, to the right place and in the right context to drive enhanced product development and new revenue channels. It also enables the secure sharing of data beyond the bounds of your organization, and better customer journeys with native identity workflows.

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation is at the forefront of innovating standards and technologies for decentralized digital identity. Today, we're excited to announce the launch of two new work items within our <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>, aimed at improving the functionality and security of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Markus Sabadello</a>, Founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://danubetech.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DanubeTech</a>, DIF Steering Committee member, and Co-Chair of the ID &amp; Discovery WG, emphasizes the importance of these new initiatives: </p><blockquote>"The I&amp;D WG recognizes that identifiers will always be the foundation of any digital identity system. For this reason, I am excited about the two latest work items in our working group - DID Traits and Trust DID Web. Both will be extraordinarily useful in our continued quest to build strong and useful identifier systems that other technologies and protocols can rely on."</blockquote> DID Traits <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcebersbach/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">JC Ebersbach</a>, CEO of <a href="https://identinet.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">identinet GmbH</a> and newly-added Co-Chair of the ID &amp; Discovery WG, initiated the <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-traits/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Traits work item</a>. DID Traits focuses on helping implementers choose the most appropriate DID method for their specific use cases.</p><p>Key aspects of the DID Traits work item include:</p>  Identifying and defining key traits of identifiers that have proven significant  Providing a JSON schema for DID method authors to present their method's characteristics in a structured, machine-readable format  Enabling third-party systems, such as DID resolvers, to utilize this structured information effectively  <p>The DID Traits work builds upon existing literature and specifications in the field, aiming to streamline the process of DID method selection and implementation.</p><p>JC shares his motivation behind the DID Traits initiative:</p><blockquote>"The introduction of Trust DID Web (did:tdw) at IIW 39 inspired me to initiate the DID Traits work item. I’m thrilled that both initiatives have been adopted by the ID &amp; Discovery working group. My aim is to provide implementers with simple, practical tools that will lead to more widespread integration of Self-Sovereign Identity technologies. With DID Traits, we aim to simplify the process of selecting the most appropriate DID method for specific use cases, making adoption easier and more effective."</blockquote> Trust DID Web <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-w-curran/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Stephen Curran</a>, Founder of <a href="https://cloudcompass.ca/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Cloud Compass Computing</a> and Chair of the <a href="https://sovrin.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Sovrin Foundation</a> Board of Trustees, leads the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Trust DID Web work item</a>. This initiative introduces the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:tdw method specification</a> as an enhancement to the existing <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:web method</a>. </p><p>Key features of Trust DID Web DIDs include:</p>  Ongoing publication of all DID Document versions  A verifiable chain of updates from genesis to deactivation  Self-certifying identifiers for DIDs, enabling portability  Signed proofs for DID Document updates  Optional mechanisms for pre-rotation keys and collaborating witnesses  Standardized DID URL path handling  A "/whois" path for returning a verifiable presentation about the DID  <p>Trust DID Web aims to provide greater trust and security while maintaining the simplicity of did:web, fostering a more trusted and secure web environment for decentralized digital identities.</p><p>Stephen Curran explains the goals of the Trust DID Web initiative:</p><blockquote>"I’m happy to lead the new Trust DID Web (did:tdw) initiative at DIF. Our goal is to enhance did:web with important security and verifiability features from the world of ledger-based DIDs, while keeping the simplicity that makes web-based DIDs so accessible. These improvements are designed to boost trust and security without adding complexity. We think that did:tdw provides a solid foundation for decentralized digital identities that are secure and easy to deploy for a variety of applications."</blockquote> Join Us <p>We invite everyone to join us in these exciting new initiatives. As Markus Sabadello notes, "We welcome anyone to our working group who would like to contribute to these new work items, or propose any other identifier-related topic."</p><p>Both meetings are bi-weekly:</p>  DID Traits on Tuesdays at 8:00 Pacific / 17:00 Central Europe  Trust DID Web on Thursdays at 9:00 Pacific / 18:00 Central Europe  <p>To participate in these and other DIF work items:</p><p>👉 <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Join DIF</a><br>📆 Subscribe to the <a href="http://bit.ly/dif-calendar?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Calendar</a><br>📧 Contact <a href="mailto:membership@identity.foundation">membership@identity.foundation</a> with questions</p><p>Stay tuned for updates as we progress with these important work items that will shape the future of decentralized identity.</p>

 What to Do When Your User Research Project Starts to Veer Off&nbsp;Course <p>User research is a journey, and like any journey, it doesn’t always go exactly as planned. We’ve written previously about <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/demystifying-user-research-e345d309abab">starting your own user research journey</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/key-questions-for-user-research-design-5edfab6046dd">questions to ask</a> that can help get you off on the right&nbsp;foot.</p><p>Sometimes though, despite all best intentions and diligent planning with your chosen selection of <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/pre-mortem/">pre-mortems</a>, checklists, Gantt charts, or Kanban boards, a user research project can still go off&nbsp;course.</p><p>There are many reasons why this might happen, and many may seem well beyond your control. In this post, we’ll share some strategies we’ve found helpful in regaining momentum and getting a project back on&nbsp;track.</p> Common Issues in User&nbsp;Research cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a><p>Before we explore solutions, it’s important to recognise some of the issues that can derail a user research&nbsp;project.</p>  Unclear Objectives<br>Without a clear understanding of what you want to find out, your project can quickly lose focus. For example, if you’re researching a digital tool’s usability but haven’t defined whether you’re focusing on ease of navigation, visual design, or performance, you may end up collecting feedback that’s too broad or irrelevant. This can lead to scattered efforts and data that doesn’t fully answer the questions you initially set out to explore. Clarity in your objectives also helps you stay within scope — after all, projects that become too complex or overly broad can be difficult to&nbsp;manage.  Recruitment Challenges<br>Finding the right participants is crucial, but sometimes, despite your best efforts, recruitment doesn’t go as planned. You may find that a particular community or demographic is underrepresented or face difficulty finding enough respondents due to limited access or poor engagement. This can delay your project and result in a participant pool that’s not as diverse or representative as it needs to&nbsp;be.  External Dependencies<br>Often, research projects rely on external factors like stakeholder input, third-party data, or collaboration with other teams. For example, you could be relying on receiving data from a partner organisation or feedback from a legal team before being able to proceed. When these dependencies fall through, your project can come to a standstill.   Strategies to Get Back on&nbsp;Track cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a><p>Now that we’ve identified some common issues, let’s look at how you can regain momentum and steer your project back on&nbsp;course.</p>  Revisit and Refine Objectives<br>If your project is losing direction, it might be time to revisit your initial objectives. What is the overarching research question you’re trying to answer? Is your objective still relevant? Do they need to be refined based on what you’ve learned so far? Narrowing or reaffirming your focus can help streamline your efforts and ensure that the data you collect is meaningful and actionable.  Simplify Your Scope<br>If you’ve taken on more than you can manage, don’t hesitate to simplify your project’s scope. Focus on the most critical questions and the areas that will have the greatest impact. It’s better to complete a smaller, focused project successfully than to stretch resources too thin across a larger, unfocused one.  Adapt Your Recruitment Approach<br>When recruitment isn’t going as planned, consider adapting your approach. If your initial outreach didn’t yield the desired results, explore alternative channels or adjust your criteria. Techniques like reaching out through community organisations or leveraging existing networks can help you connect with a broader range of participants while maintaining diversity and inclusivity.  Adjust Your Methods<br>If certain methods aren’t yielding results, be flexible and try different approaches. For example, if individual interviews aren’t providing the depth of insight you need, consider adding focus groups? The ability to adjust and adapt is a strength in user research.  Communicate and Realign with Stakeholders<br>If external dependencies are causing delays, clear communication is key. Communicate with stakeholders regularly to identify any roadblocks and realign expectations. Perhaps your pre-mortem <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/pre-mortem/">foresaw some of the issues that have emerged and have a plan to mitigate already in place</a>? Sometimes, simply clarifying timelines or adjusting deadlines can help get things moving&nbsp;again.  Refresh the Team<br>If a project is dragging on and fatigue is setting in, prioritise tasks based on their impact and feasibility. Reassign team members or bring in extra help if possible. Sometimes, a fresh perspective or additional hands can help push through bottlenecks.   Staying Resilient: Embrace the Learning&nbsp;Process cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a><p>Remember, setbacks and challenges in user research are not uncommon, especially when working to include a wide range of voices and experiences. Each obstacle offers an opportunity to learn, grow, and improve your approach. By staying resilient, being flexible, and maintaining clear and empathetic communication, you can navigate difficulties and ensure that your research is both inclusive and impactful.</p><p>Ultimately, the ability to adapt and respond thoughtfully to challenges is what strengthens your user research and makes it more effective. Every project, even those that face hurdles, contributes valuable lessons that can be applied to future work. Embrace these lessons, and use them to enhance your research practices, ensuring that all voices are heard and&nbsp;valued.</p><p>Need help?

<p>OASIS and the OpenC2 TC are pleased to announce that OpenC2 Actuator Profile for Packet Filtering Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>OpenC2 is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems, and systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms, or other aspects of the implementation. This specification defines an Actuator profile for Packet Filtering (PF). Packet filtering is a cyber defense mechanism that denies or allows traffic based on static or dynamic properties. The Actuator profile collects Actions, Targets, Arguments, and Specifiers along with conformance clauses to enable the operation of OpenC2 Producers and Consumers in the context of PF.&nbsp;&nbsp;The documents and all related files are available here:<br></p>

<p>Most of us today are accustomed to unlocking our smartphones with a simple glance or touch. In the blink of the tech industry’s eye, biometric authentication has quickly become a normal part of our daily lives.</p>



<p>Consumers love the convenience and security of biometrics, which has helped propel its growth and mainstream adoption. In the FIDO Alliance’s last global <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/barometer-2023/">barometer survey</a>, biometrics ranked top as the most secure and the preferred way to log in by consumers.</p>



<p>But for biometrics to continue its success, there is a reputation issue and ‘elephant in the room’ that is holding back consumers, governments, and other implementers alike from full trust and confidence: bias.</p>



 Are biometric technologies biased? 



<p>Concerns have been circulating for some time about the accuracy of biometric systems in processing diverse demographics. In the UK in 2021, for example, Uber drivers from diverse ethnic backgrounds took <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/ex-uber-driver-takes-legal-action-over-racist-face-recognition-software">legal action</a> over claims its software had illegally terminated their contracts as its software was unable to recognize them.</p>



<p>In the FIDO Alliance’s recent study, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/remote-identity-verification-biometric-systems-consumer-insights-2024">Remote ID Verification – Bringing Confidence to Biometric Systems Consumer Insights 2024</a>, consumers made clear that they are concerned about bias in biometric facial verification systems.</p>



<p>While over half of respondents indicated they believe face biometrics can accurately identify individuals (56%), others in the survey report a different experience.&nbsp;</p>







<p>A quarter of respondents felt they had been discriminated against by biometric face verification systems (25%).</p>







<p>Organizations like NIST have been closely<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software"> monitoring</a> the disparities in bias performance for some time – with NIST’s most recent <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_demographics.html">evaluation</a> ​​of solutions across different demographics released this year. The headline is: Not all biometric systems are created equal.</p>



<p>As face verification has become adopted globally, the accuracy in identifying diverse demographics has gone from weakness to strength, with most leading solutions today operating with extremely small margins of error. However, less sophisticated solutions do exist and are perpetuating a far bigger reputational and adoption challenge.</p>



 Inclusivity and accessibility in remote identity 



<p>Inclusivity is just one part of the problem. Bias impacts the entire user experience and erodes faith in the technology overall. Half of American and British consumers in the survey said they would <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-addresses-accuracy-bias-in-remote-biometric-identity-verification-technologies-industry-first-testing-certification-program/">lose trust</a> in a brand or institution if it were found to have a biased biometric system, and 22% would stop using the service entirely.</p>







<p>Remote identity solutions unlock huge benefits for governments, organizations, and consumers alike. Consider already how many more scenarios where we are asked to prove who we are virtually today – starting a new job, opening a bank account, signing legal documents. And, as outlined earlier, we know consumers already love using biometrics – 48% of those we surveyed preferred biometrics to enroll and verify themselves remotely.</p>



<p>However, the excitement of more remote identity solutions is understandably mixed with these bias concerns, causing some organizations to delay or reconsider implementation. We’re in an age where digital inclusivity is highly scrutinized, especially for public services, and governments are increasingly calling for a way to demonstrate equity.</p>



<p>Equitable biometrics systems are both a practical and a moral imperative. So how do we get there?&nbsp;</p>



 Addressing bias in biometric systems 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a> program, with mitigating bias as a key priority. It assesses a face verification system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender, in addition to far more wide-reaching security and&nbsp; performance tests.</p>



 Why is independent certification for biometrics important? 



<p>Currently, testing levels are completed on a case-by-case basis, per organization. This means it’s expensive and time-consuming, and what ‘good’ looks like varies widely. The FIDO Alliance’s program is based on proven ISO standards and has been developed by a diverse, international panel of industry, government, and subject matter experts. This means it is unrivaled in its ability to set equitable performance benchmarks.</p>



<p>More broadly, certification and independent global testing catalyze innovation and technological adoption. Whether launching an identity verification solution or including it in related regulations, open standards and certification set a clear performance benchmark. It removes considerable duplicated efforts, improves the confidence of all stakeholders, and ultimately drives up the performance of all solutions on the market.</p>



 How is bias evaluated? 



<p>At this time, the FIDO Alliance program considers false reject rate (FRR) for bias, using FRR methodology, and is measured at the transaction level across skin tone, age, and gender. ISO 19795-10 has multiple options for measuring differential performance. One option is described in the Section: Reporting differential performance against a benchmark (Section 7.4.2). In this approach, testers seek to compare the performance of one or more demographic groups to a specific benchmark. FIDO has chosen this approach given the small sample size of the individual groups (50+ per group). For skin tone, groups are defined and distributed across three brackets based on the Monk Scale. For gender, groups are defined and distributed across male, female, and other. For age, groups are defined and evenly distributed across four age brackets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benchmarks are set at 6% (95% confidence interval), based on bootstrapping simulations. These simulations covered a spectrum of scenarios, population sizes, correlation between attempts. The benchmark chosen reduces the probability that a group will be considered different when it actually is not, i.e., finding a difference by chance (&lt;5%).</p>



 What is the value of certification for Biometric Vendors? 



 
 Independent validation of biometric performance 



 Opportunity to understand gaps in product performance to then improve and align with market demands 



 Demonstrate product performance to potential customers&nbsp; 



 Improve market adoption by holding an industry-trusted certification 



 Leverage one certification for many customers/relying parties&nbsp; 



 Benefit from FIDO delta and derivative certifications for minor updates and extendability to vendor customers 



 Reduce need to repeatedly participate in vendor bake-offs 
 



 What is the value of certification for Relying Parties? 



 
 One-of-a-kind, independent, third-party validation of biometric performance assessing accuracy, fairness and robustness against spoofing attacks 



 Provides a consistent, independent comparison of vendor products – eliminating the burden of maintaining own program for evaluating biometric products 



 Accelerates FIDO adoption to password-less 



 Commitment to ensure quality products for customers of the relying parties&nbsp; 



 Requirements developed by a diverse, international group of stakeholders from industry, government, and subject matter experts 



 Conforms to ISO 



 FIDO Annex published in ISO standards 
 



 What is the value of certification with FIDO accredited laboratories? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/laboratory-overview/">FIDO Accredited Laboratories</a> are available worldwide and follow a common set of requirements and rigorous evaluation processes, defined by the FIDO Alliance Biometrics Working Group (BWG) and follow all relevant ISO standards. These laboratories are audited and trained by the FIDO Biometric Secretariat to ensure lab testing methodologies are compliant and utilize governance mechanisms per FIDO requirements. Laboratories perform biometric evaluations in alignment with audited FIDO accreditation processes. In contrast, bespoke, single laboratory biometric evaluations may not garner sufficient trust from relying parties for authentication and remote identity verification use cases.</p>

 Part 2: Understanding Feedback&nbsp;Loops <p>This is the second post in a series exploring the fundamentals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">Systems Thinking</a>. This is an approach that helps us make sense of complex situations by considering the whole system rather than just its individual parts.</p><p>This series is made up&nbsp;of:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-51d6e4f9df0b">Part 1: Three Key Principles</a>  Part 2: Understanding Feedback Loops (this&nbsp;post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-8af6844edacd">Part 3: Identifying Leverage&nbsp;Points</a>  <p>In the first post, we explored the foundational principles of Systems Thinking: Drawing a Boundary, Multiple Perspectives, and Holistic Thinking. Now, we’ll build on that foundation by examining Feedback Loops, another crucial concept in Systems Thinking.</p><p>Feedback loops are essential for understanding how systems behave, adapt, and evolve over time. By mastering the dynamics of feedback loops, you can identify how small changes can ripple through a system, leading to significant outcomes, whether intended or unintended.</p> 1. What are feedback&nbsp;loops? <p>“You think that because you understand ‘one’ that you must therefore understand ‘two’ because one and one makes two. But you forget that you must also understand ‘and.’” — Donella&nbsp;Meadows</p><p>Feedback loops are the mechanisms by which systems regulate themselves. They can either reinforce a particular behaviour (positive feedback) or counteract it to maintain stability (negative feedback). Understanding these loops helps us see how systems respond to internal and external changes, leading to growth, adaptation, or stability.</p><p>For instance, a classic example of a negative feedback loop is a thermostat regulating room temperature. When the temperature rises above the set point, the thermostat turns off the heating. When the temperature drops below the set point, the thermostat turns the heating back on. This loop maintains the room’s temperature within a desired range, counteracting any deviations. The thermostat example clearly demonstrates how negative feedback loops work to maintain stability within a system, bringing it back to a set equilibrium when it deviates.</p><p>On the other hand, social media platforms often rely on positive feedback loops to increase user engagement. When a user interacts with content, the platform’s algorithm shows more similar content, increasing the likelihood of further engagement. This creates a reinforcing cycle where user behaviour drives more of the same behaviour, leading to increased overall engagement. This example illustrates how positive feedback loops can amplify behaviours, sometimes leading to rapid growth or creating echo chambers where only certain types of content are repeatedly reinforced.</p><p>Feedback loops are crucial for identifying how systems behave over time, which ties back to the principles we discussed in the first post, particularly the importance of considering Holistic Thinking.</p> 2. Negative feedback&nbsp;loops <p>“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think.” — Gregory&nbsp;Bateson</p><p>Negative feedback loops work to stabilise a system by counteracting changes. These loops are vital for maintaining equilibrium and preventing a system from spiralling out of&nbsp;control.</p><p>For example, in economics, the supply and demand mechanism operates as a negative feedback loop. When the supply of a product exceeds demand, prices tend to fall, which in turn reduces supply as producers cut back on production. Conversely, when demand exceeds supply, prices rise, encouraging increased production. This self-regulating process helps to stabilise markets by bringing supply and demand into equilibrium, preventing extreme fluctuations in prices and availability.</p><p>It’s important to understand that in the context of Systems Thinking, “negative” doesn’t imply something bad or undesirable. Instead, it refers to the type of feedback that counteracts changes, helping to stabilise a system and maintain equilibrium. Negative feedback loops are essential for preventing systems from spiralling out of control, ensuring they remain balanced and functional.</p> 3. Positive feedback&nbsp;loops <p>“The only thing harder than starting something new is stopping something old.” — Russell&nbsp;Ackoff</p><p>Positive feedback loops amplify changes in a system, often leading to exponential growth or decline. These loops are self-reinforcing, meaning that as a particular change occurs, it triggers more of the same change, leading to potentially dramatic&nbsp;effects.</p><p>For example, in the context of climate change, positive feedback loops play a significant role in accelerating global warming. One such loop involves the melting of polar ice. As the ice melts, less sunlight is reflected back into space, and more heat is absorbed by the Earth’s surface, which in turn leads to further ice melt. This self-reinforcing loop accelerates the warming of the planet, contributing to increasingly severe climate&nbsp;impacts.</p><p>Again, it’s important to note that a “positive” feedback loop doesn’t necessarily have morally beneficial consequences — rather, it refers to the amplifying nature of the loop itself, which can drive both beneficial and harmful&nbsp;changes.</p> 4. The interaction of Feedback Loops in&nbsp;Systems <p>“The purpose of a system is what it does.” — Stafford&nbsp;Beer</p><p>In most systems, positive and negative feedback loops do not operate in isolation; they interact with each other, creating complex and dynamic behaviours. This interaction can make systems resilient, allowing them to adapt to changes and maintain stability, or it can make them vulnerable, leading to oscillations, chaotic behaviour, or even collapse if not properly managed. Understanding how these loops interplay is crucial for effective system management and intervention.</p><p>In product management, the balance between feature usage and product complexity is shaped by the interaction of feedback loops. When a feature is widely used and appreciated, customer satisfaction increases, leading the product team to enhance or expand the feature (positive feedback). As the feature becomes more complex, it may introduce usability issues, decreasing customer satisfaction (negative feedback). This interaction helps maintain a balance within the product, ensuring it continues to meet customer needs without becoming overly complicated.</p><p>A similar interplay of feedback loops occurs when managing product adjustments. Increasing customer satisfaction through positive feedback can prompt further enhancements, which might initially appear beneficial. Yet, if these enhancements lead to excessive complexity, they may cause usability issues, frustrating users and resulting in negative feedback. This process highlights the delicate balance product managers must maintain to keep their product both innovative and user-friendly, illustrating the challenges of managing feedback loops in product development.</p><p>By recognising and analysing these interactions, systems thinkers can identify points of leverage where interventions can either reinforce desirable behaviours or counteract negative trends, leading to more stable and resilient systems.</p> 5. Recognising feedback loops in your&nbsp;work <p>“Taking action to improve a problematical situation will of course itself change that situation, so that the learning cycle could in principle begin again.” — Peter Checkland</p><p>Identifying and understanding feedback loops in your work or organisational context can be a game-changer. These loops are often the invisible threads that weave through processes, projects, and relationships, dictating outcomes and driving behaviours. By recognising these loops, you can gain a deeper understanding of the forces at play and make more informed decisions that lead to sustainable success.</p><p>Get started identifying feedback&nbsp;loops:</p>  Think of an area in your work where specific actions lead to similar&nbsp;outcomes  Identify the underlying feedback mechanism — is it positive or negative or are multiple loops at&nbsp;play?  Make adjustments to one part of the system and observe how the system&nbsp;changes  <p>Here’s an&nbsp;example:</p>  When our team meets a deadline, team morale improves and I’ve noticed that we often meet our deadlines with the same enthusiasm  This is a positive feedback loop — success breeds further&nbsp;success.  Figure out what works, and further incentivise it.  <p>Conversely:</p>  When our team misses a deadline, we tend to become stressed leading to further&nbsp;delays.  This is a negative feedback loop — the more stressed we are, the more we miss our deadlines.  We need a win, let’s deprioritise X and focus on Y because it’s an easier task. Then we’ll come back to X when team morale is improved.  <p>Recognising these loops allows you to take proactive steps. If you identify a positive feedback loop that is driving beneficial outcomes, consider how you might reinforce or expand this loop. Perhaps you could introduce additional incentives or recognition programs to further enhance the team’s motivation and productivity. On the other hand, if you uncover a negative feedback loop that is leading to undesirable results, it’s crucial to intervene early. For example, introducing stress management resources or adjusting timelines could help break the cycle and restore&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Feedback loops are not limited to project management; they are pervasive in all areas of work, from customer service to organisational culture. In customer service, a positive feedback loop might occur when excellent service leads to customer satisfaction, which in turn results in positive reviews and repeat business. Recognising this loop could lead to further investments in training and support for customer service teams. In organisational culture, a feedback loop could exist where open communication leads to trust, which fosters more open communication, creating a virtuous cycle of collaboration and innovation.</p><p>By consciously identifying and managing these loops, you can transform potential challenges into opportunities for growth and continuous improvement. This approach not only helps in achieving immediate goals but also contributes to the long-term resilience and adaptability of your organisation.</p> Conclusion <p>Feedback loops are a fundamental aspect of Systems Thinking, providing crucial insights into how systems evolve, adapt, and maintain stability. By identifying and analysing these loops, we gain the ability to predict the outcomes of our actions more accurately and craft interventions that are not only effective but sustainable.</p><p>At We Are Open Co-op, we specialise in applying Systems Thinking principles, including the detailed analysis of feedback loops, to help organisations navigate and resolve complex challenges. Whether you’re looking to enhance organisational processes, improve project outcomes, or foster better relationships within your team, understanding feedback loops can be transformative.</p><p>If you’re curious about how feedback loops influence your work or how Systems Thinking can be integrated into your approach, we’re here to help.

<p>By LunarCrush and OriginTrail</p><p>In the rapidly evolving world of tech and finance, the demand for innovation and adaptability is higher than ever, driven by a quest for transparency for internet users. <a href="https://lunarcrush.com/">LunarCrush</a> has been at the forefront of Social Intelligence, converting human-driven insights into actionable information for both retail and institutional stakeholders. Originally focusing on the crypto industry, LunarCrush’s Social Intelligence now extends across diverse sectors such as technology, politics, travel, music, and more. Recognizing the convergence of crypto, the Internet, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), LunarCrush is making a significant leap forward in their transparency efforts through social intelligence. By launching the Social Intelligence Paranet on the <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)</a>, LunarCrush aims to enhance content collection through incentivized crowdsourcing and enable the creation of AI-powered services on this trusted knowledge base.</p> The Decentralized Knowledge Graph and the Social Intelligence Paranet <p>The Social Intelligence Paranet will operate on the OriginTrail DKG, a permissionless peer-to-peer network that ensures all social content published to the Paranet is discoverable, verifiable, and attributed to its owners. This setup allows AI services leveraging this knowledge base to avoid challenges like hallucinations, managed bias, and intellectual property violations. For an in-depth understanding of the technical design of paranets, DKG, and decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG), we recommend reviewing the <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">OriginTrail Whitepaper</a>.</p> The Social Intelligence Paranet Initiative <p>Aligned with LunarCrush’s growth trajectory, the Social Intelligence Paranet will initially target the crypto sector, attracting high-quality content creators and community members from various crypto projects. LunarCrush will also mine knowledge tied to their social insights, such as Alt Rank, Top Creators, and Sentiment analysis. Beyond knowledge mining, the Social Intelligence Paranet will feature the first AI-powered tool to interact with top knowledge assets on the Paranet, supported by LunarCrush. This AI-powered tool will be accessible to users paying with BUZ tokens. All BUZ tokens spent by users will be recycled as additional rewards for knowledge mining.</p><p>In the upcoming weeks, a comprehensive proposal for the Social Intelligence Paranet will be submitted to the <a href="https://docs.neuroweb.ai/">NeuroWeb</a> community for approval. The proposal will&nbsp;include:</p><p>- Knowledge Assets created from LunarCrush APIs</p><p>- An incentives model for knowledge miners targeting the first category of knowledge</p><p>- A demo of the LunarCrush AI&nbsp;tool</p> Advancing the Wisdom of the&nbsp;Crowds <p>The traditional wisdom of the crowds concept eliminates idiosyncratic noise associated with individual judgment by averaging a large number of responses. Social Intelligence takes this concept further by unlocking actionable information through high-quality, curated knowledge enhanced with specific domain expertise. The rise of AI introduces the potential for another leap forward in extracting wisdom from a vast body of knowledge. Incentivized crowdsourcing to collect superior social content provides an ideal foundation for AI services to uncover wisdom that is not immediately apparent. While a conversational tool is the initial step, subsequent developments will include AI agents performing comprehensive tasks such as market analysis and prediction market suggestions. As the Social Intelligence Paranet expands beyond the crypto field, it promises to support enhanced decision-making powered by the wisdom of the crowds across various&nbsp;topics.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/growing-the-buz-economy-announcing-the-social-intelligence-paranet-launch-5d7ca6f056e5">Growing the Buz Economy: Announcing the Social Intelligence Paranet Launch</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Abstract 



<p>Enterprises should consider using passkeys, especially if they are currently relying on passwords. By replacing these credentials with passkeys, enterprises will immediately reduce the risk of phishing and eliminate credential reuse, improving authentication service security. Different types of FIDO authenticators may be used to meet users’ needs with a balance between convenience and security. For enterprises that require high levels of identity assurance, internal security policies, or regulatory requirements, additional scrutiny is needed to determine the appropriate type of passkey. It is important to look at both the enterprise as a whole, as well as parts of the organization because high assurance requirements may not apply to the entire enterprise.</p>



<p>For many high assurance scenarios, attested device-bound passkeys may be more desirable. Relying parties with high assurance requirements will need to decide whether to accept all types of authenticators and adapt their authentication flow based on the attestation characteristics or reject registrations from unattested or unacceptable authenticators at the risk of a poor user experience.</p>



 Audience 



<p>This white paper is intended for IT administrators and enterprise security architects who are considering deploying FIDO authentication across their enterprises and defining life cycle management policies. This paper provides an overview of the different use cases for multi-factor authentication MFA and the FIDO Authenticator choices available to administrators. The intent is to help guide administrators in choosing the right authenticator types for their specific environment. Companies requiring higher levels of security, such as those involved in healthcare, government organizations, or financial institutions that have a hard requirement around the control of the credential, in particular should read this white paper.</p>



<p>It is assumed that the reader has an understanding of FIDO architecture, relying parties, protocols, and has read “FIDO EDWG 2023 Papers – Introduction” that introduces key concepts used in this white paper.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>This document focuses on deploying passkeys for enterprise users in high assurance environments.<br>Readers can find an introduction to the series of papers here. The introductory whitepaper provides additional descriptions and links to all papers in the series, which cover an array of use cases from low to high assurance. Most enterprises will likely have use cases that span more than one of these papers, and readers are encouraged to review the white papers relevant to their deployment environment.</p>



<p>This white paper examines what it means to be in a high assurance environment and how that may influence how FIDO is used. More specifically, the document addresses the challenges with password-only authentication and proposes passkeys as a stronger, phishing-resistant alternative to using passwords to authenticate users. Additionally, the document provides some adoption considerations for IT and security professionals to consider to ensure compliance with regulatory and security requirements for high assurance authentication scenarios. This white paper examines the use cases of registering a device, using a registered device, and dealing with recovering a lost device.</p>



<p>A key part in deciding if a passkey should be allowed in an environment is based on attestations. Attestations can be provided for credentials as part of the registration process, which relying parties can trust as provenance of the authenticator being used. For high assurance enterprise scenarios, attestations should always be requested. What can be discovered from the attestation associated with the credential, or the absence of any attestation, can help drive policy decisions about whether to accept the registration. Without any attestation, it may be difficult for the relying party to decide if the credential should be allowed. They may reject the registration outright, making for a poor user experience, or the enterprise may choose to employ additional, conditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) along with FIDO authentication to meet the high assurance requirements. With an attestation, the enterprise has assurances about the provenance, manufacture type, certifications, and features of the authenticator and often can rely on these assurances as MFA devices, providing multiple factors like credentials and a PIN to unlock the authenticator.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys work well in many use cases and can still work for some high assurance scenarios, depending on the security or regulatory requirements of the enterprise. Synced passkeys are attractive because of their recoverability and ease of use; however, they also change where credentials reside and who controls them. Given this external control of the credentials, some additional MFA may be desired for synced passkeys where the enterprise has control of the lifecycle management of the MFA method.</p>



<p>The remainder of this white paper will examine enterprises or organizations that have high assurance requirements based on Authenticator Assurance Levels [7] and FIDO Certified Authenticator Levels [8] to operate.</p>

 2. Passkey Use Cases 



<p>This section will focus on use cases around passkeys in an enterprise or an organization. There are many use cases for enterprises where synced passkeys work very well for ease and convenience in registering devices, using devices, and recovering lost devices since the credentials are available on other devices. It is highly recommended that organizations look at all the benefits of synced passkeys to determine if they are appropriate for the organization. However, the use of synced passkeys, while convenient, may not meet all the security requirements for an enterprise or organization needing high assurance (e.g., AAL3 requirements). AAL3 level has several requirements with the most significant being the use of a hardware-based authenticator. Please refer to NIST for more detail on the different levels of Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL) [7]. Quite often, AAL3 applies to companies and organizations requiring higher levels of security, such as those involved in healthcare, government, or finance, which have a hard requirement around the control of the credential, specifically, that it is device-bound and never copied.</p>



<p>2.1. Registration<br>The enterprise or organization should first consider what device(s) they will support in their environment and how they will manage the provisioning of devices. For example, an organization may support an environment where users can bring their own device (e.g., mobile phone), or an organization may have very strict requirements around issued devices that meet specific security requirements such as PIN length, particular user presence features, or even specific hardware models. Finally, organizations need to consider whether they will allow passkeys to reside on multiple devices or just a single device. This has both security and recovery implications that need to be considered.</p>



<p>Organizations may have use cases that require credentials to be device-bound and not copyable at all, in which case synced passkeys are not recommended. Organizations may choose to allow synced passkeys alongside traditional MFA mechanisms, replacing the password with a passkey. However, if the organization has strict requirements for where the credentials can reside, they should look closely at restricting use to device-bound passkeys. These factors will decide how organizations manage registration. All these cases put some added burden on the relying party if types of passkeys need to be restricted.</p>



<p>The relying party may need to check if some requirements are met during the registration process, such as requiring an authenticator that meets or exceeds the FIDO L1+ certification [8]. To assess the authenticator’s compliance with these requirements, the authenticator must provide an attestation that can be validated and examined. If an authenticator does not meet the requirements of L1+ then, the relying party may be forced to reject the registration since nothing can be proven about the provenance of the credential, or the party may consider an implementation with additional MFA to meet the requirements of high assurance.</p>



<p>If an attestation is provided, the relying party can check what type of device it is and if it meets the requirements of the enterprise or organization. The relying party may also want to restrict based on the unique identifier for the authenticator, provided an attestation is available. The unique identifier, known as an Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier (AAGUID), can be used to look up the details against the FIDO Alliance Metadata Service [2] to understand what type of device is being registered, the certification level, and what features it provides.</p>



<p>Enterprise Attestation is another form of attestation that can be leveraged during registration. This is implemented by some authenticator vendors to add additional information that is unique to the organization. Including this additional information as part of the attestation and narrowing allowed authenticators can be used to further enhance the registration experience.</p>



<p>Similarly, there may be flags about whether the credential is eligible for backup and/or if it has been backed up. These flags cannot be trusted, however, without some attestation that the device is certified. A relying party might decide to allow or deny the registration based on this information as well as other information provided at runtime.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if the relying party fails the registration of a credential, it forces the user to repeat the registration process again with a different authenticator at step one. Although WebAuthn [5] does not support a preflight mechanism to identify suitable authenticators, relying parties may provide feedback to the user before registration to identify acceptable authenticators. Additional guidance can be provided after failed registration to guide the user’s choice of authenticator. This guidance should be explicit and identify why the authenticator was rejected during registration, which authenticators meet the RP’s requirements, and guidance on managing browser-mandated optionality on communicating attestations.</p>



<p>Relying parties should be able to be more prescriptive in describing requirements of authenticators, allowing for a much better user experience where the end user can only select authenticators that meet the requirements and remove this burden from relying parties. These changes have been proposed to WebAuthn, but they have not yet gathered the support of platform vendors.</p>



<p>Another approach for enterprises might be not to offer any registration use case exposed to the end user. Instead, the enterprise would manage the lifecycle of registering the devices before they are provisioned to users. Similarly, the enterprise might provide some form of supervised registration experience to ensure only authorized authenticators are provisioned and registered. This avoids a number of pitfalls with the user experience mentioned above but puts more lifecycle management burden on the enterprise.</p>



<p>2.2. Sign In<br>Once a credential has been registered, FIDO credentials can be accessed when needed at authentication. The application(s) will leverage the WebAuthn browser API or platform passkey APIs to perform a FIDO authentication using a registered device. Depending on the type of registered device, there will be multiple factors involved in the authentication, like the entering of a PIN or a user presence challenge. The requirement for these interactions is there is a high level of assurance that the user is who they say they are, and they are not impersonating any user. These requirements need to be enforced during the registration process to ensure devices are allowed to meet the requirements of the enterprise or organization.</p>



<p>The only difference in this use case between synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys is what needs to be authenticated. For device-bound passkeys, the original hardware device used during the registration process is needed. Synced passkeys may be accessed from multiple devices that have access to an account hosted by a passkey provider. Furthermore, some synced passkeys may be shared after registration. Relying parties do not have a mechanism for identifying shared credentials in the current specifications, making it harder to understand and manage the lifecycle of synced passkeys.</p>



<p>There are several enterprise use cases covered in the white paper on “Choosing FIDO Authenticators for Enterprise Use Cases” [4]. Organizations should review these to evaluate how FIDO is leveraged. In particular, an organization planning to rely on FIDO as a first factor (passwordless) or a second factor is a key decision, and the white paper may help organizations understand what truly requires high assurance. For example, there may be a specific project, or a use case may apply to an entire industry driven by government or regulatory requirements. Employees might be allowed to use a synced passkey to access a laptop for example, but then need to use a device-bound passkey to sign in to a specific application restricted to certain employees with a particular clearance level.</p>



<p>2.3. Recovery/Lost Device<br>Recovery is where a synced passkey shines. If one loses a FIDO device that holds a credential, they can just access the credential from a different device that shares the same platform account. This is convenient, but also means that a passkey is only as secure as the platform account with which it is associated. Enterprises should examine the vendor solutions to understand how secure it is before relying on a service external to the organization. For example, does it provide end-to-end encryption with keys that are not known to the vendor? What additional measures like MFA are used to secure the user’s account? What process is used for account recovery? End users may not be concerned about such matters, but these details may represent a security concern for the organization’s security administrators. The organization’s security requirements need to be examined to see if an external party can store and manage credentials. Furthermore, without requiring attestations, the relying party has no idea who or what is the issuer of a credential—whether it be the platform, a roaming authenticator, a browser plug-in, or something else. As a result, the relying party cannot provide any guidance as to how to recover access to the credentials while providing high assurance. An alternative form of account recovery external to recovering the FIDO credential would be needed to verify the identity of the user and issue a new device and credentials. Finally, the recovery of a passkey from a provider when using synced is not known to the relying party. This represents a potential attack that the enterprise is unaware of.</p>



<p>For device-bound passkeys, the recovery process is more involved and will likely require the involvement of a help desk [6] to issue a new device and possibly revoke access for the old device. This is a security-first approach over convenience that allows an enterprise or organization to control who has devices. It does mean there are additional steps needed for the end user before they can regain access. However, this gives enterprises more control over the lifecycle of the credentials, allowing enterprises to revoke or expire authenticators at any point and be able to guarantee that credentials are not copied or do not exist outside enterprise controls. Some enterprises have solved this by provisioning multiple devices so users can self-recover. Ultimately, there is a business decision to be made regarding recovery models. In some cases, it may be appropriate to block access until the user can receive a new device, taking loss of productivity over a lower security model. The extra burden highlighted in the registration step if an enterprise chooses to manage the registration experience has a direct impact on the recovery/replacement experience.</p>



<p>2.4. Unregistering<br>At some point an employee will either leave a project or the enterprise overall. The enterprise will want to be sure they have control over credentials and unregister their use so access is no longer possible. This is a bigger consideration when it comes to synced passkeys where the enterprise does not have full control of the lifecycle and management of the credentials. If synced passkeys require additional MFA, the enterprise can control the MFA aspect, expiring the factors involved so authentications no longer are allowed. Device-bound passkey environments have much more control over unregistering devices, either by physically handing in a device and knowing no copies were made, or invalidating/expiring the device so subsequent authentication attempts fail.</p>



<p>The credential lifecycle requires the ability to disable or remove a credential, whether due to a change in status of an employee, such as a leave of absence or separation from the organization, or due to the potential loss or compromise of a credential. Passkeys differ from passwords in these instances since the user may have multiple passkeys registered with the relying party, as opposed to passwords, where the user is expected to only have one password per relying party. In the case of a permanent separation between the user and enterprise, disabling the user account and/or rotating the credential in the service is standard practice to ensure the user is no longer able to authenticate. If the separation is temporary, such as for leave of absence, enterprises may choose to rotate all the user’s credentials or disable the user account until the user returns.</p>



<p>In the case of credential loss, the next steps are dependent upon the deployment scenario. Users with device-bound passkeys who lose their security key should have the credential revoked by the service. Synced passkeys create additional challenges. If the device has been compromised, all credentials resident on the device, including those resident in different passkey providers, should be treated as compromised and revoked by the RP. If the user’s passkey provider account has been compromised, the impacted credential(s) stored with the provider must be revoked. To facilitate revocation in these scenarios, RPs should allow credentials to be named or otherwise identified by the user during registration to facilitate the revocation of specific credentials where possible. Administrative controls must narrow their focus on eliminating credentials from the RP rather than removing the credential private key material from either hardware security keys or a passkey provider’s sync fabric, which may not be possible.</p>



 3. Deployment Strategy 



<p>In a high assurance environment, the enterprise is likely going to want to manage the distribution and retirement of all authenticators. Device-bound passkeys would be managed by IT and provisioned to individuals. Relying parties would need to check for attestations and only allow the registration of authenticators that are managed by the enterprise or organization. If attestations are absent or do not meet the security requirements, the registration should fail. Processes should be established to manage the pool of authenticators to ensure they are retired when individuals leave or no longer require high-level access. Lastly, the organization or enterprise should define what the process looks like for recovering lost/stolen devices. Depending on how critical the access is to the continuity of the business, multiple hardware devices might be issued for a given individual to ensure they always have access.</p>



 4. Conclusion 



<p>There is no argument that passkeys are a strong phishing-resistant alternative option to traditional passwords. In an enterprise environment, it is important to look at security and regulatory requirements to determine if synced passkeys work, or if there are stricter constraints such as internal security policies, regulatory, or compliance requirements that require the use of device-bound passkeys. With either approach, enterprises should spend the time to understand how registration, management, and recovery of FIDO credentials will be managed. This includes important use cases like storage of credentials (external), recovery of lost credentials, and unregistering devices when employees leave. Based on the requirements of the enterprise, passkeys may work without any customizations, or enterprises may need to invest to ensure their authentication experience is more managed and filtered to specific devices.</p>



 5. Next Steps: Get Started Today 



 
 Use FIDO standards. 



 Think about what your relying parties are supporting and consider your enterprise security requirements. 



 Passkeys are far more secure than passwords. Look for the passkey icon on websites and applications that support it.

 Abstract 



<p>The intent of this whitepaper is to provide guidance for organizations as they analyze the abilities and features of both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to determine how both credential types can be utilized in a moderate assurance environment. In this paper, the term “moderate assurance” refers to an environment or organization where the legal, regulatory, and security requirements are flexible enough to allow for the use of both types of credentials, using synced passkeys to replace passwords and multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for standard user accounts and device-bound passkeys for user accounts that require the highest level of protection and assurance. The paper is designed to provide a comparison of features and requirements that are supported by device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys, providing a vision of how both types of credentials can be utilized together in an organization that has moderate assurance needs.</p>



 Audience 



<p>This white paper is one in a series of white papers intended for anyone who is considering deploying FIDO Authentication across their organization, including IT administrators, enterprise security architects, and executives.</p>



<p>Readers can find an introduction to the series of papers <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">here</a>. The introductory white paper provides additional descriptions and links to all papers in the series, covering an array of use cases from low to high assurance. We expect that most enterprises will have use cases that span more than one of these papers and encourage readers to review the white papers that are relevant to their deployment requirements.</p>



<p>The white paper assumes that the reader has a foundational understanding of FIDO2 credentials and the role they play in the<br>authentication process; introductory information on FIDO2 can be found here: <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 – FIDO Alliance</a>.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>The initial implementations of FIDO2 credentials were created as device-bound passkeys on either a roaming authenticator or platform authenticator, where the private key of the credential is stored on the device’s authenticator and not allowed to be exported, copied, backed up, or synchronized from the authenticator. This configuration presents a very secure and phishing-resistant solution for authentication that gives relying parties (e.g., web sites or service providers), a very high level of confidence that the user and the device are legitimate users of the system. With this high level of assurance, however, comes some challenges – primarily regarding usability and account recovery. For example, because there is no way to get the private key off the authenticator, if the device the private key is stored on becomes lost or damaged, then access to the resources that key authenticated would be lost. With device-bound passkeys, the solution is to register a second device-bound passkey with every relying party. This creates a more difficult user experience as the user would be required to register both authenticators. This is somewhat reduced for organizations that have consolidated their authentication flow by using an identity provider (IdP) to federate access to their applications, as the relying party is then the IdP itself.</p>



<p>To solve these challenges, in May 2022 Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced their intent to support synced passkeys in their operating systems. Synced passkeys have many of the same characteristics of device-bound passkeys, including the continued use of private and public key pairs. One significant difference, however, is that synced passkeys allow for the private key of the credential to be synchronized to other devices the user owns that exist in the same vendor’s synchronization fabric ecosystem (e.g., iCloud in the Apple ecosystem). Synced passkeys also allow for the creation of a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. All passkeys share several common security properties, are highly phishing resistant, and use unique key pairs to enable strong authentication. However, it is also important to note the difference between synced and device-bound passkeys. For example, synced passkeys introduce new security considerations when analyzed against a device-bound passkey. Conversely, synced passkeys can more easily address account recovery challenges.</p>



<p>As organizations work to evaluate how and where both credential types can be utilized in their environment, they will need to review and understand their organization’s legal, regulatory, and security requirements. When organizations evaluate these requirements, they will many times refer to the combination of these requirements as an authentication assurance level (AAL) and will reference documentation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which provides guidance and recommendation for different assurance levels. While there is currently work underway by NIST to update these assurance levels to better incorporate synced passkeys, the current standards can be helpful when evaluating the implementation of device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys into an organization. More information regarding NIST and AALs can be found here: Authenticator Assurance Levels (nist.gov).</p>



<p>In terms of this white paper, a moderate assurance environment is an organization that has several different authentication use case scenarios that can be met by a combination of AAL1 and/or AAL2 as well as AAL3 levels of assurance. This white paper will dive deeper into the advantages and disadvantages of both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to provide a comparison between the two that an organization can use along with their own legal, regulatory, and security requirements to determine how and where they can implement both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys into their moderate assurance environment so that they can take advantage of the secure, phishing-resistant, and user friendly authentication process that FIDO2 credentials provide in all parts of their organization.</p>

 2. FIDO Credential Adoption Considerations 



<p>When organizations are evaluating the use of both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to support the AAL1, AAL2, and AAL3 requirements of their organization, there are several factors that they should consider. These factors are described below and are intended to provide the organization with the information they need to help analyze both types of credentials and determine where they can be used in their enterprise.</p>



<p>2.1. User Experience<br>In terms of user experience, the goal of using FIDO credentials to authenticate to a system has always been to provide an easy-to-use and effortless process for the user. The original FIDO implementations provided a streamlined sign-in experience, but still presented some user experience challenges.</p>



<p>Passkeys introduce several enhancements to help provide improve user experience including a new feature called “passkeys Autofill UI” that provides users easier access to the creation of the passkeys and provides an autofill-like experience where users simply pick the credential they want to use when authenticating and no longer type in their username or password. This experience becomes quite easy to use and is very similar to the experience that most users already like and are comfortable with when using solutions such as password managers. Creating a passkey user experience that users like more than their current password experience removes the hurdle to adoption that has been seen with previous passkey implementations.</p>



<p>2.1.1 Backup, Lost Devices, and Recovery<br>With device-bound passkeys, the private key is stored on and not allowed to leave the authenticator. This creates a very secure solution but does create challenges for users and enterprises regarding backup of the key data, loss of the authenticator, and addition of new authenticators for the user. While there are recommended recovery practices for device-bound passkeys (<a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FIDO_Account_Recovery_Best_Practices-1.pdf">FIDO_Account_Recovery_Best_Practices-1.pdf (fidoalliance.org)</a>), synced passkeys work to resolve these challenges in a more user friendly manner. With the implementation of a synced passkey solution, the user no longer must register multiple authenticators with a relying party to ensure continued access in the event of a lost authenticator. If an authenticator is lost, a user can recover their passkey by using the recovery process provided by the passkey provider. Additionally, synced passkeys make for a better user experience as a user does not have to register unique credentials per device or maintain multiple device-bound passkeys to minimize the risk of credential loss. Once configured, synced passkeys are available across all devices synced with the passkey provider.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys do, however, create a dependency on the passkey provider and their synchronization fabric. Each provider implements their own synchronization fabric, which includes their own security controls and mechanisms to protect credentials from being misused. Organizations with specific security or compliance requirements should assess which provider(s) or hardware security keys meet their requirements.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys have a lower security posture as they allow the private key on the authenticator to be synchronized to authenticators of other devices the user has in the same vendor’s ecosystem. Organizations should also be aware that there currently are no standards or systems that allow them to keep track of what devices these credentials have been created and stored on, nor mechanisms to identify when the credential has been shared with another person. For use cases in an organization that require a high level of assurance, the fact that this information cannot be determined or obtained means that synced passkeys would not be a good solution for those specific organizational use cases, and they should look to device-bound passkeys to support those use cases.</p>



<p>2.3 Attestation and Enforcement of Credential Type<br>Attestation is a feature that is designed to enhance the security of the registration process. Attestation mechanisms are defined by the specifications as an optional feature, though most hardware security keys implement it. Attestation is the ability of the authenticator to provide metadata about itself back to the relying party so that the relying party can make an informed decision on whether to allow the authenticator to interact with it. This metadata includes items such as an Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier (AAGUID), which is a unique ID that represents the vendor and model of the authenticator, the type of encryption that the authenticator uses, and the PIN and biometric capabilities of the authenticator. Some authenticator vendors also support a feature called Enterprise Attestation that allows an organization to add additional uniquely identifying information in an attestation that is included with an authenticator registration request, with the intent to use this additional information to support a controlled deployment within the enterprise where the<br>organization wants to allow the registration of only a specific set of authenticators. Additional information about Enterprise Attestation can be found in this white paper: <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FIDO-White-Paper-Choosing-FIDO-Authenticators-for-Enterprise-Use-Cases-RD10-2022.03.01.pdf">FIDO-White-Paper-Choosing-FIDO-Authenticators-for-Enterprise-Use-Cases-RD10-2022.03.01.pdf (fidoalliance.org)</a>.</p>



<p>At the time of publication, synced passkeys do not implement attestation, which means they are not an appropriate solution for scenarios with highly privileged users that require higher levels of assurance or for organizations that want to implement Enterprise Attestation. To support these highly privileged users, relying parties and organizations have historically looked to, and will need to continue to look to, device-bound passkeys and authenticators from vendors that support and include attestation in their solutions. For organizations that have regulatory, legal, or security requirements that require all users to be treated as high privilege users or have a need to implement Enterprise Attestation, it is recommended that only device-bound passkeys be implemented in their environment. A companion white paper, “High Assurance Enterprise Authentication,” provides details on this scenario and can be found here: <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FIDO-EDWG-Spring-2023_Paper-5_High-Assurance-Enterprise-FINAL5.docx-1.pdf">https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FIDO-EDWG-Spring-2023_Paper-5_High-Assurance-EnterpriseFINAL5.docx-1.pdf</a>. Moderate assurance organizations can support all their users by implementing synced passkeys for their standard users to replace passwords and MFA with a more secure solution and then use device-bound passkeys for highly privileged users and their access to resources that require the highest level of assurance.</p>



<p>Implementing both types of passkeys in the same authentication domain does however create an additional challenge that will require organizations to take additional steps to ensure that the correct type of passkey is used when accessing resources: for example, ensuring that a highly privileged user is using a device-bound passkey and not a synced passkey when accessing a resource that requires a high level of assurance. Organizations can leverage the user risk evaluation and policy engine framework of their Identity Provider to solve this challenge. Watermarking the user’s session with an identifier representing the AAL (or other properties of their choosing) to be used in downstream authorization decisions can also be used to solve this challenge. In federated authentication environments, this may be communicated using standards such as the Authentication Method Reference (amr, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8176">RFC8176</a>) standardized by OpenID Connect.</p>



 3. Conclusion 



<p>In moderate assurance environments, both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys may be implemented together to provide a more secure authentication solution for all use cases of the organization. The more user-friendly synced passkeys can be implemented to replace passwords and MFA for users with standard assurance level requirements, giving them a more secure authentication method that is also easier to use. For highly privileged users in the organization that require the highest level of security, device-bound passkeys can be issued that provide an even higher level of security and an additional level of trust in the authentication process. The white paper provides information comparing synced passkeys, with their better user experience, against device-bound passkeys, with their enhanced security features. Using this information, organizations can evaluate device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to determine how both can be leveraged in their organization to provide easy-to-use and secure authentication methods that meet and exceed the requirements of their moderate assurance environment.</p>



 4. Next Steps 



<p>The next step for organizations is to start the evaluation of FIDO2 credentials so that organizations can move away from passwords, which are susceptible to phishing and are well documented to be a significant weakness in their overall security posture. Organizations that have a moderate assurance need and will implement both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys should determine which credential type will provide the best return on investment, work towards implementing that credential type first, and then follow up by completing the deployment of the other credential type when possible. Implementing either type of FIDO2 credential is a large step forward in moving to a passwordless environment and significantly increasing the overall security posture of the organization.</p>

 Abstract 



<p>This white paper describes the need for a more secure and convenient solution for authentication. Passwords have long been the standard for authentication, but the risks inherent to passwords reduce their efficacy as an authentication mechanism. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions have been on market for some time, but their widespread adoption has been slow due to various barriers. Passkeys are an authentication solution that reduces the adoption barriers of traditional MFA mechanisms, while offering improved security, ease of use, and scalability over passwords and classic MFA solutions. Passkeys utilize on-device biometrics or PINs for authentication and provide a seamless user experience. This white paper outlines the benefits of passkeys, the user experience, and adoption considerations for enterprises.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>Passwords have long been the standard for authentication, but their inherent security flaws make them exploitable. Many passwords can be easily guessed or obtained through data breaches, and the reuse of passwords across multiple accounts only exacerbates the problem. This vulnerability makes them susceptible to credential stuffing attacks, which use leaked or commonly used passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. In fact, passwords are the root cause of over <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/">80% of data breaches, with up to 51% of passwords being reused</a>. Despite these security concerns, many consumers and organizations continue to rely solely on passwords for authentication. According to a recent research by the FIDO Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">59% of consumers use only a pass</a><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">w</a><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">ord</a> for their work computer or account.</p>



<p>Traditional multi-factor (MFA) mechanisms, such as one time passwords (OTPs) delivered via SMS, email, or an authenticator app, are used by organizations to reduce the risk associated with a single-factor, password-based authentication system. Organizations using single-factor authentication with passwords, or those that have deployed OTPs to reduce phishing and credential stuffing, can implement passkeys as a password replacement to provide an improved user experience, less authentication friction, and improved security properties using devices that users already use—laptops, desktops, and mobile devices. For an introduction to passkeys and the terminology, please see the FIDO Alliance’s passkeys <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">resource page</a>. In the following pages, we will focus on migrating existing password-only use cases to passkeys. For additional use cases, please see <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">here</a>.</p>

 2. Why Are Passkeys Better than Passwords? 



<p>Passkeys are a superior alternative to passwords for authentication purposes and offer improved usability over traditional MFA methods. They offer several benefits such as better user experience, reduced cost of lost credentials, phishing resistance, and protection against credential compromise.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys offer a consistent authentication experience for users across multiple devices. This is made possible by leveraging the operating system platform (or a third party synchronization fabric such as that from password managers) to synchronize cryptographic keys for FIDO credentials. This allows for quick and easy sign-in using biometrics or a device PIN. Synced passkeys also improve scalability and credential recovery. With synced passkeys users do not have to enroll a new FIDO credential on every device they own, ensuring that they always have access to their passkeys, regardless of whether they replace their device.</p>



<p>On the other hand, device-bound passkeys such as security keys can be used on multiple devices allowing for cross-device portability. Unlike synced passkeys that are accessible on any synchronized device, device-bound passkeys are tied to the specific physical security key.</p>



<p>In terms of security, passkeys are built on the FIDO authentication standards, providing strong resistance against the threats of phishing and credential stuffing. Additionally, passkeys rely on existing on-device security capabilities, making it easier for small and medium enterprises to adopt stronger authentication methods.</p>



<p>Finally, passkeys offer a comprehensive solution for secure and efficient authentication that is better than passwords and traditional MFA authentication methods. With a seamless user experience, improved scalability, and enhanced security, passkeys are a valuable solution for organizations of all sizes.</p>



 3. Passkeys User Experience 



<p>3.1 Create a passkey visual UX/UI</p>



<p>Note: This section will provide an overview of the passkey registration and sign-in process using examples. Note The FIDO Alliance User Experience Working Group has developed UX guidelines for passkeys that are available here.</p>



 
 In the passkey registration flow, users are first prompted to provide an email or username along with their password to authenticate. 
 







<p>2. Then, users simply follow the prompts to provide their on-device biometric or PIN authentication.</p>







<p>3.2 Sign in with a passkey visual UX/UI</p>



 
 To sign in with a passkey, a user just selects the email or username. 



 Available passkeys will be shown in the passkey autofill user interface. 
 







 4. Adoption Considerations for Enterprises 



<p>Within businesses large and small, there are systems and services dependent upon single factor authentication using passwords. We collectively refer to these use cases as “low assurance use cases.” For low assurance use cases, technology leaders can displace password-only authentication mechanisms with passkeys, dramatically reducing the risk of phishing, and eliminating password reuse and  credential stuffing. However, even for low assurance use cases, businesses must consider factors that will influence their choice of technology and implementation, which we outline below.</p>



<p>As a prerequisite to deploying passkeys in the enterprise, leaders must clearly define the set of use cases, users, and the suitability of passkeys for this set.</p>



<p>4.1 Does the relying party (RP) support passkeys?<br>At the time of writing (Q2 2023), passkeys are a relatively new technology, and as such broad-based support is not guaranteed. As organizations review their systems to identify candidates for migration to passkeys, leaders must start by identifying where passkeys are supported within their ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, for in-house developed/managed applications, how can passkey support be added to the application(s)?If a single-sign on (SSO) mechanism is used to federate multiple applications and services, adding passkey support to the Identity Provider (IdP) can propagate support for passkeys to numerous federated applications, creating a rich ecosystem of services supporting passkeys with engineering efforts focused on the SSO IdP. Conversely, if the environment uses multiple independent applications, each of which uses password-based authentication, organizations will have to prioritize FIDO implementation across their suite of applications to leverage passkeys, or consider migrating to a federated authentication model where the IdP supports passkeys.</p>



<p>Second, third-party developed or hosted applications may or may not support passkeys. If an organization’s service provider does not support passkeys today, inquire when support is expected. Alternatively, if the organization is pursuing a federated identity model, does the service provider support inbound federation?If so, end users can authenticate to the IdP with a passkey before federating to the service providers’ systems.</p>



<p>4.2 Which devices are used to create, manage, and authenticate with passkeys?<br>After identifying a set of targeted applications or IdPs, identify the users of the applications and the devices they use to access the same. Generally speaking, users on modern operating systems, browsers, and hardware will have broad support for passkeys registered on a platform device, using a credential manager, or with a hardware security key. There are tradeoffs with each mechanism.</p>



<p>Today, passkey providers allow users to register passkeys that are synchronized to all of the devices the user registered with the sync fabric. Passkeys providers may be part of the operating system, browser, or a credential manager which stores and manages passkeys on behalf of the user. If the user loses or replaces their device, the passkeys can be synchronized to a new device, minimizing the impact on users. Typically, this is a good solution for users who use a small number of devices on a regular basis.</p>



<p>Conversely, hardware security keys create device-bound passkeys; they never leave the device. If a user loses their hardware key, they must have a backup or perform account recovery for all credentials stored on the device. Passkeys may be shared with other users if they are not hardware bound.</p>



<p>Hardware security keys require connectivity to the user’s computing device through USB, Bluetooth, or NFC whereas providers are always available on the user’s devices once bootstrapped. Platform credentials may be used to authenticate on nearby devices using the <a href="https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#cross-device-authentication-cda">FIDO Cross-Device Authentication</a>. Enterprises should consider whether users who move between a number of shared devices should synchronize passkeys across all the shared devices, use hardware keys, or use the hybrid flow to best support their work style.</p>



<p>When users operate on shared devices using a single account (or profile), passkeys registered to the platform or credential managers are not a good fit. Device bound passkeys on a hardware key are recommended for this scenario. If the user carries a mobile device, consider registering a passkey on the device and using the cross device authentication flow to authenticate users.</p>



<p>Unlike passwords, all of the passkey solutions reviewed above provide strong phishing resistance and eliminate credential theft from the RP and reuse.</p>



<p>4.3 Registration &amp; Recovery<br>If there are no restrictions on which device(s) or platform(s) the user can register their passkeys, users may self-provision passkeys by bootstrapping a new credential from their existing password using the device(s) of the user’s choice. If using hardware security keys, organizations should provide two per user to allow for a backup credential.</p>



<p>As long as a password remains active on the user account, the user can recover from credential loss following the self-provisioning described above. This step is only required if the user is unable to restore their credentials from their passkey provider.</p>



 5. Conclusion 



<p>Passkeys offer a significant improvement in security compared to traditional passwords, but it is important to carefully evaluate and understand the adoption considerations before proceeding with an implementation. Organizations should ensure its technical requirements, security, and management preferences align with the passkey solution. Not all use cases are suitable for a passkey-only implementation. For additional deployment patterns, see the other white papers in this series here.</p>



 6. Next Steps: Get Started Today 



<p>Organizations should upgrade their authentication method and take advantage of the stronger security that passkeys provide. Based on the FIDO authentication standards, passkeys offer a robust solution to the growing threat of phishing attacks. Look for the passkey icon on websites and applications that support it, and take the first step towards a more secure future. Don’t wait. Make the switch to passkeys today!</p>

 1. Introduction 



<p>Last year FIDO Alliance, Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced their intentions to support passkeys— FIDO credentials that may be backed up and made available across devices that are registered to the same passkey provider. Since then, we have seen the support for passkeys and beta implementations by multiple platforms and password managers. Enterprises have expressed interest in passkeys but do not know where to start, what type of passkeys work in their environment, or how passkeys fit in their authentication strategy.</p>



<p>It is important to note that FIDO Alliance has embraced the term “passkey” to describe any passwordless FIDO credential. This includes synced passkeys(consistent with the original announcement and intent) as well as device-bound passkeys – which are FIDO authentication credentials that cannot leave the issued device (e.g., on a FIDO Security Key).</p>



<p>In the following series of papers, the FIDO Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) will provide guidance to leaders and practitioners on deploying FIDO solutions scaling from SMBs to large enterprises. With recognition that there are a variety of different use cases for FIDO credentials, from synced passkeys to device-bound passkeys, this series will identify key decision points for identifying which solution(s) are a good fit across different enterprise use cases. Enterprises are likely to find there are multiple FIDO-based solutions required to meet their different use cases.</p>



<p>As organizations evaluate how to use passkeys in their environment, they will need to determine the legal, regulatory, and security requirements of their organization and evaluate how both synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys can meet these requirements.</p>



<p>We assume that the reader has a high level understanding of the FIDO protocols, if not, please consult&nbsp;<a href="https://passkeys.dev/">https://passkeys.dev/</a>.</p>

 2. Why Choose Passkeys? 



<p>Passwords are the root cause of over 80% of data breaches, and up to 51% of passwords are reused, making them subject to credential stuffing attacks. FIDO credentials are inherently more secure than passwords due to their design. These credentials are unique cryptographic key pairs scoped to a specific origin (e.g., https://fidoalliance.org/) to prevent discovery by unrelated services. Unlike passwords, FIDO credentials are highly phishing resistant, and the credential—a private key—cannot be stolen from the relying party (RP) servers.</p>



<p>FIDO credentials can be utilized across a variety of use cases—from low to high assurance, balancing user experience, convenience, and security. Authenticators—ranging from hardware security keys to biometric hardware in phones, tablets, and laptops to password managers—enable enterprises to choose the right tools for their unique environments.</p>



<p>While all FIDO credentials are based on cryptographic key pairs, they do not exhibit the same security characteristics, nor are they all suitable for all use cases. For example, hardware security keys may be FIPS certified devices with device-bound passkeys. RPs can identify these credentials based upon the attestation statements provided at registration. On the other hand, synced passkey implementations synchronize key material through a cloud-based service. The export and management of credentials in a third-party service introduces additional considerations and may not meet every organization’s security requirements. The table on page 4 summarizes the use cases and properties of device-bound and synced passkeys.</p>



<p>As you read the series you may encounter terminology that is unique to the FIDO ecosystem. Please consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/common-specs/fido-glossary-v2.1-ps-20220523.html">FIDO Technical Glossary</a>&nbsp;for definitions of these terms.</p>



<p>We expect that most enterprises will have use cases that span more than one of these papers. Wherever organizations find themselves on this journey, they can start using FIDO credentials today to reduce credential reuse, phishing, and credential stuffing.</p>



<p>In the first paper, we examine how organizations can deploy passkeys to their users who are using passwords as their only authentication factor. By deploying passkeys, companies can immediately reduce the risk of phishing or credential stuffing for their staff while using corporate or personal devices for authentication.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>



<p>There are many organizations that have deployed classic second factor authentication solutions such as SMS OTP, TOTP, and HOTP. In many cases, these deployments were tactical responses to reduce the success of phishing attacks. However, none of these mechanisms are immune to phishing. In the second paper of the series, we examine how passkeys can displace less phishing resistant mechanisms while improving the authentication user experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>



<p>Enterprises in regulated industries may be obligated to utilize higher assurance authentication for some, or all, of their staff. These companies (or other companies with stringent security requirements) may be able to deploy synced passkeys, device-bound passkeys, or both to meet their authentication requirements. The third paper in the series provides guidance on deciding which FIDO-based solution(s) can meet these requirements.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>



<p>The final paper describes using device-bound passkeys where functional or regulatory requirements require high assurance<br>authentication. These scenarios use attestation data to securely validate the hardware devices used to generate and manage passkeys.</p>



<p>This attestation data can be used to ensure compliance with regulatory and security requirements for regulated enterprises and use cases.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>

 Abstract 



<p>This document intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of attestation’s role in enhancing and advancing the digital security landscape, specifically with respect to authentication. It focuses on the core function of attestation: verifying the origin and integrity of user devices and their authentication materials. FIDO credentials are discussed with a focus on how they offer more secure alternatives than traditional password-based systems and how FIDO attestation enhances authentication security for both Relying Parties (RPs) and end-users. In this document, RPs are those entities that provide websites, applications and online services that require the need for secure user access by confirming the identity of users or other entities. FIDO Alliance’s historical journey is presented with practical analogies for understanding FIDO attestation, its enterprise-specific technical solutions, and privacy aspects involved in the attestation process.</p>



 Audience 



<p>Targeted for CISOs, security engineers, architects, and identity engineers, this white paper serves as a guide for professionals considering the adoption of FIDO within their enterprise ecosystem. Readers should possess a baseline understanding of FIDO technologies, the meaning of attestation, and have a desire to understand why and how to implement attestation.</p>

 1. Introduction 



 
<p>While authentication is widely understood, attestation may be less familiar to many practitioners in the information technology field. Attestation, as understood within the FIDO protocols, confirms a set of properties or characteristics of the authenticator. In the physical world, we can rely on examining an object to inspect its properties and verify its authenticity. In the interconnected digital world, physical inspection is not practical. Devices used for FIDO authentication should be carefully checked before use, especially if their source or contents are uncertain. Certain transactions, especially those related to government, healthcare, or financial institutions, demand higher assurance, and it is vital that the Relying Party (RP)&nbsp; confirms the authenticator’s legitimacy in these cases. To ensure that high-assurance transactions are legitimate, RPs can employ attestation to verify the authenticity and properties of the authenticator.</p>



<p>A note on terminology: The term “key” and “key pair” is common to several types of keys described in this paper. To alleviate this confusion the term “passkey” will always be used when referring to a key used to authenticate a user. Use of other instances of the term ‘key’ will be specific by either the context or a modifier such as Attestation Key.</p>



<p>In traditional password-based systems, it may be assumed that users and RPs keep passwords confidential. Because this assumption is not consistently enforced, breaches can occur. Using passkeys instead of passwords is a significant improvement, but some RPs may need more stringent policies to verify the authenticity of the authenticator and its properties.</p>



<p>Unlike passwords, passkeys use securely generated key material allowing access to websites and apps. Users and RPs rely on the authenticator for storage and management of this key material and therefore share the responsibility for secure handling of passkeys.&nbsp; All actors and components of the FIDO solution, including the authenticator, RP, and the passkey provider (when applicable), together ensure a robust security framework. This is in contrast to passwords, where the secure handling of passwords depends primarily on the user’s memory, behavior, the RP, and password managers (if used). RPs can leverage attestations to verify that passkeys are securely handled within&nbsp; properly implemented FIDO certified devices.</p>



<p>Attestation provides RPs with information about the authenticator protecting the user’s passkeys. This provides a means for the RP to enforce security policies for FIDO authentication. In the following sections, we delve deeper into the concept of attestation, its purpose, real-life scenario comparisons, and the problems attestation solves.</p>



<p>1.1 Real-World Analogies for FIDO Attestation</p>



<p>Drawing parallels with everyday security protocols offers significant insights. Both digital and physical environments demand rigorous checks and balances to validate identities and fortify trust. FIDO Attestation reflects the trust and verification processes familiar in the physical world.</p>



<p>To understand the pivotal role of FIDO attestation, consider its application in real-world identification and verification practices. These analogies underscore its integral function and efficacy:</p>



 
 Identity Document Verification: Just as individuals may produce official documents such as passports or driver’s licenses to authenticate identity, the verifier (e.g., immigration official) wants proof of the document’s authenticity and therefore checks for the relevant seals and marks. FIDO attestation provides proof of the authenticity of a user’s authenticator, offers statements for examination, and provides cryptographic signatures for verifying the authenticity of the authenticator and the statements. 



 Gaining Trust Through Authentication: Think of moments where trust is contingent on proof of identity or authority.&nbsp; For example, accessing a secure facility where a guard authenticates you based on your identity documents, authorizing access to the facility. FIDO attestation fosters trust in digital environments when used to confirm the authenticator provenance and authenticity during online registration. 



 Countering Threats and Weaknesses: In real-world scenarios, ID checks exist to counteract impersonation, forgery, and fraud. FIDO attestation identifies the origins of authenticators and assists RPs to detect registrations from devices with known vulnerabilities, thereby enabling them to ensure that users employ only secure devices. 
 
 



 2. Practical Implications and Use-Cases of FIDO Attestation 



 
<p>2.1 From the Perspective of a Relying Party&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delving deeper into FIDO attestation provides invaluable insights into critical roles fortifying authentication systems:</p>



 
 Assured Authenticator Security and Compliance: For RPs operating in sensitive sectors, for example,&nbsp; finance or the public domain, there’s a heightened need to ascertain that authentication devices are secure and meet specific standards. FIDO attestation helps ensure that authenticators accessing services are not only secure, but also adhere to specific standards and regulations. 



 Authenticator Model Specificity and Trust in FIDO Authenticator Models: FIDO attestation is tailored to distinct authenticator models, ensuring that cryptographic proofs during registrations validate said authenticator model authenticity. Beyond general trust in the attestation process, this specificity allows the RP to confirm that the passkey used in the registration request originates from a particular FIDO authenticator model. Such granularity is paramount for RPs where the details of authenticator models are crucial due to regulatory or security reasons. 



 Verification Through Attestation Signature: As a user sets up a new account, the onboarding RP can authenticate that the “attestation signature” linked to the freshly generated passkey is indeed from a genuine authenticator model. 



 Incident handling and Response: If a vulnerability is discovered in an authenticator, RPs checking attestations have the ability to discover which authenticators may be affected and require additional authentication factors or registration of a new credential for impacted users.&nbsp; 
 



<p>2.2 From the Perspective of the End-User</p>



<p>Although end users may not be aware of the technical details, FIDO attestation can enhance their online security:</p>



 
 Enhanced Trust in Services: When using services, particularly in high-assurance sectors such as&nbsp; banking or government portals, users can experience increased confidence. They understand that the RP isn’t just authenticating but is also ensuring that authenticators accessing the platform adhere to specific standards. 



 Authenticator Compliance: FIDO attestation assures RPs of authenticator compliance and security,&nbsp; giving users the benefit of reliable functionality of their authentication devices paired with desired RP-related services. 



 Transparent Registration and Onboarding: &nbsp;The registration process is designed for seamlessness, but includes an additional step when an RP requests attestation of a FIDO authenticator.&nbsp; At this step, users must provide their consent to share the attestation metadata with the RP. This ensures that while backend verifications related to attestations, certification path validations, and authenticator compliance are streamlined, the user is aware of and has approved the process. 
 
 



 3. FIDO Attestation Explained 



 
<p>In this section we describe FIDO attestation and FIDO attestation types.</p>



<p>3.1 What is FIDO Attestation?</p>



<p>Within the FIDO authentication framework, attestation is a process for verifying the authenticity of a user’s authenticator during the authentication process. The attestation can be used in conjunction with the FIDO Alliance’s metadata service [1] to get more information about the authenticator including the model and certification level. An optional level of attestation, known as enterprise attestation, allows for further verification of specific authenticators, see section 4.5.</p>



<p>Note that the term ‘attestation’ might have&nbsp; different meanings outside of the context of FIDO. This paper discusses attestation only within the scope of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>In FIDO registration, a key step is the creation of a user authentication passkey, which occurs regardless of whether attestation is involved. During this process, the user’s authenticator—such as a smartphone—generates a unique cryptographic key pair for each RP. The private key is securely stored within the authenticator, while the public key is shared with the RP, establishing a secure authentication framework. Additionally, during registration, the authenticator may provide an attestation, offering further assurance about the authenticator’s integrity.</p>



<p>In addition to generating the user’s authentication passkey, the FIDO authentication framework includes an optional attestation process. When attestation is requested, the authenticator may provide an attestation (synced passkeys do not currently provide attestations) by using an Attestation Key to sign the AAGUID&nbsp; (Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique ID) along with the passkey public key, creating signed evidence that establishes a trust anchor for the RP to validate that the authenticator properties meet the RP conditions through the MDS (FIDO Alliance’s Metadata Service [<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.4bvk7pj">1</a>], see section 3.3 for additional information).&nbsp; If the authenticator cannot provide an attestation, the RP can authenticate the user with the passkey, and may obtain authenticator information (e.g. AAGUID), but it may not obtain verifiable evidence that the required authenticator properties are present.</p>



<p>This attestation process helps protect against supply chain attacks, such as the introduction of substitute or counterfeit authenticators. By verifying the authenticity of the authenticator, the RP understands the properties of the authenticator and assesses whether it meets the expected security standards, particularly during the registration phase, to ensure the device’s legitimacy.</p>



<p>FIDO attestation is thus a key component of the broader security and privacy objectives of the framework. It minimizes reliance on passwords, fosters strong device authentication based on public-key cryptography, and aims to offer a standardized and interoperable approach to authentication across different platforms and devices.</p>



<p>3.2 Types of FIDO Attestation</p>



<p>There are several types of FIDO attestation which differ in how the attestation statement is signed. Note that none of these attestation types except Enterprise Attestation provide information about the specific authenticator. This is to preserve user privacy.</p>



 
 Self-attestation: The attestation statement is signed by the user’s passkey. This provides integrity protection for the attestation statement and provides no other assurances. 



 Basic attestation: The attestation statement is signed by a key created by the authenticator’s manufacturer and embedded into the authenticator. This provides integrity protection of the attestation statement and proof of the authenticator’s manufacturer. For privacy purposes, this key must be duplicated across many of the same authenticator’s model (current FIDO Alliance requirement is &gt;100,000 devices). It is not unique to a specific authenticator instance. 



 Attestation CA (AttCA) or Anonymization CA (AnonCA): This is similar to basic attestation, except the attestation statement is signed by a TPM Attestation Key. In this case, the TPM, a hardware-based module where cryptographic operations occur and secrets are stored securely without leaving the module, has its Attestation Key’s certificate signed by a trusted authority managing the authenticator. 



 Enterprise attestation: This is discussed in section 4.5, 
 



<p>It should be noted that the FIDO2 Specifications work along with the WebAuthn specification <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.4bvk7pj">[2].</a> The type of attestation used is determined by examining fields within the attestation object which are defined in the WebAuthn specification. Further definitions provided by the WebAuthn specification includes a number of different types of formats, for example: packed, TPM, and Android-key as well as supporting custom formats if needed.</p>



<p>3.3 Using AAGUID</p>



<p>The Authenticator Attestation GUID or simply AAGUID, uniquely identifies the authenticator’s make (manufacturer) and model. It does not uniquely identify the specific authenticator. The AAGUID&nbsp; is returned by the authenticator when attestation is requested by the RP and&nbsp; the RP may use it to determine if the authenticator’s make and model meets its policies. Among other uses, the AAGUID is the lookup value within the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/">FIDO (MDS)</a> [1] providing the RP detailed information about the authenticator.</p>



<p>The authenticator’s conveyance of the AAGUID provides no proof of its integrity or authenticity. The RP must trust the specific authenticator to provide truthful information.</p>



<p>This point is important to emphasize:</p>



 
 The AAGUID without attestation is “informational” only and does not provide any assurance of its authenticity. 



 Attestation provides a signature providing a level of assurance (depending on the type of attestation) of the authenticator’s identity. 
 
 



 4. Technical Solutions&nbsp; 



 
<p>This section describes the sequence of events and involved components that make up FIDO attestation.</p>



<p>4.1 Authentication vs. Attestation Keys&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of keys and methods for user authentication from FIDO have been introduced in previous documents, but the use of&nbsp; keys and methods used for attestation may not be familiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 User Authentication: This is the process where the user demonstrates possession of the correct system credentials, utilizing a passkey instead of the traditional password, which is a common application of FIDO technology. 



 Attestation: This is the process of the authenticator using a key that is not assigned to a user, but instead&nbsp; assigned to the authenticator,&nbsp; to digitally sign a message providing proof of the message’s authenticity. The message involved is called the “attestation statement” and contains information about the authenticator. When the attestation statement is digitally signed by the authenticator’s attestation key, the RP can verify the validity of the attestation statement. 
 



<p>In summary:</p>



 
 A passkey authenticates the user to an RP 



 An attestation key signs an attestation statement to authenticate its origin 
 



<p>As stated in section 3.3 an RP may obtain the authenticator’s make and model by simply checking the authenticator’s AAGUID against the Metadata Service to get this information. Without being digitally signed by a key trusted by the RP, the RP has no proof this information is authentic or associated with the authenticator being queried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: As discussed in section 3.2, there are several attestation types. One of these, “self-attestation”, uses the User Authentication key to sign the attestation statement. This is not technically a contradiction, but a simplification provided to allow integrity protection, not authenticity, of the attestation statement.</p>



<p>4.2 Trust in the Attestation Key – Trust Chain</p>



<p>Fundamental to attestation is the RP’s trust in the Attestation Key. The Attestation Key must be generated by a trusted source and protected by the authenticator. The trusted source is typically the authenticator’s manufacturer however, in the case of “Attestation CA (AttCA) or Anonymization CA (AnonCA)”, a trusted agent or Certification Authority (CA) is asserting the authenticity of the authenticator. The public part of the Attestation Key is obtained by the RP using a trusted channel, typically the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/">FIDO MDS</a> [1], mentioned previously.</p>



<p>4.3 FIDO Attestation Sequence</p>



<p>Attestation uses a key pair associated with an authenticator, not a user. It is important that all authenticators of the same make and model return the same attestation statement. The format of the attestation is examined later in this section, but it is important to understand that, at a high level, the attestation provides information about the type of authenticator, and it is not specific to a single device.</p>



<p>The following steps (1.a or 1.b then 2.) summarize a FIDO authenticator’s attestation lifecycle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Authenticator Manufacturing: There are two models for provisioning the Attestation Key: case “a” for roaming authenticators, such as smartphones or USB security keys used across multiple platforms, and case “b” for platform authenticators, which are built-in authentication mechanisms within devices like laptops or smartphones.</p>



<p>Note: This two-model distinction is not architecturally required by the FIDO Specification, but it is the practical implementation known today and provides a simplified explanation for the purpose of this paper. Also, the descriptions are generalizations and manufacturers may deploy different methods than described here – this is only a generalization.</p>



 
 Roaming Authenticator: The authenticator manufacturer generates an Attestation Keypair (AK) for a specific authenticator model. The manufacturer creates a certificate with the AK’s public key. The AK Certificate is commonly put into the MDS. This allows a RP to retrieve the AK Certificate from a trusted source, MDS, when an AAGUID is provided. The AK Certificate itself is usually signed with the authenticator’s manufacturer’s issuer key. This creates a verifiable cryptographic chain from the authenticator back to its manufacturer. 



 Platform Authenticator: The authenticator is not shipped from its manufacturer with an attestation key that can be used for FIDO attestation. Instead, it relies on persistent keys within the platform authenticator. These keys are crucial cryptographic elements that the attestation service uses to generate a FIDO Attestation Key. The attestation service is trusted by the Relying Party to provide assurance in the platform authenticator’s integrity and compliance. The attestation service creates an attestation key that is used to sign an attestation object which asserts the properties of the authenticator. The RP must trust the attestation service in the same way it trusts the roaming authenticator’s manufacturer. 
 



<p>2. User Provisioning with Attestation: During registration (setting up the new account), a new User Credential (a passkey) is created with a unique cryptographic key pair, and the public key is sent to the RP. The RP may optionally require an attestation. Note that the User or the authenticator may ignore the requirement for attestation. If the authenticator possesses an attestation key and it is allowed by the User, the user’s public passkey (along with the attestation statement) will be sent to the RP signed with the attestation private key. This allows the RP to verify the attestation statement which includes the User’s Public passkey for the newly created User. Therefore, providing confidence/proof that the User’s private passkey originated from a specific authenticator with known properties.</p>



<p>4.4 A General Description of the Attestation Lifecycle</p>







<p>The attestation key generally has an associated attestation certificate, which links to a trusted root certificate of the Manufacturer. Once the RP has determined the authenticity of the signed attestation statement, the RP can use the attestation statement along with the MDS to learn more about the authenticator. For example, the RP may want to understand what level of encryption is used and what type of activation secrets is leveraged (e.g., biometrics) with a certain level of accuracy, etc. In order to get details about the authenticator an AAGUID value identifying the authenticator model is sent to the RP along with the newly created public passkey. Since the&nbsp; AAGUID represents a specific group of authenticator instances such as specific product release with a specific characteristic, specific form factor, or enterprise branding, an RP can use this AAGUID to lookup more information about the authenticator from the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/">MDS</a>.</p>



<p>As shown in the diagram, the attestation object, if provided, will indicate the format of the attestation statement, and then include some data the RP can examine. The attestation object includes a statement that typically contains a signature as well as a certificate or similar data providing provenance information for the attestation public key.&nbsp; Detail of the attestation object is provided in section <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.3cqmetx">9.1</a> of the Appendix.</p>



<p>RPs should first verify the signature of the attestation statement and once verified, then examine the attestation statement.&nbsp; Once the RP has identified the attestation statement’s format and type, the RP then reviews the contents and compares the contents against its policy.</p>



<p>An example attestation response resulting from a&nbsp; direct request to the authenticator by an RP is provided in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.1rvwp1q">9.2</a> of the Appendix. The AAGUID provided in the attestation response can be used to obtain additional&nbsp; details about the authenticator from the FIDO Metadata Service.</p>



<p>4.5 Enterprise Attestation</p>



<p>By default, FIDO allows an authenticator to provide only product information using the AAGUID and high-level information about its type and capabilities, explicitly prohibiting an authenticator from providing uniquely identifying information.&nbsp; However, Enterprise attestation removes that limitation, as it binds a unique authenticator key pair to a serial number or equivalent unique identifier.</p>



<p>4.5.1 Use Cases</p>



<p>Enterprises actively manage authenticators for various purposes and are essential for securing high-value assets. While employees may select their own authenticators, enterprises may limit authenticators per employee and revoke them upon a departure or loss, as they oversee the entire process from purchase to collection. Additionally, enterprises may prioritize manageability and traceability to safeguard resources. Upon a threat incident, forensic investigations may need to trace activities related to a particular authenticator and correlate the authenticator’s usage activity patterns in order to discover anomalies or the source of threat. Tight management enhances their ability to ensure non-repudiation for transactions. High-risk users may be assigned dedicated authenticators from the enterprise for access to restricted sensitive information or services. These authenticators are assigned specific PINs and are acquired through trusted supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certain enterprise deployments require the use of FIDO authenticators with enterprise attestation in order to identify specific device identities (e.g. device serial numbers). Enterprise Attestation validation must also be supported by the organization’s specific Relying Parties. These practices actively address enterprise-specific needs for improved control over device provisioning and lifecycle management.</p>



<p>4.5.2 Process</p>







<p>4.5.2.1 Provisioning&nbsp;</p>



<p>Provisioning for enterprise attestation, is modified from the process described in section 4.3 to include both authenticator unique information in the attestation statement and to add any specific RPs permitted to receive this unique information from any set of RPs permanently “burned” into the authenticator by the authenticator’s manufacturer. The authenticator performs enterprise attestation only to those RPs provisioned to the authenticator. Other RPs may still perform any other type of attestation that excludes the unique identifier.</p>



<p>Authenticators that have the enterprise attestation burned into them must not be sold on the open market and may only be supplied directly from the authenticator’s manufacturer to the RP.&nbsp; An RP wanting an enterprise attestation enabled authenticator will order them directly from the authenticator’s manufacturer by providing a list of RP IDs (RPIDs). These specific RPIDs are the ones permanently burned/written to the authenticator.</p>



<p>4.5.2.2 User Registration with Enterprise Attestation</p>



<p>During a FIDO user registration described in section 4.3, the RP may indicate the need for enterprise attestation. This will uniquely associate the user with the specific authenticator by providing proof of the authenticator’s unique identifier. During user registration the authenticator verifies that the requesting RP (using its RPID) is among those listed in the permanently provisioned list of RPID permitted to perform enterprise attestation. If approved, this unique identifier is added to the attestation object and signed by the Attestation Key. The RP should validate the attestation object and, optionally, the certificate link/chain used to sign the attestation object. The RP can then verify, at user registration time, that the unique identifier was indeed purchased by the enterprise and may include that verification in its records.</p>



<p>The implementation used by an RP to authenticate the uniquely identifying information varies by authenticator. Some authenticators may use vendor facilitated methods where the enterprise provides a list of the RP IDs to the manufacturer and those are imprinted into the authenticators. Another is where some enterprise managed platforms maintain a policy, such as an enterprise managed browser. Rather than imprinting the list of allowed RPs into the authenticator, an enterprise managed platform will make the determination if the enterprise attestation is provided to the RP based on the policy.</p>
 



 5. Privacy Implications and Considerations 



 
<p>While attestation provides a valuable assertion of trust for authenticators, privacy concerns can arise from the information shared during attestation. Some privacy considerations include:</p>



 
 While the attestation properties described in this paper include a broad set of privacy controls, implementers should consider these capabilities against regional and local privacy policies. 



 Attestation enables sharing information, such as authenticator’s make and model, firmware version, or manufacturer details, with the RP. Concerns may arise regarding the potential exposure of sensitive authenticator-specific data and the subsequent tracking or profiling of users based on this information.&nbsp; For this very reason, an attestation batch of at least 100,000 is recommended so it is not a small pool to identify devices from. 



 Non-enterprise attestation prevents the association of multiple passkeys within an authenticator with different RPs, thus safeguarding user privacy. For example, a person using a single authenticator may create a User Authentication passkey (passkey1) for RP 1 (RP1), then create a new User Authentication passkey (passkey2) for RP 2 (RP2). Even though the person is using the same physical authenticator for both RPs and using attestation, even if RP1 and RP2 collaborate, they cannot determine that passkey1 and passkey2 are from the same authenticator, therefore, they cannot determine the transactions are from the same person. 



 Enterprise attestation adds uniquely identifying information (e.g., a device serial number) allowing an authorized RP to track the use of a specific authenticator across several pre-provisioned RPs within the enterprise. It is expected that users in this environment have an understanding of this property and the value it adds to the enterprise.&nbsp; 
 
 



 6. Adoption and Deployment Considerations 



 
<p>RPs can determine the registration requirements for a FIDO authenticator, as&nbsp; reflected in their preference for attestation conveyance. Some RPs may not require attestations to decide if registration is allowed. Other RPs may have security requirements that require an attestation object in order to make risk decisions. Security requirements may be based on characteristics of the authenticator (e.g., whether it requires a PIN) or could be as specific as the model of authenticator(s) allowed. Finally, in more protected environments, some RPs may require additional enterprise attestations to ensure an authenticator is known, controlled, and trusted by the enterprise.</p>
 



 7. Conclusion 



 
<p>FIDO attestation, a component of the FIDO and WebAuthn standards, validates the authenticity of a user’s authenticator. This process provides a defense against various threats such as supply chain attacks, counterfeit authenticators, and substitution attacks. For RPs requiring higher authentication assurance, attestation is a FIDO-centric mechanism to obtain that assurance. For RPs that need to ensure the authenticity of specific authenticators,&nbsp; attestation provides these RPs assurance that they are dealing with a known and trusted device.</p>



<p>By generating unique key pairs for each RP that a user registers with, FIDO underscores its commitment to user security, eliminating potential cross-service vulnerabilities. The enterprise attestation feature provides organizations with better management of authenticators used by their personnel and is vital to environments that prioritize precise device management.</p>



<p>FIDO attestation brings certain privacy considerations. Disclosing authenticator-specific information, user device fingerprinting and the potential for user tracking, all highlight the importance of a privacy-aware approach. All stakeholders, including RPs, manufacturers, and users, must navigate the path between enhancing security and preserving user privacy.</p>



<p>FIDO attestation is adaptable.&nbsp; RPs have the discretion to request their desired level of attestation, ensuring a tailored approach suitable for both specialized services and large enterprises.</p>



<p>In summary, FIDO attestation augments online authentication. With a focus on public-key cryptography, unique key pairs, and specific attestation processes, its efficacy is maximized through careful deployment, thorough understanding of its capabilities, and a consistent commitment to user privacy.</p>

  On July 9, 2012, not long after The Intention Economy&nbsp;came out, I got word from Gary Rosen of The Wall Street Journal that the paper’s publisher, Robert Thomson, loved the book and wanted “an excerpt/adaptation” from the book for the cover story of&nbsp; the WSJ’s Weekend Review section.

 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444873204577535352521092154"></a><p>The cover page of the Weekend Review section of The Wall Street Journal, July 20, 2012</p> 
<p>On July 9, 2012, not long after <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy</a>&nbsp;came out, I got word from <a href="https://x.com/garyrosenWSJ">Gary Rosen</a> of <a href="https://wsj.com">The Wall Street Journal</a> that the paper’s publisher, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Thomson_(executive)">Robert Thomson</a>, loved the book and wanted “an excerpt/adaptation” from the book for the cover story of&nbsp; the WSJ’s Weekend Review section. The image above is the whole cover of that section, which appeared later that month.</p>
<p>In the article I described a new way to shop:</p>
<blockquote><p>An “intentcast” goes out to the marketplace, revealing only what’s required to attract offers. No personal information is revealed, except to vendors with whom you already have a trusted relationship.</p></blockquote>
<p>I also said that this form of shopping—</p>
<blockquote><p>…can be made possible only by the full empowerment of individuals—that is, by making them both independent of controlling organizations and better able to engage with them. Work toward these goals is going on today, inside a new field called VRM, for vendor relationship management. VRM works on the demand side of the marketplace: for you, the customer, rather than for sellers and third parties on the supply side.</p></blockquote>
<p>The scenario I described was set ten years out: in 2022, a future now two years in the past. In the meantime, many approaches to intentcasting have come and gone. The ones that have stayed are Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Instacart, TaskRabbit, Thumbtack, and a few others. (Thumbtack participated in the early days of ProjectVRM.) We include them in <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work#Intentcasting">our list of intentcasting services</a> because they model at least some of what we’d like intentcasting to be. What they don’t model is the full empowerment of individuals&nbsp;as independent actors: ones whose intentions <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/customers-need-scale-f8e045b90304">can scale across whole markets</a> and many sellers:</p>
 <p>Scale gives the customer single ways to deal with many companies. For example, she should be able to change her address or last name with every company she deals with in one move—or to send an intention-to-buy “intentcast” to a whole market.</p> 
<p>Should we call the sum of it “<a href="https://customercommons.org/blog/the-dawn-of-i-commerce/">i-commerce</a>“? Just a thought.</p>
<p>Back to the Wall Street Journal article. It is clear to me now that&nbsp;The Customer as a God would have been a much better title for my book than The Intention Economy, which needs explaining and sounds too much like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Attention-Economy-Understanding-Currency-Business/dp/1578518717">The Attention Economy</a>, which was the title of the book that came out ten years earlier. (I’ve met people who have read that one and thought it was mine—or worse, called my book “The Attention Economy” and sent readers to the wrong one.)</p>
<p>Of course, calling customers gods is hyperbole: exaggeration for effect.&nbsp; VRM has always been about customers coming to companies as equals. The “revolution in personal empowerment” in the subhead of “The Customer as a God” is about equality, not supremacy. For more on that, see the <a href="https://projectvrm.org/?s=r-button&amp;category=r-button">eleven posts</a> before this one that mention the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/R-button">R-button</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/R-button"></a></p>
<p>That symbol (or pair of symbols) is about two parties who attract each other (like two magnets) and engage as equals. It’s a symbol that only makes full sense in open markets where free customers prove more valuable than captive ones. Not markets where customers are mere “targets” to “acquire,” “capture,” “manage,” “control” or “lock in” as if they were slaves or cattle.</p>
<p>The stage of Internet growth called Web 2.0 was all about those forms of capture, control, and coerced dependency. We’re still in it. (What’s being called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> is, while “decentralized” (note: not distributed), it is also based on tokens and blockchain. ) Investment in customer independence rounds to nil.</p>
<p>And that’s probably the&nbsp;biggest reason intentcasting as we imagined it in the first place has not taken off. It is very hard, inside industrial-age business norms (which we still have) to see customers as equals, or as human beings who should be equipped to lead in the dance between buyers and sellers, or demand and supply, in truly open marketplaces. It’s still easier to see us as mere consumers (which <a href="https://www.jerrymichalski.com/">Jerry Michalski</a> calls “gullets with wallets and eyeballs”).</p>
<p>So, where is there hope?</p>
<p>How about AI? It’s at the late end of its craze stage, but still here to stay, and <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en">hot as ever</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en"></a></p>
<p>Can AI provide the “revolution in personal empowerment” we’ve been looking for here since 2006? Can it prove <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page#VRM_Principles">our thesis—that free customers are more valuable than captive ones—to themselves and to the marketplace</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">Only if it’s personal</a>.</p>
<p>If it is, then the market is <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2024/06/11/pai-greenfield/">a greenfield</a>.</p>
<p>Some of us here are working at putting AI on both sides of intentcasting ceremonies. If you have, or know about, one or more of those approaches (or any intentcasting approaches), please share what you know, or what you’re got, in the comments below. And come to VRM Day on October 28. I’ll be putting up the invite for that shortly.</p>

 Part 1: Three Key Principles <p>This is the first post in a series exploring the fundamentals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">Systems Thinking</a>. This is an approach that helps us make sense of complex situations by considering the whole system rather than just its individual parts.</p><p>Why is Systems Thinking important? Whether you’re navigating challenges in your professional life or making decisions in your personal life, Systems Thinking offers a series of powerful lenses through which to view the interconnectedness of various elements. By understanding how different parts of a system influence one another, you can identify more effective solutions, anticipate unintended consequences, and make better-informed decisions. This holistic approach is particularly valuable in today’s complex world, where problems are rarely isolated and simple fixes can often lead to new&nbsp;issues!</p><p>This series is made up&nbsp;of:</p>  Part 1: Three Key Principles (this&nbsp;post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-77eb29d510a4">Part 2: Understanding Feedback&nbsp;Loops</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-8af6844edacd">Part 3: Identifying Leverage&nbsp;Points</a>  <p>In this first post, we’ll explore three key principles that are foundational to a Systems Thinking approach: Drawing a Boundary, Multiple Perspectives, and Holistic Thinking. These principles provide the groundwork for seeing beyond surface-level problems and understanding the deeper, often hidden, relationships and patterns within any system. By applying these principles, you can begin to approach challenges with a mindset that seeks to comprehend the whole rather than merely addressing symptoms, leading to more sustainable and impactful solutions.</p> 1. Drawing a&nbsp;boundary <p>“The only problems that have simple solutions are simple problems. Complex problems have complex solutions.” — Russell&nbsp;Ackoff</p><p>In Systems Thinking, one of the first steps is to draw a boundary around the system you’re examining. This boundary defines what is included within the system and what is considered external. It’s crucial because the way you set this boundary determines the scope of your analysis and influences the insights you&nbsp;gain.</p><p>A boundary can be drawn in various ways. It might cut cross-functionally across an organisation, considering multiple departments and their interactions. Alternatively, it could include several organisations, looking at an entire ecosystem rather than a single entity. These choices lead to different conclusions and strategies. Boundaries help manage complexity by allowing you to concentrate on specific parts of the system without getting overwhelmed by the&nbsp;whole.</p><p>For example, when we started working with the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) based at MIT, we had to make a decision about where to draw the boundary. We could have drawn it very narrowly to focus just on the DCC team, which would have focused mainly on operational issues and decision-making. Our brief, however, was to help with a communications strategy, which meant drawing a wider one. This included organisations who were aware of the DCC, but not directly involved with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Draw a boundary too wide, and it becomes difficult to identify ways to create meaningful change. For example, if we included all of Higher Education, it would have become an impossible project to manage. In the end, we identified key stakeholder groups (e.g. registrars) and included them within the boundary. That meant purposely excluding other stakeholders (e.g. vendors) so that we could work on communications that would resonate and create&nbsp;change.</p> 2. Multiple perspectives <p>“We live in a world of problems, not puzzles. Problems are tangled with uncertainty, ambiguity, and value conflicts.” — Geoffrey&nbsp;Vickers</p><p>Every system is viewed differently depending on the perspective of the observer. Recognising and incorporating multiple perspectives is a cornerstone of Systems Thinking. Each stakeholder sees the system from their own unique angle, and by considering these diverse viewpoints, we can uncover hidden dynamics and potential conflicts.</p><p>For instance, with the DCC project, we needed to gain the perspectives of different members of the team, the Leadership Council, and key stakeholder groups. Each had different opinions and concerns, which helped us create an effective and holistic communications plan, balancing the needs of all stakeholders and provide a way&nbsp;forward.</p> 3. Holistic&nbsp;thinking <p>“Insight, I believe, refers to the process by which a shift in perspective reveals a coherent pattern that had previously been obscured from view.” — Mary Catherine Bateson</p><p>Holistic thinking involves seeing the system as a whole rather than just focusing on individual parts. It contrasts with reductionist approaches, which break down a system into its components. While reductionism can be useful, it often misses the interactions and relationships that make the system function.</p><p>In the DCC communications strategy project, it was important not to take a reductionist approach focused on individual aspects, but rather think more holistically. We needed a way that considered how these elements interact. For example, by creating a cadence for communications which re-uses content from one platform, and which helps scaffold stakeholder understanding. By considering the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem as an interconnected whole, we were able to think about how a communications strategy could encourage adoption, without burning out DCC&nbsp;staff.</p> Conclusion <p>In this post, we’ve explored the three foundational pillars of Systems Thinking: Drawing a Boundary, Multiple Perspectives, and Holistic Thinking. These principles offer a powerful framework for tackling complex problems, allowing you to see the bigger picture, understand diverse viewpoints, and recognise the intricate connections that drive systems. By applying these concepts, you can develop more effective strategies, avoid unintended consequences, and create sustainable solutions.</p><p>At We Are Open Co-op, we specialise in helping organisations integrate these Systems Thinking principles into their everyday practices. Whether you’re navigating organisational change, developing strategies, or addressing societal challenges, our approach can help you uncover deeper insights and achieve lasting&nbsp;impact.</p><p>If you’re interested in how Systems Thinking can transform your organisation, we’d love to collaborate with you. Stay tuned for the next post in this series, where we’ll delve into practical applications of these principles, providing you with tools and examples to put Systems Thinking into&nbsp;action.</p> References   Ackoff, R.L.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>If Tina had been in the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/photo-gallery/">Oceania Room at Te Papa Tongarewa last Tuesday</a>, and for the two&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;that preceded it, like some of you were, I think this would have been her observation. It certainly was for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vanessaronanpearce_digitalidentitynz-innovation-payments-activity-7229439216848412672-YzKe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">another singer</a>. The buzz in the room was palpable from the very start. Compared to the previous two years, this event saw increased attendance (214 registered, 202 in the room), more international and local speakers, and an increase in panels and roundtable discussions. It’s tangible evidence that Digital Trust is entering the consciousness of more people, accompanied by a desire to ‘get stuff done’. To that end – amongst several other great presentations, panels and exhibits of things currently in progress for those that wish to opt-in – NZTA showcased its&nbsp;<a href="https://nzta.govt.nz/about-us/app/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwt4a2BhD6ARIsALgH7Dp4rtVIKTd5kCl3AqZhTLoLAgzvRz2ym6ebiMtIvag2xz7M_dSomXoaArUTEALw_wcB">NZTA vehicle status app</a>, DINZ member Worldline walked us through its<a href="https://www.paymark.co.nz/blog/safer-faster-simpler-how-a-digital-identity-could-transform-our-day-to-day-lives/">&nbsp;Digital Identity Acceptance Network</a>&nbsp;at POS terminals, and DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xebo.me/">Xebo&nbsp;</a>demonstrated the application of its information assurance platform for a document (quote) using verifiable credentials in the exhibition area. We are hugely grateful to the Hui’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/partners/">partners</a>, speakers and panellists, without whom this fantastic event would not have been possible.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Awareness and education play the most critical role in people’s adoption of these new services. In their absence, misinformation and disinformation fill the vacuum. A case in point is the jaw-dropping statistic from&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final-1.pdf">DINZ’s research published last year</a>&nbsp;regarding the extent to which organisations are trusted to protect identity and use personal data responsibly. Government agencies only scored 51%. And yet,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/information-sharing/approved-information-sharing-agreements/">OPC’s Approved Information Sharing list&nbsp;</a>is much more limited and evidentially contradicts the surveillance conspiracies that swirl around the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly with the opt-in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identity/trust-framework/">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework</a>, where it’s not widely known that it’s primarily targeted at service providers to help keep their clients’ (you and me) information private and secure from fraudsters by introducing best practices, such as adopting protected reusable verifiable credentials that you decide who gets to see – so you are not forced to hand over documents to all and sundry for copying, which carry the risk of targeted data theft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my closing remarks at the Hui, I asked each attendee to consider what single action they can undertake right now to improve Digital Trust in Aotearoa. And I’m asking again here. There is a private-sector-initiated awareness and education module all set to go. Will your organisation step up to its corporate social responsibility in this domain and help sponsor it?&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">Reach out to me</a>&nbsp;if you’re interested to know more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, please take some time to listen to the first of DINZ’s new podcast series, Digital Identity in Focus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ5DHM28YRM&amp;list=PLvjBoMqh1G6_AY36W4nbUdvACyMmjvp8y">here</a>.

  <p>Addressing the Challenges of FAIR Data Implementation</p><p>The paper addresses a critical issue in implementing the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. While many research groups strive to make their data FAIR, they often encounter challenges documenting the context in which data was collected, processed, and analysed. This lack of machine-actionable, contextual metadata frequently renders data less reusable and visible outside the immediate research team.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, the authors present the first version of the Semantic Engine, a tool designed to facilitate the creation of decentralised, machine-actionable metadata schemas. This tool is handy when data is collected across multiple projects and institutions, such as Agri-Food Data Canada.</p><p>Leveraging Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)</p><p>The Semantic Engine is built upon the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a flexible and extensible standard hosted by the Human Colossus Foundation. OCA supports decentralised collaboration and reproducibility by allowing multiple contributors to work on different aspects of a data schema without compromising the integrity of the core data structure. This approach is particularly beneficial in the agri-food sector, where data heterogeneity and decentralised research efforts are expected.</p><p>The Semantic Engine is built upon the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a flexible and extensible standard hosted by the Human Colossus Foundation. OCA supports decentralised collaboration and reproducibility by allowing multiple contributors to work on different aspects of a data schema without compromising the integrity of the core data structure. This approach is particularly beneficial in the agri-food sector, where data heterogeneity and decentralised research efforts are expected.</p><p>Applications and Future Implications</p><p>The Semantic Engine, freely accessible at <a href="https://semanticengine.org/">semanticengine.org</a>, allows researchers to create, edit, and manage OCA-based schemas. It has been thoroughly tested by researchers at the University of Guelph and is designed to be user-friendly for the broader research community.</p><p>The potential applications of OCA and the Semantic Engine extend beyond the agri-food sector. The paper highlights ongoing projects in Canada and Switzerland and the EU Horizon project 'NextGen,' which uses OCA to harmonise semantic data in cardiovascular personalized medicine.</p><p>The release of the "Decentralised Semantics: A Semantic Engine User Perspective" paper represents a significant step forward in making research data more FAIR and usable. By leveraging the Semantic Engine and OCA, researchers can ensure that their data is well-documented, reproducible, and accessible to a broader audience. The Human Colossus Foundation is proud to support this critical work and looks forward to its continued impact on the research community.</p><p>You can access the full paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2024-042">here</a> and explore the Semantic Engine at <a href="https://semanticengine.org/">semanticengine.org</a> for more information.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">GLEIF</a> is pleased to have broadened its engagement and participation in <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP)</a> by becoming a member of the ToIP Steering Committee in March 2024, recognizing the importance of well-functioning governance to the ongoing success of the foundation.&nbsp;GLEIF has been a member of ToIP, as a Founding Contributor member, since May 2020.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>, GLEIF has pioneered a new form of digitized organizational identity to meet the global need for automated identification, authentication and verification of legal entities across a range of industries. By creating the vLEI, GLEIF is now answering to this urgent and unmet need of pioneering a multi-stakeholder effort to create a new global ecosystem for organizational digital identity.</p>



<p>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier vLEI concept is simple: It is the secure digital counterpart of a conventional <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a>. In other words, it is a digitally trustworthy version of the 20-digit LEI code which is automatically verified, without the need for human intervention. The vLEI concept is also very much in-line with ToIP Technical and Governance Frameworks as detailed below.</p>



<p>The vLEI Trust Chain demonstrates the ability to chain the issuance of vLEI credentials as well as providing the foundation for the automated verification of vLEIs back to GLEIF which enable cryptographic verification of the identity of an organization back to its validated LEI identity.</p>







<p>vLEIs go further though in being able to cryptographically tie persons to organizations in the roles in which the persons are representing or engaging with these organizations. vLEI Role Credentials combine three concepts – (1) the organization’s identity, represented by the LEI, (2) a person’s identity and (3) the role that the person plays for the organization.&nbsp;</p>







<p>GLEIF works to advance digital trust standards in the neutral ToIP forum through participation in the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">Ecosystem Foundry Working Group</a>, the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/02/new-issuer-governance-requirements-guide-for-verifiable-credentials-public-comment-needed/">Issuer Requirements Task Force</a> of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">Governance Stack Working Group</a> and as a co-chair of both the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ACDC/KERI Task Force</a> and <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technical Stack Working Group</a>.&nbsp;It is here in which the technical specifications of the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">KERI Suite</a> have been drafted and have begun the process of approval to become published ToIP standards.

 A step-by-step guide from&nbsp;WAO Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/behind-the-scenes-of-our-new-project-on-job-readiness-credentials-30aa9580ca18">recent post</a> we outlined the early stages of our user research and evaluation project with Jobs for the Future (JFF) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Building on that, we also <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/key-questions-for-user-research-design-5edfab6046dd">shared a post</a> on the principles that drive our approach to user research.</p><p>Now, we offer a comprehensive guide for those who are embarking on user research for the first time, or those looking to refine their current practices.*</p> 1. Define the Scope&nbsp;🔍 <p>Every successful project starts with a clear definition of its scope. This involves establishing the “Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How” before taking any further steps. By doing so, we create a shared understanding with our clients, which is vital for ensuring that everyone is on the same page. This clarity enables us to guide the project effectively, making informed decisions at every stage. Without a well-defined scope, projects can easily lose focus, leading to wasted time and resources.</p> 2. Identify Stakeholder Groups&nbsp;👫 <p>Identifying the relevant stakeholders is the next crucial step. Stakeholders are those who have an interest in the outcome of the project or who may be affected by it. For our JFF/IRC project, we concentrated on engaging employers, IRC staff, and, where possible, IRC clients. Each group brought unique insights that enriched our understanding of the Job Readiness Credential’s effectiveness. Engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders ensures that the research reflects a wide range of experiences and perspectives, making the findings more robust and actionable.</p> 3. Create Surveys (Quantitative Data)&nbsp;📊 <p>Once stakeholder groups are identified, we design surveys tailored to each group to gather quantitative data. This data is essential for identifying trends and patterns that might not be immediately obvious. For example, in our work on this project, we developed a survey for employers that asked them to rate various aspects of the Job Readiness Credential, including its design and usability. The data collected provided a solid foundation for further analysis, allowing us to make evidence-based recommendations. Surveys are a powerful tool for collecting data at scale, providing a broad overview that can guide more detailed exploration.</p> 4. Develop a User Research Guide (Qualitative Data)&nbsp;📝 <p>Quantitative data provides a broad picture, but to gain a deeper understanding, we complement it with qualitative research. This involves developing detailed guides for our interviews, which help us stay focused while remaining open to unexpected insights. The qualitative data gathered through interviews adds depth and context to our findings. For instance, while a survey might tell us that a particular feature is unpopular, an interview can reveal the underlying reasons why. By combining quantitative and qualitative data, we create a more comprehensive picture of the user experience.</p> 5. Create Transcripts 🎤 <p>Conducting interviews is only the beginning. To extract meaningful insights, we transcribe the conversations using tools like <a href="http://sonix.ai">Sonix.ai</a>. These transcripts are then reviewed and edited to ensure clarity and accuracy. This step is crucial because it allows us to focus on the most relevant insights without losing any nuance. By thoroughly reviewing the transcripts, we ensure that the final analysis accurately reflects the participants’ perspectives. This meticulous approach to data processing is what allows us to provide our clients with reliable and actionable insights.</p> 6. Apply Snowball Sampling&nbsp;❄️ <p>In some cases, the initial set of stakeholders might not be sufficient to capture the full range of perspectives. This is where snowball sampling comes in. By asking participants to recommend others who might have relevant insights, we can expand our research to include a wider range of voices. For example, in the JFF/IRC project, we explored the possibility of engaging a representative from Indeed, the HRTech platform. This approach allows us to gather additional perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked, ensuring that our research is as comprehensive as&nbsp;possible</p> 7. Use AI to Gain Initial Insights&nbsp;🤖 <p>With the increasing availability of AI tools, we’ve integrated them into our process to generate early insights from the data we collect. Tools like GPT-4o and Claude help us quickly identify key themes and patterns in the data. These AI-generated summaries provide a useful starting point, allowing us to focus our analysis on the most promising areas. However, AI insights are not the final word; we carefully review and refine them, combining them with our own expertise to ensure a balanced and nuanced analysis. This approach allows us to work more efficiently without sacrificing quality.</p> 8. Synthesise Findings&nbsp;📚 <p>After collecting and analysing both quantitative and qualitative data, we synthesise the findings into a comprehensive report. This report brings together the survey results, interview insights, AI-generated perspectives, and our own analysis. The goal is to provide our clients with a clear and actionable summary of our findings. We often create both a visual summary and a more detailed report. The visual summary is designed for quick reference, while the detailed report offers a deeper dive into the data, providing clients with the insights they need to make informed decisions. By presenting our findings in this way, we ensure that our research is not only informative but also practical and easy to&nbsp;use.</p> Conclusion <p>At We Are Open Co-op, user research is all about helping people make better decisions with insights they can trust. Our experience with the Job Readiness Credential project shows how dedicated we are to this&nbsp;work.</p><p>We’re here to support you in your own research efforts, whether you’re just starting out or looking to refine your approach. As our work progresses, we’ll continue to share insights that can help you make the most of your user research&nbsp;journey.</p><p>* Note that user research and user testing can get very involved and scientific. Going into more detail and depth is definitely important if you are doing things at scale. This post is aimed at encouraging those who may not have in-house capacity to get started for the first&nbsp;time!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/demystifying-user-research-e345d309abab">Demystifying User Research</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Disentis, July 28 to August 9</p><p>Nestled amidst the majestic Swiss Alps and the picturesque Disentis Monastery, the 2024 Summer Academy of the German <a href="https://www.studienstiftung.de">Studientstiftung des deutschen Volkes </a>and <a href="https://www.studienstiftung.de/pool/sdv/public/documents/Max_Weber-Programm/studienstiftung_max_weber_programm_broschuere.pdf">Max Weber Programm</a> was an inspiring setting for over 70 passionate students. Among them, six vibrant working groups explored pressing societal matters, ranging from sustainability to digital health. One such group took on the challenge of envisioning a secure and inclusive European Health Data Space (EHDS).</p>





















  
  






  <p>A vision for the future of health data.</p><p>With the recent legislative work of the European Parliament and Council, the European Union is taking a visionary step towards establishing the EHDS. Beyond its benefits for patients and research, the EHDS has the potential to leverage digital technologies to significantly enhance the resilience and long-term sustainability of Europe's universal healthcare systems, provide a unique economic advantage, and set global standards in privacy, individual protection, and data governance. </p><p>For a European health data space that can be adopted by everyone (including patients!), individuals must rely on a system that embeds information security by design. A working group approached the question by leveraging the participants' diverse perspectives as stakeholders in a European Health Data Space.</p>





















  
  






  <p>Under the leadership of Philippe Page from the Human Colossus Foundation's Research Council, an international team of eleven students from diverse disciplines embarked on the mission to address key aspects of the EHDS. Their goal was to create a safe, accessible, and economically viable solution that would benefit patients and researchers alike.</p><p>Three guiding questions anchored their deliberations:</p>  <p>How might EHDS revolutionize medical research pathways via expanded data accessibility?</p>  <p>What measures could ensure the EHDS contributes to the EU economy without compromising health data privacy from commercial exploitation?</p>  <p>Which components constitute a secure, scalable infrastructure that meets the EHDS expectations and security demands? Would such an implementation prove sustainable?</p>  <p>The working group organized itself into three distinct focus groups, each addressing specific themes related to the broader topic. These subgroups operated autonomously throughout the sessions, diving into their subjects. Daily, the working group would collaborate in a collective session to share insights on primary/secondary data usage, discuss findings, and harmonize perspectives to manage risks in commercial usage. Through these collaborative efforts, the participants crafted a first draft of a position paper encompassing essential questions about the future development of the EHDS.</p>





















  
  














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                

            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>In conclusion, the Human Colossus Foundation thanks the organisers for creating space for bringing new ideas forwards in a manner respecting everyone’s perspective. The vision initiated during the retreat in Disentis Monastery is just the beginning. With plans to reconvene in 2025, the group aims to build upon its foundational ideas. Its aim is to create a safer, more inclusive European Health Data Space that sets global benchmarks in privacy, individual protection, data use in research, and data governance.</p>

 Databases on Ceramic <p>OrbisDB has emerged as a premier database solution for the Ceramic Network. Building on the foundation laid by ComposeDB, OrbisDB brings significant advancements in functionality, performance, and user experience. This blog post will elaborate on the connection between Ceramic and OrbisDB, highlight OrbisDB's new features, and showcase its value to developers.</p> ComposeDB: The Original Building Block <p>ComposeDB was the first database and has become an integral technology for many decentralized applications built on Ceramic, such as <a href="https://www.passport.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Passport.xyz</a>, <a href="https://www.zuzalu.city/dashboard/home?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Zuzalu City</a>, <a href="https://charmverse.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CharmVerse</a>, and <a href="https://www.lateral.io/desci?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Lateral DeSci</a>.</p><p>ComposeDB has been instrumental in dapp development on Ceramic because it introduces a robust, scalable, and user-friendly approach to data management. It supports structured data models, advanced queries, and the integration of decentralized identities, all while leveraging <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/revolutionizing-data-publishing-why-ceramic-shifted-from-multicast-to-pairwise-synchronization/">Ceramic's fast performance and high transaction capacity</a>.</p> OrbisDB: A Practical Evolution <p>3Box Labs designed Ceramic as an open network upon which an ecosystem of data-handling solutions could emerge. <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/composedb-is-live-on-ceramic-mainnet/">We launched ComposeDB in 2023</a> as the first database service on the network. </p><p>While ComposeDB represented the first database service offered on Ceramic and introduced many advancements for interacting with Ceramic, the need for simple onboarding, hosted nodes, SQL, and easy integrations with other services led the Orbis team to create OrbisDB.</p><p>Built initially as the Ceramic-based infrastructure for Orbis Social, OrbisDB evolved from a template implementation used by leading crypto projects such as Iggy Social, CoinEasy, Autonolas, and Gitcoin Schelling Point, into a slick set of interface services for data on Ceramic, including a UI for no code deployment, integrated hosting, support for additional languages, and a blue sea of possibilities made possible by plugins.</p> Key Upgrades with OrbisDB   Simplified Ceramic Developer Experience:  Rapid Ceramic Onboarding: OrbisDB offers a web app and SDK for storing and managing datasets on Ceramic, no-code, or CLI.  Hosted nodes: OrbisDB makes Ceramic DevOps easy with an in-built hosted node service.  Accelerated Customization: Extend the functionality of your database with plugins. Build plugins for other developers.      Database Language Choice:  SQL Queries: Using PostgreSQL as its indexing database, OrbisDB offers scalable performance and the benefits of traditional scaling methods.  GraphQL: (already available on ComposeDB) and vector embeddings are both in development.    Plugin Ecosystem:  Optional and Versatile: Developers can easily add plugins to OrbisDB. These plugins are optional and designed to perform operations beyond the core's scope, providing additional functionality and connections to other blockchain services. Recently released plugins for Dune (link) and Base (link) make data visualization and importing on-chain data from any Base smart contract code-free and straightforward.  Open source: Plugins are open source. Users can build and share plugins with other developers in the ecosystem.  Do anything with plugins:  Combine on-chain transactions from Base or other EVMs with verifiable data on Ceramic (e.g., enable mutable and verifiable metadata)  Provide sybil-resistance and instant reputation score to all user-generated data using Passport.xyz or Verax attestations.  Easily token-gate your applications via pre-defined indexing logic  Resolve ENS Domain names directly from any datasets in one click  Enable a single query from multiple data sources (API, on-chain, Ceramic data, etc.)      <p>Get Early Access to OrbisDB Studio</p><p>OrbisDB represents a practical evolution of databases on Ceramic, building upon the foundations laid by ComposeDB and significantly improving experience, languages, and interoperability.</p><p>Projects have already started building on OrbisDB in beta, including Index Network, Plurality, and Flashcards, for various use cases, including a blockchain event listener and storing encrypted user data and educational content.</p><p>We're excited to work with Orbis to support the future of decentralized data management. OrbisDB Studio, accessible later this year, will offer the developer experience improvements discussed above. <a href="https://app.formo.so/hJ5VGyugmGigyVFyqdHJa?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Sign up here to get on the waitlist for early access</a>. </p><p>Learn more about OrbisDB at <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">useorbis.com</a></p>

<p>It’s cybersecurity season in Las Vegas and I’m inspired to write an overdue post on why I hate the phrase “cyber civil defense”. Actually, I don’t hate the phrase, I disagree with its usage. Being the literal sort I am, I have to of course start with a long look at what the three words seem to mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cyber: aka technology; though perhaps a more detailed definition would include “software driven” and “internet connected” as necessary attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civil: in this context, I think it means “citizens” or just “people”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Defense: The catch with this term is that it’s unclear what or who is being defended and by what or whom. For instance, this innocuous three-word phrase could mean any number of things:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Civilians defending “cyber” [tech] from other civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Civilians defending other people from civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending civilians from other civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending civilians from tech.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending tech from civilians. (ew.)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>I could go on but my head hurts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civilian defense seems to imply a kind of volunteer force to defend people from cyber threats (what kinds of threats?).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s where the wheels fall off this phrase: what about when the call’s coming from inside the house? Meaning, what about when the technology—as designed and with perfect integrity—is itself harmful to people? I’m not fine with using the phrase in the context or implication of defending people from risks from commercial technology itself because doing so:&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Reinforces that it’s acceptable for commercial technology (i.e. commercial products) to be a thing that civilians need to protect themselves from,&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Gaslights people into thinking that it’s somehow their responsibility to protect themselves against commercial technology that is evolving faster than the governance around it, bolstered by staggering amounts of financial resources, and whose risks are admittedly poorly understood by the makers themselves, but with just a little more elbow grease, you, dear user, can maybe be marginally less at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Smacks a bit of a military operation. I don’t want to join an army, I just want to have reasonably safe technology products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>– Also it’s a smidge paternalistic. (I can almost hear the “little lady” in there…)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is we already have a phrase to describe risks of commercial products on humans. It’s called Product Safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But product safety is an abject failure when it comes to commercial software and software-driven technology. In the US we have a dedicated product safety commission, but their scope hasn’t been updated since 2008, and was hamstrung by budgetary contractions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. Other agencies pick up pieces of product safety in the style of the blind men and the elephant, using their granted powers to maximum effect. The failure, however, is with the law makers. We have not updated ideas of “products” and “product safety” to keep pace with the internet age and citizens pay the price every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, from my research, it usually does take around 50 years after the launch of a new commercial product for US product safety laws to emerge, so we’re depressingly on time. For example, seatbelts became mandatory on January 1, 1968, sixty years after the commercial launch of the Fort Model T.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU recognized this gap in 2023 with their <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/general-product-safety-regulation-2023.html">updated product safety law</a>. As we in the US still wait for a federal privacy law, perhaps we can leapfrog ahead to a reimagined federal product safety law. Good news: we at ISL have tons of data, know-how, and tools to support this; it doesn’t have to start from scratch. But it would take extraordinary intestinal fortitude on behalf of the lawmakers to create something that meaningfully throttles the myriad risks technology foists upon us today. It would take precise regulation and a financially backed commitment to enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won’t be holding my breath, but we are absolutely here for that moment if and when it comes. Meanwhile, in the likely event the US government continues to ignore product safety for technology, ISL will continue to champion the safety of all tech users through our maturing safety labels and research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Our approach to the nexus of user research and user&nbsp;testing <p>WAO often starts projects with a bit of user research: asking your stakeholders and audience, users and even friends to give you some insight is always time well spent. After all, we all bring our own biases and experience, and user research can help surface some of those to better serve other&nbsp;people.</p><p>While there are, of course, specialised organisations and more or less complex user research projects, user research is something that you and your organisation can do yourself!. Even talking to five people about your project will give you a wealth of ideas and perspectives on how to improve things for your stakeholders.</p><p>In this post, we’re going to look at a few important considerations to make as you start the design of your user research. Read on to find out how you can bootstrap your first user research&nbsp;project.</p> Are you doing user research or user&nbsp;testing? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>We use the term ‘user research’ when we’re trying to figure out how to serve users better, whereas ‘user testing’ is when you have a prototype and you want to observe how people respond to it. We often do research that sits at the nexus of these two things — we ask questions as well as showing prototypes and ideas. However, rather than simply observing how people use them, which is what you would traditionally do in “user testing”, we talk to people about what they are experiencing. This allows us to both test ideas while also deepening our understanding of our users’&nbsp;needs.</p> Who are&nbsp;‘users’? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The word ‘User’ is sort of a confusing word in the research context. Sometimes we are, indeed, talking to users of a platform or product, but more often than not, we’re talking to people who are involved in a programme or project, but not necessarily as ‘users’. If you are having trouble figuring out who to talk to, you may want to reframe the term ‘user’ into ‘participant’ and reconceptualise ‘user research’ as just ‘talking to people’. Having a structured conversation with the people you are trying to serve is how you can create systems, process and, yes, products that are relevant and valuable.</p><p>The goal of this kind of research is to understand what people need and want, and the behaviours they have. This can help make programme, project or product design better. It can also help your communication and marketing.</p><p>The first thing you’ll want to do when designing a user research project is to think about the types of people you are designing for and see if you can talk to them. Our <a href="https://weareopen.coop">Learn with WAO</a> site has some activities to help you think about who these people are. Perhaps start with <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/stakeholder-mapping/">Stakeholder Mapping</a> and then see if you can apply your learnings in the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/persona-mapping/">Persona Mapping</a> activity.</p> Can you be more inclusive? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>While you need to be targeted in the specific types of people you talk to, it’s also important to ensure that you have a diverse range of participants for your user research. It’s important to be inclusive, which means that you don’t overlook people or groups that you might not associate as ‘users’. Once you’ve figured out the stakeholders and/or spectrum of personas you want to talk to, make sure you have diversity in your&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Diversity and inclusion is an intentional act, so if you realise that you do not have a racially, geographically, social-economically and gender diverse group of participants, you’ll need to do more outreach. It is perfectly acceptable to contact people within your network to ask for help finding diverse participants. You can also use social media and hashtags.</p><p>Sometimes, we use what’s called “snowball sampling” to help us find more participants. We simply ask people who have already volunteered to participate if they know someone who might also be willing to participate. This works well, but beware, snowball sampling can actually lead to less diverse groups because of the way network effect works. It can also lead to ‘scope creep’ where your project ends up being much larger than initially defined. So watch out for&nbsp;that!</p> What kind of data should you&nbsp;collect? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Effective user research combines both quantitative and qualitative methods. While quantitative data provides measurable insights, qualitative research helps to understand the context and motivations behind user behaviours, leading to deeper insights.</p><p>One of the tactics we like is to use surveys first. This allows us to collect quantitative data as well as to expand our recruitment pool for user research interviews. We ask “May we talk to you more about your answers?” And if the survey respondent answers yes, we ask for their contact information.</p><p>Once you have people to talk to, you need a set of questions to ask. A user research guide helps you ensure some rigour and can be used to steer interviews. You need to avoid leading questions, questions that have the answer in the question (e.g. things like “Isn’t this prototype beautiful and easy to use?”) Use open-ended questions, neutral language and avoid assumptions. It can help to test your questions on friends or colleagues!</p><p>Another point to note is that, as you carry out the user research interviews, you’ll learn things about the project and about the needs and desires of participants. You will need to balance asking similar questions (for fairness and reliability), with perhaps slightly different ones as the landscape becomes&nbsp;clearer.</p> Next steps cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In the end, user research is all about getting to know what your users need and want from your project, programme, product or service. The best way to get that information is to find a diverse group of people and talk to them in any way you can! Then, you can gather your data and present it in a way that tells a story about what your next steps should&nbsp;be.</p><p>Need help? We do this a lot, get in&nbsp;touch!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/key-questions-for-user-research-design-5edfab6046dd">Key Questions for User Research Design</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>To mark the entry into force of the eIDAS Regulation 2.0 in May 2024, the Blockchain Berlin news platform has published a comprehensive review of the IDunion research project’s work over the past three years.</p>

<p>While the original aim of the project was to develop a decentralised identity management system based on blockchain, the project was subsequently refocused on federated data storage using the OpenID4VC protocol family developed by the consortium partners. The integration of these protocols into the eIDAS 2.0 Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) by the EU confirms IDunion’s expertise and its important contribution to digitalisation in Europe.</p>

<p>The article presents various possible use cases for digital credentials, such as the digital student ID card of the TU Berlin or the digital product passport for seamless identification and transparency of product sustainability data. </p>

 New Initiative to Drive Sustainability, Circular Economy, and Data Interoperability Across&nbsp;Europe <p>In response to the sustainability and circularity data sharing needs highlighted in the EU Green Deal and the new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), the European Commission adopted the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) in March 2022. This regulation establishes the Digital Product Passport (DPP) system, designed to provide essential information on a need-to-know basis to support sustainable production and enable the transition to a circular economy. The DPP aims to boost material and energy efficiency, extend product lifetimes, and optimize product design, manufacturing, use, and end-of-life handling.</p><p>Beyond facilitating sustainability and circularity-related data sharing among economic operators along value chains, the DPP is intended to create new business opportunities through digital and circular value retention and optimization, such as product-as-a-service, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. It also helps consumers make sustainable choices and allows authorities to verify compliance with legal obligations.</p><p>Currently, there are numerous initiatives for such data sharing systems at the industry sector, platform, or individual company level. However, there is a lack of standardization in data definition, data format, and IT infrastructure, which hinders cross-sectoral interoperability. To address this, the EU Commission initiated the CIRPASS Coordination and Support Action (CSA) in October 2022, with the project set to conclude in March 2024. The focus is on batteries, electronics, and textile sectors. By the project’s end, CIRPASS will propose a clear cross-sectoral definition and description of the DPP system, identify key data for circularity, and define requirements for product identification and data exchange protocols to support further legislative and standardization developments.</p><p>To ensure inclusivity, an open call for pilot proposals was widely disseminated, forming the CIRPASS-2 project consortium, which will run from May 2024 until April 2027. Alongside 17 partners, CIRPASS-2 will demonstrate functioning Digital Product Passports in real-world settings through circular pilot deployments and use cases in textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, tires, and construction value&nbsp;chains.</p><p>CIRPASS-2 will show that the DPP, as a digital transformation initiative, helps strengthen the Union’s resilience and data sovereignty. It will develop a DPP data space fully aligned with Europe’s ongoing efforts in this field (such as SIMPL and DSSC) and emphasize interoperability based on harmonized standards. The focus on open source and architecture will also foster the EU data economy while ensuring compliance with data regulations. By taking the conceptualized DPP and pilot solutions and deploying them at scale, CIRPASS-2 aims to bridge the gap between digital technology research and market deployment. The project will contribute directly to Digital Europe Programme (DEP) objectives through its results and will provide extensive policy and business recommendations to further these&nbsp;goals.</p><p>CIRPASS-2 is an Innovation Action project funded by the European Commission’s Digital Europe Programme, running from May 2024 until April 2027. With 13 lighthouse pilots, the project will demonstrate functioning DPPs in real settings and at scale across four target value chains: textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, tires, and construction materials. Additionally, CIRPASS-2 will create a broad community of DPP stakeholders to facilitate the deployment of DPPs in various product sectors across Europe and&nbsp;beyond.</p> About Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Energy Web is a global non-profit organization accelerating the energy transition by developing and deploying open-source decentralized technologies.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO</p>



<p>In a significant move to bolster software security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations have released new guidance that organizations can use to demand better security from their software vendors.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-demand-guide">Secure by Demand Guide: How Software Customers Can Drive a Secure Technology Ecosystem</a> underscores the pivotal role that software customers play in digital supply chain security. The guide outlines high-priority security requirements from the earliest stages of software development, a principle central to creating “secure by design” products.</p>



<p>Among the items highlighted are phishing-resistant authentication methods, such as <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, as a default feature in software products. Announced on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at Black Hat USA, this new guidance represents a vital step forward in securing the digital supply chain in the United States and worldwide.</p>



 Secure by Demand, Secure by Design 



<p>This new guidance complements CISA’s recent <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/Shifting-the-Balance-of-Cybersecurity-Risk-Principles-and-Approaches-for-Secure-by-Design-Software.pdf">Secure by Design Guide</a> aimed at technology manufacturers to improve their software product security. By focusing on the procurement aspect in the supply chain, the new guidance advises software buyers to demand modern security features from technology manufacturers, such as phishing-resistant authentication and passkeys. By doing so, customers can drive demand for security as a baseline feature and compel technology manufacturers to adhere to secure design practices.</p>



<p>The guidance also includes an assessment to evaluate software security and include security requirements in contracts. It encourages a proactive procurement approach, where a buyer can assess a manufacturer’s security and capabilities to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience. The guide establishes best practices for secure software procurement and highlights the product security features that bolster supply chain security and interoperability.</p>



 Passkeys Take Center Stage 



<p>CISA’s guidance aligns with the recent guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in their digital identity guidelines on authentication and lifecycle management. In supplemental guidance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/nist-cites-phishing-resistance-of-synced-passkeys-in-digital-identity-guidelines-update/">NIST SP 800-63Bsup1</a>, NIST affirmed that synced passkeys meet Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) requirements and device-bound passkeys satisfy Authentication Assurance Level 3 (AAL3). The two guidance documents emphasize the importance of security, including digital identity and authentication best practices, across the digital supply chain.</p>



<p>The Secure by Demand guidance empowers IT buyers, who can drive market demand for secure software features, such as passkeys and FIDO authentication. Given that weak or stolen passwords account for <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/resources/reports/global-password-security-report">80% of hacking-related breaches</a> and <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/100067-report-shows-1265-increase-in-phishing-emails-since-chatgpt-launched">credential phishing has skyrocketed by 967%</a> since 2022, buyers can use the guide’s security assessment to evaluate software security, including passkey capabilities, and improve security risk management in the supply chain. With this guidance, CISA aims to increase awareness and drive market demand for secure software.</p>



 Key Recommendations for Software Manufacturers 



<p>CISA’s Secure by Demand guide outlines several critical requirements that customers should evaluate when procuring software, and includes questions to assess a software manufacturer’s security capabilities in the following areas:</p>



 
 Authentication: Manufacturers should support secure, standards-based Single Sign-On (SSO) and implement phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) or passkeys — by default, and at no extra cost. 



 Eliminating Vulnerabilities: Systematic efforts should be made to address and prevent classes of software defects, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. 



 Secure Defaults: Security logs should be provided to customers without additional charges, ensuring transparency and accountability in software security. 



 Supply Chain Security: Ensuring the provenance of third-party dependencies via Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and robust processes for integrating open-source components are vital. 



 Vulnerability Disclosure: Transparency and timely reporting of vulnerabilities, including authorization for security testing by the public, is crucial for maintaining trust and improving security outcomes. 
 



 A Call to Action for Security Leaders 



<p>The guidance for those manufacturing or procuring software across the software supply chain is clear: passkeys improve third-party supply chains and ensure higher security standards in software procurement and development processes. By integrating passkeys into authentication processes, organizations can strengthen end-to-end digital identity lifecycle management and significantly reduce the risks of phishing and social engineering attacks.</p>

Here is WHY knowledge graphs (KGs) are so important for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) helps power trust at Internet&nbsp;scale.</p> Knowledge Graphs in support of reliability of the&nbsp;GenAI <p>KGs act as intelligent maps for AI, aiding in understanding connections, explaining decisions, enhancing learning through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to reduce hallucination and bias in&nbsp;AI.</p><p><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/">Initially developed by Meta</a>, RAG is a type of AI system that combines two main tasks: retrieving information and generating answers. Think of it like a smart assistant that not only looks up facts but also puts them together in a way that makes sense. By using KGs, RAG systems become smarter and more reliable.</p><p>They can understand questions better, provide accurate answers, connect different ideas, search quickly, show their sources, and bring together knowledge from various topics. This helps users find the information they need and helps drive more reliable AI based on the transparent use of knowledge sources.</p> Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG): Trust the&nbsp;Source <p>“We live in a time of abundant connectivity and alas abundant misinformation.

<p>In response to Graeme Muller’s open letter from NZTech to New Zealand Government officials, DINZ and its Biometrics Special Interest Group wish to emphasise our support for the concerns raised. The letter, published yesterday, highlights significant concerns about the OPC’s proposed Code of Practice for biometrics, which could negatively impact businesses, innovation, and the economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“DINZ is fully committed to supporting the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). We believe that privacy-enhancing technologies introduced by our industry can complement the OPC’s role in protecting privacy. Collaboration between the OPC and businesses should not be seen as a trade-off but as a partnership with mutual benefits.” says Steven Graham, Head of Biometrics (ANZ) &amp; Innovation, NEC New Zealand Limited and Chair of DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group.</p>



<p>Following the publication of this letter the Privacy Commissioner reached out to NZTech CEO Graeme Muller to assure NZTech members that the process is far from finished, they are still reviewing the feedback and there will be further opportunities for stakeholders to engage. Given how important biometrics are for privacy, productivity and economic growth, DINZ, and NZTech look forward to the OPC publishing their proposed next steps and engaging in real consultation with experts in biometrics.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>



<p>The spread of misinformation is evolving around the world at a concerning pace. Bad actors are finding new battlegrounds and frontiers every day, and information and images generated by AI are being used to push political agendas and false narratives, scam and steal money and identities, and, even worse, lure online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, AI is also evolving rapidly, with risks as significant as the benefits. Further, now that AI is generative, users can manipulate images and information at unprecedented speed and scale, and vast amounts of inaccurate and malicious information make it difficult for people and organizations to verify information authenticity.</p>



<p>In today’s era of information warfare, authenticity and verification must be prioritized — particularly given the role of digital trust and identity verification in the delivery of government and business services.</p>



<p>Our submission and recommendations reflect the deep experience and expertise of DIACC’s member organizations, and our collective commitment to working with leaders in both the public and private sectors to secure verifiable information authenticity to the benefit of government, industry, and citizens alike by prioritizing inclusive and accessible privacy-protecting digital trust and verification capabilities.</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, with a goal to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>DIACC is guided by a belief that our public safety, civic engagement, and economic prosperity depend on leveraging trusted solutions and using well-established risk mitigation and certification tools. DIACC is committed to accelerating digital trust adoption and reducing information authenticity uncertainty by certifying services against its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework — a risk mitigation and assurance framework developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts that signals trustworthy design rooted in security, privacy, inclusivity, accessibility, and accountability.</p>



<p>Recommendations</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Citizen Services; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety; and 



 Digital Trust in Business and Industry. 
 



<p>Digital Trust in Citizen Services</p>



<p>DIACC advocates for digital trust in citizen services, emphasizing the importance of secure, privacy-respecting, and user-centric solutions through collaboration between government, private sector, and civil society. Leveraging our collaborative partnerships, we developed the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) – a risk mitigation and assurance framework that extends standards and open source code to help service providers ensure risk mitigation and user care.</p>



<p>As public services continue to move online, digital trust and verification services will be critical for ensuring that services are secure and accessible. From online healthcare consultations to digital government services, these technologies provide the necessary security infrastructure to protect public interactions and data.</p>



<p>Through partnerships with organizations such as DIACC, the government is encouraged to prioritize innovation in digital trust technologies through pilot projects, research, and education. Collaboration with various sectors will ensure the development and implementation of secure, efficient, inclusive, and accessible digital trust solutions, fostering a reliable digital ecosystem for accessing healthcare, banking, and government services.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory</p>



<p>Canadians benefit from being a highly banked jurisdiction with broad inclusivity and accessibility – according to the Canadian Bankers Association, approximately 99 per cent of Canadian adults have a bank account.</p>



<p>Existing financial regulations provide powerful and internationally recognized tools that act as a solid foundation to fight fraud and foster a more verified, authentic, and trustworthy ecosystem that supports the needs of people, governments, and businesses alike. However, the government is encouraged to build on the existing regulatory framework and develop new regulations to facilitate secure digital transactions, including compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.</p>



<p>Further, digital trust and verification services will be critical as the government moves forward with its commitments to open-banking, with interoperability also being paramount as the federal framework and existing provincial frameworks work together.</p>



<p>Similarly, the government has committed to reducing incidents of mortgage fraud and strengthening proof of borrower and title insurance, and digital trust and verification services can and should play a critical role in making that commitment a reality.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Safety</p>



<p>DIACC believes that implementing digital trust and verification services are essential for enhancing public safety. Digital verification can play a crucial role in protecting vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities.</p>



<p>By ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive areas such as schools, healthcare facilities, and care homes, digital trust services can help safeguard these groups from potential harm. Further, digital trust and verification services enable secure and reliable cross-border identity verification, facilitating international collaboration in law enforcement, disaster response, and public health.</p>



<p>By prioritizing advanced authentication methods that ensure individuals and organizations are who they claim to be, we can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and critical infrastructure, minimize financial scams and misuse of personal data, and enhance public safety for all Canadians.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Business and Industry</p>



<p>Enhanced security is a primary benefit of digital trust and verification services for businesses and industries. These services provide robust security measures that protect businesses from fraud, identity theft, and cyber threats. Ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information and resources, these services help maintain the integrity of business operations.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust in business and industry and implementing authentication and verification tools, the government can help drive the following benefits:</p>



 
 streamlined business processes by automating identity verification and reducing the need for manual checks; 



 faster, more efficient operations and reduced administrative costs, allowing businesses to allocate resources more effectively; 



 data minimization and the secure handling of personal information, increasing customer confidence; 



 a competitive advantage for Canadian businesses by helping them innovate and offer their customers new, secure digital services; and 



 a reduction in incidents of fraud, resulting in significant cost savings for businesses. These savings can be reinvested into other business areas, driving growth and innovation and improving overall business performance. 
 



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>In today’s world, where AI is becoming smarter every day, and information can be generated and manipulated at unprecedented speed and scale, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of information is critical. It is vital to maximize the benefits of an AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-fueled data ecosystem for Canada while also fostering citizen trust and protecting their safety.</p>



<p>To effectively address the challenges we’re facing while realizing the benefits of AI, the federal government should prioritize verification and authentication tools as part of its broader AI strategy. Prioritization must include funding, collaboration, and urgent action to support the development, adoption and certification of tools that verify information authenticity while protecting privacy and empowering Canadians. Governments, banks, telcos, tech companies, media organizations, and civil society must work together to deploy open, standards-based solutions and services to verify the authenticity of information.</p>



<p>The economic imperative of investing in these capabilities is clear. According to a <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting/perspectives/generative-ai-in-finance.html">study</a> by Deloitte, the Canadian economy could unlock an additional 7 per cent (CAD $7 trillion) in economic value through AI and AGI technologies. People and organizations can only realize this potential for the good of society by investing in tools, processes, and policies that support verifying the authenticity of the information generated and processed by AI and AGI technologies.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Today, solutions can signal verified trust by getting certified against a technology-neutral risk and assurance framework like DIACC’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts.</p>



<p>Verifiable information authenticity relies on critical principles, including provenance and traceability: provenance establishes the origin and history of information, ensuring it comes from a reliable source, while traceability allows for audibility of the flow of information, enabling people, businesses, and governments to verify its accuracy and authenticity. These principles are essential in combating the spread of misinformation and disinformation, which can have far-reaching consequences in an AI-fueled world.</p>



<p>Provenance and traceability are potent information authenticity tools that can help:</p>



 
 businesses and professionals reduce liabilities and meet obligations to verify information about their clients and their operations; 



 citizens and residents interact securely and efficiently with governments; 



 customers and clients transact with privacy and security anywhere, anytime; 



 industries manage decision-making and securely supply chains using trusted data; 



 producers verify essential data related to environmental, safety, and operational goals and 



 creators track intellectual property to ensure fair payment and cultural protection. 
 



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>Our public safety, civic engagement, and economic prosperity depend on leveraging trusted solutions, well-established risk mitigation and certification tools, and powerful collaboration to ensure regulations set informed guardrails that put people’s benefits, protections and agency to control data at the center of the design. The evolving AI-fueled information landscape presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities for innovation and progress. By prioritizing verifiable information authenticity, inclusive and accessible solutions, &nbsp;and investing in digital trust, we can ensure that people and organizations realize the benefits of AI and AGI while mitigating its risks<br><br>Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide our input in advance of Budget 2025 and as we collectively move forward on the path to a digitally and economically prosperous Canada.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity in the Age of GenAI: Coping with the Exponential Web of Change</p>



<p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses face a paradoxical challenge: while digital transformation fuels revenue growth, it also exposes them to escalating cyber threats.On the one hand, more than half of the global GDP is driven by digitally transformed organizations by now (<a href="https://financesonline.com/digital-transformation-statistics/">IDC, 2020</a>). On the other hand, this digital revolution, while fostering economic growth and innovation, also ushers in an era of unprecedented cybersecurity risks. Cybercrime damages are expected to reach a staggering <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damage-costs-10-trillion-by-2025/">$10.5 trillion annually by 2025</a> roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/">10% of the projected global GDP</a>, with a concerning annual growth rate of 15%. The complexity and scale of these threats highlight the inadequacy of traditional cybersecurity approaches and the urgent need for a paradigm shift.</p>



<p>As we embrace the power of Generative AI to transform most aspects of society, its exponential growth and capabilities bring about new risks and challenges.</p>

<p>Hell, we’ve been up and starting for one month short of eighteen years. Across that whole time, we’ve been pushing the idea that free customers are more valuable—to themselves, to sellers, to the whole marketplace—than captive ones.</p>
<p>And I’m more optimistic than ever that we’ll prove that idea in the next few years.</p>
<p>Toward that ambition, here are some links in tabs I’m closing:</p>

After giving instructions (which I just followed, surprised that I hadn’t turned this shit off), he explains, “The deeper they hide stuff like this, the more it shows they understand that it’s not in your best interest to have it on. The Apple billboards are all about protecting you from tracking. I haven’t seen one yet that was more like Connect and share with brands you love! (please let me know if you see any Apple billboards like this) Information has value in a market. When your browser passes information about you—<a href="https://blog.zgp.org/pet-projects-or-privacy/">even in a form that is supposed to prevent individual tracking</a>—you’re rewarding risky and problematic advertising practices along with the legit ones.

 Registry enables tracing and tracking of sustainable aviation fuel with the help of Energy Web and Polkadot technologies <p>The Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificate or SAFc registry was recently launched to support major consumers of air travel and transport in their efforts to help directly decarbonize flight. The registry’s design, development, and testing was spearheaded by nonprofit organizations RMI and the Environmental Defense Fund, that work through the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), an organization whose members include major airlines, fuel providers, and sustainable aviation buyers such as Novo Nordisk looking to reduce the climate impacts of air transport.</p><p>The <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a> connects corporate consumers, airlines, freight forwarders, and clean fuel providers in one universally accessible platform that will spur the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by ensuring that SAF certificates purchased outside of the platform are delivered consistently, verifiably, transparently, and credibly. The registry builds on industry best practices and was subject to public consultation to ensure SAF certificates exchanged realize their intended environmental impact and can be claimed towards emissions reduction goals.</p><p>SAF is made from renewable or waste materials and can decrease the lifecycle emissions of flight by more than 80%. However, the fuel is not yet widely available and can be significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. The Registry helps address this market gap by connecting corporate demand for emissions reductions to SAF producers through an auditable ledger for certificates which decouples the emissions benefits of SAF use from the physical fuel supply. It is the final piece of market infrastructure — in addition to robust <a href="https://rsb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RSB-PRO-20-001-001-RSB-Book-and-Claim-Manual-3.0.pdf">standards</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificate-safc-emissions-accounting-and-reporting-guidelines/">book &amp; claim accounting guidelines</a>, and structured <a href="https://flysaba.org/2023/04/04/first-collective-purchase-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates/">RFPs</a> — to create a robust and de-risked market for SAFc investment.</p><p><a href="https://flysaba.org/2024/04/17/sustainable-aviation-buyers-alliance-announces-historic-agreements-to-purchase-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates-to-grow-investment-in-clean-fuel-technologies/">Major customers have already banded together via SABA to collectively procure SAF certificates</a>. Several of these deals will use the SAFc Registry as the delivery mechanism. Future procurement efforts inside and outside of SABA can use the SAFc Registry to seamlessly ensure the delivery of SAF certificates and sustainability assurances to buyers. Q8Aviation, an international jet fuel supplier delivering sustainable aviation fuel to the aviation market, recently enrolled to the registry saying, “We look forward to leveraging the SAFc registry to expand accessibility and support broader adoption of&nbsp;SAF.”</p><p>Additionally, climate tech company CHOOOSE is complementing the registry with features to streamline the flow of SAF transactions across the value chain. “At CHOOOSE, we build and operate software that supports airlines, freight forwarders, clean fuel providers, and corporate buyers in scaling their sustainable aviation fuel programs. Recognizing the vital role SAF plays in helping to decarbonize the aviation industry, these programs contribute meaningfully to SAF’s adoption. By leveraging systems like book and claim, the SAFc Registry ensures the secure transfer of certificates — and when coupled with CHOOOSE technology, SAF transactions become more automated, streamlined, and accessible. Through this partnership, we’re able to accelerate the use of SAF across the sector,” said Gaute Gamst, Chief Technology Officer at&nbsp;CHOOOSE.</p><p>Web 3 technologies play an important role in operation of the SAFc Registry in order to provide deep transparency to end-users. With the support of so-called worker nodes anchored and supported by the Energy Web X blockchain on Polkadot, actions on the SAFc Registry are checked, validated, and digitally recorded in a zero trust, tamper proof way. For registry users, the public, and auditors, this represents a continuous audit of registry operations.</p><p><a href="https://safcregistry.org/">For more information, please visit the SAFc registry&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>Notes to&nbsp;Editors:</p><p>About Energy Web Foundation:</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

 Championing European Gymnastics with Borderless Knowledge enabled by Artificial Intelligence and OriginTrail <p><a href="https://www.europeangymnastics.com/">European Gymnastics</a> is a sports organisation counting 50 national member federations, and reaches beyond the borders of political Europe. It nevertheless bears the idea of a united gymnastics nation. As guarantor of interests of its around 8,500,000 gymnasts, European Gymnastics represents many different facets. From high-level competitive sports in four Olympic, and three non-Olympic disciplines to leisure sports in gymnastics for all with offers for all age groups, from toddlers to senior citizens. European Gymnastics transmit their understanding of being together beyond borders and set an example in community.</p><p>Now, European Gymnastics is launching its own Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant powered by <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> to drive borderless knowledge in order to further their mission to promote, develop and support synergy among the community to make Gymnastics and gymnasts at all levels, shine. The friendly mascot Luigi who you can meet at all major European Gymnastics events, is now receiving its digital twin. Powered by AI, digital Luigi allows anyone to learn and keep in touch with the European Gymnastics community. From finding the information about the next competition to learning about​​ important events in European Gymnastics history or helping you understand which elements are important for scoring a routine on parallel bars — all can be discovered with the help of the AI-powered Luigi.</p><p>The uniqueness of our digital Luigi is that his responses always include sources of information, allowing the user to explore any particular source further. This capability is unlocked by using OriginTrail’s Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is promising to unlock an even more powerful Luigi assistant as it will allow the initial knowledge base to continuously expand, not only by European Gymnastics’s inputs but also with contributions of the national federations, gymnasts and fans. As OriginTrail is based on blockchain, all such contributions will also be protected against tampering — extending European Gymnastics’s commitment to integrity from the sport halls to managing&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today’s launch of Luigi is accompanied by the launch of the biggest sporting event in the world — the Olympic Games. To help you navigate all the performances by European gymnasts in Paris, Luigi is already equipped with knowledge about the schedule and will also be receiving updates about results every&nbsp;day.</p><p>“European Gymnastics is excited to keep pushing the innovation in our sport. After being the first continental gymnastics federation to launch a digital cup competition this year, we are now making first steps into adopting Artificial Intelligence and blockchain to improve the ease of interaction with what is sometimes considered a complex world of Gymnastics. This is an important step in our newly adopted Strategy 2030, embracing top technology which has a lot to offer..” Dr. Farid Gayibov, European Gymnastics President.</p><p>You can find Luigi’s digital twin on the <a href="https://europeangymnastics.com/ask">European Gymnastics website</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/championing-european-gymnastics-with-borderless-knowledge-enabled-by-artificial-intelligence-and-f49dae6f6e25">Championing European Gymnastics with Borderless Knowledge enabled by Artificial Intelligence and…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>About a month ago one of our founders, Joel Thorstensson, released an <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/private-data-architecture/1585?ref=blog.ceramic.network">initial overview</a> of our plans to begin ideating how physical private data capabilities could be natively offered to developers using the Ceramic Network. The forum post includes details of how this would be rolled out in two phases in the form of a proof-of-concept, which is advisable to read before consuming this article.</p><p>It's also important to mention the motivation behind this effort. To start, Ceramic doesn't currently offer any native privacy features. This means that all data on Ceramic is public by default. At the same time, over the past few years, we've recognized the strong need for access control across several applications and use cases. A rough estimation would be almost half of all apps built on Ceramic have access control needs in one form or another.</p><p> In thinking about a solution, we aligned on the premise that physical access control (where data lives and who can sync it, as opposed to encryption) resonates most directly with the uniqueness of Ceramic's event-based architecture and our desire to align with edge privacy principles.</p><p>As such, our next step was to define a scope around a minimalist build to showcase how physical data privacy could be implemented in Ceramic.</p> Phase 1: API Read Access Control <p>If you've read Joel's forum post (linked above), you already know the details of the concept we've designed for this first phase. However, below are several key takeaways:</p>  Builds on <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic-one</a> (implementation of the Ceramic protocol, written in Rust)  Leverages the Feed API on Ceramic-one nodes, thus allowing nodes to filter the feed of events based on which permissions a user has  Designed to showcase how two users could share private data from the same node by leveraging object-capabilities (OCAP)  Shows how an object-capability generated by user 1 references a stream containing the data they want to share (as well as the DID corresponding to user 2, the person they want to share their data with) and allows user 2 to access data that would otherwise be physically inaccessible to query and obtain without the OCAP  <p>This article will walk through how to run the PoC locally.</p><p>If you prefer video, please view the YouTube version of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNiUlGremBQ&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Private Data Playground</a>:</p> Setting Up Your Environment <p>This walk-through requires you to generate clones of two repositories, one of which is the PoC itself, while the other is the Rust-Ceramic codebase.</p> Rust-Ceramic Set-Up <p>First, install protobuf:</p> <code># You can alternatively use `brew install protobuf`
PROTOC_VERSION=3.20.1
PROTOC_ZIP=protoc-$PROTOC_VERSION-linux-x86_64.zip
curl --retry 3 --retry-max-time 90 -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v$PROTOC_VERSION/$PROTOC_ZIP \
    &amp;&amp; unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc \
    &amp;&amp; unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*' \
    &amp;&amp; rm -f $PROTOC_ZIP</code> <p>Next, clone the Rust-Ceramic codebase:</p> <code># we will need a special branch from the repo
git clone https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic &amp;&amp; cd rust-ceramic &amp;&amp; git fetch</code> <p>We need to set up our Rust-Ceramic node from a specific branch. Enter the branch relevant to this PoC, build, and run the daemon:</p> <code># enter the special branch
git checkout feat/private-data

# build and run
cargo run -p ceramic-one -- daemon</code> <p>If your terminal starts populating with logs like the screenshot below, you've successfully started your node!</p><p>You now have an active Ceramic node running in the background! Next, we'll walk through the configuration for the private data playground web app.</p> Private Data Playground Web App Setup <p>First, clone the Private Data Playground repository:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/private-data-playground</code> <p>Go ahead and open the private-data-playground repo in your text editor of choice. Once open, we will need to create a copy of the example environment file and rename it:</p> <code>cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Our first step is to supply a value to our <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID</code> variable by setting up a Project ID with WalletConnect. You can set one up for free (if you don't already have one) by following the simple steps in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/walletconnect-tutorial/">WalletConnect tutorial</a> (under "Obtain a WalletConnect Project ID). We will need this given that our application's Wagmi hooks rely on a contextual wrapper that will allow us to leverage these hooks within all child components, and use <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/appkit/overview?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal</a>.</p><p>Once obtained, paste this into your new environment file next to the variable name referenced above.</p><p>Next, install your dependencies:</p> <code>npm install</code> <p>We're now ready to run the PoC!</p> Running the Application <p>Start up your application from within the private-data-playground repository in developer mode to initiate the UI:</p> <code>npm run dev</code> <p>You should now be able to access the UI by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:3000/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser!</p> Creating a Stream and a Capability <p>Our first section will focus on generating a stream (containing a simple message) and an OCAP. </p><p>To begin, self-authenticate by clicking "Connect Wallet." </p><p>You should see a secondary signature request appear after selecting an account - approving this request will create a browser session (specific to your DID, stemming from your Eth address) that the application will use to sign and submit data on your behalf as you create messages:</p><p>There are two views contained in this simple PoC - one for writing data, and one for reading. Make sure you're in the "Write" view by clicking the toggle under your address:</p><p>Go ahead and enter a simple message of your choosing - for example, "I love Ceramic!" would be an obvious choice. Go ahead and click the "Create" button. This action initiates a process that builds a new Ceramic stream and constructs your message into a payload that the Rust-Ceramic feed API will accept.</p><p>You should now see the resulting identifier under "Stream ID":</p><p>Go ahead and copy this value. Save it somewhere as it's needed later (a simple text document will suffice). </p><p>Finally, select another Eth address you control (make sure to remember which one) and enter it into the text input under "Delegate read access to". When ready, click "Create Capability". If you've followed all the steps correctly, your screen should look something like this:</p><p>Copy the capability value somewhere you can reference for the next section.</p><p>Congrats! You've successfully created both a Ceramic stream and a capability object! The next section will show how to use these to access otherwise private data.</p> Using the OCAP to Access Private Data <p>Go ahead and disconnect your current authenticated account from the web app. Next, go through the sign-in flow using the address you selected for the "Delegate read access to" input from the prior section.</p><p>Once authenticated, navigate to the "Read" toggle in the web app:</p><p>Enter the Stream ID and the Capability generated and saved from the prior section.</p><p>If you've copied over the values correctly, you should now be able to view the original message:</p><p>Congratulations - you've successfully used a capability to access otherwise private data on Ceramic. </p><p>You can also run through the "Read" process again, but this time make an arbitrary edit to the OCAP (thus invalidating it). With the Stream ID value kept the same, you'll notice that you no longer access the resulting message.</p> Next Steps <p>This minimal PoC is only the beginning of our plans for rolling out private data on Ceramic, with phase 2 coming soon (showcasing data privacy in the form of nodes and their ability to sync data between each other based on signed capabilities).</p><p>Is private data relevant to what you're building?

<p>Today, we are excited to announce our latest research exposing the massively networked personal information sharing happening between and across identity resolution and customer data platforms that has been hiding in plain sites for over 10 years. These industries are the plumbing backbone in synthesizing personal data from hundreds of data sources—across services, devices, and spanning the digital world and the physical world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February 2024, Cracked Labs published <a href="https://crackedlabs.org/en/identity-surveillance">“Pervasive identity surveillance for marketing purposes”</a>, an in-depth analysis of LiveRamp’s RampID identity graph. One of the most superficial yet most powerful functions of this excellent report was to guide attention towards industries responsible for pervasive consumer surveillance. The timing was excellent as I’d already committed to present “The Hidden Identity Infrastructure” at Identiverse (May 2024) and prompted by the report, I dug in to better understand the two industries underpinning hidden identity infrastructure, namely, Identity Resolution (ID Res) and Customer Data Platforms (CDPs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are nearly $9T worth of industries worldwide that rely on persistent, hidden identification of people. Naturally, demand of this magnitude fueled the now mature industries that perform pervasive, universal identification of people and their personal information. ISL identified over 350 companies providing either identity resolution platforms, customer data platforms, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This paper explores the magnitude and reach of these two industries, how they came to be, and most importantly, why, from a human well-being perspective, it’s crucial that these kinds of platforms be held to higher regulatory standards of scrutiny, transparency, and accountability. One identity resolution company alone out of 93&nbsp; such companies (worldwide) boasts the collection of 5,000 data elements for [each of] 700 million consumers in 2021. To put this in perspective, the number of user accounts breached worldwide in 2023 was about 300 million1. Is there an appreciable difference between stolen user data and undisclosed “legitimate” personally identifiable information sharing? Moreover, nearly 40% of the 93 companies that provide identity resolution platforms are registered data brokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, after reviewing the research, we must ask ourselves, is this the kind of world we want to live in: a world where everything about us is always known by industry; a world where the ongoing surveillance of people is deemed necessary in the name of capitalism. Is this the kind of world in which humans and societies will flourish or self-destruct? Are humans more than capitalistic consumers? Are we more than our purchasing potential?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A Call to Action&nbsp; 
<p>ISL conducted this research to help illuminate the sizable risk of hidden identification and the worldwide web of user surveillance. ISL believes naming and exposure is crucial to effecting change. Identification resolution and customer data platforms have been hiding in plain sight for more than a decade, and yet even the “identerati” are largely unfamiliar with these industries. How can we expect everyday people to know?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This paper is a rallying call for privacy advocates to come together to demand greater regulatory scrutiny, transparency and oversight for these industries, in conjunction with more meaningful data broker regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, this is a rallying call to acknowledge the catastrophic failure of notice and consent as a valid permissioning mechanism for highly complex and interconnected digital services. It’s inconceivable that people understand the magnitude of data sharing that consenting to sharing “your data with our marketing” entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves if this is the kind of world we want for ourselves and our children, where our preferences, practices, relationships, behaviors, and beliefs are all up for sale and broadly shared without our awareness. Are we ourselves in fact being sold?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technologies fueling these capabilities have received billions of dollars; consumers don’t have a chance in the face of voracious hunger to identify, know, and manipulate them. We hope that this research shines a much needed light on the forces enabling the worldwide web of human surveillance so that they may be held to accountability for their troves of data on nearly all internet users.&nbsp;</p>

   The Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Act took effect on the first day of the month, and included the establishment and implementation of the Regulator, the Trust Framework Authority.

<p>The Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Act took effect on the first day of the month, and included the establishment and implementation of the Regulator, the Trust Framework Authority. The launch was rather low-key, with the only discernible signal from the Department of Internal Affairs being updates to their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/programmes-and-projects/digital-identity-programme/">digital government web pages</a>&nbsp;to reflect this milestone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a different story in industry, however, where the occasion was covered by&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/07/10/government-bringing-in-new-digital-trust-framework/">DINZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018946184/government-bringing-in-new-digital-trust-framework">nationally by RNZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepress.co.nz/business/350322132/digital-identity-regulator-launched-usher-start-brave-new-world">locally</a>, internationally by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202407/new-zealand-trust-framework-looks-to-onboard-digital-id-providers">Biometric Update</a>&nbsp;and social media posts, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-w-7921274/recent-activity/all/">my own</a>&nbsp;and those from<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219461359028121601/">&nbsp;DINZ</a>.</p>



<p>The quote that really stuck was this one from Victoria University’s Professor of Informatics&nbsp;<a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/markus.luczak-roesch">Markus Luczak-Roesch</a>: “There’s a huge risk of doing nothing. Which is why it’s good that we’re doing something.” He’s absolutely right. It’s been over seven years of policy work at the DIA to reach this point, which I described as<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7215637634742726656/">&nbsp;‘the end of the beginning</a>’. While a challenging journey, Aotearoa can build from here with those that want to opt-in.</p>



<p>Next month’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;ahead of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nethui.nz/">Net Hui</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/the-point-2024-navigating-beyond/">The Point 2024</a>, will kick off with a keynote by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianacafik/">Microsoft’s global identity standards lead</a>&nbsp;and past&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">DIACC TFEC member</a>&nbsp;Juliana Cafik. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219811396312580096/">panel</a>&nbsp;that follows will discuss NZ’s Digital Identity Trust Framework, representing organisations that could be potential Relying Parties/Verifiers in Aotearoa under the DISTF regulation. The Trust Framework market model would see such parties seek out Digital Identity Service Provider/Issuers to deliver privacy-aware, cryptographically secured verified credentials, a topic that I&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/07/24/will-the-digital-trust-hui-taumata-2024-move-the-dial/">blog about here</a>. Publicly, it’s known that MSD and HNZ are piloting DIA’s platform, with RealMe as a notional issuer.</p>



<p>Additionally, the event will cover Digital Public Infrastructure, AI, biometrics, digital acceptance networks, digital drivers’ licences, the Metaverse, passkeys, digital cash, next generation payments, and the challenges of delegated administration across communities and much more. It’s all there, along with a panel of four experts who will review the sessions from a Te Ao Māori perspective.</p>



<p>In short, this year’s Digital Trust Hui Taumata will be like no other. The wait is over, and the rubber is hitting the road for the DISTF. What matters now is scale – will they come?</p>



<p>Lastly, I’m very excited to tell you that the DINZ podcast series is almost ready for launch so do keep an eye out for the first episode dropping very soon.</p>

&nbsp;



 In May 2024, the US government’s General Services Administration updated its Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Contract with a new Special Item Number (SIN 541519CSP, Credential Service Providers) under the IT Large Category. 
 SIN 541519CSP&nbsp;is designed to help federal agencies ensure that any IT services procured meet the requirements of “National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63 requirements and digital identity compliant services”. To provide credential services under the new SIN, companies must meet&nbsp;<a href="https://gsa.federalschedules.com/resources/new-it-sin-for-credential-service-providers/#overview">specific instructions and requirements</a><a href="https://gsa.federalschedules.com/resources/new-it-sin-for-credential-service-providers/#overview">.</a> 




 &nbsp; 
 SIN 541519CSP was created to meet the increasing need for robust, trustworthy credential service providers. The new SIN will help government agencies quickly identify credential service providers that have been vetted against the government’s standard requirements. If your company offers credential services and meets the requirements, obtaining SIN 541519CSP will place your company in a better position to capture bids as agencies look to acquire NIST 800-63 compliant services. 
 &nbsp; 
 In order to be included on the Schedule, Credential Service Providers must either be listed on the&nbsp;<a title="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-status-list" href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-status-list">Kantara Trust&nbsp;Status&nbsp;List</a> or provide a letter of approval from Kantara Initiative, or other GSA approved third party that can assure conformance to NIST SP 800-63.&nbsp; To begin the process, you’ll need to complete forms that can be found on <a href="https://www.idmanagement.gov/search/?query=541519CSP">idmanagement.gov</a>. 
 &nbsp; 
 Since both state and federal government agencies are permitted to use the vendors on this schedule for credential services, this considerably extends opportunities for Kantara certified companies. 
 &nbsp; 
 <a href="https://gsa.federalschedules.com/resources/new-it-sin-for-credential-service-providers/]">Read the full instructions</a>&nbsp;on how to be included on MAS, including the Technical Evaluation Criteria.

 Gordian Envelope Updates 

<p>Gordian Envelope, Blockchain Commons’ “Smart Document” system, continues to be a major focus. Here’s what that meant in Q2.</p>

<p>Expanded Developer Pages. The developer pages were updated with a new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/summary/">executive summary</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/features/">feature list</a> to clarify the capabilities and advantages of using Envelope. (More executive summaries of our technology to follow!)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Request/Response Presentation. Our May Gordian Developers Meeting included a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDf2cmfX1k">presentation on Request/Response</a>, which is an interoperable communication methodology using Gordian Envelope. Why use it? It can make complex digital-asset procedures more accessible by using automation to dramatically reduce the amount of human interaction needed, yet it also preserves security by ensuring that human choices are required whenever data is transmitted from one device to another. (But watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDf2cmfX1k">the presentation</a> for more!)</p>



 
    
   

<p>Graphs Representation. Blockchain Commons has a new research paper out on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-006-envelope-graph.md">Representing Graphs with Envelope</a>, which presents a proposed architecture for representing many types of graphs, enabling the use of Envelope for a variety of graph-based structures and algorithms.</p>

 Gordian Meetings 

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/tree/master/meetings#blockchain-commons-meetings">Gordian Developer Meetings</a> are how we bring the wallet community together to talk about our interoperable specifications. We’ve been thrilled to expand that in the last quarter with some feature presentations from experts in the field.</p>

<p>FROST Presentation. April saw a special presentation on FROST by Jesse Posner that not only talked about his work to date, but also some of the emerging capabilities of FROST, such as the ability to regenerate shares or even change thresholds without changing the underlying secret! We’ve long thought FROST was a great next-generation resilience solution for digital assets, and so appreciate Jesse talking to our community about why it’s so exciting. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCM8dDql6oo">complete video</a> of our April meeting for more.</p>



 
    
   

<p>PayJoin Presentation. Privacy is one of our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">fundamental principles for Gordian design</a>. It’s also a principle that will be better supported in Bitcoin with a <a href="https://payjoin.org/">new version of PayJoin</a>. Dan Gould was kind enough to give a full presentation on the updates he’s working on at our May meeting. We’ve got a video of just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMGL-Y498ZQ">his PayJoin presentation</a>.</p>



 
    
   

<p>All the Rest. Both meetings of course also included details on Blockchain Commons’ own work (much of which is detailed in this report). The Gordian Developer meetings continue on the first Wednesday of every month. We’ve also already scheduled a few feature presentations for the rest of the year. On August 7th, we’ll have a special presentation on BIP-85, then on December 4th, we’ll have another FROST presentation for wallet developers. If you’d like to make a special presentation in September, October, or November on a topic of interest to wallet developers, let us know!</p>

<p>Also, if you’re a cryptographer, spec designer, or library developer who is working to implement FROST, please be sure to sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#frost-implementers">FROST implementers announcements-only list</a> so that you can receive invites for our second FROST Implementers Round Table, which will be on September 18 thanks to support from the <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-14-projects-worldwide/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a>.</p>

 Seedtool-Rust Release 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ newest reference application is <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">seedtool-cli for Rust</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">
    
</a></p>

<p>seedtool-cli-rust. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">Seedtool</a> is a domain-specific  application that allows the creation, reconstruction, translation, and backup of cryptographic seeds. Blockchain Commons’ new Rust-based Seedtool replaces our older C++-based CLI and provides broader support for Gordian Envelope, including offering Gordian Envelopes of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR shares</a>, that can backup a seed using Shamir’s Secret Sharing. Seedtool’s Gordian Envelopes can then be piped into <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">envelope-cli-rust</a> for compression, encryption, or the addition of further metadata.</p>

<p>Seedtool Manual. For more on seedtool-cli-rust, check out the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust/blob/master/MANUAL.md">full user manual</a>, which explains how to use all of its functionality and why it’s important.</p>

 dCBOR Adoption 

<p>dCBOR is one of the foundations of Envelope, as it allows for the deterministic ordering of data, which is crucial for a hashed data system like Envelope. The IETF dCBOR Internet-Draft updated from <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/08/">v8</a> to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/10/">v10</a> over Q2, with most of those changes due to expanding support for the spec. We’re still hoping to see the Internet-Draft finalized soon!</p>

<p><a href="https://cbor.me/">
    
</a></p>

<p>cbor.me. <a href="https://cbor.me/">The CBOR Playground</a> is Carsten Bormann’s foundational diagnostic site for CBOR. It now supports dCBOR thanks to a new <a href="https://github.com/cabo/cbor-dcbor">Ruby Gem</a> that Carsten authored.</p>

<p>cbor2. Joe Hildebrand’s <a href="https://github.com/hildjj/cbor2">cbor2 library for Typescript</a> has also been expanded to support dCBOR.</p>

<p>QCBOR. Laurence Lundblade’s <a href="https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR">QCBOR</a> library (which is written in C) now supports dCBOR in its development branch.</p>

<p>IANA Assignment of Tag 201. Finally, 201 is now officially the “enclosed dCBOR” <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">tag for CBOR</a>. This is also critical for Gordian Envelope, which uses this tag to wrap dCBOR in each of an envelope’s “leaf” nodes.</p>

 GSTP Improvements 

<p>Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol (GSTP) is a Gordian Envelope extension. It allows for Envelope Requests and Responses to be sent in a secure way and is a critical element of Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/csr/">Collaborative Seed Recovery</a> system, which enables the storage of SSKR shares in a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-depo-rust">Gordian Depository</a>.</p>

<p>GSTP Advances. Thanks to support from our Research Sponsor, <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation Devices</a>, Blockchain Commons was able to expend considerable engineering work on GSTP in the last quarter, resulting in more fluent API patterns for building GSTP requests and responses. In addition, GSTP now supports bidirectional self-encrypted state with a unique and powerful new feature that we are calling Encrypted State Continuations (ESC). Overall, GSTP is a system that is secure, distributed, and transportation-agnostic. In a world where we could be sending digital-asset info by NFC, Bluetooth, or QR codes, it’s a critical security measure. See our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnH14LkJOnI">presentation</a> from the most recent Gordian Developers Meeting for more!</p>



 
    
   

 SSH Research 

<p>SSH has been long used as an authentication system, primarily for accessing UNIX computers. However, it’s recently come under increasing usage as a signing system as well, primarily thanks to extensions in Git. That has led to Blockchain Commons experimenting with the integration of SSH keys into Envelope. (This has also demonstrateð the flexibility of Envelope through the addition of these signing methodologies.) We’ve now got some first results.</p>

<p>ssh-envelope Experiment in Python. Early in the quarter, we produced <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/ssh-envelope-python">ssh-envelope</a>, an experimental Python program that worked with both <code>ssh-keygen</code> and <code>envelope-cli</code>. But, thanks to some very rapid development, we’ve already moved beyond that.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">
    
</a></p>

<p>SSH Key Support for envelope-cli. We’ve since integrated SSH key support throughout our Rust stack, primarily affecting our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">bc-components</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-rust">bc-envelope</a> Rust crates. This allowed us to bring our SSH key support fully into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">Rust envelope-cli</a>, which you can now use <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust/blob/master/docs/Signing.md">for SSH signing</a>.</p>

<p>More to Come. We’re still working on processes that will allow for the safe, secure, and reliable signing of software releases, something that we talked about extensively in our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-software.md">software use cases</a>. You can see some more of our work-in-progress in a discussion of <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/3d6a2f39c4b623a1a287b3fb7e0aa05b">SSH Key Best Practices</a>. We hope to have more on using SSH to enable resilient &amp; secure software releases later in the year.</p>

 Architectural Articles 

<p>Blockchain Commons expresses a lot of its more architectural thoughts as articles. There were two major articles in Q2.</p>

<p>Minimum Viable Architecture. Our first major article for the quarter focused on the methodology of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-mva/">Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)</a>. Many companies still focus on Minimum Viable Products. Our article advocates instead looking at the big picture (with lots of discussion on why that’s important).</p>

<p>Authentication Patterns. Design patterns are a crucial element in architectural design. Much as with the adversaries found in <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a>, design patterns allow you to put together a larger system piece by piece. As part of a guide to the strength of heterogeneity in architectural design, Blockchain Commons penned a set of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/architecture/patterns/auth/">authentication design patterns</a>. We’d like to do more to fill out the space, but for now feel like this is a good first cut that shows the value of the design style.</p>

 DID Futures 

<p>The Blockchain Commons principals have been involved with DIDs since Christopher Allen founded <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting Web of Trust</a> in 2015.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">
    
</a></p>

<p>W3C DID 1.1 WG. After a hiatus, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID working group</a> has been rechartered through 2026. Christopher Allen continues as an Invited Expert, focused on a variety of privacy issues, including elision, DID registration, and DID resolver issues.</p>

<p>RWOT 13. Meanwhile, Rebooting the Web of Trust continues to be on the frontline for DID advancements, with Christopher still the chair of the organization and Shannon Appelcline the editor-in-chief. <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/rwot%20workshop/RWOT13-Papers/">RWOT13</a> is finally back in the USA, with the early bird deadline for advance-reading papers at the start of August.</p>

 Grants/Funding 

<p>As we’ve written elsewhere, funding has become more difficult in the last year because of large-scale financial factors such as inflation and the resultant increase in interest rates. Blockchain Commons has responded by working more closely with some of our partners on topics of special interest to them and by seeking out grants.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation</a> for their grant enabling our continued support of FROST work.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation Devices</a> for their support of GSTP work.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://contract.design/">Digital Contract Design</a> for their support of our advocacy over the last year.</p>

<p>Please consider becoming a personal or corporate <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a> of Blockchain Commons so that our work can continue. Or, if you want support to integrate or expand one of Blockchain Commons’ existing projects (such as SSKR, Envelope, or the Gordian Depositories) in an open manner, to meet your company’s needs, contact us directly about becoming a Research Sponsor.</p>

<p>Also, please let us know of any grants or awards that you think would be closely aligned with our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can apply.</p>

 What’s Next? 

<p>Coming up:</p>
 
   More work on Envelope &amp; GSTP. 
   More reveals of our SSH work. 
   A new musings on cryptographic “cliques”. 
 

<p>We’re looking forward to Q3!</p>

<p>Like just about every market sector, the automotive industry is plagued by risks and ramifications associated with decades of relying on passwords – and is also uniquely poised to improve the user experience by embracing <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> for user authentication.</p>



<p>With smart cars having embedded technology to connect to digital experiences, there are several innovations primed for take-off in the automotive industry. With nearly <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/research/fintech-payments/emerging-payments/in-vehicle-payments-research-report/">100 million vehicles will be making payments by 2026</a>, up from just 2.3 million in 2021, passkeys will be crucial to simplify the in-vehicle user experience. At the same time, manufacturers have the opportunity to improve IoT and secure embedded devices to improve customer experiences on and off the road.</p>



 Manufacturing and Smart Car Case Studies 



<p>On the workforce front, the event featured a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fido-munich-seminar-workforce-authentication-case-study-pptx/270406201">case study</a> from MTRIX and considerations on how to deploy FIDO security keys to a manufacturer’s workforce – contemplating the many types and locations of workers for today’s global manufacturers. This case study reinforced the factors called out in a presentation by <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">Infineon</a> on the regulatory-driven push and pull with FIDO authentication.</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/vincss-official/">VinCSS</a> described how <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/device-onboarding-overview/">FIDO Device Onboard</a> is being used today to secure the smart car ecosystem both at point of manufacturing as well as for after-market use cases.</p>



 Using Passkeys for In-Vehicle Payments 



<p>The final block of sessions looked more closely at our in-vehicle future – including an overview of current trends for in-vehicle payments. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fido-munich-seminar-in-vehicle-payment-trends-pptx/270406190">Visa</a> and <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fido-munich-seminar-blueprint-for-in-vehicle-payment-standard-pptx/270375336">Starfish</a> then presented a blueprint and demo respectively for a standards-based approach for in-vehicle payments before <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">Qualcomm</a> wrapped things up with their vision for a digital chassis as the foundation for a software-defined vehicle that contemplates the need for secure identity, payments and driver/passenger personalization.</p>

<p>The digital transformation and the proliferation of e-identity schemes have escalated the need for secure and reliable online <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/">identity verification</a> methods, especially in light of the alarming trend of AI-generated “deepfakes.” As internet users have learned about the increasing threat of deepfakes, they have become increasingly concerned about their identities being spoofed online, according to a new study conducted by the FIDO Alliance. As a result, deepfake awareness and the risks associated with them have steadily increased.</p>



<p>Amidst this landscape, the FIDO Alliance released its newest research in the eBook, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/remote-identity-verification-biometric-systems-consumer-insights-2024">Remote ID Verification – Bringing Confidence to Biometric Systems Consumer Insights 2024</a>, which reveals insights from an independent study surveying 2,000 respondents in the U.S. and the U.K. on consumer perceptions on remote identity verification, online security, and biometrics. While the data showed consumer awareness and adoption of biometrics is increasing, consumers also expressed concerns about the rise of AI-generated deepfakes – reinforcing the need for preventative strategies and technologies focused on secure remote identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a “deepfake”? 



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/mdm-inauthentic-content-product-english_508.pdf">Center for Internet Security</a>, a deepfake consists of convincingly fabricated audio and video content designed to mislead audiences into believing that fabricated events or statements are real. These manipulations can create realistic yet entirely false representations of individuals through synthetic images or complete video footage. This manipulated audio/video content is dangerously effective at spreading false information. In cybersecurity, deepfakes are increasingly being used to spoof identities to fraudulently open accounts or take control of existing accounts.</p>



<p>With the advent of AI and the increasing use of face biometrics for remote identity verification, the deepfake risks to remote identity proofing (RIDP) methods have become a reality. Security researchers have been closely evaluating the identity verification risks associated with deepfakes to increase awareness of the rapidly changing threat landscape and support stronger countermeasures that enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of remote identity proofing (RIDP) methods. In the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’s (ENISA) latest remote ID <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/remote-id-proofing-good-practices">report</a>, researchers observed that deepfake injection attacks are increasing and becoming more difficult to mitigate.</p>



 Users Express Concerns about Deepfakes and ID Verification 



<p>With the rise of generative AI and deepfake videos in the news, there has been a heightened consumer unease about the security of biometrics for online verification. In the FIDO Alliance’s study, the deepfake trends have not escaped consumers’ attention online, who are increasingly using face biometrics to authenticate identities online and are concerned about identity security.</p>



<p>On one hand, the study reinforced consumer preference for using biometrics in remote identity verification, with nearly half of the respondents indicating a preference to use face biometrics, especially for sensitive transactions, like financial services (48%).&nbsp;</p>







<p>On the other hand, just over half of respondents revealed they are concerned about deepfakes when verifying identities online (52%).</p>







 Building Consumer Trust in Face Biometrics 



<p>As the concerns around deepfake security threats gain prominence, the industry has taken a significant step forward with the FIDO Alliance’s newly introduced Identity Verification certification program for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification</a>. This industry-first testing certification program, based on ISO standards, with requirements developed by the FIDO Alliance, aims to measure accuracy, liveness (including deepfake detection), and bias (including skin tone, age, and gender) in remote biometric identity verification technologies. By providing a framework for testing biometric performance and a network of accredited laboratories worldwide, this certification program standardizes and evaluates the performance of face verification systems while mitigating the impact of bias and security threats, like deepfakes.</p>



 Certifying Identity Verification with the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The Identity Verification certifications that the FIDO Alliance provides offer industry providers the ability to demonstrate commitment to addressing bias and security threats in remote biometric identity verification technologies. With a focus on standardizing and enhancing the performance of face verification technologies, the Alliance released its new <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certification Program</a> to elevate the performance, security, and equity of biometric solutions for remote identity verification. Combined with its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/document-authenticity/">Document Authenticity</a> (DocAuth) Certification Program, these two certifications work together to ensure identity verification solution providers can leverage FIDO’s independent testing and accredited laboratories as a market differentiator.&nbsp;</p>



 What is the value for IDV Biometric Vendors? 



 
 Independent validation of biometric performance 



 Opportunity to understand gaps in product performance to then improve and align with market demands 



 Demonstrate product performance to potential customers&nbsp; 



 Improve market adoption by holding an industry-trusted certification

 Commitment to ensure quality products for customers of the relying parties&nbsp; 



 Requirements developed by a diverse, international group of stakeholders from industry, government, and subject matter experts 



 Conforms to ISO 



 FIDO Annex published in ISO standards 
 



 What is the value of accredited laboratories? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/laboratory-overview/">FIDO Accredited Laboratories</a> are available worldwide and follow a common set of requirements and rigorous evaluation processes, defined by the FIDO Alliance Biometrics Working Group (BWG) and follow all relevant ISO standards. These laboratories are audited and trained by the FIDO Biometric Secretariat to ensure lab testing methodologies are compliant and utilize governance mechanisms per FIDO requirements. Laboratories perform biometric evaluations in alignment with audited FIDO accreditation processes. In contrast, bespoke, single laboratory biometric evaluations may not garner sufficient trust from relying parties for authentication and remote identity verification use cases.</p>



 What are the ISO Standards that FIDO certification conforms to? 



<p>When a vendor invests in FIDO’s Face Verification Certification, they and their accredited lab are adhering to the following ISO standards:</p>

 Celebrating 50 Years of the GS1&nbsp;Barcode <p>June 26 marked the 50th anniversary of the GS1 barcode, commemorating the first-ever product scan at a cash registry checkout. Over the decades, billions of products worldwide have been equipped with barcodes, streamlining and standardizing supply chain processes and adhering to GS1 standards.</p><p>As consumer demand for product information grew, regulatory requirements became stricter, and supply chain optimization pressures increased, the need for an updated barcode became evident. Enter the GS1 Digital Link, the barcode upgrade designed to provide dynamic access to comprehensive product information. Now, with <a href="https://www.gs1.org/resources/articles/leading-companies-retail-and-consumer-goods-industries-support-transition-qr-codes-gs1">leading retail and consumer goods companies actively supporting the transition to Digital Link QR codes</a>, the stage is set for the traditional barcode to retire gracefully.</p> Setting a Strong Foundation for Digital Link with OriginTrail <p>For products and brands to fully benefit from the GS1 Digital Link transition, a robust, connected, and verifiable data foundation is crucial. Product data is often split across various supply chain partners, including manufacturers, logistics providers, wholesalers, retailers, and others. To connect billions of products to the internet in a meaningful way that provides genuine insights and business value, this scattered product data needs to be interconnected.</p><p>Scanning a Digital Link on a product and seeing the manufacturer’s information, such as production date, description, ingredients, and brand details is good. Scanning the same code and accessing comprehensive information about the product’s journey through the supply chain — including whether the ingredients were ecologically produced, if the product was stored at proper temperatures during transport, and how long it was in the supply chain — is much better. This is the true potential of the Digital&nbsp;Link.</p><p>Beyond consumer engagement, consider a business operating a rail or plane network being able to access details on a component’s manufacture, testing, and maintenance by scanning a Digital Link code. That would have surely been invaluable with the recent Boeing aircraft incidents.</p><p>This is where the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and GS1 Digital Link make a match in heaven. The DKG provides a verifiable and interconnected knowledge base encompassing product data, supply chain events, certifications, locations, and more — across organizations and data sources. With the new DKG V8, the OriginTrail introduces the scalability needed to bring billions of products equipped with Digital Link into a world of standards-based, connected, and verifiable data. And the new DKG Edge Node concept empowers organizations and business networks to exchange product and other supply chain data with just a few clicks while maintaining data privacy, verifiability, and connectivity.</p>Supply chain data from multiple sources connected in a verifiable Decentralized Knowledge Graph.<p>As a longstanding partner of GS1, OriginTrail DKG is designed to natively support GS1 standards, including EPCIS, Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), Global Data Model (GDM), and Digital Link. This integration means that consumers, regulators, brands, and other stakeholders can access richer, more comprehensive, and trusted product data. The challenge now is to make this user experience seamless and simple, and there’s a tech perfect for the job — Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p> OriginTrail, Digital Link, and AI: A Consumer Engagement Power&nbsp;Throuple <p>Incorporating AI into the mix creates an incredibly powerful technology trio, enabling brands to enhance consumer engagement, based on connected and verifiable data spanning organizations, in unprecedented ways. And with the DKG Edge Node, AI capabilities come natively. Brands can thus offer personalized and tailored experiences by allowing customers to scan a product with a Digital Link QR code and ask anything — from brand details to product origins, sustainability, and environmental impact, all based on verifiable data from OriginTrail DKG.</p><p>This combination not only benefits consumers but also provides brands with valuable insights into customer preferences, allowing them to refine their business strategies. As billions of products transition from barcodes to Digital Link, the potential of this technology trio becomes evident. In fact, AI-powered product discovery, based on OriginTrail and Digital Link, is no longer a future concept but a current&nbsp;reality:</p><p>Some additional examples to check&nbsp;out:</p>  <a href="https://www.perutnina.com/int/en/premium-quality/check-the-origin/">Check the origin&nbsp;» Perutnina Ptuj</a>  <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1759626249813520823">Church of Oak Whiskey Distillery</a>  <p>Simultaneously, organizations can leverage AI to better understand and enhance their supply chains, ensuring they receive accurate and verifiable responses rooted in data from across their business network. By simply scanning a Digital Link QR code on a product, pallet, or shipping container, users are immediately empowered to ask questions and get verifiable answers — from basic queries like “Where was this product manufactured?” to more complex ones such as “Was the temperature in this shipping container in line with expectations?” and “Give me a list of all train wagons that are likely to experience issues with their wheels in the next month.” Exciting stuff&nbsp;indeed.</p> Where do we go from&nbsp;here? <p>As billions of products transition from traditional barcodes to Digital Link QR codes, establishing a robust foundation of connected and verifiable data becomes paramount. OriginTrail is at the forefront of this transformation, with the new DKG V8 offering the scalability and simplicity necessary to realize its full potential. When combined with AI, this technology trio unlocks immense opportunities for brands to engage with their customers in a trusted and meaningful way.</p><p>But consumer engagement is just one area set to benefit significantly from this transition. Regulatory bodies will gain streamlined access to verifiable product data, and supply chain management will become more proactive and efficient. The coming months and years promise exciting advancements and opportunities, making this a pivotal moment in the evolution of product information and consumer engagement.</p><p>We are excited to see OriginTrail at the epicenter of it all, as we — Trace Labs, the core developers of OriginTrai — along with our ecosystem partners get ready to unveil the Digital Link support via the new DKG V8 at the GS1 Industry &amp; Standards Event. Over 1,000 business leaders from 80+ countries will come together virtually to solve today’s greatest business challenges through the development and adoption of the GS1 global standard.</p><p>For the GS1 Industry &amp; Standards Event, register at: <a href="https://standards-event.gs1.org/">https://standards-event.gs1.org/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/from-barcodes-to-digital-links-supercharging-trillions-of-products-for-the-next-50-years-f46f4653e589">From Barcodes to Digital Links: Supercharging Trillions of Products for the Next 50 Years</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the past months we have replaced the algorithm at the heart of the ceramic database. This post explains why we made the change from Multicast to pairwise synchronization but first let review the design motivations of Ceramic.</p><p>“Information also wants to be expensive. Information Wants To Be Free. ...That tension will not go away.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free?ref=blog.ceramic.network#cite_note-3">Stewart Brand</a>. There is tension since data storage is a competitive market but data retrieval can only be done by the service that has your data. At 3Box Labs, we want to catalyze a data ecosystem by making community driven data distribution not only possible but available out of the box. <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a decentralized storage solution for apps that are dealing with multi-party data and that is more scalable, faster and cheaper than the blockchain. </p> Data vendor lock-in <p>Many organizations and individuals have data that they want to publish and Ceramic lets them do so without instant data vendor lock in for storing their own data. In the Web2 era, data often becomes ensnared within exclusive services, restricting its accessibility and durability. Access to this data requires obtaining permission from the service provider. Numerous platforms have vanished over the years, resulting in significant data loss like GeoCities, Friendster and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Orkut</a>. Even within still existing companies like Google, numerous lost data products are documented. See <a href="http://killedbygoogle.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">killed by google</a>. </p><p>We can break free from this risk by creating data-centric applications that multihome the data. Ceramic is the way to have many distinct data controllers publishing into shared tables in a trustless environment. Each reader can know who published what content and when they did without relying on trusting the storage service to keep accurate audit logs. Since each event is a JSON Document, signed by a controller, timestamped by ethereum, and in a documented schema it can be preserved by any interested party, with or without permission from the storage vendor. </p>Multihome the data<p>In Ceramic we separate the roles of data controllers from the data servers. By allowing data to live on any preferred server the data is durable as long as any server is interested in preserving the data. This allows data to outlive a particular data server, paired with the durability of data living in multiple places and the speed/reliability of operating on local data.</p> Document the schema <p>Throughout the history of the internet, we have witnessed numerous data services going away and taking the users data with them. While multihoming helps preserve data, it's useless without the ability to interpret it.</p><p>Ceramic preserves the data formats in two ways. The first is that the data lives in JSON Documents. This format allows us to reverse engineer and examine the data.&nbsp; The second is that the model schema gets published. The model schema contains both json-schema and human language description that the original developer can use to give machine and human context to the data. This enables both the preservation of the data and schema so the data can be understood and new apps can be made to interact with the preserved data.</p> <code>{

}</code> <p>Example schema document</p> Information retrieval&nbsp; <p>The key to multihome data is being able to retrieve the data from a server that has it.</p><p>How do we move the data from the servers that have the data to the servers that are interested in storing it? When we first made Ceramic we used two multicast methods: The first was to do a gratuitous announcement of new data. Send the data to EVERY node in the network so that they can store it if they are interested in it. Second, if a node did not know about a stream then when requested by a user it would multicast a request to the whole network and take the latest version to come back as a response.</p><p>This worked but had several drawbacks. The first is that requests for streams that a node did not know used WAN traffic and would have unpredictable latencies. This meant that all applications needed to design for slow unpredictable retrieval times. The second drawback was that a node had no way to retrieve a complete set of the streams that matched their interests. They could only listen to the multicast channel and fetch any stream they happened to hear about. Any stream that they missed either because it happened before the node was online or during down time could be missed forever. Third, there is a performance cost to sending requests to nodes that have no mutual interest with your node. A node that did 100 events a year could not scale down since it would need to keep up with filtering announcements from nodes doing 100 events a second. If we wanted to support both very large and very small data centric applications we needed a new strategy. We even saw cases where a slow node could not keep up on the multicast channel harming the performance of larger more powerful nodes.</p><p>To solve these problems of performance, completeness, and scalability we switched to a pairwise synchronization model. Each node advertises the ranges of streams that the node is interested in. Each node only synchronizes the streams that are of mutual interest and the nodes synchronize pair wise.</p> Scalability <p>Since the nodes synchronize pairwise, no slow node can harm the ability of two healthy nodes to complete a synchronization. If two nodes have no intersection in their interests then the conversation is done. A range of streams that has 100s of events per second that your node is not interested in will not create work for your node. A node only needs to scale to the speed of events in the ranges it is interested in and the scale of any model you are not interested in costs you nothing. This solved our scale up / scale down objective.</p> Completeness <p>If the two nodes do have an intersection of their interests they will continue the synchronization until both nodes have ALL the events that the other node had when the synchronization began. There is no longer a need for high availability to be online either when the stream’s event was originally published or when some node queried for that stream. If the event is stored by either of the nodes both nodes will have it at the end of the pairwise synchronization. Once a node has pairwise synchronized with each of the nodes that are advertising an interest range that node has all of the events in that range as of the time of the synchronization. This solves the completeness objective.</p><p>More interestingly, the local completeness means that we can build local indexes over the events and do more complex queries over the events in the ranges nodes are interested in entirely locally.</p> Performance <p>&nbsp;Lastly, since we have a complete set of events for our interests we can serve queries about the events from the local node with no need for WAN traffic. This solves the performance objective for predictable fetch latencies.</p> Pairwise Synchronization in Logarithmic rounds <p>In the multicast model ceramic sends messages to all other ceramic nodes. One of the most notable differences with synchronization is that nodes do pairwise synchronization one peer at a time. The two peers will each send the other their interests. Both nodes filter the events that they have to find the set of events of mutual interest between the two nodes. Once this intersection is found we synchronize the set with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13567?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Range-Based Set Reconciliation</a> protocol we call Recon.</p><p>We can report progress in a Recon synchronization by reporting the percentage of events in the in sync vs syncing ranges. Alternatively we could render a bar like in the diagram showing which ranges are in which states.</p><p>This is a divide and conquer protocol. We start with the full intersection as a single range. We pull a range off the work list and send the (hash, count) of all events in the range to the other side. They compare their own (hash, count) and respond accordingly.</p>

<p>We have</p><p>They have</p><p>Acton</p><p>hash_A</p><p>hash_A</p><p>Done.<br>`in sync`</p><p>0</p><p>hash_A</p><p>Send a request for the events.<br>`Don’t have`</p><p>hash_A</p><p>0</p><p>Send the events.<br>`in sync`</p><p>hash_A</p><p>hash_B</p><p>Split the range<br>Push sub-ranges from split on the work list.<br>Each range `syncing`</p>

<p>The range splits are handled differently on the Initiator then the Responder. The Initiator maintains the work list and pushes all of the subranges onto the work list. The Responder just sends a message back with multiple ranges and hashes for each range. This keeps the synchronization state on the Initiator and reduces the burden on the Responder to a stateless call and response. This fits Recon into the http client server request response paradigm.</p> Exponential distribution <p>Now that we have replaced a multicast message to all nodes in the network with pairwise sync it is reasonable to ask if we have broken the exponential distribution we got from multicast trees.</p><p>How fast can data spread through the network? Now that we have replaced the multicast channel with pairwise connections, how do we match the exponential distribution of the multicast channel?&nbsp;</p><p>We get this property since each node cycles through connecting to all other nodes that advertise overlapping interests. When the node that originally received the event from a client there is 1 copy on the network. After the first sync there are 2. Then both of the nodes sync to new nodes giving 4. This will grow exponentially until almost all interested nodes have the data. At that point the odds that any node with the event calls a node without it is small but the odds that the node without the event calls a node with it is large. By using synchronization we get the benefits of both push and pull gossip protocols. Push which is fast when the knowledge of the event is rare and pull which is fast when knowledge of the event is common. </p> Summary <p>By using Set reconciliation to perform pairwise synchronization of node’s overlapping interests we are able to have performance, completeness, and scalability. The predictable performance of querying local data on your node. The completeness of synchronizing all of the events of interest preemptively. The scalability of not synchronizing the events that lay outside of the interests of a node. Pairwise synchronization protects the network from slow nodes from slowing down the rest of the network. It is now possible to scale up or down without performance and completeness problems. This enables developers to build data intensive applications without the data vendor lock-in from either the storage providing service or the application that originally read the schema.</p>

<p>Corporate overview:</p>



<p>Wedding Park Co., Ltd. was founded in 2004 with the management philosophy of “Making marriage happier.” Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2024, it started as a wedding review information site and has since expanded its operations. Utilizing a wealth of information, it operates several wedding-specialized media, including the wedding preparation review site <a href="https://www.weddingpark.net/">Wedding Park</a>. In addition, it runs various businesses in the realm of weddings combined with digital technology, such as internet advertising agency services, digital transformation (DX) support, and educational ventures.</p>



<p>Background and challenges leading to deployment</p>



<p>Wedding Park was faced with the challenges of strengthening the security of multiple cloud services that were being used for internal operations and the complexity of password management. As a way to address these issues, the company introduced an ID management service and consolidated them into a cloud service entrance with a single sign-on function.</p>



<p>The impetus for deploying FIDO authentication came from the fact that Salesforce, which is used for authentication for customer management, order and supply systems, and time and attendance management, announced that multi-factor authentication (MFA) was mandatory. However, if MFA is applied only to Salesforce and other cloud services continue to operate with password authentication, not only will the usability of users deteriorate, but the work of the IT management department will also become more complicated. In addition, due to the vulnerability of password-only authentication, the company decided to apply MFA to all cloud services, including Salesforce, in accordance with its policy to promote zero-trust security in February 2020.</p>



<p>Selection and verification of an authenticator</p>



<p>As an authentication method for MFA, the company considered one-time password authentication (OTP) and biometric authentication using smartphone applications, but ultimately decided to deploy passwordless authentication using FIDO for its unique ability to improve both security and user convenience.</p>



<p>In order to realize passwordless authentication using FIDO, a terminal equipped with a FIDO-compatible biometric authentication device is required. The majority of devices currently on the market support FIDO authentication, and with the exception of a few employees, the adoption of FIDO has been supported by the fact that all in-house devices are already equipped with Windows Hello and Touch ID. For some employees who use the devices not equipped with biometric features, a separate external authenticator has been installed.</p>



<p>A step-by-step changeover for each department</p>



<p>After examining the authenticators, the policy to deploy passwordless authentication company-wide in January 2022 was officially launched. The transition took place from February to March of the same year, and the smooth implementation in a short period of one month was made possible by the department-by-department implementation and the generous support provided by the IT management department. For this implementation, the company requested the support of CloudGate UNO, an identity management platform by International System Research Corporation (ISR) that the company has been using since 2012, because it supports passwordless authentication using FIDO2 and biometric authentication using a smartphone APP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The introduction of the system within the company began with the development department and gradually progressed to departments with a larger number of employees. First, at regular meetings for each department, the company communicated the purpose of why the system was being introduced and the benefits of “the deployment of the system will make daily authentication more convenient,” and gained the understanding across the company. The introduction of the system on a departmental basis had the advantage of not only limiting the number of people the IT management department had to deal with at one time, but also allowing the accumulation of QA as test cases and the smooth maintenance of manuals, since the system was introduced starting with the development department, which had high IT skills.</p>



<p>As a result of close follow-up by the IT management department, which not only prepared materials, but also checked the progress status on the administrator website as needed, and individually approached employees who had not yet registered their certifiers, the company was able to implement the system company-wide within the targeted time frame.</p>



<p>Effects of introduction</p>



<p></p>



<p>The number of login errors due to mistyping of passwords, which used to occur about 200 times a month, has been reduced to zero since the deployment of FIDO authentication. Many employees commented that the system has become very convenient, eliminating authentication failures due to forgotten passwords or typing errors. In addition, the number of periodic password reset requests has decreased, resulting in a reduction in man-hours for the administrator.</p>



<p>The passwordless authentication is smooth, and the authentication status retention period was shortened to further enhance security, but the system has continued to operate without problems since then.</p>



<p>Wedding Park’s future vision is to link all cloud services used within the company to “CloudGate UNO” and centrally manage them, including authentication, with “CloudGate UNO.</p>



<p>Akira Nishi, General Manager of the Corporate IT Office, who spoke with us about this case study, made the following comments.</p>



<p>“For those who are considering the deploying of a new authentication method, there is inevitably a concern that a change in authentication method will cause a large-scale login failure. In our case, in the early stages of the project, we held explanatory meetings for each department and repeatedly brushed up on explanatory materials and procedures, which was effective in minimizing confusion and anxiety within the company.</p>



<p>“After the switchover, we continued to check on the progress of the implementation and followed up with each department individually, but once the use of passkey (device-bound passkey) became standardized within the company, we felt that the scope of use, including various security measures, was expanding dramatically.”</p>

<p>The Ceramic protocol has undergone a series of updates over the past few months, all focused on improving performance and scalability, enabling developers to build applications that work better and faster. Today, the core Ceramic team is excited to share these updates with the community by announcing the release of <code>ceramic-one</code>.</p> About the release <p>The new release of Ceramic includes a data synchronization protocol called <a href="https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-124?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recon</a>, implemented in Rust. This new implementation of the Ceramic protocol enables data sharing between nodes and allows developers to run multiple nodes that stay in sync and are load balanced. All this facilitates highly available Ceramic deployments and reliable data synchronization.</p><p>To utilize the Recon protocol for their applications, developers are provided with a binary called <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>ceramic-one</code></a>.</p><p>This new implementation of the Ceramic protocol offers significant performance and stability improvements. Additionally, this release marks a significant shift in making the Ceramic architecture more robust, allowing the team to iterate on and build new protocols in the future.</p> The new Recon protocol <p>Recon is a new data synchronization protocol used for synchronizing stream events in the Ceramic network, implemented on top of libp2p. Stream sets bundle multiple streams together, allowing nodes with a common interest in certain streams to synchronize efficiently.</p><p>Before Recon, Ceramic nodes broadcasted updates to streams to every node in the network using a simple libp2p pubsub topic. Due to the single channel, nodes would receive stream event announcements they were not interested in, imposing a significant overhead on every node. Additionally, the network's throughput was limited by bandwidth, which led to either prioritizing high-bandwidth nodes or greatly limiting the network throughput to support low-bandwidth nodes.</p><p>Recon provides low to no overhead for nodes with no overlap in interest, while retaining a high probability of receiving the latest events from a stream shortly after any node has the events, without any need for remote connections at query time. By shifting updates from the pubsub channel to a stream set, interested nodes can synchronize without burdening uninterested ones. Stream sets also enable sharding across multiple nodes, allowing synchronization of only sub-ranges, which distributes the storage, indexing, and retrieval workload.</p><p>Additionally, nodes need to discover peers with similar interests for synchronization. Recon achieves this through nodes gossiping their interests and maintaining a list of peers' interests, ensuring synchronization with minimal bandwidth. Nodes also avoid sending event announcements to uninterested peers.</p> Performance and robustness improvements <p>This release, along with the recent Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) updates, marks significant scalability improvements. Currently, Ceramic provides a throughput of 250 TPS (transactions per second), more than double the previous throughput of up to 100 TPS before the Recon implementation. This increase in throughput is especially important for applications that handle large amounts of user data and require fast transaction times.</p><p>These numbers were measured between two nodes that share the same interest. It’s worth noting that nodes without overlapping interests do not affect each other's throughput. This means that, in theory, the throughput of a ceramic-one node scales horizontally. However, there is still one component that puts an upper limit on this: the CAS, which is operated by 3Box Labs. This service is currently a centralized bottleneck in the protocol, which is why the team’s next goal is <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ceramicstudio/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&amp;itemId=68981845&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Self-Anchoring</a>, allowing any Ceramic-One node to operate completely independently.</p><p>This release of Ceramic is also a significant step towards making the Ceramic architecture more robust, enabling the team to iterate on it and build new protocol implementations more easily and quickly.</p> Getting started with ceramic-one <p>All new Ceramic developers are recommended to use the <code>ceramic-one</code> to start building on Ceramic. Check out <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network">the setup guides</a> on the Ceramic documentation to get started.</p><p>Developers, who have been building on Ceramic for a while, are encouraged to migrate their applications to the <code>ceramic-one</code>-based implementation. Check out <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/blob/main/UPGRADE.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">this migration guide</a> to follow the migration steps.</p> Share you feedback with us! <p>We would like to get your feedback on building on Ceramic. Do you have any suggestions or ideas of how the core Ceramic team can improve the implementation of Ceramic? Do you have questions or troubles using the new release or migrating your existing application? Share your thoughts and ideas with us by posting on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Community Forum</a>.</p>

In both rounds, we spoke one-to-one with people deeply involved in the DCC’s work. In the first round, we spoke with staff members, W3C task group members and people already implementing the Verifiable Credentials standard. In the second round, we talked to members of the DCC and with the Leadership Board. We asked the same questions for both rounds, but allowed for organic conversation to&nbsp;emerge.</p>cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>These interviews not only provided us with a bounty of onboarding and understanding to the DCC’s multitude of work, but it helped us identify, specifically, what stakeholders need and want from the&nbsp;DCC.</p> Segmentation <p>Once you have collected insights from your audience, you can begin to reflect those insights back in ways that help others understand who your audience is. Segmentation is a way to find overlapping interests and topics. We like to visualise segmentation and have done so in multiple ways, from our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">Audience Ikigai</a> to <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/defining-the-cast/">Defining the Cast</a> and <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/persona-mapping/">Persona Spectrums</a>, we use a couple of different tools to find audience overlaps. Figuring out a visual way to explain your audience and their unique needs and insights is a great way to help people feel connected to your organisation.</p> Crafting your communications First slide of a deck implementing suggested design constraints Being specific <p>Understanding your audience will help you tailor your messages and customise content to specific segments of your audience. Through research, you are also creating relationships with your audience and can encourage people to feel open to giving you feedback.</p><p>Our research and subsequent analysis helped us see trends and patterns to pay attention to as we began to craft communications for the DCC. We also identified some quick intervention points allowing us to immediately implement small changes and quick wins. For example, before we ran our final interview, we implemented a new README for the <a href="https://github.com/digitalcredentials/">DCC’s Github organisation</a>. Small wins can have big&nbsp;impact!</p><p>Our onboarding and research activities helped us see where there were misunderstandings, so that we could deal with them as quickly as possible.</p> Design guidelines <p>It can be helpful to put what we call “Design Constraints” in place when we’re building communication strategies and initiatives. Design Constraints are simply rules you and your colleagues use to create consistency in both visual and written language. For example, we helped the DCC select a colour palette, fonts and an illustration library for their future communications.</p><p>A brand guide is an example of visual design constraints. A “key messaging and wording” section in your communications strategy is another. It helps create consistency, so that your audiences know how you wish to communicate your organisational goals.</p> Growing your&nbsp;audience cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> Engagement <p>You want to engage with people strategically so that you can work sustainably and your communications are aligned with your current initiatives and goals. We use several tools to help us figure out the best way to engage with a specific audience or community. We’ve written often about <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">the Architecture of Participation</a>, our go-to framework for creating participatory communities.</p><p>We also like to build Contributor Pathways, which help show how different stakeholders engage with a project. These pathways can outline steps different audience take and where you might be able to engage with them more effectively.</p><p>There are four stages to the engagement model we like to&nbsp;use:</p>  Awareness — The first stage invites you to think about how your particular group hears about you or your project for the first time. The questions to as are How do they hear about us and how would we like them to hear about&nbsp;us?  First Engagement — Stage two identifies the first interaction a person or a group has with you or your project. What is the first action that they take and what action would you like them to&nbsp;take?  Build Relationship — Stage three is about your interaction. How do you build relationships with people or groups and what value can you&nbsp;bring?  Deepen Engagement — As people deepen their engagement with your organisation or project, you’ll want to show them that they’re valued. So how can you ensure consistent engagement with your most engaged audiences?  <p>We think about each of these stages in reference to each specific audience group, as some audiences might be more or less engaged than&nbsp;others.</p> Advocacy <p>WAO tends to work with groups and organisations that are trying to create a better world. Advocacy is an integral part of our work. There are a variety of advocacy and collaboration strategies as well as best practices that you can use to ensure you are able to promote your messages in a way that lead to&nbsp;action.</p><p>In this post on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">campaigning for the right things</a>, we take a deep dive into using an advocacy framework to figure out where we might focus efforts. You can reapply this framework to your own initiatives!</p> Building and sustaining engagement cc-by-nd Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO Cadence <p>If you’ve truly understood your audiences through research and analysis and you’ve determined the messages and design constraints you need to utilise for maximum communication effectiveness, your audience will begin to grow. Yay! You are building engagement!</p><p>It’s time to find sustainable ways to keep your engagement going. Probably the most effective strategy we have for sustaining engagement is cadence and consistency.</p>an example month of DCC events and associated comms<p>You need to establish a cadence to your engagement efforts both so that your growing audience knows what to expect and so that you and your team can stay sane.

<p>Canada’s digital trust leader, the DIACC, releases its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) Authentication Final Recommendation V1.2, signalling it’s ready for inclusion in their <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Certification Program</a>.</p>



<p>Why is the PCTF Authentication component important?</p>



<p>The Authentication component helps assure the on-going integrity of login and authentication processes by certifying, through a process of assessment, that they comply with standardized Conformance Criteria. The Conformance Criteria for this component may be used to provide assurances that Trusted Processes result in the representation of a unique Subject at a Level of Assurance that it is the same Subject with each successful login to an Authentication Service Provider while also providing assurances concerning the predictability and continuity in the login processes that they offer or on which they depend.</p>



<p>What problems does the PCTF Authentication component solve?</p>



<p>The Authentication component helps establish a standardized way for individuals and organizations to verify their identities when accessing digital services. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches. Additionally, by providing a reliable method for authentication, this allows the PCTF to foster trust and confidence among users, service providers, and stakeholders. This is crucial for the widespread adoption of digital services.</p>



<p>Who does the PCTF Authentication component help?</p>



<p>All participants will benefit from login and authentication processes that are repeatable and consistent (whether they offer these processes, depend on them, or both). It can help lay the foundation to provide assurances that identified Users can engage in authorized interactions with remote systems. When combined with considerations from the PCTF Wallet Component, participants may have an enhanced user experience through the reuse of credentials across multiple Relying Parties.</p>



<p>Relying Parties can benefit from the ability to build on the assurance that Authentication Trusted Processes uniquely identify, at an acceptable level of risk, a Subject in their application or program space.</p>

Wild works for the award-winning international open source (OS) investigative journalism collective <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/about/awards/">Bellingcat</a>. She is an expert on the creative deployment of technical approaches to support a more diverse cohort of public interest reporters and investigators, blending automated approaches with human-centered research methodology.</p><p>As someone who has supported expert networks in both disinformation and conflict documentation, I wanted Wild’s first-hand perspective on the benefits and risks of using novel open source intelligence (OSINT) tools to enable a broader, more transparent global knowledge base. We conducted this interview over email between Amsterdam and New York&nbsp;City.</p><p>Sam Hinds: Do you encounter specific types of people or professional backgrounds in the work of investigations and OSINT tool development?</p><p>Johanna Wild: The great thing about the field of open source research is that it consists of people from various backgrounds. Open source researchers spend a lot of time online. They find pieces of information on social media platforms, in online forums, and databases, and they compare features that they identify in user-generated online videos and photos with locations that can be seen on satellite imagery. This process, called geolocation, is used to verify online images. The nature of open source research allows everyone with an internet connection to do this type of&nbsp;work.</p><p>The open source researcher community is therefore a mix of people who do open source research as part of their job and volunteers who are passionate about contributing to important research in their free time. My surveys and user interviews with our Bellingcat community showed that our community consists of people working for human rights organizations, stay-at-home-parents who use their limited time to do something mentally challenging and useful, cybersecurity specialists, job seekers who want to learn new skills, lawyers, data scientists, people who are retired and many more. When I ask volunteers about their motivation, they often say that they want to contribute to research that reveals issues in the regions where they live, that they want to feel that in these times that are characterized by various conflicts around the world, and global challenges like climate change; they do not just passively sit around but actively contribute to something that creates new knowledge about those issues. Another motivation is to become part of a community with similar interests and to improve their open source research&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Of course there are also many journalists who are part of this community. Nowadays, more and more newsrooms are setting up teams focusing on open source research. However, journalists were more of the late adopters in this field. Most of them only discovered in the last few years how useful this type of research can be, especially if it is combined with traditional journalistic skills and methods. Newsrooms even started hiring skilled open source researchers who are completely self-taught and who have no journalism degree, which is something that is still rather unusual in the news industry.</p><p>Volunteers with a technical background contribute by building tools. These are often simple command line tools that are able to do one very specific task, for instance to scrape posts from a specific social media platform or to check whether an online account has been created on a platform using a specific phone number. Those tools do not usually turn into big commercial products; they are built by people from within the open source software community who focus on writing code that is publicly accessible to anyone. Several years ago, I clearly saw that the open source researcher and the open source software community are a very good match for each other, we just needed to bring them together. This is one of the things that we now do at Bellingcat. We organize hackathons, actively invite software developers into our volunteer community, and support them to build their own tools or to contribute to tools built by the Bellingcat team. This group of volunteers consists for example of people who have a full time job in a software company but want to do something meaningful in their free time, of job seekers who want to create their own portfolio of tools, or of academics who are already deep into a technical topic but would like to test its practical application.</p><p>Although the open source researcher and tech communities are very diverse in terms of their professional and personal backgrounds, they are currently still dominated by volunteers and professionals from Western countries, mainly from the US and Europe. The technical tool builder community is also, to date, still male dominated. This lack of representation raises serious questions in terms of who defines the future of our field and who has the power to research topics in regions all around the world. With people in many other regions still excluded from participating in this type of research, they mainly become the subject of Western researchers.</p><blockquote>“While AI tools can be powerful, we should not expect to automate the whole open source research process. Doing open source research is a combination of specific research methods, the use of tools, a good dose of logical thinking and also creativity!”</blockquote><p>SH: Have you seen novel trends emerge in the type of information researchers want&nbsp;today?</p><p>JW: I definitely observe that researchers, and especially journalists, have become more aware of how useful it is to be able to work with large datasets, to know how to scrape information from websites or to have the skills to build small tools that can speed up some of their research&nbsp;tasks.</p><p>Currently, everyone is of course interested in AI. Less experienced researchers are hoping for a tool that lets them input any picture or video and then spits out the exact location of where it was taken. While AI tools can be powerful, we should not expect to automate the whole open source research process. Doing open source research is a combination of specific research methods, the use of tools, a good dose of logical thinking and also creativity! Creativity is needed to spot topics that are worth getting investigated. When deciding where to look next in the vast amount of online information that is out there, creativity helps to connect multiple, often tiny, pieces of verified information which allow researchers to draw conclusions on a certain&nbsp;topic.</p><p>Another trend is the use of facial recognition tools. Open source researchers often find pictures that show individuals who have a connection to a certain research case but whose identity they don’t know. In the last few years, several easy to use facial recognition tools have emerged. Researchers can upload a picture of a person and the tool compares this picture with collections of photos from social media platforms. Sometimes, this can reveal the identity of a person, for instance by providing the person’s LinkedIn profile. It is obvious how useful this can be to identify individuals who were involved in serious crimes that require journalistic reporting.</p><p>However, facial recognition tools are a double-edge sword. We all know that they can provide wrong results. Two people might just look very similar and an uninvolved person might be misidentified as someone who is involved in illegal activities. It is therefore important that open source researchers do not use those tools as the only way of identifying someone. On top of that, the use of such tools raises various ethical questions ranging from the risk of stalking random people online, to questions about the data sources on which facial recognition tools rely. At Bellingcat, we reflected on how we can ensure a responsible use of facial recognition technologies and concluded that we will refrain from using these tools extensively, and never as a core element of an investigation. We also never used products from companies like Clearview AI. A good example of how we sometimes use a facial recognition tool as a starting point for further research can be found in our article on how <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/04/06/cartel-king-kinahans-google-reviews-expose-travel-partners/">“Cartel King Kinahan’s Google Reviews Expose Travel Partners”</a>.</p><p>SH: Are there any overlooked tools that you like to highlight in your trainings?</p><p>JW: The best type of tool really depends on the research topic. Often a combination of several small tools can lead to the best results. For instance, our<a href="https://bellingcat.github.io/name-variant-search/"> Name Variant Search Tool</a> is basically an enhanced search engine for finding information about people. Open source researchers often start with a name and try to find out as much as possible about the person’s online presence. However, the name might be written differently on different sites. “Jane Doe” might also show up as “J. Doe” or “Doe, Jane”. The tool suggests different possible variations of a name and provides search results for all those variations. It is also possible to instruct the tool to search for a name specifically on Linkedin or Facebook.</p><p>Example: Name Variant Search results for different variants of the name “Jane&nbsp;Doe”</p><p>Our<a href="https://osm-search.bellingcat.com/"> OpenStreetMap search tool</a>, on the other hand, supports the geolocation process. A core task of many open source researchers is to find out where a photo or video that they found online has been taken. To do that, they try to identify specific features and compare those with what is visible on satellite imagery or maps. If researchers already have a rough idea in which region a photo might have been taken, they can input a list of features that are visible in the photo (for instance, a residential street, a school and a supermarket) into our tool, which will try to list all locations in a pre-defined region in which those features show up together. This can really help narrow down possible locations.</p><p>SH: What’s an example of an unusual story or insight one can find from OS&nbsp;tools?</p><p>JW: If open source researchers have no idea where a picture might have been taken but they know at which time it was captured and the photo shows objects that cast clearly visible shadows, they can try our<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/GalenReich/ShadowFinder/blob/main/ShadowFinderColab.ipynb"> ShadowFinder</a> tool which is able to calculate at which locations around the world shadow lengths correspond with what can be seen in the photo at a specific point in time. This helps open source researchers concentrate their geolocation efforts to the areas suggested by the tool instead of searching across the whole&nbsp;world.</p>Example of a<a href="https://github.com/bellingcat/ShadowFinder"> ShadowFinder</a> tool result: Possible locations are shown by the yellow&nbsp;circle.<p>Another tool that has gained popularity within the open source researcher community is<a href="https://peakvisor.com/"> PeakVisor</a>, a tool that was originally targeted at helping mountaineers orient themselves but which can also be used for<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/07/13/more-than-mountaineering-using-peakvisor-for-geolocation/"> geolocation tasks</a>. For instance, we used it to research the location of the<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/12/11/the-sound-of-bullets-the-killing-of-colombian-journalist-abelardo-liz/"> killing of Colombian journalist Abelardo Liz</a>. This example in particular shows that a combination of research skills and the use of tools can go a long&nbsp;way.</p><p>SH: What frustrations or barriers do you see as a trainer, and how could the field democratize knowledge of command line&nbsp;tools?</p><p>JW: First of all: Teaching open source research is great. People who are interested in learning these methods come from so many different backgrounds which allows everyone to learn new things from each other, including the trainers! The topic is also quite accessible, meaning that everyone can start doing open source research with very simple methods, like using search engines in creative ways. Sometimes, this can lead to surprising results: For instance, just by googling, my colleague Foeke Postma revealed how<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/05/28/us-soldiers-expose-nuclear-weapons-secrets-via-flashcard-apps/"> US soldiers exposed nuclear weapons secrets via flashcard apps</a>.</p><p>Of course not all methods are as simple, and one of the things people are struggling with the most are research tools. During my <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/">Nieman-Berkman Klein fellowship</a> my research assistant Cooper-Morgan Bryant and I interviewed forty open source researchers about their use of tools. Their answers confirmed my<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/08/12/these-are-the-tools-open-source-researchers-say-they-need/"> previous findings</a> on this topic: Open source researchers, who are either beginners or who are looking at a topic that is new to them, find it really difficult to figure out what tool they should use at what stage of the research process and how those tools work. With such a wide variety of online tools, some more useful and some easier to find than others, and many researchers feel overwhelmed by the task of finding their way through the landscape of available tools spread across various platforms.</p><p>In addition, the majority of open source researchers are not able to use command line tools since this requires a certain degree of technical skills. However, those are exactly the type of small tools that the open source software community is building most frequently. There is a clear divide between those who are building tools for open source researchers and the researcher community itself, for whom those tools often turn out not to be accessible.</p><blockquote>“Open source researchers want complex tools that are easy to use and that are stable and well-developed but such tools need funders and teams who build them, and these conditions are not always easily met in the open source research and journalism space.”</blockquote><p>On the other side, open source researchers are often not aware of the resources that are required to build mature tools that have an easy-to-use interface. It is getting easier now, but tool builders need to invest a lot more time to build such tools and this is difficult for people who do this task in their free time and without any funding. Open source researchers want complex tools that are easy to use, stable, and well-developed, but such tools need funders and teams who build them. These conditions are not always easily met in the open source research and journalism space. I hope that researchers will become a little bit more open to learn some basic technical skills, and even more importantly that they understand that not every tool that is useful for their research has to function like a fully built commercial tool.</p><p>At Bellingcat, we focus on bridging this gap between tool builders and open source researchers. We work with tech communities —often through programs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOHj7r0_CKA">hackathons</a> or fellowships — and make them aware of how important good user guides are, even for seemingly easy-to-use tools. On the other hand, we teach open source researchers how to use command line tools. We also launched a video series with the goal to help researchers make their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymCMy8OffHM">first steps</a> towards the more technical side of research&nbsp;tools.</p><p>SH: Tools take a lot of resources to build. Do any OSINT tools have a complicated provenance in terms of private sector origin or geopolitics?</p><p>JW: It is definitely problematic that researchers and journalists can be so dependent on tools provided by big tech companies. Meta’s social monitoring platform Crowdtangle will be shut down in August and this has caused a lot of discontent amongst journalists, in particular amongst those who are covering elections. For instance, many of the platforms and tools open source researchers use are provided by Google, like Google Search, Google Maps and Google Earth Pro. We are often at the mercy of the decisions that big tech companies take regarding use of their&nbsp;tools.</p><p>However, their tools are usually provided for free, which is not the case for other commercial tools. Open source researchers definitely need to look into the companies from which they are buying tools. One risk is that tool providers might be able to see what type of keywords people are typing in or on what topic someone is working on. Researchers and journalists need to be sure that their sensitive research topics are safe from being monitored by tool providers.</p><p>At Bellingcat we focus on mostly small open source tools, but those tools come with their own set of challenges. For instance, it is often not clear who is behind a tool that is offered on code-sharing platforms like Github, which can raise security-related questions.</p><blockquote>“I would love to see universities getting more involved in building and maintaining tools for open source researchers and journalists…since both sides have the common goal of advancing research in the public interest”</blockquote><p>This is why I really hope we can build a different tool ecosystem for open source researchers in the future. I would love to see universities getting more involved in building and maintaining tools for open source researchers and journalists. I think that such collaborations could work well since both sides have the common goal of advancing research in the public interest, and many of the tools that are used by open source researchers are equally useful for academic researchers. I also see opportunities to research security-related aspects of widely used tools together, as journalists and open source researchers could definitely use some help in assessing the risks that some of the tools they are using might be posing. If anyone who reads this would like to discuss these topics with me: Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/johanna_wild">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p><p>SH: Misinformation, disinformation, conspiratorial thinking: What are some of the uses and abuses of “research” you see in these contexts?</p><p>JW: What is most common — especially during conflicts and wars — is that people share either photos or videos from a different conflict or old imagery and make people believe that they are related to current events. In the context of the Israel-Gaza conflict since October 2023, this phenomenon has reached a new scale with countless examples circulating online. For instance,<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/11/hamas-attacks-israel-bombs-gaza-and-misinformation-surges-online/"> Bellingcat</a> found videos that were shared with the claims that one showed rockets that were fired at Israel by Hamas and another that claimed to show recent Israeli strikes on Hamas; both turned out to be recycled videos that had been uploaded to YouTube several years&nbsp;prior.</p><blockquote>“People who post such pictures might sometimes think they are doing ‘research’ and that they are sharing relevant information about an ongoing conflict, without realizing that they are actually sharing incorrect information.”</blockquote><p>What is dangerous is that some of those posts go viral and are able to reach significant numbers of people who will never know that they fell for misinformation. People who post such pictures might sometimes think they are doing “research” and that they are sharing relevant information about an ongoing conflict, not realizing the information is incorrect. Others, however, will do it on purpose to evoke emotions either in favor or against one of the conflict parties. Users of online platforms cannot really do much to prevent being confronted with such posts. This is another reason it is essential that we all learn to question what we see online and to invest some time in learning <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2021/11/01/a-beginners-guide-to-social-media-verification/">basic verification skills</a>.</p><p>What we have also been seeing is that supporters of conspiracy ideologies are increasingly using open source research tools and presenting the information as journalistic findings. For example,<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/11/24/toy-rabbits-chemtrails-and-german-qanon-fanatics-how-not-to-conduct-open-source-investigations/"> Qanon supporters</a> in German-speaking countries started using flight-tracking sites to search for flights which they falsely believed were circling above “deep underground military bases” in which children were hidden and mistreated. This is problematic since people who are not aware of the methods and standards of open source research might not be able to differentiate between serious research and the distorted version of&nbsp;it.</p><p>SH: What are some of your favorite guidelines or best practices for journalists who aim to cover (and fact-check) broad conspiratorial thinking enabled by OS information?</p><p>JW: Looking at their business models can often be a very promising approach. More often than not, conspiracy-minded communities have business-savvy people amongst them who manage to benefit financially from those communities’ beliefs. When I was researching QAnon online communities in Germany, big platforms like Amazon and eBay had started implementing measures to ban QAnon products from their platforms. However, this seemed to have created new opportunities for QAnon influencers who were offering merchandise via their own small online shops. On top of that, customers in Germany were able to buy QAnon products from abroad, for instance from Chinese or British companies who offered products targeted specifically at German-speaking customers. It was interesting but also concerning to see how international today’s conspiracy merchandise markets&nbsp;are.</p><p>To research online shops, it is always worth researching what<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/03/26/how-to-get-started-investigating-payment-gateways-online/"> payment options</a> those shops are using and to look into their potential use of<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/03/26/how-to-track-illegal-funding-campaigns-via-cryptocurrency"> cryptocurrencies</a>. It is also important to take some time to learn the terminology a certain group is using. If you are looking into the far-right, for instance, it is crucial to learn how to<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/04/04/how-not-to-interpret-far-right-symbols/"> interpret the symbols</a> they&nbsp;use.</p><blockquote>”Open source researchers are often portrayed as some type of ‘nerdy hero’ who spends time on his laptop to research ‘the bad guys’ and is celebrated once he succeeds. The idea of one hero figure who solves all the research challenges is really the exact opposite of how open source research works&nbsp;best…”</blockquote><p>SH: How might international organizations build stronger support for women, femme-identified, and gender-nonconforming media and research professionals?</p><p>JW: In the field of open source research, there are definitely tendencies that I would like to see changed in the future. It is well established that women and gender-nonconforming people have traditionally had a much harder time to enter and succeed in the space of investigative journalism. Those issues are far from being overcome, but the journalism world has started to talk more openly about it, and the fact that academic researchers have published work on this topic has also been&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>My impression is that as open source researchers, we have not yet put enough effort into reflecting on what is happening in our own field. Maybe we thought that since it is relatively new, those issues would not appear as strongly. Unfortunately, however, they do, and it’s time to recognize this.</p><p>There are definitely many contributing factors, but one that has had a strong effect on me is that open source researchers are often portrayed as some type of “nerdy hero” who spends time on his laptop to research “the bad guys” and is celebrated once he succeeds. The idea of one lone wolf who solves all the research challenges on their own is really the exact opposite of how open source research works best, which is by nature collaborative and often requires the efforts of many to put together various small pieces of verified online sources for a specific research case. For those of us who don’t want, and are also not able to fit into this commonly portrayed male hero picture, this field might not necessarily feel like a good&nbsp;fit.</p><p>However, since more and more traditional newsrooms are setting up open source research units right now, I see more women entering the field and hopefully, this will also change how we publicly talk about open source research over time. To everyone who organizes a public event on open source research, I recommend to not only approach the few already well known voices in the field but to take the effort to find and invite speakers who can contribute new perspectives and who have done research on topics that are not always in the spotlight.</p><p>SH: What were the most meaningful conversations you had during your time at the Berkman Klein Center? Do you plan to use any of your connections or insights from the fellowship in your future&nbsp;work?</p><p>JW: I am very grateful that I was able to be a Berkman Klein Fellow this year. It was a great opportunity to be part of a community of people who all reflect on how we integrate new technologies in our lives but from various different angles. Each fellow and community hour provided me with insights into a different technology-related topic and I liked the “surprise” effect of being able to learn new things about topics I usually don’t have the time to think about. This has definitely had an impact on how I approached my own projects with Bellingcat. I feel that being immersed in such a knowledgeable and collaborative community has unlocked my creativity and I am looking forward to continuing to learn from everyone in the Berkman Klein sphere in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Johanna Wild was a joint 2023–2024 <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/#:~:text=The%20Nieman%2DBerkman%20Klein%20Fellowship,project%20relating%20to%20journalism%20innovation">Nieman-Berkman Fellow in Journalism Innovation</a>, a joint fellowship administered between the <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/">Nieman Foundation for Journalism</a> and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University.

<p></p>      First Web3 Global Battery Passport Implementation for Current and Future Regulatory Compliance           <p>DENSO, Honda, Mazda, and Nissan among MOBI members who have completed Stage 1 of the Cross-Industry Interoperable Minimum Viable Product, a three-year initiative towards a decentralized Global Battery Passport built for data privacy and selective disclosure</p>
          <p>Los Angeles, 10 July 2024 — MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, is thrilled to announce a significant milestone in development of the Web3 Global Battery Passport (GBP) Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In a historic first, the MVP has successfully demonstrated battery identity/data validation and exchange between nine organizations using open-standards — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI Battery Birth Certificate</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework — an achievement that carries exciting implications for stakeholders of the battery value chain and lays critical groundwork for the Web3 Economy. Organizations worldwide are invited to <a href="https://dlt.mobi/participate/">join and collaborate</a> in this trailblazing effort.</p>
<p>Participants of MOBI Circular Economy and the GBP Working Group, constituting close to USD 1 Trillion in annual revenue and representing diverse functions within the global battery ecosystem, have successfully completed Stage 1 of the three-year MVP and are set to begin Stage 2. Implementers of the decentralized GBP include <a href="https://www.anritsu.com/">Anritsu</a>, <a href="https://www.densoautoparts.com/">DENSO</a>, <a href="https://www.hioki.com/">HIOKI</a>, <a href="https://global.honda/">Honda</a>, <a href="https://www.mazda.com/">Mazda</a>, <a href="https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/">Nissan</a>, and <a href="https://trade-log.io/">TradeLog Inc</a>.</p>
<p>As the world increasingly turns to batteries for sustainable energy solutions, global battery value chains are making continuous improvements to enhance operational efficiency, circularity, and cross-border compliance. Forward-looking global policies like the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/17/2023-06822/section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit">US Treasury’s Section 30D Guidance on EV Tax Credits</a> and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542">EU Battery Regulation</a> mandate digital recordkeeping to track battery life cycles, underscoring the need for a global battery passport — a digital credential containing key information about the battery’s composition, state of health, history, and more.</p>
<p>Creating a scalable GBP will require cross-industry interoperability, such that entities across the value chain can securely coordinate and selectively share relevant data without the need to pay for costly one-off integrations or abandon their existing systems. MOBI and its members believe Web3 can become a key enabler for cross-industry interoperability at scale. SSI in particular introduces a promising approach to unlocking powerful synergies, enabling entities to securely control and share credentials across different web applications and platforms without the need for centralized intermediaries. To this end, MOBI and its members are building a decentralized Web3 marketplace ecosystem with standardized communication protocols for Self-Sovereign Data and SSI, designed such that the federated infrastructure and data therein are not controlled or managed by one organization. While MOBI MVP initiative demonstrates a specific use case for implementing the GBP, the benefits of MOBI Web3 implementation extend to almost any use case that involves multiparty transactions.</p>
<p>In Stage 1 of the initiative, implementers demonstrated the<a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/"> Integrated Trust Network</a> (ITN) identity services of one-to-one cross-validation for battery identity and data. The ITN serves as a federated (member-built and operated) registry for W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>, offering SSI management for connected entities such as batteries and their value chain participants. The ITN is the first enterprise network supporting multiple blockchains at the same time. These features are unique to the ITN, built for high resilience by ensuring the network’s functionality and sustainability do not rely on a single organization or blockchain.</p>
<p>Stage 2 will demonstrate <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a> decentralized marketplace services through creation of the cross-industry interoperable, privacy-preserving GBP. ITN services are one-to-one whereas Citopia services are one-to-many (and many-to-one). Through Web3 implementation, the availability and selective disclosure of trusted data and identities throughout the battery value chain will beget digital services and applications such as enhanced battery and carbon credits management, vehicle-to-grid communications and transactions, risk-based insurance calculations, and data-driven used electric vehicle pricing.</p>
<p>“Today’s global battery value chain is complex and it’s difficult to simultaneously ensure efficiency, scalability, safety, circularity, and regulatory compliance. To balance these priorities, we need to enhance battery lifecycle management through the creation of a shared ecosystem with SSI framework for secure coordination and selective disclosure of sensitive data,” said MOBI CEO and Co-founder, Tram Vo. “Driving innovation at this scale requires cross-industry collaboration. We invite public and private organizations worldwide to join us in this critical pursuit.”</p>
<p>“Web3 is an interesting technology which may facilitate a more scalable approach to exchanging battery data in a peer-to-peer fashion between organizations,” said Christian Köbel, Senior Engineer at Honda Motor Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>“It is confirmed how Web3-based self-sovereign data management works throughout Stage 1 of the MVP,” said Yusuke Zushi, Senior Manager at Nissan.</p>
<p>Said Mazda Motor Corporation, “Through participation in the GBP Working Group, we not only acquired the technical knowledge of Web3 but also understood a vision of an ecosystem that realizes the exchange of reliable information. We appreciate MOBI for giving us this invaluable opportunity.”</p>
<p>“The Stage 1 MVP experiment was instrumental in deepening our understanding of a system that enables sovereign data management. In the current era of data, the integrity and safety of information flow are paramount. As an experienced manufacturer of measuring instruments, HIOKI has always placed a premium on the reliability and accuracy of data,” said Kenneth Soh, Executive Officer at HIOKI. “We believe that the insights gained from this MVP are vital for the future progress of measurement instrument manufacturers and the industries we serve, from the perspective of innovation and societal contribution driven by mechanisms that offer both security and precision in data distribution.”</p>
<p>“The successful implementation of the Web3 GBP MVP is a significant step towards a more transparent and sustainable battery ecosystem. We are honored to contribute to the realization of the GBP as participants in this important initiative,” said Hisashi Matsumoto, Senior Manager at Anritsu.</p>
<p>“We, TradeLog, Inc., proudly support the decentralized Global Battery Passport project, driven by the efforts of MOBI and its dedicated Implementers,” said Alvin Ishiguro, Project Coordinator at TradeLog, Inc. “Going forward, we will continue to deliver our customers new experiences through blockchain technologies in the energy sector.”</p>
          <p>About MOBI</p>

<p>Running a Ceramic node in a production environment involves several key components. This article aims to provide an overview of the necessary resources and cost estimates for deploying a Ceramic node in the cloud. While we only showcased two specific providers for the services required (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DigitalOcean</a> and <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">QuickNode</a>), we hope these cost examples given the hypothetical scenarios we walk through will help give you a general idea of cost.</p> Components Required for a Ceramic Node <p>There are several sub-services to consider when running a Ceramic node in production, each serving different functions. As such, you will need:</p> 1. Resources for JS-Ceramic   Functionality: Tracks and stores the latest tips for pinned streams, caches stream state, provides the HTTP API service for connected clients to read, and communicates with the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) for blockchain anchoring and timestamping.   2. Resources for Ceramic-One   Functionality: These nodes store the actual data and coordinate with network participants.   3. Resources for Postgres Database   Functionality: Required for indexing data.   4. Ethereum RPC Node API Access   Functionality: Required to validate CAS anchors.   5. Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) Access   Current Status: Anchors Ceramic protocol proofs to the blockchain. This service is currently funded by 3box Labs, however, eventually, this function will be provided by node operators and with some expected cost.   Baseline Recommended Resources <p>Given the services you’ll need above, the Ceramic team has tested and organized a set of “baseline” configuration settings we recommend when setting up your node. However, seeing as these are baseline, or average, you may need to increase resourcing accordingly based on your actual usage:</p> JS-Ceramic   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for state   Ceramic-One   4 vCPU  4 GB memory  100 GB disk for storage   Postgres Database   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for indexing   High Traffic Recommended Resources <p>Given the services you’ll need above, the Ceramic team has tested and organized a set of “High Traffic” configuration settings we recommend when setting up your node. However, seeing as these are baseline, or average, you may need to increase resourcing accordingly based on your actual usage:</p> JS-Ceramic   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for state  10,000 IOPs     Ceramic-One   6 vCPU  8 GB memory  500 GB disk for storage  15,000 IOPs     Postgres Database   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for indexing   High Availability Configuration <p>For high availability, an additional node can be configured to sync data and handle dynamic read/write tasks, thus doubling the cost of a single-node setup.</p> Ethereum RPC Node Endpoint Costs <p>We’ve also chosen QuickNode to provide several RPC cost examples :</p>  QuickNode Base Plan: $10/month (100 million API credits, 2 endpoints, 550 credits/second)  QuickNode Middle Plan: $49/month (500 million API credits, 10 endpoints, 2,500 credits/second)  QuickNode Premium Plan: $299/month (3 billion API credits, 20 endpoints, 6,000 credits/second)   Hypothetical Scenarios and Cost Estimates <p>Let’s walk through three hypothetical need scenarios and use these to help estimate our cost structure:</p> Application A: Small User Base   User Base: 10,000 monthly active users  Query Behavior: 30% writes, 70% reads  Availability: Low-priority  Configuration: Baseline resources  Cost Estimate:  Node: $96/month  Ethereum RPC: $10/month  Total: $106/month     Application B: Write-Heavy Mid-Sized Application   User Base: 100,000-500,000 monthly active users  Query Behavior: 70% writes, 30% reads  Availability: High priority (2-node setup)  Configuration: High Traffic  Cost Estimate:  Nodes (2x): $918/month (2x $459)  Ethereum RPC: $49/month  Total: $967/month    <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator?hl=en&amp;dl=CiRjN2M2MzI1My0xYTQ1LTQ1N2YtOTc2MS04NjlkNzg1YjQ4YjYQCBokRjhGNDYwNjgtRTFBMC00M0MxLTgzMDAtRTRBNDFGQUFGQkVC&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Example GCP budget</a></p> Other Considerations <p>Additional cloud costs must be considered for networking - these costs will vary based on traffic patterns. Most cloud providers offer free traffic ingress to the nodes but will charge for egress, or data leaving the nodes.</p><p>Running a Ceramic node in production involves various components and resources, each contributing to the overall cost. By understanding the necessary configurations and associated costs, developers can make informed decisions tailored to their application's needs and user base. High availability setups and resource over-provisioning can significantly impact costs, especially for mid-sized applications with high traffic and write volumes.</p>

 <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">Open Identity Exchange (OIX)</a> and <a href="https://diacc.ca">DIACC</a> commit to finding alignment for global policies on digital trust and verification. 



<p>UK, June 2024 – The global non-profit <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">Open Identity Exchange (OIX)</a> and the Canadian non-profit <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</a> have committed to working together to advance global digital interoperability – a crucial element for trusted, successful international trade in a rapidly advancing digital global economy.</p>



<p>OIX is an influential global community for all those involved in the ID sector to connect and collaborate, developing the thought leadership and guidance needed to enable interoperable, trusted identities carried seamlessly from place to place in ‘roaming wallets’ for everyone. DIACC is an equally influential community of public and private sector leaders committed securing inclusive digital economy benefits by promoting user-centric design principles and verifying private sector services against the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) to support a secure ecosystem of services to enable user-directed information verification between public and private sector data authorities.</p>



<p>The two organisations will explore how different country-based policies related to identity management, verification, security, data privacy innovation and approaches to digital identity assurance can be compared and analysed so that more rapid progress can be made towards global digital ID interoperability through alignment of policy or acceptance of policy differences.</p>



<p>The collaboration will focus on advancing methods for participants in one framework to accept identity verification and digital credentials verified through another trust framework based on a mixture of policy acceptance and technology adaption. DIACC and OIX will explore equivalency and interoperability processes, identify potential alignments, new standards required, and gaps that may need to be addressed, and highlight use cases that can be facilitated through interoperability across digital ecosystems. Within this work, they will explore methods to describe common features of jurisdictional and sectoral trust frameworks, and share insights widely available as a resource.</p>



<p>The exchange and transfer of knowledge and expertise will be at the heart of this collaboration. OIX and DIACC will work together to create ‘intellectual capital’ to shape debate and bring about actions, moving identity management, data privacy, and security forward at pace.</p>



<p>Nick Mothershaw, Chief Identity Strategist at OIX, said: “The benefits of the digital global economy will be vast, but there is still some way to go before everyone can confidently access them. Our collaboration with DIACC will play a critical role. The fantastic progress DIACC has already made across Canada is an exemplar for global interoperability and will provide much needed insight, tools and guidance to pave a much clearer way forward globally.</p>



<p>“Our plans are to share our work with other trust frameworks across the globe, by publishing the criteria and values, and in the short-term creating an interim tool for trust frameworks to use for policy areas. We also want to secure their input on what they want to see in Trust Framework Comparison tool, as well as to start demonstrating how a roaming wallet will work.”</p>



<p>Joni Brennan, DIACC President, said: “We’re thrilled to collaborate with the Open Identity Exchange. The formalization of our liaison demonstrates progress in supporting our shared values to advance secure, user-centric digital identity solutions globally. Our collaboration will leverage each organization’s expertise to explore opportunities to foster innovation, enhance interoperability, and build public trust in digital services by identifying the alignments and gaps between jurisdictional and sectoral trust frameworks.”</p>

<p>Driving data interconnectivity, interoperability, and integrity, the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), now in its 6th iteration, delivers significant advancements that have benefited world-class organizations and shaped standards for industrial information exchange. Through partnerships with entities such as the British Standards Institution¹²³, GS1⁴⁵, European Blockchain Sandbox⁶, and various government-funded initiatives, the DKG has also played a crucial role in informing public policies.</p><p>DKG uniquely and effectively addresses the challenges of data ownership, AI hallucinations, and bias⁷ with the Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG)⁸ framework. dRAG drives a vast advancement of the RAG model initially developed by Meta⁹, by organizing external sources in a DKG while introducing incentives to grow a global, crowdsourced network of knowledge made available for AI models to&nbsp;use.</p><p>The DKG V8 has through a prototype demonstrated an unprecedented scale at which the Verifiable Internet for AI can drive value for anyone, on any device, and any chain. Addressing sensitive data concerns, scalability, and AI challenges concurrently has brought encouraging results that importantly shape the expected V8 release timeline.</p> DKG V8 — for Anyone, on Any Device, on Any Chain at Internet&nbsp;Scale <p>OriginTrail DKG has been battle-tested in real-world applications increasingly used by an ecosystem of organizations and government-supported initiatives. To date, no decentralized system has scaled in the production environment the way V6 DKG has. However, the current capacity of DKG reached its limits to support the growing usage requirements, prompting a transition to the V8, evolved to tackle the scale at which AI is consumed in any environment.</p><p>Data has been growing exponentially for decades, with AI driving further growth acceleration — according to the latest estimates, 402.74 million terabytes of data are created each day¹⁰. This trend is increasingly visible in the rising demands for additional capacity in the DKG, driven by data-intensive industry deployments in aerospace, manufacturing, railways, consumer goods, and construction driving DKG&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Version 8 of the DKG has therefore been designed with major scalability improvements at multiple levels, with a prototyped implementation tested in collaboration with partners from the sectors mentioned above.</p> 3 key products of OriginTrail DKG&nbsp;V8 <p>The major advancement that DKG V8 is making is in expanding the OriginTrail ecosystem’s product suite to 3 key products:</p>  DKG Core Node V8 — highly scalable network nodes forming network core, persisting the public replicated DKG  DKG Edge Node V8 — user-friendly node applications tailored to edge devices (phones, laptops,&nbsp;etc).  ChatDKG V8 — the launchpad for creating AI solutions using decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG).   DKG Edge Node — enabling the largest, internet-scale decentralized physical infrastructure network&nbsp;(DePIN) <p>The newcomer in the product suite is the DKG Edge Node — a new type of DKG node enabling the OriginTrail ecosystem to tackle the global challenges described above. As the name suggests, DKG edge nodes can operate on Internet edge devices. Devices such as personal computers, mobile phones, wearables, IoT devices, but also enterprise and government systems are where we can find huge volumes of very important data activity that DKG edge nodes will enable to enter the AI age in a safe and privacy-preserving way. The DKG edge node will enable such sensitive data to remain protected on the device, giving owners full control over how their data is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Together with being protected on the device, edge-node data becomes a part of the global DKG with precise access management permissions controlled by the data owner. In this way, AI applications that the owner allows data access to will be able to use it together with the public data in the DKG via decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG).</p><p>Since such AI applications can equally be run locally on devices directly, this enables fully privacy-preserving AI solutions aimed at the ever-growing number of devices on the network edge that can at the same time use both public and private DKG data. The introduction of the DKG edge node enables the DKG to quickly expand to be the largest, internet-scale decentralized physical infrastructure network&nbsp;(DePIN).</p> New features of the DKG Edge&nbsp;Node <p>To unlock these powerful capabilities, DKG edge node will include new features that have previously not been available on DKG nodes but were elements of other proprietary or open-source products.</p>  To enable a seamless creation of knowledge, DKG nodes will inherit the proven knowledge publishing pipelines from the Network Operating System&nbsp;(nOS).

<p>The digital realm has long struggled with the vulnerabilities inherent in password-based authentication systems. With iOS 18 launching in September, Apple introduces a groundbreaking API for developers to implement passkeys, transforming how users secure their online accounts. This innovation is set to create a password-less future, significantly enhancing user data protection.</p>



 What Are Passkeys? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are a sophisticated, passwordless login option for apps and websites developed by the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance</a>. They consist of a “private key” stored on the user’s device and a “public key” residing with the service. This dual-key system undergoes an encrypted verification process, ensuring that access is granted only when the user’s biometrics or device PIN confirm their identity. This system effectively eliminates the need for passwords and multi-factor authentication codes, creating a seamless and secure user experience.</p>



 The Benefits of Passkeys 



<p>Traditional logins rely on passwords, which users often reuse across multiple sites, posing substantial security risks. Passkeys, however, are tied to the user’s unique device and biometric data, rendering them immune to phishing and brute-force attacks. If a passkey is stolen, it becomes useless without the rightful owner’s biometric verification. This intrinsic link between the user and the device significantly mitigates the threat landscape.</p>



 Banks and Passkey Adoption 



<p>While the advantages of passkeys are clear, some industries have been slow to adopt, including banks. Andrew Shikiar, CEO and Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance, explains, “Banks and financial institutions operate in a highly regulated industry, so they are vigilant when it comes to ensuring that user authentication complies with relevant regulations. Synced passkeys introduce a new customer assurance model that compliance leads within banks are still adjusting to.”</p>



<p>However, Shikiar noted that “we are now seeing regulatory and other government bodies begin to give formal guidance on how industry should contemplate passkeys,” including an April 2024 <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/giving-nist-digital-identity-guidelines-boost-supplement-incorporating">missive</a> from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offering guidance about implementation.</p>



<p>But Shikiar says that “banks are hypersensitive to customer experience,” too, and thus more cautious about changing how customers log in—even if passkeys are quicker and more secure. New login methods require educating customers—and that takes time.</p>



<p>Despite these bottlenecks, Shikiar says that banks are slowly moving away from strictly password-based logins because they “inherently understand that using a passkey as a primary factor is far superior to a password.”</p>



 The Collaborative Future of Passwordless Authentication 



<p>Apple’s implementation of passkeys underlines a collective effort by tech giants within the FIDO Alliance, including Microsoft and Google, to enhance internet security. The Alliance has pioneered developments in authentication standards, striving to eliminate the vulnerabilities of password-based systems. Users can visit the FIDO Alliance to learn more about the ongoing efforts and advancements in passkey technology and the latest in <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">passkey implementation</a>.</p>



<p>As passkeys gain traction, the internet moves closer to a future where security does not come at the expense of user convenience. The collaborative efforts of industry leaders within the FIDO Alliance signal a transformative shift towards more secure, passwordless authentication methods, promising a safer digital experience for all.</p>
