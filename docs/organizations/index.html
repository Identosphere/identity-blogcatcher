<p>In a world where data is currency and information is power, the lines between our virtual and real-world selves have become increasingly blurred. The digital realm is no longer a separate entity; it’s an integral part of our daily lives. It’s where we communicate, create, and conduct business. But in this digital landscape, who truly holds the reins of control? Who has the power to shape their <a href="https://elastos.info/digital-destiny/">digital destiny</a>? Elastos, as it celebrates its 6th anniversary, answers these questions with a resounding call to action.</p>
<p>Elastos empowers individuals in an era where data ownership is paramount and information is the currency of the future. With a comprehensive suite of tools and technologies, Elastos invites you to be the architect of the next generation of creative platforms, financial services, and business processes. It doesn’t just envision a world where you take control of your digital destiny; it provides the means to make that vision a reality.</p>
<p>At the heart of this empowerment lies Elastos’ versatile and robust consensus mechanism—a three-pronged approach that is unique, flexible, and, above all, secure. Through <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/mainchain/auxpow/">auxiliary proof of work</a> (APoW), <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/mainchain/bpos/">variable bonded proof of stake</a> (BPoS), <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/council">proof of integrity</a> (PoI), and <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/sidechains/intro/">sidechains</a>, Elastos ensures that you have the tools to shape your digital future on your terms. In the 2nd part of the “Journey of Elastos- Celebrating its 6th Anniversary series”, let’s embark on a journey to explore how this innovative consensus mechanism puts the power back in your hands, where it belongs.</p>
 Elastic Consensus – Shaping Your Digital Destiny 
<p>Elastos’ <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastic-consensus-technical-overview/">Elastic Consensus</a> is not just a technical concept; it’s a call to action. It’s an invitation for individuals to take control of their digital destinies. In a world where data is increasingly valuable, Elastos provides a unique and flexible framework that empowers you to participate actively in shaping the digital landscape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first prong, proof of integrity (PoI), stands as an emblem of decentralized governance. It’s about ensuring that the decisions that shape the blockchain’s future are made collectively and transparently. The Cyber Republic DAO, which embodies POI, gives you a seat at the table. It’s a space where community voices are heard, Proposals are discussed, and decisions are made collaboratively. In a world where information is power, the Cyber Republic DAO empowers you to actively participate in the governance of the digital realm.</p>
<p>Elastos’ mainchain consensus is the second prong of the Elastic Consensus which is anchored by two core components: merged mining with Bitcoin for heightened security and the innovative variable BPoS system. Merged mining taps into Bitcoin’s unmatched security to safeguard the network, while BPoS introduces equity tokens and community incentives, ensuring widespread participation and empowering stakeholders in shaping the blockchain’s future.</p>
<p>Sidechains constitute the third prong of the Elastos Consensus, playing a pivotal role in enabling secure and efficient asset transfers between the mainchain and various sidechains within the ecosystem. This is achieved through mechanisms like SPV, multi-signature transactions, and the involvement of elected Arbiters, ensuring network decentralization and security. Sidechains ensure the seamless movement of assets and represent a crucial element of Elastos’ overall consensus mechanism.</p>
 The Cyber Republic DAO: Empowering Community Governance 
<p>One of the most remarkable achievements in Elastos’ journey has been the establishment of the Cyber Republic DAO. This monumental development represents a paradigm shift in the world of blockchain governance. It acknowledges the pivotal role played by a vibrant and engaged community in not only the success but also the long-term sustainability of a blockchain project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Cyber Republic DAO introduces a decentralized decision-making process in which community members, ELA token holders, and the <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/council">CR Council</a> collaboratively participate. This process encompasses various aspects, including Proposal submission, CR Council Member elections, and participatory voting. It empowers every individual within the Elastos ecosystem to have a real say in shaping the project’s direction.</p>
<p>Central to the Cyber Republic DAO is Elastos’ commitment to openness, transparency, and inclusivity. It has transformed the governance structure, making it more accessible and participatory. Elastos is not just a blockchain project; it’s a community-driven ecosystem that thrives on the active involvement of its stakeholders.</p>
 Mainchain Consensus 
 Merged Mining 
<p>Elastos achieved a significant milestone in its journey with the introduction of <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-merged-mining-explained-harnessing-bitcoins-strength-for-security/">merged mining</a> alongside <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>. This strategic move, which took shape on August 26, 2018, followed over a year of rigorous internal development and close collaboration with mining pool partners. The result was a substantial enhancement of the Elastos mainnet’s security.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What makes merged mining particularly ingenious is its ability to harness the hashing power of the Bitcoin network without incurring additional energy costs. Elastos’ initial hashrate quickly surpassed 30% of Bitcoin’s network hashrate, underscoring its position as a prominent player in the world of public blockchains.</p>
<p>The integration of merged mining with Bitcoin not only bolstered Elastos’ security landscape but also contributed to its energy-efficient approach. Elastos demonstrates that security and sustainability can go hand in hand in the blockchain space.</p>
 Evolving Consensus: From DPoS to BPoS 
<p>Elastos’ evolution in consensus mechanisms from Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) to <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/mainchain/bpos/">BPoS</a> marked a significant turning point in its journey. BPoS introduced equity tokens and incentives for participation, heralding a future of decentralized consensus that simultaneously prioritizes security and community vibrancy.</p>
<p>Under BPoS, users stake ELA tokens as BPoS equity tokens, which grant them staking privileges based on the quantity and duration of their staked tokens. This innovative approach encourages broader participation and introduces equity tokens tailored for diverse community engagements. Validators play a central role in the process, earning rewards for their contributions to block consensus and arbitrator selection.</p>
<p>Elasots’ transition to BPoS in April 2023 was a bold move towards a more decentralized, secure, and stable blockchain ecosystem. The variable BPoS Consensus positions Elastos as a leader in cultivating an inclusive and robust blockchain landscape.</p>
 Sidechain Consensus 
<p>In the Elastos blockchain ecosystem, sidechains play a vital role within the overall consensus mechanism. They facilitate seamless asset transfers between the Elastos mainchain and various sidechains through a bidirectional anchoring mechanism.</p>
<p>Cross-chain transactions involve the movement of ELA between the mainchain and sidechains. When users deposit ELA from the mainchain to a sidechain, they send it to a designated frozen address on the respective sidechain. The sidechain’s SPV module monitors the mainchain transaction and creates a corresponding transaction in the sidechain to credit the user’s account with sidechain tokens.</p>
<p>Each sidechain has its own frozen address linked to the mainchain, facilitating asset transfers. Secure transaction procedures ensure the movement of assets between the mainchain and sidechains. Users generate random secrets and corresponding hashes for authentication during transactions. Multisignature addresses play a crucial role in transaction security.</p>
<p>The Elastos ecosystem employs security mechanisms like SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) and elected arbitrators to ensure the safety of cross-chain transactions. Arbitrators are elected by mainchain token holders and are responsible for authorizing token withdrawals from sidechains to the mainchain.</p>
<p>Cyber Republic Council members, in addition to their validator node roles, maintain Arbiter nodes. These Arbiters oversee cross-chain transactions and contribute to the consensus process.</p>
<p>There’s a possibility of adjusting the consensus mechanism for cross-chain transactions in the future, potentially involving a total of 36 nodes, which would include 12 CR nodes and 24 voting nodes. Such an adjustment could influence the governance and decision-making related to cross-chain transactions.</p>
<p>In essence, sidechains are a fundamental component of the Elastos consensus mechanism, ensuring secure and efficient asset transfers between the mainchain and sidechains while maintaining network decentralization and security. This is achieved through SPV, multi-signature transactions, and the role of elected Arbiters.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Elastos doesn’t just provide technology; it provides a philosophy of empowerment. It’s a call to action for individuals to actively participate in securing, governing, and influencing the digital landscape. Whether you’re a creator, an investor, or simply someone who believes in the power of decentralized technology, Elastos empowers you to be an active participant in the digital revolution.</p>
<p>As Elastos celebrates its 6th anniversary, it stands as a beacon of innovation in the blockchain space. The lines between the virtual and real-world selves may continue to blur, but with Elastos, you can ensure that the control over your digital destiny remains firmly in your hands. Embrace the future, shape it, and make it your own, for in the world of Elastos, your digital destiny is truly yours to define.</p>
<p>As Elastos commemorates its 6th anniversary, its journey continues to be characterized by remarkable achievements in governance, security, and decentralization. The rise of the Cyber Republic DAO, side chain consensus, merged mining with Bitcoin, and the transition from DPoS to BPoS exemplify Elastos’ unwavering commitment to reshaping blockchain paradigms. Stay tuned for the next installment in this series, where we will explore further the multifaceted journey of Elastos as it celebrates its 6th anniversary.</p>

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the fourth article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">Photo forensics for AI-generated faces</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Classic computer-generated imagery (CGI) is produced by modeling 3D scene geometry, the surrounding illumination, and a virtual camera. As a result, rendered images accurately capture the geometry and physics of natural scenes. By contrast, AI-generated imagery is produced by learning the statistical distribution of natural scenes. Without an explicit 3D model of the world, we might expect that these images will not always accurately capture the 3D properties of natural scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The lighting of a scene can be complex, because any number of lights can be placed in any number of positions, leading to different lighting environments. Under some fairly modest assumptions, however, it has been shown that a wide range of lighting can be modeled as a weighted sum of nine 3D lighting environments that each capture a variety of lighting patterns from different directions.</p><p>My team and I first wondered if lighting environments on AI-generated faces match those on photographic images. Next, we wondered if the lighting on multiple faces or objects in an image are the same, as would be expected in an authentic photo.</p><p>Analyzing lighting environments first requires fitting and aligning a 3D model to individual objects. Fortunately, for faces, fitting a 3D model to a single image is a problem that has largely been solved. (See article 1 in the Further Reading section.)&nbsp;</p><p>Below you’ll see a 3D model fitted to an AI-generated face. From this aligned 3D model, we can estimate the surrounding lighting environment, which reduces to nine numeric values corresponding to the weight on each of nine 3D lighting environments.</p>

  <p>As you can see in the plot on the left below, there are some significant deviations between the nine lighting values for real faces (horizontal axis) and diffusion-generated faces (vertical axis). Interestingly, as you can see in the plot on the right, the lighting on GAN-generated faces (see previous post) are nearly indistinguishable from the lighting on real faces.</p>

  <p>While a comparison of lighting environments may expose a diffusion-based face (or object), it appears that this approach will not provide much insight for GAN-based faces. This is the reverse of our <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">previously described technique</a>, which was applicable to GAN-based faces but not diffusion-based faces, further highlighting the need for a wide variety of approaches.</p><p>The above analysis can be expanded to compare the lighting between two people or two objects situated side by side in an image where, in a naturally photographed scene, we expect the lighting to be the same. For this analysis, we find that diffusion-based faces and objects exhibit relatively large (but not always perceptually obvious) differences in lighting. (See article 3 in the “Further reading” section below for more details.)</p><p>The strength of this lighting analysis is that we have discovered a fairly fundamental limitation of today's AI-generated content: In the absence of explicit 3D models of the physical world, diffusion-based models struggle to create images that are internally (across multiple people/objects) and externally (as compared to photographic images) consistent. The weakness of this technique is that, unlike other approaches, it does not necessarily lend itself to a fully automatic and high-throughput analysis. The fitting of 3D models can be somewhat time intensive and require manual intervention.</p><p>Another strength of this technique is that even when made aware of the issue of lighting inconsistencies, it is not easy for an adversary to adjust the image. That is because the pattern of illumination is the result of an interaction of the 3D lighting and the 3D scene geometry, whereas most photo editing occurs in 2D. Also, as you will see in the next post, there are additional aspects to lighting that we can exploit to distinguish the real from the fake.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] Y. Feng, H. Feng, M.J.

  <p>ABSTRACT: Self-Sovereign Computing is a transformative paradigm designed to empower individuals to take command of their digital journey and to uphold their dignity, human rights, and resilience online. It encourages proactive collaboration among individuals, collectives, and platforms to enhance digital autonomy and to mitigate vulnerabilities. Building on Christopher’s initial ideas of self-sovereign identity, self-sovereign computing introduces an allegory that revisits some foundational influences and recognizes self-sovereignty not just as a personal choice but as something that’s part of a larger ecosystem._</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2016, Christopher Allen authored <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, where he introduced the concept of “Self-Sovereignty” to the world, with its ten principles. Five years later, he offered an <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/SSI-5-Years-On/">update</a> on its progress. Today, the self-sovereign community continues to evolve, with recent successes including <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/news/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">the ratification of DIDs</a> and the passage of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">laws in Wyoming</a> that recognized self-sovereignty. Given the time that had passed, Christopher also wrote an article talking about <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>

<p>Christopher’s newest look at self-sovereignty is an allegory that again revisits some of its foundational influences, recognizing self-sovereignty not just as a personal choice, but something that’s part of a larger ecosystem.</p>



 Your Digital Journey 

<p>Consider the times when you’ve felt lost in the vast and unpredictable digital sea. You’ve set out in a small ship, but your course is uncertain.</p>

<p>Despite being the rightful owner of that ship, you are a mere passenger. Your ports of call and your choice of companion vessels are not under your command but dictated by corporate behemoths that lurk beneath the waves. These unseen gatekeepers exact a continuous “toll” from you, not always in gold, but often in the currency of your personal data or by compelling you to relinquish your rights. Those behemoths control not just your data, but also your actual digital identity.</p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing is about finding a better way: about giving you control over your digital vessel.</p>

 Claiming Command — From Passenger to Captain 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing empowers you to claim command, to ascend from being a passenger to becoming the captain of your digital ship. This gives you the autonomy to plot your journey, to command your personal data, and to navigate digital exchanges without the burden of incessant tolls.</p>

<p>You become the rightful commander of your digital voyage and online experience.</p>

 Assembling Your Tools — Devices and Services 

<p>Your smartphone, your laptop, your smartwatch, and your digital wallet are the tools that you use to command your vessel, modern-day sextants and compasses. They help you to become a skilled navigator in the often treacherous marketplace of the digital ocean.</p>

<p>They are also powerful tools of communication that allow you to foster cooperation with other digital captains, opening up new possibilities when we self-sovereign sailors come together.</p>

<p>Tools that important must be reliable. Beyond that, they must meet our personal needs. This calls back to a time when ship makers would consult with captains about the individual needs of their vessels (just as we do in the modern day with <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a>). This ensures that we can sail the digital seas safely and have control and trust in our tools.</p>

 Fostering Digital Cooperation — Unity on the High Seas 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing envisions a cooperative digital ecosystem where individuals, as digital captains, can unite. Each ship, regardless of its size, contributes to the strength of our self-sovereign fleet, enhancing autonomy and rights for every individual. They can come together against the considerable adversaries of the digital landscape.</p>

<p>There are also promises of mutual aid: Self-Sovereign Computing seeks to protect the vulnerable. If a ship is in distress, others are obligated to give it support, which might mean helping to route messages to evade censorship or just lending some bandwidth to get around a digital traffic jam.</p>

<p>In essence, Self-Sovereign Computing steers us towards a cooperative digital ecosystem, where every digital captain’s strength is amplified through unity. The result is a digital seascape where collective strength is harnessed and where collective bargaining power is pooled, to negotiate better terms, services, and experiences for all.</p>

 The Inspiration of Self-Sovereign Computing 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing stems from a blend of inspirations, some of which are shared with <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>. Among the influences most important to understanding the idea of Self-Sovereign Computing are: the Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity, Living Systems Theory, Agency Law, and Maritime Law, each of which contributed to its foundational ethos.</p>

<p>The Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity play a crucial role in defining the paradigm of Self-Sovereign Computing. These principles emphasize user control and consent, the freedom of data interoperability, and the decentralization of identity authority, pushing the boundaries of individual digital autonomy.</p>

<p>Living Systems Theory speaks of inviduals having boundaries (“membranes”) that separate them from the rest of the world, but recognizes that communication occurs through that membrane. It was a foundational inspiration for Self-Sovereign Identity and is closely linked to the analogy of ships upon the sea.</p>

<p>Agency Law offers the concept of fiduciary duties that dictate a relationship of trust, responsibility, and user priority. Under this framework, digital tools and platforms are required to grant a duty of loyalty and care to their user: acting in their best interest, respecting privacy, protecting data, and ensuring users maintain control and authority over their digital identities and personal information.</p>

<p>Maritime Law contributes principles of mutual aid, freedom of navigation, and the doctrine of the high seas, reinforcing the importance of collective security, unrestricted access, and autonomy in the digital realm.</p>

<p>This blend of inspirations helps us envision a digital landscape that respects individual autonomy while also acknowledging our shared responsibility within the digital community. Collectively, these principles create the bedrock of Self-Sovereign Computing, guiding us towards a future where technology remembers its ultimate duty — to serve and protect the people.</p>

 The Self-Sovereign Computing Call to Action 

<p>Self-Sovereign Computing is more than a concept. It’s a beacon on the digital seas. It’s a movement and a rallying cry for individuals including: professionals in decentralized identity; digital human rights advocates; lawyers; and technologists alike. It’s a call for us to advocate for privacy-preserving tools, to demand transparency from platforms, and to assert control over personal data. It’s about supporting initiatives and platforms that align with the principles of Self-Sovereign Computing, fostering a culture of digital self-sovereignty in our communities.</p>

<p>Working collectively, we can form a fleet, to command respect and instigate change in the digital seas. By engaging in discussions, raising awareness, and actively advocating for change, we can reshape the digital world to prioritize people over corporations.</p>

 The Journey Ahead 

<p>Are you ready to seize control and chart your own course on this digital ocean? The era of Self-Sovereign Computing is upon us. It’s time to take the helm for your digital journey, shaping your route based on your choices and needs, not those of distant corporations.</p>

<p>Together, we can navigate toward a future where technology serves us unconditionally, and our devices, our data, and our digital experiences truly belong to us.</p>

<p>The helm is in your hands. The journey towards self-sovereignty begins now. Will you join us?</p>

It argues that while this work is crucial for team success, it can also be career-limiting if not managed deliberately, potentially pushing individuals into less technical roles.  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-new-turing-test/">To Navigate the Age of AI, the World Needs a New Turing Test</a> (WIRED) — an article discussing discusses the evolving perception of machine intelligence, particularly in the context of large language models like GPT-4. It suggests that the traditional Turing Test for machine intelligence is becoming outdated and proposes a new “Actual Alan Turing Test” that considers not just computational ability but also the machine’s impact on human emotion and cognition.  <a href="https://bryanalexander.org/future-trends-forum/solarpunk-as-a-way-of-redesigning-higher-education-for-the-climate-crisis/">Solarpunk as a way of redesigning higher education for the climate crisis</a> (Bryan Alexander) — this article explores “solarpunk” as a design movement that offers a hopeful, sustainable vision for the future, particularly in the context of climate change and its emotional toll. It considers ways in which higher education can adopt solarpunk principles, such as biophilic design and renewable energy to create campuses and curricula that are more harmonious with nature and focused on holistic problem-solving.  <a href="https://techpolicy.press/technology-companies-must-make-platforms-safer-for-women-in-politics/">Technology Companies Must Make Platforms Safer for Women in Politics</a> (Tech Policy Press) — the US-based National Democratic Institute (NDI) has conducted a study urging technology platforms to implement measures that protect women, especially those in politics, from online harassment and abuse. The article argues that making online spaces safer for women not only has ethical and democratic implications but also offers financial benefits for tech companies, such as enhanced brand reputation and reduced legal&nbsp;risks.  <p>👋 That’s it for this&nbsp;week!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/2-the-one-with-the-reframing-recognition-7fed71cc597f">#2: The One with the Reframing Recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Passwordless authentication is one of those concepts that is finally having its day in the sun after Apple, Google and Microsoft came onboard last year, expanding their support for the passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium. “The work that the FIDO Alliance has done to roll out passkeys, really positioning them as a strong way for consumers to start using and leveraging that strong PKI authentication, I think that is a really good step forward,” said Josh Cigna, enterprise solutions architect at Yubico.</p>

<p>Google has developed a quantum-resilient way of implementing the FIDO2 security key standard, an increasingly popular method of authentication that’s used as an alternative to passwords. David Turner, senior director of standards development at FIDO Alliance, which manages password-free authentication standards, said post-quantum changes to security keys are expected to come with challenges.</p>

 Introduction <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to make the most out of the query filtering and ordering capabilities in ComposeDB. By the end, you will know how to:</p>  Set up type validation directives and create indices for specific fields  Use value and logical conditions for querying  Sort the returned results by specific fields   Prerequisites   Basic understanding of GraphQL  An active ComposeDB environment (make sure to <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network">install the latest versions of Ceramic CLI and ComposeDB CLI</a>)   The Model <p>Before we can start querying, we need to have data models defined in ComposeDB, along with some data to query, filter, and sort.</p><p>You can use a simple social app from the great <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-composedb-on-ceramic-2/">Getting Started With ComposeDB on Ceramic</a> tutorial, create a model from scratch, or work on your existing data.</p><p>For simplicity, I’ll create a new model, adapt it to support filtering, add some data to it, and demonstrate all the filtering and sorting capabilities.</p> Defining a <code>Posts</code> model <p>A simple <code>Posts</code> model from the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-composedb-on-ceramic-2/">“Getting Started” guide</a> looks like this:</p> <code>type Posts @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post") {
  body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
  edited: DateTime
  created: DateTime!
  profileId: StreamID! @documentReference(model:"BasicProfile")
  profile: BasicProfile! @relationDocument(property: "profileId")
}
</code> <p>It’s good enough to capture and store data, but let’s make it more robust, add a few fields and get it ready for filtering and sorting.</p> Create indices and add fields <p>Query filtering in ComposeDB allows you to create queries that return a subset of data that matches specified criteria. This functionality helps you narrow down the search by specifying the search parameter.</p><p>To filter queries, you will need to create an index for the corresponding field. An index is a data structure that allows the database to find documents matching the filter criteria more quickly.</p><p>In our <code>Posts</code> type, for example, we have created indexes for <code>status</code>, <code>tag</code>, <code>created</code>, <code>rating</code>, and <code>edited</code> fields using the <code>@createIndex</code> directive as shown below:</p> <code>@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "status" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "tag" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "rating" }])
@createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }])
</code> <p>Our model now looks like this:</p> <code>enum PublicationStatus {
    DRAFT
    PUBLISHED
    ARCHIVED
}
type Posts
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple Post")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "status" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "tag" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "rating" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "edited" }]) {
    body: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    tag: String! @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 100)
    rating: Float @float(min: 0, max: 10)
    status: PublicationStatus!
    edited: DateTime
    created: DateTime!
}
</code> <p>You’ll notice a few additions here:</p>  A new <code>enum</code> type: <code>PublicationStatus</code>. We know that the publication status can have only a few possible options. We’re enumerating them all here and then we’ll use that as a type that we can apply to variables. We’ll use it for the new <code>status</code> value, and we’ll make the <code>status</code> mandatory by adding an exclamation point to the type  New fields: <code>tag</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>edited</code>. A good social app should have more than just short entries. With these fields, we’re adding an option to tag and rate posts, have different publication statuses, and an option to see which entries were edited and when.  <code>@createIndex</code> directive on five fields: <code>status</code>, <code>tag</code>, <code>created</code>, <code>rating</code>, <code>edited</code>. These add all the necessary indices. We can now filter and sort on all of these.   Add data <p>We have a model now but we don’t have any data yet. We can’t do much filtering if we don’t have anything to filter. Let’s add some posts.</p> <code>mutation CreatePosts{
  createPosts(input: {
    content: {
      body: "ComposeDB Launch",
      tag: "announcement",
      rating: 9.9,
      status: PUBLISHED,
      created: "2023-02-28T12:00:00Z"
      edited: "2023-03-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }){
    document{
      body
      tag
      rating
      status
      created
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>This mutation adds our first post, a ComposeDB launch post, with an <code>announcement</code> tag, a <code>9.9</code> rating and a non-zero <code>edited</code> field.</p><p>Let’s add 20 more posts so that we have enough to play with. You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/velvet-shark/ff6e840e939ba80dc5a11ad3338db5f9?ref=blog.ceramic.network">copy them from this gist</a> and use GraphiQL to add them to your Ceramic node.</p> Query Filtering <p>Now that we have a way to filter and have the data to filter on, let’s do some filtering.</p><p>You can filter by value or with logical conditions.</p><p>Filtering by value is based on a single field value and we can do a lot with it:</p>  check if it’s null - <code>isNull:</code> Boolean  check if it’s equal or not equal to a value - <code>equalTo:</code> (value), <code>notEqualTo:</code> (value)  check if it is or isn’t in a list of values: <code>in:</code> […values], <code>notIn:</code> […values]  check if it’s greater or smaller than a certain value: <code>lessThan:</code> (value), <code>lessThanOrEqualTo:</code> (value), <code>greaterThan:</code> (value), <code>greaterThanOrEqualTo:</code> (value)  <p>Logical conditions combine multiple conditions using <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, or <code>not</code>.</p> Filtering Examples: Filtering by Value <p>Let’s see all the ways we can filter our posts.</p><p>Filter by publication status</p><p>A query:</p> <code>query FilterByStatus($input: PostsFiltersInput!) {
  postsIndex(filters: $input, first: 50) {
    edges {
      node {
        body
        created
        rating
        tag
        status
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>With the input to show only posts with <code>DRAFT</code> status:</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "status": {
        "equalTo": "DRAFT"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>If you’re <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#graphql-server">using GraphiQL</a> to run your queries, you need to write the query in the query section <code>(1)</code> and the input data in the variables section below <code>(2)</code>.</p><p>You can then run the query with the filter by pressing a play button and you get the results on the right <code>(3)</code>.</p><p>As you can see, only the posts with <code>DRAFT</code> status are showing up. The filter works!</p><p>Let’s do more filtering.</p><p>Filter by rating</p><p>Show poorly-rated posts, with rating less than 7.5</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "rating": {
        "lessThan": 7.5
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by date</p><p>Posts from earlier than Jan 10, 2023.</p> <code>{
  "input": {
    "where": {
      "created": {
        "lessThan": "2023-01-10"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by edited status</p><p>Show me the posts that have been edited (their <code>edited</code> field is not null).</p> <code>{
  "input":{
    "where": {
      "edited":{
        "isNull": false
      }
    }
  }
}
</code> <p>Filter by tags</p><p>Only the posts tagged with <code>Decentralization</code>, <code>Future</code>, or both.</p> <code>{
  "input":{
    "where": {
      "tag":{
        "in": ["Decentralization", "Future"]
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  Filtering by Logical Conditions <p>Logical conditions combine multiple conditions. These could be either for a single field, or for multiple fields. The syntax is the same.</p><p>Filter by rating range</p><p>This is filtering on the same field but it needs combining two <code>where</code> filters with an <code>and</code> operator, indicating that both conditions must be true. If you know GraphQL, this syntax should be familiar.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "rating":{
                  "greaterThanOrEqualTo":2.2
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "rating":{
                  "lessThan":8.8
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code> <p>Filter by date range</p><p>Show me only the posts from January of 2023 (note the <code>greaterThanOrEqualTo</code> operator).</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"lessThan":"2023-01-31"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code> <p>An alternative way of filtering by range</p><p>The previous two examples of filtering by range used an explicit <code>and</code>: you started with <code>and</code> at the top and supplied two <code>where</code> queries.</p><p>This can also be achieved with an implicit <code>and</code>, where you supply two conditions and the <code>and</code> is implied.</p><p>The two examples above can be rewritten like this:</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "where":{
         "rating":{
            "greaterThanOrEqualTo":2.2,
            "lessThan": 8.8
        }
      }
   }
}</code>  <code>{
   "input":{
      "where":{
         "created":{
            "greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01",
            "lessThan":"2023-12-31"
        }
      }
   }
}</code> <p>In both cases, the results are the same with both an implicit and an explicit <code>and</code>.</p><p>Filter by multiple fields</p><p>I want to clean up some posts. Show me the posts with <code>DRAFT</code> or <code>ARCHIVED</code> status, created before March 1, 2023.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "status":{
                	"in": ["DRAFT", "ARCHIVED"]
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"lessThan":"2022-03-01"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
</code>  Query Ordering <p>Now that we have focused on the posts we wanted, it would be nice to be able to sort the results, too.</p><p>For that, we need to define an additional variable: <code>$sortinginput</code>, include it in the query, and then add it next to the <code>$input</code> variable.</p> <code>{
   "input":{
      "and":[
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"greaterThanOrEqualTo":"2023-01-01"
               }
            }
         },
         {
            "where":{
               "created":{
                	"lessThan":"2023-12-31"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
  },
  "sortinput":{
      "created":"DESC"
   }
}
</code> <p>Now the posts are filtered, only showing the ones from 2023, and they’re also all sorted by created date, in a descending order, with the newest ones at the top.</p> Putting it all together <p>Here's a sample query that uses multiple filtering options and a sorting option on top, to show you what's possible:</p><p>A lot is going on here:</p>  Implicit <code>and</code> for range filtering  Filtering by options in a provided list  Combining multiple filters  Sorting the output  <p>And that’s it. You’re now filtering and sorting at will! Congratulations 🎉</p> Conclusion <p>ComposeDB's query filtering and ordering features offer powerful ways to manipulate and retrieve your data.</p><p>With the steps in this tutorial, you can now efficiently filter and order your data based on specific criteria, enabling you to build more robust applications.</p><p>Dive deeper into the documentation for more advanced filtering and ordering techniques.</p><p>If you have any questions about filtering and ordering, jump into our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">community forum</a>.

<p>In January 2023, the ToIP Foundation announced the formation of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force</a> (TSPTF) within our <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Stack Working Group</a> (TSWG). <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">See the introductory blog post</a> for an overview of this task force. In short, the goal is to maximize interoperability of decentralized digital trust infrastructure by defining the core protocol at the center of the ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">hourglass model</a>. This protocol needs to meet all the Layer 2 requirements defined in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification</a>.</p>



<p>To do this, the TSPTF spent three months to go through the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">proposal stage</a>, entertaining four overall design proposals from <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/17">Sam Smith</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/19">Daniel Hardman</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/25">Wenjing Chu</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions/27">Michael Herman</a>. Then the task force entered the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">consolidation stage</a>: the hard work of finding enough common ground among these proposals to reach a rough consensus about the overall framework of the design so it can prepare the first Working Draft of the specification.</p>



<p>The good news is that we believe we have achieved that goal. Through a series of in-depth virtual workshops, additional proposals, and small group <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/trust-spanning-protocol/discussions">discussions</a>, we have arrived at seven “pillars” of the design. These seven pillars apply not just to the trust spanning protocol, but to a core family of protocols that together form the foundation for all the trust task protocols at Layer 3 of the ToIP technology stack.</p>



<p>In this blog post we will summarize these seven pillars:</p>



 
 <a>Verifiable Identifiers</a> 



 <a>End-to-End Authenticity and Confidentiality</a> 



 <a>Direct Connections (Inner and Outer Channels)</a> 



 <a>Routing Via Intermediaries (Routing Channels)</a> 



 <a>Relationship Context Channels</a> 



 <a>Text and Binary Encoding</a> 



 <a>Trust Task Protocol Framework</a> 
 



<p>This blog post does not attempt to provide the full technical details about each of these topics, rather it will attempt to summarize them using language accessible to anyone interested in decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



 #1: Verifiable Identifiers 



<p>The ToIP Foundation as a whole—and the TSWG in particular—have long compared the ToIP stack to the Internet’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP stack</a> (see <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">our introductory white paper</a> for a full explanation). In particular, we have pointed to how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP) illustrates the critical role of a spanning protocol in a protocol stack (for details, see Principle #3, The Hourglass Model, in <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a>).</p>



<p>The heart of the Internet Protocol defined a new type of address—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a>—that enabled communications between existing networks that otherwise had no automated way to pass data between them. This new addressing layer enabled the Internet Protocol to “span” existing local area networks and create the ubiquitous global Internet we enjoy today.</p>



<p>Since the goal of the ToIP stack is to enable trust to span existing trust domains, the ToIP trust spanning protocol needs the same solution: a new type of address—one designed explicitly to enable cryptographically verifiable communications. In section 6.4 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Technical-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-PR1-2022-11-14.pdf">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification</a> (TAS), we call this new type of address a verifiable identifier (VID). The three essential characteristics of a VID are:</p>



 
 It can be resolved securely to obtain the current public key(s) needed to verify that the VID owner controls the VID. 



 It can be resolved securely to obtain the current network endpoint(s) for establishing a ToIP connection with the entity identified by the VID. 



 It does not need to change when the controller’s key(s) are rotated or network endpoint(s) are updated. 
 



<p>Section 6.4 of the TAS explains that there are multiple types of VIDs, including many different types of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs—standardized by the W3C), and several types of Autonomous Identifiers (AIDs), such as those being standardized in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-did-keri">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> specifications from the ToIP <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">Authentic Chained Data Container</a> (ACDC) Task Force. Since a verifier’s trust in a VID may depend on both the type of VID and the characteristics of its supporting infrastructure (e.g., cryptographic algorithms, storage, key management, resolution, etc.), the trust spanning protocol specification must also include an appraisability framework: a standard way for a ToIP endpoint to describe the type and properties of its particular VID.</p>



<p>In addition, VIDs share the same challenge as any other new type of identifier: how do parties discover and share the VIDs they want to use for each other? How do they bootstrap setting up their first ToIP communications channel? How can they do this safely while avoiding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle</a> (MITM) attacks?&nbsp;</p>



<p>All VID-based protocols, including <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/">DIDComm</a>, <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a>, rely on some form of out–of-band introduction (OOBI), such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR code</a>, to accomplish this critical first step. Regardless of the specific OOBI used, the ultimate result is that all parties now have the VIDs needed to begin using the ToIP trust spanning protocol to connect and interact.</p>



 #2: End-to-End Authenticity &amp; Confidentiality 



<p>Almost all modern security protocols based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public/private key cryptography</a> use some combination of message signing (for authenticity) and message encryption (for confidentiality). A longstanding question has been: precisely what combination of these two properties produces the strongest security?</p>



<p>Our second pillar is a firm answer to that question: the signing and encryption pattern that provides the strongest protection against both key compromise impersonation (KCI) and sender impersonation of the ciphertext is called ESSR (for Encrypt Sender’s key then Sign Receiver’s key). ESSR was first defined <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/079">in a 2001 paper</a> by Jee Hea An and is well explained in these three Neil Madden blog posts about public key authenticated encryption: <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-i/">PKAE1</a>, <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/26/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-ii/">PKAE2</a>, <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/12/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-iii/">PKAE3</a>.</p>



<p>The bottom line: by binding the sender’s public key inside the encrypted ciphertext and binding the receiver’s public key in the enclosing signed plain text, an adversary is prevented from forging messages that compromise either authenticity or confidentiality. So the trust spanning protocol can achieve both strong authenticity and strong confidentiality by applying ESSR to all messages that require both properties.</p>



 #3: Direct Connections (Inner and Outer Channels) 



<p>With VIDs supplying verifiable public key(s) and network endpoint(s), and ESSR supplying the message signing and encryption pattern, all the essential ingredients for two ToIP endpoints are in place to establish a connection in order to communicate securely and confidentially. The only ToIP Layer 2 requirement that we have not addressed is correlation privacy: preventing public observation/correlation of the VIDs that parties are using to communicate.</p>



<p>Although the trust spanning protocol is designed to be transport-independent and could be used with any transport protocol for which a binding is defined (e.g., Bluetooth, AMQP, MQTT), if ToIP endpoints A and B have a direct connection with each other over a public TCP/IP network like the Internet, then full correlation privacy is impossible: anyone who can see the Internet traffic can track the flow of encrypted messages between A’s VID and B’s VID. Thus the only way A and B can achieve full correlation privacy is by employing intermediaries (see Pillar <a>#4</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>However A and B can still achieve partial correlation privacy over a direct connection by tunneling one ESSR protocol inside another. This is shown in Figure 1 below.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Figure 1: A direct connection showing one ToIP channel tunneled inside another for partial correlation privacy.</p>



<p>In Figure 1, the VIDs A0 and B0 are publicly-observable VIDs used to form the outer channel (shown in red). They are outside the two endpoint boxes because they are publicly observable on the Internet. The VIDs A1 and B1 are private interaction VIDs that form the inner channel (shown in orange).&nbsp; They are inside the two endpoint boxes because they are completely private to A and B. Each ToIP message between A1 and B1 is carried in the encrypted payload of ToIP messages between A0 and B0, so A1 and B1 are never exposed publicly on the Internet.</p>



<p>This two-layer, two-channel model enables A and B to communicate privately between A1 and B1 over the inner channel. As explained in Pillar <a>#5</a>, one potential use of this private channel is for A and B to negotiate replacing their current publicly-observable VIDs A0 and B0 with new publicly-observable VIDs An and Bn if/when needed. They can do this while still keeping A1 and B1 hidden. This enables some degree of correlation privacy even without the use of intermediaries.</p>



 #4: Routing Via Intermediaries (Routing Channels) 



<p>To provide stronger correlation privacy—i.e., to prevent public observation that A and B are communicating at all—it is necessary to tunnel one layer deeper using intermediaries. This triple layering is shown in Figure 2.</p>







<p>Figure 2: Adding a routing layer tunneled via intermediaries for stronger correlation privacy</p>



<p>In this configuration, both A and B first establish outer channels over direct connections with their respective intermediaries α and β (shown in red between VIDs A0 and α0 and B0 and β0 respectively). Then A and B tunnel another ESSR protocol (shown in blue) inside the outer channel to send ToIP routing messages. This routing channel gives the intermediaries α and β just enough information to pass the messages to the next hop on the path. The full path is never revealed to any single intermediary; all α and β know is the next destination.</p>



<p>The inner channel (orange) is layered within the routing channel (blue). As with direct connections, this is the fully private interaction channel between A1 and B1. Neither α or β know about A1 and B1 and cannot see any of the communications on this inner channel. To use a physics analogy, this inner channel has two layers of “insulation” that prevent the heat (private information) from leaking out into the environment (third parties observing the outer channel).</p>



<p>This routing architecture is not limited to two intermediaries; it can scale to more as needed. However adding more intermediaries is not required to enable better correlation privacy; it simply increases the number of intermediaries that would need to be compromised to learn the full path.</p>



 #5: Relationship Context Channels 



<p>The double or triple layering of ToIP channels described in Pillars <a>#3</a> and <a>#4</a> satisfies the ToIP architecture requirements for authenticity, confidentiality, and ​​correlation privacy. Whether it operates over a direct connection or via intermediaries, the inner channel instantiates a relationship root context connecting the two endpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, what if two endpoints A and B need to communicate over other inner channels representing different relationship contexts? For example, what if they need to:</p>



 
 Move to a higher level of identity assurance, e.g., for high-value transactions instead of low-value transactions? 



 Step up to perfect forward secrecy or some other cryptographic algorithm? 



 Stream data instead of sending individual messages? 



 Instantiate a multi-party channel incorporating other parties (such as using the IETF <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_Layer_Security">Message Layer Security</a> protocol)? 



 Instantiate new publicly-observable VIDs to increase correlation privacy? 



 Instantiate new private interaction VIDs to prevent privacy leakage over time? 



 Invoke specific higher-level (ToIP Layer 3) trust task protocols (see Pillar <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CULKg76dSLnO5EX3YM5kG6Ya8PWDwmPSZAbGKKqdoTU/edit#heading=h.ekx5229cmb3v">#7</a>)? 
 



<p>In these cases, A and B need to be able to use the default inner channel as a “control channel” to establish other inner channels. Each new inner channel needs: a) a new pair of VIDs to establish a new relationship context, and b) a new set of parameters specific to that relationship context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can be accomplished using a simple control channel protocol that enables A and B to establish and manage as many relationship context channels as they need over the lifetime of their relationship. This is illustrated in Figure 3 (shown over a direct connection for simplicity). The control channel is shown in orange and each new relationship context channel is shown in black.</p>







<p>Figure 3: Using the default inner channel as a control channel to establish new independent relationship context channels between A and B</p>



<p>Note that these new inner channels can emulate the same features as the concept of sessions used in other protocols. However, by using VIDs, they have the following advantages:</p>



 
 They can operate independently from any session management defined by underlying transport protocols. 



 They can persist as long as both parties need them (not just during one communications session). 



 They can establish fully “cryptographic sessions” that include all the security and privacy protections of the ToIP trust spanning layer. 
 



 #6: Text and Binary Encoding 



<p>Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_protocol">wire protocol</a> that moves data from one endpoint to another must define its encoding(s). Encoding choices are even more critical (and often contentious) with security protocols because: a) they are replete with heavyweight cryptographic data structures, and b) they impose very strict rules governing message signing, encryption, decryption, and signature verification.</p>



<p>To avoid as much contention as possible, we propose to use Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) as the encoding format for all ToIP messages. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ssmith-cesr/">CESR specification</a> is one of the deliverables of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ToIP ACDC Task Force</a>. To quote from the introduction:</p>



<p>The Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) is a dual text-binary encoding format that has the unique property of text-binary concatenation composability.&nbsp; This composability property enables the round trip conversion en-masse of concatenated primitives between the text domain and binary domain while maintaining the separability of individual primitives.&nbsp; This enables convenient usability in the text domain and compact transmission in the binary domain.</p>



<p>Other key benefits of CESR include:</p>



 
 Format-agnostic. CESR streams support interleaved JSON, CBOR, and MGPK serializations. 



 Optimized for cryptography. Popular cryptographic material suites have compact encodings for efficiency while less compact encodings provide sufficient extensibility to support all foreseeable types. 



 Self-framing. CESR supports self-framing group codes that enable stream processing and pipelining in both the text and binary domains. 
 



<p>For a complete overview of the benefits of CESR, see the IIW presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12nX_IIPp5xw8qAxhZy-ae2aWYytYQmFBbB9K3PcVhqQ/edit?usp=sharing">CESR for First Year Wizards</a>.</p>



<p>Note: CESR V1.1 will include a few minor pipelining improvements based on production experience with CESR V1.0.</p>



 #7: Trust Task Protocol Framework 



<p>The final pillar is the capability for architects and developers to design, define, and build higher-level ToIP Layer 3 trust task protocols that operate over the Layer 2 relationship context channels described in Pillar <a>#5</a>. This trust task protocol framework should be modeled using the same protocol definition patterns established by other VID-based protocols such as <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/">DIDComm</a>, <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a>. These definitions typically follow a two level model:</p>



 
 Protocol definitions specify the protocol ID (or VID), human-readable name, version, and other identifying metadata for the protocol. They also define its overall relationship context channel parameters and a catalog of its specified packets/messages. 



 Packet/message definitions specify the required and optional contents of each packet or message defined in the protocol. 
 



<p>A complete trust task protocol specification based on this framework will also include roles, states, request/response business logic, co-protocols, error messages, etc.. See <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#protocols">section 9 of the DIDComm V2 specification</a> for a detailed example.</p>



<p>The ToIP trust task protocol framework should also define a small set of standard utility trust tasks such as:</p>



 
 Discovery. Rather than broadly defining how two parties try to discover each other’s VIDs, this trust task will narrowly define how two ToIP endpoints that have established a connection can discover what trust tasks each other is capable of supporting (see examples below). 



 Error handling. The rich extensibility of trust tasks—and the fact they may be combined into complex workflows—make it very useful to have a well-known trust task for handling error messages. 



 Trust ping. This simple, universal trust task for testing a ToIP connection is the ToIP equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)">ping network utility</a> for testing an IP connection. 



 Logging/auditing. This is a standard trust task for logging ToIP interactions for debugging or auditing purposes. 
 



<p>The whole reason for the hourglass design of the ToIP technology stack is for the Layer 2 trust spanning protocol to support any number of trust task protocols at Layer 3. With authenticity, confidentiality, and correlation privacy all handled by the trust spanning layer, it becomes far easier for infrastructure architects and developers to design reusable trust tasks. This is turn makes it much easier for application designers and developers to build trusted applications by calling a series of trust tasks to accomplish their workflows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current market emphasis on digital identity wallets (such as the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU eIDAS 2.0 initiative</a>) can give the impression that the only important trust tasks are the issuance, presentation, and revocation of verifiable digital credentials. These are in fact only a small subset of the universe of trust tasks that can be enabled by the ToIP stack. Some other common examples discussed by the TSPTF include:</p>



 
 Stepping up authentication by using a ToIP connection to request local biometric authentication and/or liveness detection of a user. 



 Signing digital documents with strong, permanently verifiable digital signatures that do not require centralized service providers (a required feature of eIDAS 2.0). 



 Querying a trust registry to determine the authorized participants in a digital trust ecosystem (a trust task protocol under development by the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">ToIP Trust Registry Task Force</a>). 



 Exchanging electronic business cards for peer-to-peer communications and relationship management. 



 Secure messaging using synchronous chat or asynchronous mail. 



 Transmitting digital payments via any mutually-agreed means: credit card, debit card, direct-to-bank, fiat currency, cryptocurrency, loyalty points, etc. 



 Issuing e-receipts for any type of digital payment or value exchange. 



 Buying a digital ticket for an event and presenting it for admission. 



 Bidding in a digital auction, including reconciling and settlement of a winning bid. 



 Issuing a digital purchase order, sending an invoice, and remitting payment. 



 Orchestrating data supply chains using “product passports” that can be the digital twin of physical or digital products. 
 



 Next Steps 



<p>The TSPTF is now moving into the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27724781">Working Drafts stage</a>. After a break during the month of August, we are beginning two weekly meetings again every Wednesday (8AM PT for NA/EU time zones and 6PM PT for APAC time zones) starting on&nbsp;06 September&nbsp;(the full schedule of all ToIP meetings is published on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings">ToIP Calendar</a>).&nbsp;Our goal will be to work through enough open issues to be ready to present a complete “IIW Preview Draft”&nbsp;at the next Internet Identity Workshop, 10-12 October in Mountain View, California.

 OT-RFC-18 — Growing the Trusted Knowledge Foundation: TRAC delegation &amp; OTP incentives <p>“Q. How do you propose to do&nbsp;this?</p><p>A. By saving the knowledge of the race. The sum of human knowing is beyond any one man; any thousand men. With the destruction of our social fabric, science will be broken into a million pieces. Individuals will know much of the exceedingly tiny facets of which there is to know. They will be helpless and useless by themselves. The bits of lore, meaningless, will not be passed on. They will be lost through the generations. But, if we now prepare a giant summary of all knowledge, it will never be lost. Coming generations will build on it, and will not have to rediscover it for themselves. One millennium will do the work of thirty thousand.”</p><p>Hari Seldon</p><p>Foundation series by Isaac Asimov&nbsp;(1951)</p> Introduction <p>OriginTrail ecosystem’s vision is to build a trusted knowledge foundation that greatly improves the way humanity’s knowledge is produced, maintained and shared in a trusted and inclusive manner. The purpose of the OriginTrail Parachain is to provide a tailored blockchain for Trusted Artificial Intelligence that extends the capabilities of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) with growth incentives for <a href="https://origintrail.io">real-world adoption</a>.</p><p>The requirements have already been met for the OriginTrail Parachain utility token (OTP) to be transferable via both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEXs and DEXs) by having the decentralized governance in place. Now this DKG-focused L1 blockchain supporting real-world adoption, is set to drive growth of both valuable Knowledge Asset assemblies and DKG multichain infrastructure — crucial components of the Trusted Knowledge Foundation. It achieves that by incentivizing Knowledge generation and trusted knowledge infrastructure operation with OTP tokens, in unison with the multichain DKG adoption (detailed in OT-RFC-17).</p><p>The OT-RFC-18 proposes the first batch of incentivization features, which also leverage already implemented OriginTrail Parachain community voting.</p> OTP incentives for Trusted Knowledge Foundation Growth <p>Using OTP to create incentives for Trusted Knowledge Foundation Growth is one of its core utilities. The pool of OTP designated for that was 14% (or 70 million OTP) of the Genesis supply and also receives 30% of the annual inflation (you can learn more about the tokenomics and exact numbers&nbsp;<a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/OriginTrail_Ecosystem_White_Paper_2.0.pdf">here</a>).</p><p>When considering the best first activities to be included for the OTP incentives, the key requirements include the relevance of the activity, measurable nature of the activity and inclusiveness for all OriginTrail participants. All OTP incentives should also take full advantage of OriginTrail Parachain Governance — from proposal stage for an activity, to ongoing decisions on the scope of incentivisation support or even proposals to discontinue/substitute the incentives with more appropriate ones.</p><p>The OT-RFC-18 takes the above guidelines in action to propose 2 categories of activities as candidates for incentivization — (1) Incentivizing trusted knowledge creation and (2) Incentivizing trusted infrastructure.</p> Incentivizing trusted knowledge creation <p>Incentivizing the creation of trusted knowledge is central to the growth of the OriginTrail Trusted Knowledge Foundation. By offering OTP incentives for Knowledge Asset creation the “north star” growth activity is supported. The intention of incentives is also to serve as a curation mechanism for guiding publishing of high quality knowledge on the DKG. Curation is to be implemented through community-wide decisions using OriginTrail Parachain Governance. These activities will provide a significant boost towards creating truthful, structured, and AI-ready Knowledge Assets — ultimately leading to the creation of the largest trusted knowledge foundation in the world. The specific incentive mechanisms to achieve this will be continuously improved through OriginTrail Parachain Governance proposals.</p> Incentivizing trusted infrastructure: TRAC delegation &amp; Multichain adoption <p>The OriginTrail trusted infrastructure is a two layer system with two&nbsp;tokens:</p>  the DKG layer hosted on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) fueled by the TRAC utility&nbsp;token,  and multi-chain consensus layer, with respective native blockchain tokens in use (which includes the OriginTrail Parachain and OTP&nbsp;token).  <p>Each of the layers performs a distinct function, yet are necessary building blocks for the implementation of the DKG (more info available in the OriginTrail whitepaper 2.0).</p><p>An increasingly important element of the trusted knowledge infrastructure is the TRAC stake for DKG nodes. The stake presents a collateral TRAC amount that is locked-up as a signal for the security and quality of node operations. The amount of TRAC stake also significantly contributes to the share of the network rewards (paid as network fees by Knowledge Asset publishers) that a DKG node can&nbsp;receive.</p><p>With the OT-RFC-18, the TRAC delegation feature is introduced, and DKG node operators will now be able to open their node stake for other TRAC holders to participate. With a higher amount of TRAC as their stake, nodes are eligible for more network rewards which are then shared with those that delegated their TRAC (implementation details below). This instrument will lead to more TRAC being used for its utility, larger TRAC holder community engagement, more robust and secure trusted knowledge infrastructure and a vibrant “marketplace” of DKG nodes and TRAC delegators.</p><p>To incentivize all of the above-mentioned positive effects of TRAC delegations, the OT-RFC-18 proposes this feature to be eligible for OTP incentives as well. The core premise of the OTP incentives would be to allow any TRAC delegator on blockchains where DKG V6 is implemented to be eligible for OTP rewards according to the size of their delegated stake.</p><p>Moreover, as more blockchain ecosystems <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-17-origintrail-integration-with-evm-compatible-blockchains-e635dc8afb86">express interest</a> to integrate with the DKG (following<a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-17-OriginTrail-integration-with-EVM-compatible-blockchains"> the procedure and criteria detailed in the OT-RFC-17</a>), one time incentives in OTP are proposed, to both reward TRAC token holders who support integrations by contributing to the minimum required threshold. More details on this to be discussed in a separate proposal on incentivising MultiChain DKG adoption before voting on it via OriginTrial Parachain governance mechanism.</p> TRAC delegation mechanics <p>The implementation of the TRAC token delegation mechanism is loosely based on DeFi projects such as Uniswap, with the core component representing Node share tokens, (similar to Uniswap LP tokens). Each node deployed on ODN has a respective, node-specific, mintable and burnable 18 decimal ERC20 token created for it on the desired blockchain during node deployment, with the token symbol and name set by the node operator, as can be seen in the figure&nbsp;below.</p>Figure 1: Node share tokens on OriginTrail Parachain, visible through Subscan block&nbsp;explorer<p>The “share tokens” represent essentially a share of the total amount of TRAC stake that has been deployed on a specific node. The TRAC delegation feature, when fully activated, will enable node operators to “open up” their node to receiving more TRAC stake through delegation by TRAC token holders. The delegation mechanism is explained in the following figures:</p><p>Formula for share tokens&nbsp;minting:</p><p>Where tracAmount is the amount of TRAC delegated to the&nbsp;node.</p><p>Formula for share tokens&nbsp;burning:</p><p>Where tracAmount is the amount of TRAC withdrawn from the node&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Nodes with larger amounts of TRAC staked have effectively stronger economic security signals (see <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/OriginTrail_Ecosystem_White_Paper_2.0.pdf">the whitepaper</a>), and therefore an advantage in receiving Knowledge Asset publishing fees from Knowledge Publishers (also in TRAC). Therefore, node operators have an interest in attracting a large amount of TRAC stake to establish a better position in the DKG service&nbsp;market.</p><p>TRAC token holders’ interest is in putting their TRAC tokens to work, which is achieved by node operators effectively sharing a portion of the TRAC fees received through Knowledge Asset publishing with the delegators.</p><p>Effectively, node runners are delegators to their own nodes at the moment of writing this RFC (currently only node admin keys can delegate, until the fully fledged system is implemented), and get 100% of the TRAC rewards from publishings their nodes&nbsp;receive.</p><p>When the delegation feature goes live, each node operator will be free to set their node settings, which are the following:</p>  operator_fee: percentage of the TRAC fee, which is deducted from each knowledge asset publishing fee, and is directed to the node operator prior to sharing with other delegators. The remaining TRAC fee is then split in proportion to the amount of share tokens among all delegators,  maximum_delegated_trac: the maximum amount of stake a node operator allows to be present on their&nbsp;node.  <p>It is important to note that the system is non-custodial, meaning that all delegated TRAC is locked in DKG core contracts, and can only be “withdrawn” from the system by burning share tokens by the delegators, which can only be performed by the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-evm-module/blob/main/contracts/Staking.sol">DKG Staking contract</a>.</p><p>With such a system in effect, TRAC token holders can safely delegate their tokens to node runners. Having Node Share tokens be ERC20 tokens, they can also be easily transferred between wallets (e.g. a delegator can change wallets for OpSec purposes by transferring share tokens to a different address) and utilized with any ERC20 supporting tool.</p><p>Finally, the proposal indicates delegating TRAC in two&nbsp;ways:</p>  “Delegate” function: by using this function, share tokens are available to the delegator, enabling withdrawing TRAC at all times. This function should not involveOTP incentives,  “Delegate &amp; Lock” function: share tokens are locked in DKG contracts for a period of time, which qualifies the delegator for OTP Incentives, as they promote long-term security in the&nbsp;network.   TRAC Delegation: Implementation action&nbsp;points <p>After the RFC process and open discussion on TRAC delegation feature is completed, the core development team will proceed with detailed specification and updates on the implementation. Community proposals through comments on this RFC are very&nbsp;welcome.</p><p>The relevant updates are expected to include an updated version of smart contracts, with the aim to encapsulate other optimizations to the system (system formulas, neighborhood distance function updates, etc). All information will be available in the relevant Github repositories.</p> Conclusion <p><a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-18-Growing-the-Trusted-Knowledge-Foundation/README.md">This RFC</a> introduces the implementation direction for OTP incentives and initial high-impact activities for the growth of the Trusted Knowledge Foundation.

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the third article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">How realistic are AI-generated faces?</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>As I discussed in <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">my previous post</a>, generative adversarial networks (GANs) can produce remarkably realistic images of people that are nearly indistinguishable from images of real people. Here I will describe a technique for detecting GAN-generated faces, such as those typically found in online profiles</p><p>Below you will see the average of 400 StyleGAN2 faces (left) and 400 real profile photos from people with whom I am connected on LinkedIn (right).&nbsp;</p><p>Because the real photos are so varied, the average profile photo is fairly nondescript. By contrast, the average GAN face is highly distinct with almost perfectly focused eyes. This is because the real faces used by the GAN discriminator are all aligned in the same way, resulting in all the AI-generated faces having the same alignment. It seems that this alignment was intentional as a way to improve generation of more consistently realistic faces.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to having the same facial alignment, the StyleGAN faces also appear from the neck up. By contrast, real profile photos tend to show more of the upper body and shoulders. It is these within-class similarities and across-class differences that we seek to exploit in our technique for detecting GAN-generated faces.</p>

  <p>Starting with 10,000 faces generated by each of the three versions of StyleGAN (1, 2, 3), we learn a low-dimensional representation of GAN-generated faces. This learning takes two forms: the classic, linear, principal components analysis (PCA) and a more modern auto-encoder.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of the underlying computational technique, this approach learns a constructive model that captures the particular properties of StyleGAN-generated faces. In the case of PCA, this model is a simple weighted sum of a small number of images learned from the training images.</p><p>Once the model is constructed, we can ask if any image can be accurately reconstructed with this model. The intuition here is that if the model captures properties that are specific to GAN faces, then GAN faces will be accurately reconstructed with the model but real photos (that do not share these properties) will not.</p><p>Below you will see the average reconstruction error for 400 GAN faces (left) and 400 real faces (right). They are displayed on the same intensity scale where, the brighter the pixel value, the larger the reconstruction error. Here you will see that the real faces have significantly higher reconstruction errors throughout, particularly around the eyes.<br></p>

  <p>By simply computing this reconstruction error, we can build a fairly reliable classifier to determine whether a face was likely to have been generated by StyleGAN. We can make this classifier even more reliable by analyzing the eiGAN-face model weights needed for the full reconstruction.&nbsp;</p><p>Using this approach, we can detect more than 99% of GAN-generated faces, while only misclassifying 1% of photographic faces — those that happen to match the position and alignment of GAN faces.</p><p>Any forensic technique is, of course, vulnerable to attack. In this case, an adversary could crop, translate, and/or rotate a GAN-generated face in an attempt to circumvent our detection. We can, however, build this attack into our training by constructing our model not just on GAN faces, but also on GAN faces that have been subjected to random manipulations. (See the article in the Further Reading section below for more details on this attack and defense.)</p><p>No defense will ever be perfect, so the forensic identification cannot rely on just one technique. It must instead rely on a suite of techniques that examine different aspects of an image. Even if an adversary does not find a way to circumvent this particular detection, newer diffusion-based, text-to-image synthesis techniques (e.g., Dall-E, Midjourney, and Adobe Firefly) do not exhibit the same facial alignment as GAN-generated faces. As a result, they will fail to be detected by this specific technique. In my next post, I will describe a complementary forensic analysis that is more effective at detecting faces generated using diffusion-based techniques.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] S.

 Introducing Elacity’s Video District: A Vision of Innovation 
<p>Elacity is not just about NFTs; it’s about pushing the boundaries of decentralized content sharing. The forthcoming Video District is a testament to this commitment. After a year of dedicated work, Elacity is set to launch a DRM-powered video-sharing platform. This platform operates on the <a href="https://medium.com/@elacity2822/the-access-economy-decentralized-identity-digital-rights-and-ownership-in-the-age-of-web3-23f7b1bbb4ce">Access Economy Protocol (AEP)</a>, a revolutionary fusion of EVM smart contracts and DRM that leverages the Elastos SmartWeb.</p>
<p>Creators using the Video District can generate access tokens and encrypt video content with remarkable ease. This is powered by Elacity’s unique system, enabling the allocation of revenue from token trading to multiple decentralized wallets. By integrating Web3’s decentralized identities, the Video District ensures secure registry, encryption, trade, and access of intellectual property, all while preserving creator control.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Elacity is developing an Elastos <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/runtime-the-missing-piece-of-web3/">Runtime</a> media player utilizing WebAssembly. This innovative solution secures assets within an execution environment, allowing token holders to host and decrypt video license keys securely for playback. This groundbreaking approach enhances asset protection and reinforces trust in decentralized business operations.</p>
<p>The first iteration of the Video District, v1, is set for release on the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/sidechains/esc/">Elastos Smart Contract Chain </a>in Q4 2023. Alongside this launch, Elacity will also introduce a comprehensive whitepaper, outlining its vision for the future of user-owned access marketplaces that encompass diverse digital assets.</p>
 Elacity: Elevating NFT Innovation and Ownership 
<p>In summary, Elacity’s Version 1.8 and the forthcoming Video District underline the platform’s unwavering commitment to innovation, user-centric experiences, and pioneering advancements in the NFT and content sharing space. Stay tuned for more updates and get ready to embark on a new era of creative exploration and ownership.</p>

 Part 2: Participating in Greenpeace’s Critical Incident&nbsp;Network <p>After a number of years, we’ve been given the go-ahead to write openly about a project we’ve been working on with Greenpeace International. This is part 2, get caught up with <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/navigating-greenpeaces-critical-incident-network-5d9fe79ea824">Part 1: Navigating Greenpeace’s Critical Incident Network</a>&nbsp;(CIN).</p> Build your&nbsp;pathways <p>Creating a whole educational programme is much more complex than simply putting together a training session. Imagine it as a detailed network of learning, where topics are carefully connected, each one building on what’s been learned before, aiming for a level of expertise. This process combines learning goals, ways of testing understanding, teaching methods, carefully chosen resources, and&nbsp;more.</p>The Network Pathway cc-by WAO &amp;&nbsp;GPI<p>Your best bet, figure out the big picture. GPI has the goal of increasing Greenpeace’s organisational and communication responsiveness by building confidence, team cohesion and staff capacity in how to identify and deal with critical incidents communication (particularly as a part of a Critical Incident response&nbsp;team).</p> Dive into your&nbsp;pathways <p>The network pathway provides us with a lens through which we can create individual training offerings. We aim to help people up their involvement with the CIN through a structured offering:</p>Steps 1 and 2 of the learning pathway CC-BY WAO &amp;&nbsp;GPI<p>Step 1 — Observing: First, you want to introduce people to the big idea. We have an introductory session that introduces the CIN and can help people understand what to expect from the network as a whole, and then the first training initiative, the CIN Advanced Comms training. An introductory session gives potential participants a taste and helps them to make an informed decision. If a person is interested in becoming a participant, their application is assessed by others in the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Step 2 — Participating: Once people are excited about your programme, it’s time to get them into a training session. The first of these, the CIN Advanced Comms Training, takes place online over the course of a month. Part 3 of this series is on its specific design, as it interestingly mixes scenario-based experiential learning with self study and group-based reflection. It’s beautiful and complex (so it deserves its own post&nbsp;;) This training is designed around 5 learning objectives:</p>  Shared understanding — building a shared vocabulary and mental model for critical incidents so that people can apply the appropriate tactics and techniques for crisis communications  Decision-making — identifying relevant information, making a judgement, and choosing a path&nbsp;forward  Collaboration under pressure — supporting other individuals and the team to respond effectively in difficult and stressful situations  Stress resilience — developing self-awareness to understand capacity and desire for dealing with difficult and stressful situations  Conflict reframing — articulating risks to identify communication opportunities  Steps 3 and 4 of the learning pathway cc-by WAO &amp;&nbsp;GPI<p>Step 3 — Contributing: A community learning and development programme should inspire people to contribute to its success. The CIN Advanced Comms training doesn’t work without trainers and experts coordinating scenarios and their teams. Therefore, we offer a Train the Trainer (TtT) programme to help level up those in positions of responsibility. The CIN TtT training takes place online over a period of two sessions. These sessions are held on two consecutive days and the training includes some multimedia self study and reflection exercises. The learning objectives for the TtT&nbsp;are:</p>  Self-reflection — developing a reflective mindset, promoting inclusive relationships  Learning theory — applying pedagogically-sound learning models including scenario and experiential learning approaches  Illustrating Leadership — showing ways in which leadership can take many and varied&nbsp;forms  Logistics — recognising and explaining the structure of the Advanced Comms training and orienting learners within the&nbsp;training  Coaching — supporting participants and giving developmental feedback  <p>Also part of the Contributing progression step is the as of yet undeveloped Deep Dive. We intend to create another training that provides a more in-depth view into various topics. This offering is&nbsp;TBD.</p><p>Step 4 — Leading: Once people are contributing, you want to distribute leadership to help the programme be inclusive and diverse. The CIN programme offers a special session for people who want to be Lead Trainers in the Advanced Comms training team. It is designed to help guide them, and provide an overview to the Trainer Committee, the facilitator or group of facilitators coordinating the training.</p>Step 5 of the learning pathway cc-by WAO &amp;&nbsp;GPI<p>Step 5 — Owning: Last, but not least, you should help people take over responsibility. At the moment we have a lot of community building to do before we can reliably make ourselves redundant. However it is the express wish of the CIN Programme team (WAO and our GPI colleagues) to find ways to empower&nbsp;others.</p> Zoom back out with a canonical link <p>People need to broadly understand your educational programme so that they can decide if it is something they want to participate in. Our intricate pathways and scaffolded learning objectives are a lot to digest all at once, so we recommend zooming back out to help potential participants understand the programme offerings. A canonical link is a place where you can explain training sessions, link out to more detailed information and easily promote your programme.</p>Part of the CIN Programme overview page in Greenpeace’s intranet&nbsp;system Visualising your&nbsp;work <p>When you are collaborating with a team to create a multifaceted learning programme, it’s helpful to help people imagine the offerings of that programme in several ways. Visualising your pathways, as well as describing them in documents, helps get your learning design team on the same&nbsp;page.</p><p>Openly sharing these kinds of plans helps others provide input, and it helps people understand how the entire learning process is structured. These sorts of maps can provide inspiration for others, and they can help you find flaws in your learning&nbsp;logic.</p> There’s more to&nbsp;come <p>In Part 3, we will write more specifically about the innovative Advanced Comms training we’ve helped run a number of times. We have loads to say about this project and are looking forward to being more open about it now that it’s no longer in its&nbsp;infancy.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/exploring-community-learning-pathways-88a9758928c2">Exploring community learning pathways</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

             <p>During the year of the coronavirus, bol.com experienced an impressive 54 percent growth in revenue. Even now, as the virus appears to be under control, bol.com continues to grow. "The coronavirus has certainly accelerated our growth. And we continue to make plans for further expansion. Why? Because we see that our proposition aligns very well with the needs of consumers," says Vincent Weijers.</p>
 
     

     
   

         
                                                                                                                                                                                              
   

    
   
    
                         
            
                   
            
 
              
  
  
 
                
     

 
 
     

           
           
            
 
              
  
  
 
                
     

 
 
     

           
                     
    
                                                                                                                                                                                              
   

    
   
    
                         
           
  
    
       
      
 
              How did you manage to cope with a sudden growth? 

<p>We quickly ensured additional capacity by redesigning existing warehouses and leasing new ones. I am proud of my team who achieved this. Our top priority is always to be one hundred percent reliable. If necessary, we adjust the delivery promise to a later time. We prefer to do this rather than taking all orders we can and struggle with fulfilling them later. This approach allows us to keep control over our supply chain. Our customers appreciate this, as they keep coming back to us. They know that their package will arrive at the promised time.</p>

              How important is data in the process? 

<p>Extremely important because transparency is necessary for manageability, and data is essential for transparency. We need to know what product items we are dealing with. What are the requirements that these product items must meet? What kind of treatment do they need? It all begins with a correct barcode: the EAN code, which is officially known as the GS1 GTIN, the Global Trade Item Number. I've been involved with GS1 Netherlands, which was then called EAN Netherlands, since 1993. As an information analyst, I had the opportunity to contribute to the rules for the use of EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). I was immensely proud. From 2012 to 2015, I served on the board of GS1 Netherlands, and I was even chairman for a while. Currently, I am a member of the Global GS1 Management Board. So, from a young age, I have understood the importance of data and standards. Take GS1's slogan, for instance: 'The global language of business.' That is true. Standardisation enables easier communication with many more people. This is also crucial for bol.com. We sell 35 million items across diverse product categories through our platform, and unfortunately, we see that standardisation has not been equally implemented in every product category.</p>

 Is there a task for GS1 in this regard? 

<p>Certainly, I advocate for more standardisation and more information. In the food sector, GS1 has already launched a data pool to share product data across the supply chain, and we have linked it to a data quality programme. I would like to see similar initiatives in more sectors. With standardised data readily available, we can place more trust in the quality of that data. Currently, this is not always the case. Data quality is particularly crucial in the online realm. The only interaction an online consumer has with a product is based on the information available online. Their purchasing decisions depend on this information being accurate. If the information is incorrect, the product may be returned. In such cases, the customer is dissatisfied, we are dissatisfied, and it has negative implications for the environment.</p>

              As many as 52,000 entrepreneurs sell their products through bol.com's platform. Why is it so important for these products to have an identification number? 

<p>Having an identification number, a GTIN, for each product allows us to uniquely identify the product throughout the entire supply chain. With the GTIN, we no longer rely on vague product descriptions and can be certain that we are all referring to the same product. During my early days at Unilever, we would receive faxes from customers requesting twelve units of Dove. However, we couldn't determine if they meant twelve bottles, one box of twelve bottles, or twelve boxes, or or two shrink wraps each containing six bottles. No matter how well we describe the products, the GTIN ensures absolute clarity.</p>

 What are the consequences if selling partners do not use the GS1 GTIN? 

<p>A lot can go wrong. If partners reuse the GTIN from other products, we cannot identify the product correctly, leading to potential mix-ups and confusion. Of course, the risks vary depending on the nature of the products. For instance, if food products are mixed up, it could even result in harm to consumers' health. Therefore, it is also in the best interest of our customers that every partner ensures their products are properly identified. That doesn't seem unreasonable, does it?</p>

 Among the selling partner, there are both large companies and small ones, and they all need guidance. 

<p>That's exactly what we are striving to achieve. When sellers deal with existing products, they usually don't need to purchase the GTIN from GS1, but we do expect them to use the existing GTIN numbers assigned by manufacturers. However, when sellers sell their own unique products, we encourage them to obtain their GTIN from GS1. We are working to make it easier for smaller sellers by offering smaller subscription plans and code bundles, reducing the barriers to compliance. For instance, does a small family-owned business have to pay for a corporate membership? Why can't that business just purchase a single code?</p>

              We hear that selling partners who don’t have correct GTIN may be removed from the platform. Does that happen frequently? 

<p>Fortunately, not. The majority of sellers do things properly and they are rewarded. They receive better reviews, sell more, and have fewer returns. In certain categories like food, we are extremely strict due to health risks. Thankfully, most of them are aware of this. And we always initiate a conversation first. Actual removals are rare.</p>

 Do partners with lower data quality actually perform worse? 

<p>We have an algorithm that ranks customers based on attractiveness. Several factors come into play, such as the price and quality of the products, but also the number of issues. If a seller generates more returns than other sellers with the same product, that raises concerns. However, I'd rather look at it the other way around. If you do things right, you are rewarded with more transactions and more satisfied customers.</p>

              In media, we hear a lot of stories about returns being discarded. 

<p>That is not the case with us. We only discard items that cannot be repaired. We don't mind investing considerable effort in handling returns. It's partly an economic consideration: the amount of labour should be justified by the value added to the product. In the past, we had to open each box to see what was inside. Improved coding and identification of returns now enable us to send them directly to the right specialists without opening them, allowing us more time to enhance the products. This demonstrates that a strong foundation of codes and data drives innovation. When you are confident that your foundation is solid and your data is reliable, you can develop logic to streamline your processes. This logic also helps us provide better recommendations to our customers.</p>

 Bol.com aims to enable CO2-neutral shopping. How do you plan to achieve this? 

<p>We have reduced carbon emission per package by 34% since 2018 and have recently become a certified B-corp. We aim to achieve carbon-neutral shopping at bol.com and we're working on several fronts to make that a reality. It involves our energy supply, packaging, delivery, and an improved return process to minimise waste. At all our facilities in the Netherlands and Belgium, we use 100% wind and solar energy, partly generated on- or near site. To reduce packaging waste, we have fifteen advanced packing machines and a manual packing system that allows us to customise packaging, minimising the use of excess materials.<br>
In collaboration with carriers like PostNL, we are focused on making our delivery process more sustainable. Already 24% of our "last mile" deliveries are done by bike or on foot. We are working towards achieving zero grams of CO2 emissions per package through further measures such as using smaller, reusable, and biodegradable packages and more efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles.<br>
Furthermore, we are actively pursuing the sustainability of our product assortment. Currently, we offer a sustainable alternative in half of all product categories, and our goal is to expand this to cover all product categories by the following year. We have already removed products like single-use plastics from our assortment. Again, having accurate and comprehensive product data is crucial in this effort. We continue to encourage GS1 to centralise more neutral product data across a wider range of product categories, including sustainability certifications.</p>

              The peak season is just around the corner. How did you prepare for it? 

<p>The preparation actually started right after the previous peak. It begins with expanding our capacity. To be able to sell a lot in November and December, we started acquiring inventory in September and October. Especially during these months, it's crucial that we can rely on correct identification of products with the GTIN. Otherwise, our operation would fall apart. After all, we're dealing with large quantities, possibly over a million items on certain days. And particularly in December, nothing is more frustrating than a package arriving late.</p>

This combination of technologies gives users full ownership of their credentials on-chain.</p><p>KaratDAO chose to build on Ceramic after looking at other options because it was the most developer-friendly tech for DIDs, offering the most extensions and toolkits for developers. It also made IPFS usable and had a strong community of other projects in its ecosystem.</p> Why KaratDAO Chose Ceramic   Ceramic is the most friendly platform for DID projects. DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are a new way of identifying people and things on the internet. Ceramic is the most mature platform for storing and managing DIDs.  Ceramic has the most extensions and toolkits for DIDs. Ceramic has a wide range of extensions and toolkits that make it easy to integrate with other projects.  Ceramic makes IPFS more usable. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized file storage system. Ceramic makes it easier to use IPFS by providing a layer of abstraction on top of it.  Ceramic has a strong community of other projects. This means that there is a lot of support and development available for Ceramic.  Ceramic is a long-term project with positive momentum and staying power. Ceramic has been around for several years and has a track record of positive development. This gives the KaratDAO team confidence that Ceramic will be around for the long term.   How KaratDAO Uses Ceramic <p>KaratDAO uses Ceramic to store three types of data:</p>  VCs: VCs are a way of storing verified credentials, such as a person's name, email address, or phone number. KaratDAO uses VCs to store user information in a secure and private way.  Schemas: Schemas define the structure of VCs. KaratDAO uses schemas to ensure that VCs are consistent and easy to use.  Lit protocol conditions: Lit protocol conditions are a way of defining rules for how VCs can be used. KaratDAO uses Lit protocol conditions to ensure that VCs are only used in a way that is consistent with their privacy policy.  <p>Each piece of user data is stored as a separate stream in Ceramic. For example, a user's Twitter handle would be <a href="https://cerscan.com/mainnet/profile/did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1eEad001168B559b7a76875e7D7C2d5EaC6d854a?ref=blog.ceramic.network">stored in a separate stream</a>, and their Discord handle would be stored in a separate stream. This makes it easy to manage and access user data.</p><p>They use the Karat contract to write a <a href="https://www.okx.com/web3/marketplace/nft/collection/zksync-era/karat-vc-registry-a0d713?ref=blog.ceramic.network">pointer to the user data on-chain</a>. This allows KaratDAO to verify the authenticity of the user data and to make it more accessible to other applications.</p><p>In the future, KaratDAO plans to use a smart contract wallet to improve the user experience of storing data on Ceramic. This will allow users to store their data on Ceramic without having to sign a contract.</p><p>KaratDAO offers a number of features and benefits that make it a powerful tool for data privacy and ownership. These features include:</p>  Decentralized control: KaratDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which means that it is owned and controlled by its users.  Rewards for data sharing: KaratDAO rewards users for sharing their data with projects. This helps to incentivize users to share their data responsibly and benefits the projects that can access the consumer data. There are roughly 100 projects using Karat dApps for their own websites, allowing them to host campaigns when users sign up that they can record on their data dashboards for airdrops and other giveaways.  <p>The team is also working on a number of new features and integrations, including:</p>  A marketing platform that will help projects to better understand and engage with their users.  A governance system that will give users control over the future of KaratDAO.  Integrating account abstraction (EIP4337) into Karat Network, enhancing user experience.  The incorporation of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to further protect user’s privacy and bolster data ownership.   The Future of KaratDAO <p>KaratDAO is still under development, but the team plans to continue to grow the KaratDAO user base and become the leading data privacy and ownership platform in Web3. The team also plans to decentralize KaratDAO further, and to give users more control over the platform.</p><p>To learn more please visit the <a href="https://karatdao.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">KaratDAO website</a> or join the KaratDAO community on Discord.</p>

<p>OSLC Open Project has now completed eight OASIS Standards</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its two newest OASIS Standards, approved by the members on 23 July 2023:</p>



<p>OSLC Configuration Management Version 1.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>23 July 2023</p>



<p>OSLC Configuration Management defines an RDF vocabulary and a set of REST APIs for managing versions and configurations of linked data resources from multiple domains.</p>



<p>OSLC Tracked Resource Set Version 3.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>23 July 2023</p>



<p>The Tracked Resource Set protocol allows a server to expose a set of resources in a way that allows clients to discover that set of resources, to track additions to and removals from the set, and to track state changes to the resources in the set. The protocol does not assume that clients will dereference the resources, but they could do so. The protocol is suitable for dealing with sets containing a large number of resources, as well as highly active resource sets that undergo continual change. The protocol is HTTP-based and follows RESTful principles.</p>



<p>These two specifications are part of a broader set of OSLC specifications that are part of the OSLC-OP project. In particular, OSLC-Core (<a href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/core/v3.0/oslc-core.html">https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/core/v3.0/oslc-core.html</a>) provides the core services upon which the Configuration Management and Tracked Resource Set specifications are built.</p>



<p>About the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project:<br>Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle is very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across a product’s entire application and product lifecycle.</p>



<p>Configuration Management received three Statements of Use – from MID, SodiusWillert, and IBM.<br>Tracked Resource Set received three Statements of Use – from IBM, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and SodiusWillert.</p>

<p>When the U.S. Department of the Interior recently conducted an internal investigation into password security,&nbsp;the findings&nbsp;described a situation ripe for exploitation by enterprising cybercriminals. In his Washington Post column, Greenblatt illustrates how his department needs to move away from passwords. We can bolster security with passwordless authentication in the form of passkeys. It’s impossible to access a passkey-protected account without physical access to the end-user device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Who Controls Your Gaming Destiny? As we build towards a new concept of a decentralized web, we need to come together to agree on what a self-sovereign, equitable Web3 looks like, what it requires and how we can work together to make it happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing Twitter Spaces series, we ask,<a href="https://elastos.info/manifesto/"> ‘Who Controls Your Digital Destiny?’</a>, inviting industry leaders to debate, disagree, and ultimately identify and align on the key pillars of the web we all want to be part of.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo/status/1692042666664403301">Our most recent Spaces</a> took a deeper dive into one of the key areas highlighted in our first Twitter Spaces: gaming and entertainment! This session aimed to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identify and agree on the opportunities and challenges for gaming and gaming communities as they explore and migrate to Web3 and GameFi. 
 Build consensus on the different technology solutions needed to ensure personalized experiences, creator-owned and monetized content, marketplaces, gamer IDs, leaderboards, etc. 
 Build understanding of what it takes to build a healthy ecosystem and community for gamers that is open, accessible, self sovereign and most importantly, a lot of fun! 
 
<p>Gaming is the largest entertainment segment in the world! The Global “Games Market” earns nearly $200BN per year. That’s bigger than Hollywood and the music industry combined. But not only that, given Web3’s community focus and ability to track and incentivize behaviour, the gamification of everything from work to shopping to health means that we are entering a new era. But how can we make sure gamers are central to this new world and not commoditized as they have been in the social media era? How can we own and keep and manage our virtual assets? What aspects of a gaming ecosystem need to be considered?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a cross section of the key discussion points laid out by our guests:&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://twitter.com/0xAdin">Adin</a> – Web3 Manager at <a href="https://www.wisdom.gg/labs">Wisdom Labs</a>, the innovation arm of game and entertainment studio Wisdom Gaming 
 <a href="https://twitter.com/_gojohnnygo">Johnny</a> – CEO of <a href="https://www.morfyusleague.io/">Morfyus</a> and Morfyus Leage, a gameFi esports league and guild 
 <a href="https://twitter.com/royingles">Roy</a> – Co-Founder of <a href="https://arcusgo8.com/">Arcus</a>, a popular play-to-earn first person shooter 
 *<a href="https://twitter.com/pavelbains">Pavel </a>– CEO of <a href="https://twitter.com/BluzelleHQ">Bluzelle</a>, unfortunately wasn’t able to join. 
 
<p>The conversation covered various topics such as the challenges and opportunities of Web3 gaming compared to Web2, the importance of decentralized identity (DIDs) and data sovereignty, and the role of fairness and transparency in gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panellists discussed the need for qualities and technologies in an open, self-sovereign gaming ecosystem. They touched upon the importance of standards and interoperability, as well as the integration of business models into Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conversation explored the potential of Web3 gaming, addressing challenges, discussing technologies, and emphasizing the importance of fairness, transparency, and self-sovereignty in gaming experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are the challenges of Web3 gaming and how do they compare to Web2? 
<p>One challenge mentioned is the commoditization of gamers in the social media era. How to ensure that gamers are central to the new Web3 world and not treated as mere commodities, as they have been in the past. This suggests that in Web2 gaming, players may have been undervalued or not given the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p>Another challenge discussed is the learning curve for people transitioning to web3. Johnny mentioned that games in the past were not as seamless as they are today, indicating that Web3 gaming aims to provide a more user-friendly and familiar experience. This suggests that in web2 gaming, the user experience may have been more complicated or less intuitive.</p>
<p>Additionally, the conversation touched on the challenge of integrating web3 into existing gaming experiences. Adin mentioned the need to find ways to integrate web3 into broader gaming experiences through marketing campaigns, brand integration, and providing more value to brands. This implies that adapting web3 technology to fit existing games and platforms may pose a challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How can interoperability and standards be established across different games and platforms in web3? 
<p>Collaboration between game developers: Johnny raises the question of how to get different game developers to work together. Establishing collaboration and cooperation among game developers could be a key factor in establishing interoperability and standards. This could involve sharing knowledge, resources, and best practices to create a unified approach to web3 gaming.</p>
<p>Development of industry-wide standards: To ensure interoperability, the gaming industry could work towards developing and adopting industry-wide standards. These standards could define protocols, formats, and guidelines that games and platforms must adhere to in order to achieve compatibility and seamless integration. Establishing these standards would require the involvement of industry organizations, regulatory bodies, and game developers.</p>
<p>Open-source initiatives: Open-source projects can play a significant role in fostering interoperability. By creating open-source frameworks, libraries, and tools, developers can collaborate and contribute to building a common foundation for web3 gaming. Open-source initiatives encourage transparency, community participation, and the sharing of knowledge, which can lead to the establishment of interoperable standards.</p>
<p>Adoption of blockchain technology: Blockchain technology, which underpins web3, can facilitate interoperability by providing a decentralized and transparent infrastructure. Through the use of smart contracts and decentralized protocols, game assets, currencies, and identities can be easily transferred and utilized across different games and platforms. By leveraging blockchain technology, developers can establish a common framework for interoperability.</p>
<p>Standardization of game asset formats: To achieve interoperability, it would be essential to standardize the formats of game assets such as characters, items, and environments. By defining common formats, developers can ensure that these assets can be seamlessly integrated and utilized across various games and platforms. This standardization could streamline the process of asset sharing and interoperability.</p>
<p>Cross-platform compatibility: To establish interoperability, web3 games should aim to be cross-platform compatible. This means ensuring that games can be played and accessed across different devices and platforms, such as consoles, PCs, mobile devices, and virtual reality headsets. By focusing on cross-platform compatibility, developers can enable players to enjoy the same gaming experience regardless of their preferred platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are the challenges of web3 gaming and how do they compare to web2 gaming? 
<p>Commoditization of gamers: The moderator raised the concern that gamers have been commoditized in the era of social media. In web3 gaming, the challenge would be to ensure that gamers are not treated as commodities but rather as active participants and beneficiaries of the ecosystem. Web2 gaming may not have faced this challenge to the same extent, as the focus was primarily on entertainment rather than community participation and value creation.</p>
<p>Integration of web3 technology: Adin mentioned the responsibility of finding ways to integrate web3 into broader gaming experiences. This suggests that one challenge of web3 gaming is effectively incorporating blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other web3 elements into traditional gaming models.Web2 gaming, on the other hand, may not have faced this challenge as it was not built on decentralized and blockchain-based technologies.</p>
<p>Learning curve and user experience: Jamie asked about the biggest challenge for people on the learning curve and how games can evolve in the future. This implies that web3 gaming may present a steeper learning curve compared to web2 gaming. The integration of complex technologies and the need to understand concepts like digital ownership and decentralized systems might require users to adapt to new interfaces and experiences. web2 gaming, in contrast, may have focused more on providing familiar and user-friendly interfaces.</p>
<p>Mass adoption and value provision: Adin mentioned the need to find ways to introduce web3 into games and provide immediate value to players. Web2 gaming may have had the advantage of already being established and familiar to players, while web3 gaming needs to convince users of the benefits and advantages it offers.</p>
<p>Fairness and transparency: Adin spoke about the goal of providing more fairness and transparency in gaming through web3. This implies that web3 gaming faces the challenge of addressing the issues of fairness, such as reducing cheating and ensuring transparent and trustworthy gameplay. In comparison, web2 gaming may have faced similar challenges, but web3 gaming has the potential to leverage blockchain technology and smart contracts to create more transparent and fair gaming environments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To become successful, web3 gaming must address challenges in scalability, user experience, community building, interoperability, regulations, and sustainability. To achieve this, developers must leverage blockchain technology to build games with open economies, allowing players to earn and spend tokens within and outside those games. They also need to design games with incentives to attract and retain users.</p>
<p>Web3 gaming is a nascent industry, and through collaboration, Elastos <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-tech-stacks-potential-to-transform-web3-gaming/">hopes to build a vibrant ecosystem</a> with partners such as <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-and-wisdom-labs-co-op/">Wisdom Labs</a>, <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-and-arcus-teaming-up/">Arcus</a>, <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/mofyus-and-elastos-sign-mou/">Morfyus</a>, <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/lifty-to-deploy-on-elastos/">Lifty.io</a> and <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/build-it-merchants-and-elastos-partner-to-offer-next-level-gaming-experiences/">Build it Merchants</a>. As the gaming industry has shown, early adopters of new technologies can reap significant rewards. Therefore, it is essential for developers to stay abreast of evolving player preferences and continue to iterate and innovate to meet users’ demands and help achieve web3 gaming’s success in the future.&nbsp;</p>

 Join Energy Web in Shaping the Energy Future via Upcoming Polkadot Crowdloan, Launching September 5th <p>Zug, Switzerland, August 24, 2023 — Energy Web, a non-profit organization developing digital solutions to accelerate the energy transition, is pleased to announce the <a href="http://crowdloan.energywebx.com">Energy Web X crowdloan</a>. The objective of the crowdloan initiative is to secure a parachain slot for Energy Web X on the Polkadot Relay Chain, thereby empowering it to leverage the security and scalability inherent in Polkadot’s infrastructure. Contributing to the crowdloan represents a unique opportunity for the Polkadot and Energy Web communities to help expand the Energy Web ecosystem to the Polkadot network and support Energy Web’s mission to accelerate the energy transition.</p> Crowdloan and Polkadot Parachains: Powering Energy Web X with&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Connecting to the Polkadot Relay Chain offers a <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/EWX-Lightpaper.pdf">multitude of scaling and security benefits </a>for the Energy Web ecosystem. Energy Web X aims to harness these advantages through a parachain connection. However, due to the limited availability of parachain slots on Polkadot, a competitive process is in place to allocate&nbsp;them.</p><p>To determine which projects get to connect their parachains to the Polkadot Relay Chain, lease periods (referred to as ‘ ‘time slots’ ‘) are auctioned off. Each lease period lasts for 12 weeks. Projects can bid for up to 8 slots at once in a crowdloan, for a total of 96 weeks of lease time. Winning an auction secures the project a parachain slot, granting it access to the security and resources of the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>The Energy Web and Polkadot communities can support Energy Web X’s bid for a parachain slot through a crowdloan mechanism.</p> How the EWX Crowdloan Works <p>Contributors lend their DOT tokens for the Energy Web X launch via the Polkadot crowdloan mechanism. Similar to the parachain auctions themselves, crowdloans occur directly on the Polkadot Relay Chain. Contributors will use DOT tokens to participate, requiring a Polkadot wallet. Contributed DOT tokens are temporarily locked on behalf of the project. No tokens are spent (except for a small transaction fee). In the event that Energy Web X does not win an auction, contributed DOT tokens are immediately and automatically returned.</p><p>In the event that Energy Web X wins an auction and secures a parachain slot, DOT tokens will be returned to all contributors once the parachain lease ends (96 weeks after it begins). If Energy Web X is awarded a parachain slot in the forthcoming auction, launch will be targeted for October 23, 2023 (coinciding with Polkadot lease period&nbsp;14).</p> Rewards for EWX Crowdloan Contributors <p>To incentivize community participation, a rewards program is in place. For every 1 $DOT contributed to the Energy Web X crowdloan, 1 $EWT (Energy Web Token) on Energy Web X is offered as a reward. The distribution of $EWT rewards is expected to commence in Q1 2024, with the rewards vested and distributed in consistent amounts in regular intervals over the remaining lease time of Energy Web X until Aug 25,&nbsp;2025.</p><p>The EWX parachain address is automatically calculated based on the Polkadot account that was used for the Crowdloan participation. Therefore it’s not possible to receive the crowdloan rewards to another&nbsp;address.</p> Participation Guidelines <p><a href="http://crowdloan.energywebx.com">To participate in the EWX Crowdloan</a>, contributors must send their $DOT tokens directly to the EWX Crowdloan on Polkadot, as described below. Funds raised via the crowdloan will be used in auctions beginning on September 5, 2023 and concluding between September 19 and September 24, 2023. Due to the candle auction mechanism that defines the auction end time at random, contributions made before September 7 have the most impact on EWX’s chances of winning the auction and your chances to win a reward. Please note that Ledger wallets will not initially support EWX. Contributors using Ledger wallets for the EWX Crowdloan may need to follow additional steps to access their $EWT rewards after the public&nbsp;launch.</p><p>About Energy Web <br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>In an article authored by Elacity CEO Sasha Mitchell and Elastos Growth Team member Jonathan Hargreaves, the necessity of a decentralized identity system is highlighted. This transformation would empower individuals by reinstating ownership and control over user data and content, countering the prevalent centralization on existing platforms. It proposes a model based on blockchain-enabled <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/introducing-elacity-digital-rights-management-drm-an-nft-powered-digital-content-platform-on-elastos/">Digital Rights Management</a> using access and royalty tokens that would allow creators to retain ownership while enabling fair monetization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This “Access Economy” approach could democratize content access, empower creators, and promote an open, inclusive digital ecosystem where individuals control their online narratives. New tokenized digital asset models would enable open markets for trading access rights to content, blurring geographic boundaries and decentralizing revenue generation from digital assets. Here is the <a href="https://medium.com/@elacity2822/the-access-economy-decentralized-identity-digital-rights-and-ownership-in-the-age-of-web3-23f7b1bbb4ce">article</a> in its original version:</p>
<p>In today’s digital world, your online identity and content are often at the mercy of centralized platforms that control your data and monetize your creative output. Imagine a creator who had millions of followers and an income from their online presence, only to lose it all overnight due to platform decisions beyond their control. This scenario illustrates the need for a paradigm shift — a decentralized system that returns power and ownership to the individual.</p>
 The Mysterious Case of X: Open Markets and Identity 
<p>There is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/26/twitter-now-x-took-over-the-x-handle-without-warning-or-compensating-its-owner/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKQnMhGdyoATlsco4y7wJ2U8QC4OiYR4mqldJ6DQx120hC2fqh2Lk0d9rGk97mbEJK9OUNpbjb3v2jVgANAv4g4nkRmq9D212yAAMVhscmekeUOnPXskXNHJQ7d98Y29cfpi5lOJ4PIdiU9I_RFgnpSwAsc0XvJvdRUd4EdJ_-7t">story</a>&nbsp;that the owner of the Twitter account @X was relieved of their account and rights without being offered any compensation or even asked for permission. Shortly after this, the holder of the Twitter @music handle since 2008 was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/by-seizing-music-elon-musk-shows-he-doesnt-know-what-made-twitter-good/">disconnected by X</a>, along with over a million followers. In many circumstances, this could be seen as theft, but not in a Web2 model, as every platform you join owns your identity. It also owns your data and, critically, it owns the rights to your content and the ability to make an income from your talents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, it is not just X that has this legal right; all Web2 platforms work on this premise, and we willingly sign consent forms to this end. What is legally permissible has become normalised as morally acceptable. In this way, the connection between an individual’s rights to an identity and the idea of an open market for people to sell their content is killed stone cold. Indeed, what happens is that creative output becomes the subject of a heist by the platform that owns the rights to use and sell advertising around your content. This ruse ranges from X to YouTube and Meta.</p>
 Decentralised Identity and the Open Market<br>
 
<p>This is why a decentralised identity is such a revolutionary force, as it creates a model where every user has the choice to own their data, decide where they store this data, and how they can use it to create content and even a business for themselves. What’s more, this identity is recognised across the whole system as being yours, and this can clearly be extended to real-world business (and even Web2), so a new kind of genuinely open market can be built around this ‘sovereign’ identity and subsequent content business.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This kind of optimism did exist around the creator economy in Web2, but it got subverted as the platforms took advantage of their ability to control identity and access to the Web. The challenge is how to ensure that Web3 is not co-opted in a similar fashion but enables a decentralised identity to shape a new kind of open market. If a decentralised identity can own its data, what use is it if access control still belongs to a few?</p>
 Digital Rights Management and Owning Identity 
<p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a system that protects digital content from unauthorised use by encrypting it. When you purchase digital content, you receive a license with a decryption key, which unlocks the content but also enforces usage rules. Today, a central server manages these licenses and ensures compliance with the rules. However, centralisation can lead to issues such as server failures and high costs, especially for smaller content providers. Managing rights for numerous users and content can also be complex and costly. When centralised entities have control over the keys to your online ‘house,’ ownership can feel elusive, and there is the inevitable abuse of such power.</p>
 New Access Economy and Tokens 
<p>To avoid Web2’s pitfalls, we must build a new economy centred on democratising access and ensuring individual ownership remains invulnerable to commercial forces, whether from Web2 giants or traditional businesses, Elacity’s Access Economy model addresses this with access tokens, enabling decentralised identities to create a permission system for content creation, sharing, and consumption. As an example, individuals or organisations can package a video into an encrypted ‘Video Capsule,’ accompanied by a blockchain-based smart contract which governs rights with scarce, tradable access tokens for decryption, royalty tokens for revenue distribution, and distribution rights tokens for resale and transfer rules.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unlike centralised methods, access token buyers get a license key directly from the creator’s smart contract using their rights, allowing the same playback experience as in Web2. This decentralisation democratises content access, empowers creators with ownership and control, directs profits to stakeholders, and fosters a fair access economy. It enables creators to set monetisation models, connect directly with their audience, avoid centralised risks, explore new revenue streams, gain resilience and security, and promote a fair, inclusive digital ecosystem. The Access Economy allows everyone to own their online narrative.</p>
<p></p>
<p>New Models and Capsules<br>
In the emerging world of Encrypted Digital Assets (EDAs), new digital value forms are creating an open market for the Access Economy. This can fuel various Capsules, including art, music, gaming, software, and robotics application. These capsules can be hosted, downloaded, and access to them traded. Envision a future where shoppers could purchase access to decentralized AI services from healthcare to financial sectors, enjoy AI-generated media featuring familiar faces and preferred styles, or trade software access for robotics applications such as healthcare, environmental restoration, or home maintenance tasks. Individuals could contribute to sustainability by selling access to excess renewable energy or sensor data supporting smart cities.</p>
<p>Royalties would be distributed to all contributors with every transaction, promoting shared wealth, collective intelligence, and inclusive innovation. In this future, the Access Economy blurs geographical boundaries and democratizes access to revenue-generating assets in an open, global marketplace. It allows asset owners to monetize their resources by offering temporary access, and creating new income streams without sacrificing ownership, while consumers benefit from cost-effective, flexible access to a wide array of resources, fostering innovative business models and strengthening community ties.</p>

So, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.happyporch.com/">Happy Porch</a>, we set off on a journey all about community, values, and rewilding work.</p> Battling change&nbsp;fatigue Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>There are a lot of shiny things in the world of digital transformation. New products and processes that look fancy and promise to help an organisation reach its goals. But you can’t just lurch from one change to the next; you need a plan, a strategy and a group of people dedicated to keeping the organisational mission in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>In our experience, one of the problems with community work is ‘change fatigue’. While people welcome change for the better, if you alter things too often and too quickly, then they become tired of having to adapt. That’s sometimes a difficult thing to balance with testing multiple&nbsp;options.</p> User research and client education <p>Happily, like all effective organisations, WEAll were happy to start with user research. So after doing some work on an <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">Architecture of Participation</a>, we sent out a survey and followed up with interviews via video conference. Happy Porch explored functional requirements for different platforms, and we narrowed the options down to&nbsp;three.</p>Comparison of different online platforms<p>As you can see in the above, we wanted to help WEAll understand what kind of platform they wanted, especially as lots of people conflate <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-good-the-bad-and-the-social-a7b7639165bd">chat apps, social networks, and forums</a>. After some real-life testing, we found that Hylo didn’t fit the bill, but Discourse could be a good fit. It was more than a choice between chat apps and forums; it was about finding the right place for real conversations.</p><p>It’s one thing to choose a platform; it’s another to make it thrive. We set up ‘missions’ for users to explore and get comfortable with the new space. WEAll has even brought on a new hire to make sure the community would keep growing. We’ve worked hand in hand, preparing the groundwork and helping those in charge to steer the&nbsp;ship.</p>Screenshot of <a href="https://together.weall.org">together.weall.org</a><p>This hasn’t just been a project; it’s been a meaningful journey. Working with WEAll, who all work just four days a week, has opened our eyes to different ways of doing things. It’s about more than just business; it’s about building connections, sustainable work, and community. It’s been rewarding, inspiring, and, yes, even a bit challenging at times. But that’s how you learn and&nbsp;grow.</p><p>The collaboration with WEAll is continuing by <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/people-process-product-5a3dfbe565b">crafting a digital strategy</a> that aligns with our shared values. The idea is to connect people working on the wellbeing economy, and we’re proud to be part of this movement. It’s more than a job for us; it’s part of who we&nbsp;are.</p><p>You can join us on this journey towards a better way of working by stopping by the <a href="https://together.weall.org">WEAll community platform</a> at or by learning more about <a href="https://weall.org">their mission</a>. Let’s build a future where work is not just a way to make a living but a way to make a&nbsp;life.</p><p>Also, if we can help your organisation with something like this, then <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/nurturing-the-wellbeing-economy-4396a8ad5bb4">Nurturing the Wellbeing Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made?&nbsp;For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the second article in a six-part series.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>Read part 1: <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">From the darkroom to generative AI</a></p>




 


  <p>by Hany Farid</p><p>Before we dive into talking about specific analyses that can help distinguish the real from the fake, it is worthwhile to first ask: Just how photorealistic are AI-generated images? That is, upon only a visual inspection, can the average person tell the difference between a real image and an AI-generated image? Because the human brain is so finely sensitive to images of people and faces, we will focus on the photorealism of faces, arguably the most challenging task for AI-generation.</p><p>Before diffusion-based, text-to-image synthesis techniques like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Adobe Firefly splashed onto the screen, generative adversarial networks (GANs) were the most common computational technique for synthesizing images. These systems are generative, because they are tasked with generating an image; adversarial, because they pit two separate components (the generator and the discriminator) against each other; and networks, because the computational machinery underlying the generator and discriminator are neural networks.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Although there are many complex and intricate details in these systems, StyleGAN (and GANs in general) follow a fairly straightforward structure. When tasked with creating a synthesized face, the generator starts by splatting down a random array of pixels, and then it feeds this first guess to the discriminator. If the discriminator, equipped with a large database of real faces, can distinguish the generated image from the real faces, the discriminator provides this feedback to the generator. The generator then updates its initial guess and feeds this update to the discriminator in a second round. This process continues with the generator and discriminator competing in an adversarial game until an equilibrium is reached when the generator produces an image that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real faces. Above you can see a representative set of eight GAN-generated faces.</p><p>In a series of recent perceptual studies, we examined the ability of trained and untrained observers to distinguish between real and synthesized faces. The synthetic faces were generated using StyleGAN2, ensuring diversity across gender, race, and apparent age. For each synthesized face, a corresponding real face was matched in terms of gender, age, race, and overall appearance.</p><p>In the first study, 315 paid online participants were shown — one at a time — 128 faces, half of which were real. The participants were asked to classify each as either real or synthetic. The average accuracy on this task was 48.2%, close to chance performance of 50%, with participants equally as likely to say that a real face was synthetic as vice versa.</p><p>In a second study, 219 new participants were initially provided with a brief training on examples of specific rendering artifacts that can be used to identify synthetic faces. Throughout the experiment, participants were also provided with trial-by-trial feedback informing them whether their response was correct. This training and feedback led to a slight improvement in average accuracy, from 48.2% to 59.0%.&nbsp;</p><p>While synthesized faces are highly realistic, there are some clues that can help distinguish them from real faces:&nbsp;</p>  <p>StyleGAN-synthesized faces have a common structure consisting of a mostly front-facing person from the neck up and with a mostly uniform or nondescript background.</p>  <p>Facial asymmetries are telltale signs of synthetic faces. They are often seen in mismatched earrings or glasses frames. (See the top-left image in the figure below.)</p>  <p>When viewing a face, we tend to focus most of our attention in a "Y" pattern, shifting our gaze between the eyes and mouth and often missing some glaring artifacts in the background that may contain physically implausible structures. (See the top-right image in the figure below.)</p>  <p>StyleGAN-synthesized faces enforce a facial alignment in the training and synthesis steps that results in the spacing between the eyes being the same and the eyes being horizontally aligned in the image. (See the bottom image in the figure below.)</p>

  <p>Having largely passed through the uncanny valley, GAN-generated faces are nearly indistinguishable from real faces. Although we have not carried out formal studies, my intuition is that the more recent diffusion-based, text-to-image generation yields faces that are slightly less photorealistic. As this technology improves, however, it will surely lead to images that also pass through the uncanny valley.</p><p>Having seen that the visual system may not always be reliable in distinguishing the real from the fake, in my next post I will describe our first technique that exploits the facial alignment of GAN-generated faces to distinguish them from real faces.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p>[1] S.J.

Moreover, Gnosis Chain builders exhibited a high level of readiness to support integration and development of AI solutions for prediction markets, using the DKG as a trusted knowledge foundation.</p> Unique character of OriginTrail DKG on Gnosis&nbsp;Chain <p>The rapid expansion of AI capabilities poses a breakthrough opportunity for improving the efficiency of prediction markets as we unlock the strength of Web3 and AI technological overlap. The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph and its Knowledge Assets were identified as the ideal gateway to enable this vision for Gnosis prediction markets&nbsp;by:</p>  creating a trusted knowledge base that serves as input for AI agents to provide more precise bets on prediction markets,  using Knowledge Assets as semantic oracles for fulfillment of prediction markets,  publishing prediction knowledge as Knowledge Assets into the DKG for access with AI tools (Knowledge Graph completion).  <p>The new features of combined Gnosis and OriginTrail technologies are intended to be available to users and builders in both ecosystems, who can also apply for additional support through the <a href="http://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> program run by OriginTrail core developers or by submitting treasury proposals to the <a href="https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=0&amp;month=7&amp;year=2023">Gnosis&nbsp;DAO</a>.</p> Pioneer the OriginTrail V6 on&nbsp;Gnosis! <p>To join pioneers of Gnosis Chain V6 DKG integration, put your TRAC utility token to use by bridging it from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain via the Omnibridge — <a href="https://omnibridge.gnosischain.com/bridge">https://omnibridge.gnosischain.com/bridge</a>.</p><p>Before using the Omni bridge make sure to familiarize yourself with the terms of use and possible associated risks.</p><p>Trace ON!</p><p>👇 About Gnosis — The Community-Run Chain&nbsp;👇</p><p>Gnosis Chain is one of the first Ethereum sidechains and has stayed true to its values.

 Accelerating Innovators through Energy Web Validator Community Fund&nbsp;Grants <p>Zug, 20 July 2023 — Energy Web Chain Validators recently approved a newly designed <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/communitygrantprogram/">Community Fund Grant Program</a>. The program’s objective is to support innovative projects aligned with Energy Web’s mission by awarding them with grants to turn innovative ideas into&nbsp;reality.</p><p>The program will be governed by a comprehensive set of rules approved by the validator community and managed by the Community Fund Committee. The rules and processes were inspired by the experience of several validators, who have participated in several grant programs in other Web 3 communities.</p><p>Although the Community Fund has been used for initiatives such as the Bug Bounty Program or the Validator Accounting Tool, its potential can be maximised by opening it to the wider public and supporting innovative projects that contribute to Energy Web’s mission. And with <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-and-polkadot-link-up-to-build-pioneering-renewable-energy-solutions-aca7e95e61c">Energy Web entering the Polkadot environment </a>and developing its next-generation blockchain <a href="http://www.energyweb.org/EWXLightpaperV1">Energy Web X</a>, the opportunities for innovation are even&nbsp;greater.</p><p>The rules behind the program set a general framework comprised of specific requirements applicants must meet and also specify application processes. It features a tiered grant system intended to support different types of projects, from small-scale ideas such as building simple components to improve Energy Web’s tech stack to larger ones like building entirely new solutions or conducting pilots involving energy&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Impact-driven innovation and open-source technologies are deeply rooted in Energy Web’s mission and values. Applicants will be required to tackle tangible challenges and must be willing to share project results in a transparent way.</p><p>The first iteration of the program is officially accepting grants. Participants will be required to to submit an application via a simple online form made available on this <a href="http://energyweb.org/communitygrantprogram">website</a>. And, though it has only just kicked off, future iterations are being planned by having a GitHub based application process (similar to <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#1-application">W3F’s process</a>) catering to developers and increasing transparency.</p><p>Energy Web Chain Validators look forward to receiving your applications. Stay tuned to upcoming announcements and do not hesitate in reaching out if you have any questions.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

Backed by blockchain technology, DIDs eliminate reliance on third parties, enabling self-sovereign digital identity management.</p>
<p>The Elastos platform provides an end-to-end decentralized identity framework to make DIDs a reality. At its core is the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/dids/intro/">Elastos DID</a> built on the dedicated and interoperable <a href="http://did.elastos.io">Elastos Identity Chain</a>, enabling unique digital identities tied to users’ public-private key pairs. Elastos offers both the foundational infrastructure and a wealth of integration partners to drive adoption.</p>
<p>Elastos ecosystem projects like the <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/revolutionizing-data-protection-with-elastos-essentials-wallet/">Essentials Superwallet</a>, <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-feeds-a-place-of-free-thought/">Feeds</a>, <a href="https://www.creda.app/home">CreDA</a>, <a href="https://ela.city/">Elacity</a>, <a href="https://pasarprotocol.io/">Pasar</a>, and&nbsp; <a href="https://kyc-me.io/">KYC-me</a> demonstrate the versatility of the Elastos DID. Each project tackles real-world identity challenges, showcasing how Elastos DID can enhance security, privacy, and user control across diverse verticals. The applications extend further into healthcare, education, government, supply chain, and legal sectors.</p>
<p>Together, the Elastos DID platform and its expanding ecosystem of integrations provide a concrete path to mass decentralized identity adoption. Elastos offers full-stack decentralized identity – from cryptographic foundations to simple wallet interfaces – making self-sovereign identity a reality for users and businesses worldwide.</p>
 Elastos DID Driven Ecosystem Projects 
 Elacity: NFT Marketplace Driven by Identity 
<p>Elacity is an NFT marketplace built on the principles of the Access Economy, a model that empowers users to control and monetize their own data. Elacity leverages decentralized identifier (DID) and self-sovereign identity (SSI) technologies to put users in charge of their digital identities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users on Elacity have complete ownership over their personal data and profiles. Sensitive information is never stored centrally. Users also retain full control over how their data is used and shared.</p>
<p>This user-centric approach promotes ethical data use while allowing users to capitalize on their information. By leveraging SSI and DID, Elacity creates an open marketplace where participants can securely interact without ceding control of their digital identities.</p>
 Feeds: User-Controlled Social Media 
<p>Feeds showcases the potential of DIDs in social media. Unlike platforms like Facebook or Twitter, Feeds utilizes DIDs and Hive for user data and connections, ensuring individual ownership and privacy. Users access Feeds with secure DIDs instead of traditional usernames, maintaining privacy and preventing unauthorized data collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIDs enable server-free operation, decentralizing user data and control. This contrasts with profit-driven networks that analyze user data. With DIDs, Feeds offers a user-centric, private, and autonomous social media experience, free from centralized surveillance and data exploitation.</p>
 CreDA: Decentralized Credit Scoring 
<p>CreDA leverages DIDs to offer decentralized credit scoring for DeFi platforms. By linking on-chain and off-chain financial data using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#:~:text=A%20verifiable%20credential%20is%20a,certificates%2C%20and%20digital%20educational%20certificates.">verifiable credentials</a>, CreDA helps DeFi entities assess creditworthiness while protecting user privacy through selective disclosure. This expands access to capital worldwide.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Traditional credit scores rely on centralized credit bureaus, leaving many unbanked or underbanked individuals excluded. CreDA changes this by developing credit assessments based on both traditional banking data as well as Web3 financial transactions. Utilizing DIDs and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, CreDA generates secure, portable credit reports that users control.</p>
<p>Individuals share only specific financial credentials required for credit assessments, minimizing data exposure. CreDA unlocks new opportunities for billions lacking access to loans and financial services. Its privacy-first approach aligned with decentralized values makes it uniquely appealing for DeFi and Web3 applications.</p>
 Essentials Superwallet 
<p>While DIDs provide a revolutionary model for digital identity, complexity has hindered mainstream usage. The average internet user lacks the technical know-how to manage cryptographic keys and operate on blockchain platforms. Elastos Essentials provides a user-friendly wallet interface that abstracts away blockchain intricacies. For the first time, ordinary people can easily register and leverage decentralized identities without being blockchain experts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the Essentials wallet, getting started with DIDs involves just a few intuitive clicks. Users register a unique DID directly on their phone in seconds. The app handles cryptographic key management behind the scenes. Once registered, users can store verifiable credentials like proof of age or education certificates as NFTs in their wallet. They selectively disclose credentials to log into websites, access services, or prove qualifications. No more remembering countless passwords or filling out endless forms.</p>
<p>The Essentials wallet puts the convenience and superpowers of DIDs directly in people’s pockets. Its elegantly simple design makes DID a reality for general consumers rather than just a concept for tech pioneers. By abstracting away complexity, Essentials provides the missing link for global DID adoption. Now anyone can exercise digital autonomy and control their online identities through the power of blockchain.</p>
 Potential Real World DID Use Cases 
 Government and Civic Services 
<p>DIDs enable digital identity portability across government services like tax filing, voting, social welfare benefits, and more. Citizens can selectively disclose only the minimum credentials required to access each service, minimizing unnecessary data sharing with authorities. DIDs reduce identity fraud while facilitating remote access and paperless processes for civic services.</p>
<p>Another example is digital voting implemented using DIDs. Voters could access ballots using their DIDs and cast votes linked to their decentralized identities. This enables remote participation while preventing duplicate voting. DIDs align with civic values around privacy and autonomy.</p>
 Legal Services 
<p>The legal industry is primed for disruption by DIDs. DIDs enable verifiable digital signatures, tamper-proof documentation, and selective disclosure of confidential information.</p>
<p>Legal contracts can integrate DIDs to validate signatories and digitally sign agreements. Smart contracts make contract logic executable based on immutable data from oracles. DIDs provide non-repudiation and make digital contracts enforceable. DIDs allow provable authorship and timestamping of legal documents like affidavits and filings. Lawyers can anonymously submit privileged information, while selectively disclosing credentials to courts.</p>
<p>Arbitration systems can leverage DIDs for digital evidence sharing between parties. Users control access by disclosing selective credentials needed to present claims or defenses. DIDs also enable enforceable digital arbitration rulings. DIDs help firms digitize compliance processes like KYC and AML where clients must prove credentials like nationality, PEP status, accreditation, etc. This increases efficiency and reduces risk.</p>
<p>Overall, DIDs introduce valid digital identities into the legal system. This unlocks paperless processes, remote access, and disintermediation. DIDs represent the first step in bringing legal systems into the digital age while upholding privacy.</p>
 Healthcare 
<p>Patients can leverage DIDs to control access to their medical records. Healthcare providers must verify their credentials in order to view relevant health data – without exposing unrelated personal details. Patients grant time-limited access only to the minimum health information that providers need.</p>
<p>DIDs enhance medical data privacy while improving care coordination, accuracy, and efficiency. Patients can easily share verified health credentials with new providers, creating a comprehensive unified record across different healthcare systems. This reduces duplication of tests and prevents medical errors.</p>
<p>DIDs also enable advanced applications like remote patient monitoring and telemedicine. Patients can share real-time health data from wearables with healthcare providers, without sacrificing privacy. Overall, DIDs help restore power to patients over their medical information.</p>
 Education 
<p>Educational institutions can issue digital diplomas, transcripts, certifications and credentials as verifiable credentials linked to students’ DIDs. Students then control access to their academic records, choosing when to prove enrollment or qualifications – without revealing unnecessary personal details.</p>
<p>DIDs eliminate paper-based records and simplify verification processes. Students own their educational credentials on their blockchain-secured decentralized ID, rather than through educational institutions. This gives students life-long permissionless access to their own academic achievements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>DIDs also enable credential portability across different institutions, workplaces, and geographic borders. Students can seamlessly prove their credentials as they progress through higher education and employment.</p>
 Supply Chain Logistics 
<p>DIDs introduce transparency and accountability to supply chain operations. Manufacturers can cryptographically sign key data like proof of origin, ingredients, transport conditions, and custody logs as verifiable credentials linked to products’ unique decentralized IDs.</p>
<p>Supply chain partners can then selectively disclose credentials to prove important product attributes like fair trade sourcing or cold chain compliance, without exposing entire databases. This provides accountability while protecting commercially sensitive details.</p>
<p>Consumers can also verify product origins and lifecycle histories to a granular level by accessing relevant supply chain credentials. DIDs enable precision authentication without centralized data sharing across disparate entities. This is a major upgrade over current supply chain tracking methods.</p>
 The Future of Identity Belongs to the People 
<p>DIDs herald a monumental shift by restoring individual sovereignty over digital identity. After years of centralized data exploitation, DIDs finally enable self-determination and user control. Elastos stands at the forefront of this revolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elastos DID provides the cryptographic foundations for self-sovereign identity. Elastos ecosystem projects like Essentials, Elacity, Feeds, and CreDA manifest the real-world promise of DIDs. Together, they enable users to control their data, assets, and online personas. Where incumbent social networks and banks once wielded unilateral power, now users are in charge. Elastos is architecting the digital future we all deserve – one of autonomy, privacy, and user rights.</p>
<p>The era of centralized data monopolies is ending. Elastos is making this decentralized vision a reality, returning power from corporations to individuals. Far more than a technical innovation, self-sovereign identity enables people to take back ownership of their digital lives. Elastos DID finally gives users the tools to control their digital destiny. The future is self-sovereign.</p>

<p>Committee Note discusses approaches to alerts in specific geographic areas</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce publication of “Mobile Alerting Practices Version 1.0,” a Committee Note from the members of the OASIS Emergency Management TC [1].</p>



<p>One method of reaching people with emergency alert messages is via their personal mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablets. Access to these devices is via the Mobile Network to which they are currently attached. However, the need to make a large-scale distribution in a specific geographic area without crashing the control channel, and the need to reach roamers, whose devices may retain their default behavior from their home network, needs consideration by those mobile networks. This document discusses how practitioners have considered this matter.</p>



<p>The Committee Note is available here:</p>

<p>OASIS and the OASIS Universal Business Language TC are pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.4 is now available for public review and comment. This is the second public review for Universal Business Language Version 2.4.</p>



<p>About the specification draft:</p>



<p>UBL is the leading interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:<br>– A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.<br>– A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.<br>– A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.</p>



<p>UBL v2.4 is a minor revision to v2.3 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 93. As with previous UBL releases, the UBL 2.4 library is designed to support the construction of a wide variety of document types beyond those provided in the 2.4 package.</p>

  DID methods are the magic ingredient that gives DIDs their flexibility. Before creating any specific DID, you first choose a DID method, which determines how you perform the create, read, update, and deactivate operations on a DID of that method. Once created, each DID includes the name of its method in the identifier itself, so that when you use the DID, others know how to retrieve the associated

 What Happened <p>On Tuesday, August 15, 2023 around 2pm EST, hackers believed to be from the Pink Drainer hacker group breached Ceramic’s Discord server. This resulted in a series of fake airdrop announcements with malicious links that looked like they came from a core team member.</p><p>After the hackers infiltrated the server, they immediately removed all core team members and other prominent community members, which effectively disabled us from taking action to stop the attack. Once the core team realized they lost access to Discord, around 2pm EST, they immediately contacted the support team at Discord and posted on Twitter to warn the community. By 6pm the core team regained control of Discord, banned the hackers, and eliminated the threats including malicious links and posts.</p><p>In total, the hackers siphoned around $1,710 (0.93476 ETH) from community members who clicked the malicious link in the announcement channel. If you were affected by this phishing attempt please email us at <a href="mailto:team@3box.io">team@3box.io</a>.</p><p>Huge thanks to the Metamask, Discord, LearnWeb3, and ENS teams and the multitude of community members who responded so quickly and effectively to help us contain the damage.</p> How it Happened <p>Hackers reached out to a core Ceramic team member on Telegram impersonating a prominent mainstream media journalist and requested an interview for a feature. Prior to speaking, they requested the completion of prerequisite consent forms that required the team member to drag and drop a button into their bookmarks and sign into Discord in order to verify their account identity.</p><p>After dragging the bookmark into <a href="http://discord.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Discord.com</a> through their web browser, the hacker was able to steal the JWT Auth Token of this user’s account from the browser's local storage—bypassing username, password and 2FA. This attack is known as a bookmarklet, you can read more about it <a href="https://breakdev.org/hacked-discord-bookmarklet-attacks/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>. The hackers only gained access to Discord and no other information was lost or compromised.</p><p>This highly-coordinated attack appears to be the work of Pink Drainer, a hacker group that has executed this type of bookmarklet attack on a number of other leading Web3 projects. You can read more about other similar hacks performed by this group <a href="https://drops.scamsniffer.io/post/pink-drainer-steals-3m-from-multiple-hack-events-including-openai-cto-orbiter-finance/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p> Incident &amp; Response Timeline <p>11:20am EST - Consent forms completed, hack begins</p><p>1:50pm EST - Core team members lose access to Ceramic Discord</p><p>1:55pm EST - Hackers impersonate Ceramic’s community manager and post fake Ceramic token airdrop announcements</p><p>2pm to 6pm EST - Core team engages Discord, MetaMask, Seal 911 team, WalletConnect, LearnWeb3, and ENS for support</p><p>6pm EST - Core team regains access to and control of Ceramic Discord</p> Next Steps <p>The Ceramic core team will be doubling-down on security while restoring previous roles and settings in Discord. Please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:team@3box.io">team@3box.io</a> if you’ve been affected by the attack.</p><p>We take our role of protecting the best interests of our community very seriously and this was certainly not our finest afternoon; however, these types of events are an unfortunate reality of operating in Web3. </p><p>We will learn from this misstep, improve, and make sure we continue to serve and protect our community of Web3 builders.

 Part 1: Building Resilience Amongst Environmental Activists CIN Advanced Comms training logo, cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Have you ever heard of <a href="https://fckoatly.com/">Fck Oatly</a>? It’s a playfully sarcastic website that documents scandals the brand Oatly has had to deal with — bad press, boycotts, internet shaming, you name it. Oatly has taken control of their PR nightmares, company crises and embarrassing incidents. Fck Oatly is an admirable way for an organisation to own their&nbsp;story.</p><p>PR mishaps or brand crises are pieces of a complex crisis management puzzle. For several years, we have been designing and redesigning, delivering and iterating on a complex digital training for Greenpeace International (GPI). Until now, we’ve not written publicly about the training, due to the sensitive nature of the themes surrounding crisis management inside of a global network of organisations like Greenpeace.</p><p>We’re pleased to have been given the go ahead to write about the programme(s). It’s a lot, so we’ll do a series of posts starting with some context and background.</p> A little&nbsp;context cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Greenpeace is a network of organisations that rally together around the common mission to “ensure the ability of the earth to nurture life in all its diversity.” This network is made up of individual Greenpeace organisations. Greenpeace International (GPI) is the global enabling body that provides support for national and regional Greenpeace organisations (NROs) around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Greenpeace International had, for years, been running an in-person training program designed to connect people across the network together and teach them skills on how to manage complex activist situations. The in-person training revolved around scenario based, experiential learning. Essentially, people gathered together to role play potential scenarios and the trainers would gauge responses while connecting reactions to policy and procedures.</p><p>Activism is about changing the status quo, so activist organisations are inherently placed in potentially risky situations. Because of the potential risk, there are management tactics within activist organisations that are designed to reduce risk both to the organisation as well as the activists within&nbsp;it.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, they knew this critical training programme needed to be digitised, but they didn’t want to lose the experiential aspects of what was supposed to be a high stress training situation.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Issues Management tends to be a proactive look at various activities within the Greenpeace network, whereas Crisis Management, and its more serious delineation Critical Incident Management, are reactive.</p><p>Dealing with crises is a complex psychological, strategic and tactical endeavour. Self awareness and stress resilience are key, so not everyone is suitable for this kind of&nbsp;work.</p> Building a Community of&nbsp;Practice cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>A network of organisations like Greenpeace need capable, thoughtful comms professionals. When something unexpected happens, when shit hits the fan, a coordinated network of skilled people get organised to deal with the situation, whatever it may&nbsp;be.</p><p>A strong, international Community of Practice is able&nbsp;to:</p>  monitor, analyse, handle, and escalate critical issues relevant to Greenpeace  lead or support communication in international critical incident situations  <p>We call this Community of Practice the Critical Incident Network or CIN for&nbsp;short.</p> A Progressive Pathway for the&nbsp;Network <p>Our end goal is to build a vibrant community of experienced professionals, but to do that, we need to help people become experienced in managing crises and incidents without them being involved in real incidents.</p><p>The stakes are high, and the road is long. When we think about how people become experienced to participate in a network like this, we acknowledge a progression of experience, skills and connections. Our Network Pathway consists of five distinct steps, the progression of which aligns with what we call “progressive education” or “constructivism”.</p><p>Progressive education emphasises active and experiential learning, encouraging learners to engage in real-world experiences and take an active role in their education. It focuses on the development of critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and personal&nbsp;agency.</p>The Network Pathway cc-by&nbsp;WAO Get Ready! <p>We have lots to share around this innovative learning programme! We are looking forward to getting into the intricacies of each step of the learning pathway. We are looking forward to showcasing some of the unique aspects of the digital training. The design, methodology, and technologies used are world-class, and we’re pleased to explain how we managed to preserve the experiential learning aspects while accommodating the shift to virtual settings.</p><p>For now, if you have thoughts or ideas, specific questions or ideas — Get Organised and send them our&nbsp;way!</p><p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/exploring-community-learning-pathways-88a9758928c2">Read Part 2: Exploring community learning&nbsp;pathways</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/navigating-greenpeaces-critical-incident-network-5d9fe79ea824">Navigating Greenpeace’s Critical Incident Network</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Findynet received 10 responses to the SSI RFI and continues to evaluate available SSI solutions by arranging a series of demo sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Findynet <a href="https://findy.fi/en/ssi-rfi-2023/">requested information about Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions</a> in the summer. We are very pleased with the quality of the 10 responses and thank all respondents for their participation. We feel that we have a good baseline to start evaluating which solutions would best fit the various ecosystems and use cases Findynet is planning to support.</p>
<p>If you are a potential participant in a Findy pilot or a Finnish SSI ecosystem member looking for an SSI solution, please reach out to <a href="mailto:samuel.rinnetmaki@findy.fi?subject=SSI+RFI+results">Samuel Rinnetmäki</a> so we can share the overview of the RFI results with you.</p>
<p>We have also arranged a series of demonstrations where SSI solution providers showcase their capabilities.&nbsp;In these 1-hour online events, invited SSI solution providers demonstrate their capabilities to support use case examples defined by Findynet.</p>
 Invitation to live demos 
 The demo sessions are open to all Findynet’s members and customers – both current and potential ones. If you’re interested to see how Self-sovereign identity works in practice and how SSI solutions can reduce friction and improve privacy, please join the Teams online sessions using the links below. The date and time is a link to a calendar invitation.

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>With this year’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata&nbsp;</a>earlier in the month now behind us but still very much in the sector’s mind, it has to be the most appropriate topic to lead this month’s newsletter.</p>



<p>Some of you reading this were there in the room to experience it and as I wrote to you last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/speakers-2023/">s</a><a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/speakers-2023/">peakers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/sponsors/">sponsors</a>&nbsp;and delegates alike all played their part to make this event a great success, ‘the best yet’. Attendee survey results certainly support this assertion.</p>



<p>There were jaw-dropping statistics thanks to the Department of Internal Affairs and&nbsp;<a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/paulwarrentape">Paul Warren-Tape from Diamond Sponsor IDVerse</a>. The cost of identity crime in NZ is +$200M annually, and the cost of identity theft globally in 2021 was $52bn. By comparison, the estimated cost to eradicate world hunger for a year is $45bn. No math needed – the human cost of identity crime is huge and Aotearoa simply has to do better, faster, if we are to get ahead of this.</p>



<p>We enjoyed&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/programme-2023/">presentations, panel and roundtable discussions</a>&nbsp;ruminating on new tech in biometrics, in AI and Cloud, on talent and trust, identity and security. We heard experiences from the banking, health and retail sectors in operationalising digital trust. And we were able to get some useful insights and updates from the Department of Internal Affairs’ Digital Public Service branch and the RealMe team, even though Ministers and senior government officials were unable to attend due to the election being so close. Fortunately for attendees, they can re-run the event on the Backstage app, to keep those poignant moments top of mind. Get a head start on next year’s Summit:&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/subscribe-for-updates/">Subscribe for updates – Digital Trust Summit</a>.</p>



<p>Our decision to bring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victordominello/">Victor Dominello&nbsp;</a>over from New South Wales to deliver the international keynote paid off handsomely – Victor also giving up his time so generously to meet with the Minister, the opposition, the Digital Executive Board comprising senior public service officials, the Te Whatu Ora and&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity NZ’s</a>&nbsp;own&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it was in my car on the Sunday night two days before the Hui Taumata, touring Victor around the Wellington CBD showing the locations for his upcoming meetings when he asked, “What happened? In my early days in the New South Wales Government as Minister for Digital we envied just how far ahead New Zealand was in terms of digital compared to us. And now you have me over here to share our story. What happened?”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a fair point. There were several policy changes around seven or eight years ago which impacted New Zealand’s leadership position. But on the other hand, that’s when discussions about regulating the New Zealand digital identity market first surfaced (with the passing of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">DISTF regulation</a>&nbsp;we are up towards the front again in that aspect) and with the establishment and success of New Zealand digital identity companies coming a little later, some of which have gone global (MATTR recently winning a contract from the NSW Government no less) it’s clear that we’ve moved forward. If you’re interested,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final-1.pdf">pages 14 -15 and 32-34 of our Report on Digital Identity in Aotearoa</a>&nbsp;help with further context around the market dynamics. Nonetheless, it’s sobering to be reminded how offshore perceives us – how our comprehensive leadership in this space less than 10 years ago has narrowed and in some cases been overtaken. Just like the All Blacks or the Silver Ferns (if we thought of Aotearoa’s digital identity ecosystem as a national team) there should be no complacency regarding our relative position in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So it was great to feel the ‘buzz’ of a sense of urgency in conversations at the Hui Taumata this year. And it has motivated<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">&nbsp;Digital Identity NZ</a>&nbsp;to think strategically on how to deliver its value proposition and increase its relevance more directly into the NZ digital identity ecosystem while supporting its members. In the coming months expect to see some timely and strategic changes to our positioning, posture, website and events content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>My opening and closing remarks encouraged attendees to actively participate and help frame the underpinning ecology and ecosystem that’s needed to support our shared goal. That could be through advocacy, research and development or education and awareness raising throughout your organisation, whānau, iwi and hapu of the critical and foundational role digital identity plays in achieving safe, secure and privacy-centric digital transactions.</p>



<p>To that end&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity NZ</a>&nbsp;has some great resources to draw on for help, including&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">articles, research, reports and our submissions</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/webinars/">webinars</a>&nbsp;and similar postings from its&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/knowledge-hub/">Knowledge Hub</a>.&nbsp;They are there for you – private, public and&nbsp;non profit sectors – the mahi sponsored by socially responsible organisations working alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-members/">members</a>&nbsp;volunteering their time.&nbsp;The time for action is now.</p>

 Introduction — bringing any message across blockchains <p>The OriginTrail technical architecture consists of 3 layers — the consensus layer, the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) layer and the application layer. Since the OriginTrail ecosystem inception and the first whitepaper, the consensus layer was intended to include multiple blockchains in order to ensure neutrality, robustness and inclusiveness.</p><p>We have seen the first implementation of the multi-chain approach in the V5 of the DKG which ended up being integrated with Ethereum, Gnosis and Polygon. The currently newest V6, initially deployed on the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot, has yet to become a multichain network and drive trusted knowledge infrastructure across blockchains. This document serves as an outline of the path towards reaching&nbsp;that.</p><p>Web3 is currently lacking an interoperable layer for maintaining a trusted knowledge base across a growing number of blockchain ecosystems which is limiting the possibility to create cross-blockchain applications or expand user experience and user base across multiple blockchain ecosystems.</p><p>In addition to limiting the value that can be created for Web3 users, it also significantly discourages Web2 users from onboarding to Web3. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/10/majority-of-americans-arent-confident-in-the-safety-and-reliability-of-cryptocurrency/">According to research, </a>75% of Americans who have heard of cryptocurrencies are not confident in their safety and reliability. While reasons for this are multifaceted, it is clear, the growth of this sector is impeded by misinformation, poorly structured and siloed&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Web3 requires a semantic layer to bring any message across blockchains in a verifiable manner. Having discussed integrations with several leading EVM compatible blockchain ecosystem champions, the right time to enable such integrations is&nbsp;now.</p> OriginTrail integration with EVM — compatible blockchains <p>The ambition of the multichain OriginTrail project is to drive trusted knowledge exchange across Web3 communities by equipping builders from various ecosystems with tools and guidance to integrate DKG with their EVM-compatible chain.</p><p>The impact of OriginTrail integration with a blockchain ecosystem:</p>  Bringing Decentralized Knowledge Graph technology to any blockchain ecosystem enabling trusted AI applications, such as AI-powered trusted semantic search (<a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> initiative)  Enabling enterprise solutions leveraging DKG and AI technology on your chain (enterprises using OriginTrail <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/overview">here</a>)  Cross-chain knowledge portability (e.g. bridging knowledge for multichain Dapps)  Semantic data oracle functionality for smart contracts on your blockchain (e.g. RWA applications)  Integrations with applications and protocols within your blockchain ecosystem, leveraging the interoperable design of Knowledge Assets (e.g. NFT marketplaces for trading Knowledge assets)  Shared user experience between metaverses leveraging trusted Knowledge Assets across blockchains (e.g. <a href="https://www.tracverse.com/">Tracverse</a>)  <p>Enablement of EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystems drives further exposure and awareness about OriginTrail DKG, resulting in synergies between crypto communities and ultimately the establishment of the Multichain Trusted Knowledge Foundation.</p> EVM blockchains DKG integration steps <p>The process kick-starting the integration of Decentralized Knowledge Graph on an EVM compatible blockchains is straightforward. The first step is to create a pull request in the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/">OT-RFC-repository</a> using the template pull request with the following name: RFC-17-CHAIN_NAME_integration. In the PR you should create a JSON file with key details about the blockchain network (name, network ID, block explorer, website) and addresses of the smart contracts for TRAC bridge (both on Ethereum and destination chain). An example of the file is available <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-17-OriginTrail-integration-with-EVM-compatible-blockchains/chains/integration-requests/example.json">here</a>.</p><p>Once the pull request is submitted, the core development team will validate the submission to ensure that no inputs are missing and that all requirements are fully met (see below). Depending on the findings, the integration might be approved for the next stage or a request for more information will be&nbsp;given.</p><p>Once approved, a dedicated channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/cCRPzzmnNT">OriginTrail Discord</a> will be created for the blockchain network and integration will be scheduled for implementation (the exact date will be communicated in Discord).</p> EVM blockchain requirements for DKG integration <p>There are a few key criteria that need to be met in order for integration to&nbsp;proceed:</p>  The blockchain network needs to be EVM-compatible.  The blockchain network needs a functioning, preferably decentralized, bridge for the TRAC&nbsp;token.  Engagement within the OriginTrail community — there should be a positive presence of the particular blockchain community present in the OriginTrail community and/or vice-versa. The signaling of desired DKG utility on a particular blockchain ensures that the deployed network will see reasonable activity.  5MM+ TRAC bridged to the blockchain network showing support to initiate network infrastructure and initial DKG network activity.   Conclusion <p>This RFC has presented the approach to integrating OriginTrail DKG with EVM-compatible blockchains, the value propositions and indicated requirements for such integrations. We invite the wider Web3 community to participate in the RFC process, provide their feedback and initiate integrations.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-17-origintrail-integration-with-evm-compatible-blockchains-e635dc8afb86">OT-RFC-17 OriginTrail integration with EVM-compatible blockchains</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>In the past, altering the historical record required cumbersome and time-consuming darkroom techniques. Starting in the early 2000s, powerful and low-cost digital technology began to make it easier to record and alter digital images. And today, sophisticated generative-AI software has fully democratized the ability to create compelling digital fakes.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, I was waiting in line at the library when I noticed an enormous book in the return cart called The Federal Rules of Evidence. I thumbed through the book and came across Rule 1001 of Article X, which outlined the rules under which photographic evidence can be introduced in a court of law. The rules seemed straightforward until I read the definition of original:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>An “original” of a writing or recording means the writing or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by the person who executed or issued it. For electronically stored information, “original” means any printout — or other output readable by sight — if it accurately reflects the information.</p></blockquote><p>I was struck that the definition of original included this vague statement: “... or other output readable by sight.”&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, digital cameras and digital editing software were still primitive by today’s standards, and generative AI was unimaginable. The trajectory of technology, however, was fairly clear, and it seemed to me that advances in the power and ubiquity of digital technology would eventually lead to complex issues around how we can trust digital media. As we enter the new age of generative AI, these issues have only become more salient.</p><p>Although it varies in form and creation, generative AI content (a.k.a. deepfakes) refers to images, audio, or video that has been automatically synthesized by an AI-based system. Deepfakes are the latest in a long line of techniques used to manipulate reality — from Stalin's darkroom to Photoshop to classic computer-generated renderings. However, their introduction poses new opportunities and risks now that everyone has access to what was historically the purview of a small number of sophisticated organizations.</p><p>Even in these early days of the AI revolution, we are seeing stunning advances in generative AI. The technology can create a realistic photo from a simple text prompt, clone a person's voice from a few minutes of an audio recording, and insert a person into a video to make them appear to be doing whatever the creator desires. We are also seeing real harms from this content in the form of non-consensual sexual imagery, small- to large-scale fraud, and disinformation campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Building on our earlier research in digital media forensics techniques, over the past few years my research group and I have turned our attention to this new breed of digital fakery. All our authentication techniques work in the absence of digital watermarks or signatures. Instead, they model the path of light through the entire image-creation process and quantify physical, geometric, and statistical regularities in images that are disrupted by the creation of a fake.</p><p>In this series of posts, I will describe a collection of different techniques that we use to determine whether an image is real or fake. I will explain the underlying analyses — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, specular reflections in the eye, and AI-generated faces — and the conditions under which the analyses are suitable.</p><p>While these and related techniques can be powerful, I need to emphasize their limitations.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it is important to understand that while the presence of evidence of manipulation can tell us something, the absence of traces of manipulation do not prove that an image is real. We cannot differentiate between a flawless fake and the real thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, nearly all forensic techniques have a limited shelf life because techniques to manipulate content are continually improving. So while these techniques are applicable today, we have to continually be aware of how generative AI is evolving.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, these forensic techniques are only one part of a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record. This includes efforts like the Content Authenticity Initiative (to which I contribute), some regulatory pressures, education, and the responsible deployment of AI technologies.</p><p>Further reading:<br>[1] H.

    <blockquote>
      <p>Among the many challenges in our global healthcare delivery landscape, digital health plays an increasingly important role on almost a daily basis, from personal medical devices, to wearables, to new clinical technology and data exchanges. Beyond direct patient care, digital health also applies to diagnostics, drug effectiveness, and treatment delivery. These use cases are being driven by rapid growth in data modeling, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML), and data visualization. Given the rapid digitalization of healthcare delivery, emerging digital twin technology is considered the next system that will advance further efforts in medical discoveries and improve clinical and public health outcomes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>More than 50 open data, digital identity and API security technologists globally contributed to this whitepaper to answer the following questions:</p>
       
         What are the differences and similarities between different open data ecosystems? 
         Is global interoperability between different ecosystems possible? 
         Who will be driving this movement and what are the use cases motivating them? How will users benefit? 
         How could cross-border use cases work and what “good might look like”? What are the architecture and governance requirements? 
         What can you do if you believe this is the right direction for Open Banking and Open Data?

      <p>The whitepaper offers an overview of the global health sector privacy and security landscape and introduces similar work from outside the health domain with health experts. One key hypothesis we will test is that existing Open Banking and other Open Data standards, like FAPI, could help the health community deliver on their Open Health goals more quickly.</p>

    <blockquote>
       
         A identity standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its implementations. 
         A standard’s value can be measured by the number of instances of certified technical conformance extant in the market. 
         Certified technical conformance is necessary but insufficient for global adoption. 
         Adoption at scale requires widespread awareness, ongoing technical improvement and a open and authoritative reference source. 
         When Libraries/Directories/ Registries act as authoritative sources they amplify awareness, extend adoption and promote certification. 
         Certified technical conformance importantly complements legal compliance and together optimize interoperability. 
         Interoperability enhances security, contains costs and drives profitability.

The OpenID Foundation formed the “<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/">Shared Signals and Events</a>” (SSE) Working Group as a combination of the previous OpenID RISC working group and an informal industry group that was focused on standardizing&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/re-thinking-federated-identity-with-the-continuous-access-evaluation-protocol">Google’s CAEP proposal</a>. These represented two distinct applications of the same underlying mechanism of managing asynchronous streams of events. Therefore the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0-01.html">SSE Framework</a>&nbsp;is now proposed to be a standard for managing such streams of events for any application, not just CAEP and RISC.

One key benefit of the approach proposed in the white paper is that the standards required to enable this network already exist: OpenID Connect and eKYC/IDA.</p>

      <p>The White Paper was a “no logo, pro bono, open source” collaboration of over 150 co-authors including many members of the OpenID Foundation.

<p>Version 3.1 specifications now available</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of two PKCS #11 specifications as OASIS Standards, approved by the members on July 23, 2023.</p>



<p>The OASIS Standards announced today are:<br>– PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1<br>– PKCS #11 Profiles Version 3.1</p>



<p>These PKCS #11 specifications define a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules and smart cards. The API itself is named “Cryptoki” (from “cryptographic token interface” and pronounced as “crypto-key”).<br>– PKCS #11 Specification defines data types, functions and other basic components of the PKCS #11 Cryptoki interface.<br>– PKCS #11 Profiles is intended for developers and architects who wish to design systems and applications that conform to the PKCS #11 Cryptoki standard.</p>

<p>In our time of climate emergency and growing efforts to erode democratic relationships and information ecosystems, perspectives around equity, enjoyment and care help us reimagine futures that nurture and regenerate relationships and natural ecosystems. Below I explore these ideas, proposing some critical positions for looking at technologies (many of which we are cultivating in The Engine Room), which I hope will inspire others and grow like wild herbs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I draw inspiration from feminists from different intersectionalities – indigenous leaders, cyberfeminists, seed keepers, popular educators, linguists and poets – to encapsulate seeds of thought that articulate the direction of efforts in promoting technology decisions and technology systems focused on justice.</p>



<p>Some iridescent sources of inspiration are <a href="https://feministinternet.org/en/principle/environment" title="">the efforts of APC</a>, <a href="https://fondoaccionurgente.org.co/site/assets/files/1433/care_at_the_center_web.pdf" title="">care-centred conversations</a> with colleagues from the Latin American Urgent Action Fund and the Numun Fund, reflections on critical points with Sursiendo and its “<a href="https://archive.org/details/Technoaffections" title="">Technoaffections</a>” initiative, long conversations with friends like <a href="https://pazpena.com/" title="">Paz Peña</a>, and many other sources, like <a href="https://web.facebook.com/coordinadorafeminista8M/videos/cierre-3er-encuentro-plurinacional-de-las-y-les-que-luchan/134664785171969/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr" title="">local gatherings</a> where I have facilitated conversations focused on feminist technologies and <a href="https://www.ariadne-network.eu/green-screen-coalition-awards/" title="">Green Screen Coalition</a>-facilitated conversations on building sustainable and equitable views of internet infrastructure.</p>



 Grounded in the territory 



<p>An understanding of technologies from a feminist perspective takes as its starting point that technology cannot be separated from the territory it exists on. We must consider the materiality of the devices and the internet’s infrastructure. Both of these rely on an extractivist model that is <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Info-Sheet-1_-Intersection-1-_.pdf" title="">thirsty for data</a> and <a href="https://territorios.fondoaccionurgente.org.co/en/" title="">feeds itself with more extractivism</a>. This system has an impact on health (of humans and other living-beings), erodes the land and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Info-Sheet-5_-Intersection-5-_.pdf" title="">creates displacement of peoples</a>.</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, we have <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">documented</a> some of the impacts of big-tech infrastructure and how this impacts communities in <a href="https://www.harvarddesignmagazine.org/articles/shahidul-alam-on-the-majority-world/" title="">the Majority World</a>. In the basin of the area of Chile where I live, for example, the expansion of Google’s and Microsoft’s data centres has diverted scarce local water sources and contaminated local water systems.</p>



<p>In our support to local movements and ecosystems for social justice, we also consider it essential to start from territory and context, and we ask ourselves how the definitions of “local” and “territory” vary between communities, understanding that territory in many cases does not map on to political borders, but to land, natural (for example, the Andean-Amazonian zone), ancestral or cultural environments. This territory can also be the internet.</p>



 Equity as a catalyst 



<p>Along the same lines, the possibility of inhabiting the Internet with enjoyment is facilitated or restricted depending on where you connect from. We have observed – from the experiences and concerns of the communities we support, as well as those of our team members – internet shutdowns and interruptions (whether government-ordered or due to power/network instability) obstructing work, collective organising, advocacy and enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this, we propose technological and information management alternatives that respond to the territory and identities of those who make up the collective; that offer an enjoyable human connection, reduce harm, focus on digital care, and provide tools to increase digital resilience against emergencies, which also reduces stress and strengthens well-being. For example, we have provided our team members with solar panels and chargers and portable power stations where needed in order to facilitate their remote participation, and have organised community calls to share strategies in times of disruption.</p>



 Preserving memory and the seeds of knowledge 



<p>During the pandemic, I attended several sessions organised by the <a href="https://redsemillas.org/" title="">Red de Guardianes de Semillas </a>(Seed Guardians Network), which connects families that protect agrobiodiversity and promote regenerative life systems in Ecuador, within the context of advancing agroindustrial monoculture farming. Guardian initiatives and seed guardians are widespread throughout the lands of America, generally representing ancient roles that were born with agriculture <a href="https://www.estudiospnud.cl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/undp_cl_medioambiente_Guardianas-de-semillas.pdf" title="">twelve thousand years ago</a>. Seeds are protected and inherited, together with the knowledge of how to keep them alive, with the aim of “sowing teachings in the community”.</p>



<p>Following this ancestral model, communities should have the option to choose what knowledge they seek to preserve and communicate among themselves, and through which channels they want to do it. Thus, we highlight and promote initiatives that make it possible to make knowledge and communications fly across borders privately (such as <a href="https://signal.org/" title="">Signal Messenger</a>), and local information management initiatives like Rede Mocambos, a solidarity movement that brings together quilombola communities, indigenous people, artisans and artists to organise <a href="https://baobaxia.mocambos.net/#mocambos/rede/bbx/search/datacenter" title="">community data centres</a>.</p>



<p>We also have promoted and investigated <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/findings-tool-dev/" title="">development of technology projects</a> to preserve collective memory, including through the documentation of human rights violations and the creation of <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/" title="">workflows and open source tools</a> for journalists and human rights defenders to archive valuable digital information.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://uwazi.io/" title="">Uwazi</a>, created and maintained by Huridocs, is one example of these tools. We have worked with a number of organisations to create (and sometimes publish) databases on Uwazi, including <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/dont-reinvent-the-wheel-refine-it/" title="">Japiqay</a>, one of our 2018 intensive-support “Matchbox” partners who used it to create and systematise an extensive database of corruption cases from the last 30 years in Peru.</p>



 Sustaining infrastructures of care 



<p>Maintaining adaptable digital infrastructures is key to the sustainability of movements. Adaptable&nbsp; infrastructures are not only made up of technology and digital information, but also require knowledge management practices, an organisational culture centring learning and adaptability, and a commitment to care and joy in development and maintenance processes.</p>



<p>We know that it is not an easy task to design and re-design a collective, fluid and resilient infrastructure with the multiple bodies, cultures and territories of those who make up a collective. In the ever-relevant path towards creating and sustaining a culture of care, some of the questions we ask ourselves to get closer to sustaining infrastructures are:</p>



 
 How do we learn from our past experiences with technology, and apply the learnings to future decisions? 



 What forms of infrastructure must we adopt so that everyone, with their differences, can fully participate, with special attention to times of power and connectivity interruptions? 



 What systems should be established or strengthened to allow rest, disconnection and well-being? How do you apply a holistic approach to digital security and care? 



 How do we take care of the organisation’s data and the data of the people with whom we work? How can we adopt a care policy that focuses on the collective and not on individualised practices? 



 What are the support networks that we must nurture to express solidarity and mutual support, or seek support when we need it? 



 How do we build adaptability in such a way that infrastructures can flow, and respond to the complexity of our identities and their changes? How do you create an infrastructure that promotes enjoyment for all? 
 



 Maintaining the flame of imagination 



<p>I have always admired the ability of feminisms that maintain the <a href="https://ia601805.us.archive.org/32/items/nos-permitimos-imaginar-web/NosPermitimosImaginar.pdf" title="">ability to dream</a> – despite the passing years, democratic and <a href="https://www.awid.org/resources/impact-fundamentalisms-and-extremisms-cultural-rights-interview-un-special-rapporteur" title="">human rights setbacks</a>, denialism and misinformation resulting in <a href="https://www.icfj.org/news/how-disinformation-fuels-online-violence-storms-targeting-women-journalists" title="">violence</a>. To <a href="https://www.awid.org/2021-festival-in-review" title="">create, resist and transform</a> is sustained as a political act.</p>



<p>Last year, we collected some of the dreams that The Engine Room team members have around what a world with justice-focused technology and data systems could look like. Here we offer a composite of those dreams:&nbsp;</p>



<p>We imagine an internet that builds on interconnection and joint responsibility, instead of individualism and capitalism. That is organised through consent, collaboration and privacy. Where digital platforms and networks primarily work towards community engagement – as and how communities define them. A world where we have time and space to collectively understand that technologies go beyond digital ones, and that these build from the knowledge and strategies that pass from generation to generation. Where we are able to turn off digital systems, and live a full life even if we opt out. A world that is a big playground of possibilities.</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>Open standards can play a significant role in ocean protection. They can facilitate collaboration, interoperability, and transparency among stakeholders and organizations working towards a common goal. In the context of ocean protection, open standards can provide a framework for the development and implementation of sustainable practices and technologies that can help reduce the negative impact of human activities on the marine environment.</p>



<p>Open standards can also facilitate the sharing of data and information related to ocean health, such as water quality, temperature, and biodiversity. Furthermore, open standards can help ensure that ocean protection efforts are inclusive and equitable by allowing for the participation and input of diverse stakeholders, including local communities, indigenous peoples, and small-scale fishers.</p>



<p>Today, they are particularly useful in the field of oceanic sciences, where data interoperability and sharing are critical for advancing scientific research and understanding of the ocean:</p>



 
 NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of open standards for storing and sharing scientific data in a platform-independent manner. 
 



 
 The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) develops and maintains a set of open standards for geospatial data and services. 
 



 
 The Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions provide a set of guidelines for the creation and sharing of climate and forecast data.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Ocean Data View (ODV) is an open-source software tool that provides a platform for visualizing and analyzing oceanographic data. 
 



<p>Scientists may share and combine data more easily utilizing open standards like these, enabling more effective research and understanding of the ocean. A wider number of stakeholders, such as policymakers, the general public, and other researchers, can benefit from access to and transparency of ocean data and research thanks to open standards.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: The idea of Self-Sovereign Identity emerged in 2016, but it has inspirations dating back centuries. This article explores the historic evolution of sovereignty and demonstrates how it can be modeled using approaches from other disciplines, including Living Systems Theory and Ostrom’s Principles. It then dovetails that with the topic of human rights to demonstrate many of the goals of the original advocacy for Self-Sovereign Identity. These are goals that we must reconsider today, to shape a digital future rooted in individual autonomy and human rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christopher Allen is a futurist whose work on the internet highlighting personal agency and privacy dates back to his co-authorship of the TLS spec. He popularized the the term “self-sovereign identity” through his publication of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/27/the-path-to-self-sovereign-identity/">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a> and has continued to support it through the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops</a> and articles such as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/26/self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on/">“Self-Sovereign Identity, Five Years On”</a>. It’s now seven years on: here’s the latest.</p>

 The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>Throughout my professional career, themes of collaboration and trust have remained constant pillars that inform my ventures in the digital world. As a technologist, I have been involved with the development of collaboration and security tools since the inception of the internet and became deeply invested in how these digital spaces can both bolster and challenge traditional systems. My fascination as a software architect with trust has guided me toward understanding the ways in which some concepts of sovereignty, particularly self-sovereignty, unfold within both our physical and digital identities. The convergence of collaboration, trust, and self-sovereignty led to my formulation of <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of Self-sovereign Identity</a> in 2016.</p>

<p>However, I feel that over time some of my original intents for self-sovereign identity have been lost. Though I meant for it to be something that would protect the individual, self-sovereignty doesn’t mean that you are in complete control. It simply defines the borders within which you can make decisions and outside of which you negotiate with others as peers, not as a petitioner.</p>

<p>To help to clarify some of the original goals of self-sovereign identity, I thought that it would be helpful to delve into the origins of those principles and to examine the array of influences that shaped them.</p>

<p>This includes five major areas:</p>

 
   History, which reveals how the idea of sovereignty has evolved. 
   Living Systems Theory, which describes how membranes allow different systems to interact. 
   Ostrom’s Principles, which further define the boundaries of common resources. 
   Feminist Perspectives, which redefine sovereignty as agency, not control. 
   Human Rights &amp; The Governance of the Commons, which detail the intersection between self-sovereign systems and the UN Declaration of Human Rights. 
 

<p>Through this exploration, I aim to describe some of the original goals underlying the self-sovereign principles and to illuminate the importance of self-sovereign identity in our interconnected, digital world.</p>

 A History of Sovereignty 

<p>Any look at the recent concept of self-sovereignty must begin with a look at historic sovereignty, dating back to even before the state-centric model we are familiar with today. It has changed and evolved over time.</p>

<p>During the early Middle Ages, the concept of sovereignty was embodied by lords, who wielded power to give them control over their domains. However, these lords did not exist in isolation; they were part of a complex network of feudal relationships, where power and authority were often negotiated rather than absolute. Vassals pledged fealty to their lords, yet even these bonds were based on mutual obligations. The lord promised protection, and in return, the vassal provided military service and counsel. It was a symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p>As societies underwent transformation, so too did the concept of sovereignty. The rise of cities during the late Middle Ages challenged the power dynamics that had previously been centered around lords and their domains. Independent cities, often organized as city-states, started to emerge as powerful entities. Their sovereignty was asserted not through isolated power but through commerce, diplomacy, and alliances with other cities. Networks of cities created dynamic trade relationships, with goods and information flowing between these different powers.</p>

<p>Jean Bodin wrote about sovereignty in 1576. He saw it as “absolute” and “indivisible”, but nonetheless recognized that it could be passed from one person to another for a limited time. This concept was the foundation of the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years’ War in 1648.</p>

<p>The treaty was a major shift in sovereignty from cities to nations that established the modern concepts of the nation-state and state sovereignty. It marked this significant transition by formalizing the idea of territoriality and non-interference, establishing that each nation was sovereign within its borders. Yet, even then, nations needed to negotiate with each other, reflecting the historical roots of sovereignty in reciprocity and interconnectedness: sovereignty was fluid, rooted in the balance of power between peers with power. It was less about rigid boundaries and more about negotiations and relationships.</p>

<p>This evolution of sovereignty — from lords to cities to nations — offers a historical lens through which we can better understand the principles of self-sovereign identity and its own interconnected world view.</p>

 Living Systems Theory 

<p>The evolution of my ideas for self-sovereign identity goes beyond the traditional context. That began with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_systems">Living Systems Theory (1978)</a>, which struck a deep chord with me from the moment I was first introduced to it, in the mid-80s. It provides a great model for extracting some of the design patterns seen in historic sovereignty.</p>

<p>Living systems theory is a framework that sees the world as an interconnected network of systems. Each living system (such as a single cell, an organism, a social organization, or an ecosystem) is part of a larger system (its environment), and, in turn, is composed of smaller systems (its subsystems). The beauty of this theory lies in its capacity to draw parallels between different levels of organization, making it applicable across a diverse range of fields.</p>

<p>One of the key principles of living systems theory is the concept of the membrane. This is not just a physical barrier but a selective boundary that controls the exchange of energy, matter, and information between the system and its environment. The membrane allows certain things to pass through while restricting others, thereby maintaining the system’s integrity and autonomy. It’s a delicate balancing act: the system must allow enough interaction with the environment to sustain itself while ensuring that it isn’t overwhelmed by external forces.</p>

<p>The concept of the selective membrane is not static; rather, it’s a dynamic entity, constantly adapting and responding to the system’s internal and external changes. This theory is particularly resonant in today’s world, which is characterized by interconnectedness and the continuous negotiation and redefining of boundaries.</p>

<p>It also has obvious parallels to the historic evolution of sovereignty. The symbiotic relationships of peers, cities, or nations all reflect the interdependent relationships in a living system, while the flow of goods that evolved out of the mercantile city-state period demonstrates the movement of objects out of and through the membranes of these independent entities.</p>

<p>More importantly, living systems theory reveals the conception of a sovereign self: a sovereign entity (whether an individual or collective) that like a living systems navigates the balance between maintaining its autonomy and engaging with its environment, including its peers. This is the central foundation of self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Ostrom’s Principles &amp; Living Systems 

<p>Elinor Ostrom’s groundbreaking work on managing common-pool resources was another non-traditional look at sovereignty that offered additional valuable insights to shape my emerging understanding of self-sovereign identity. As the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, in 2009, Ostrom challenged conventional wisdom by showing how local property can be successfully managed by local communities.</p>

<p>Ostrom’s <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html">eight principles</a> for managing a commons provide a blueprint for effective, sustainable communal resource management. They demonstrate that with the right systems in place, communities can manage shared resources equitably and sustainably, without the need for centralized control or privatization.</p>

<p>Her first principle was particularly notable for my self-sovereign work. I paraphrase it as:</p>

 
   Authorized Use. The community of those who have the right to use the common resource is clearly defined. 
   Commons Boundaries. The boundaries of the commons are clearly defined so as to separate the usage rules from the larger environment. 
 

<p>Much like the selective membrane in living systems theory, Ostrom’s principles delineate the boundaries of a common resource, establishing clear rules on who can use the resource and how much they can use. They also call for collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process, responding dynamically to their environment through the membrane of their living system.</p>

<p>Further, Ostrom’s principles recognize the need for effective monitoring, conflict resolution mechanisms, and graduated sanctions for rule violators. These elements can be seen as analogous to the regulatory mechanisms within a living system, ensuring its continued functionality and survival.</p>

<p>Finally, Ostrom’s principles suggest that resource governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises. This reflects the hierarchical organization seen in living systems, where smaller systems exist within larger ones, and each layer is interconnected and interdependent.</p>

<p>In this light, Ostrom’s principles and the living systems theory converge towards a shared understanding: that complex systems, whether they be biological, social, or digital, can effectively self-regulate and sustain themselves when guided by fundamentals that respect their autonomy, uphold their integrity, and recognize their interconnectivity.</p>

 Sovereignty from a Feminist Lens 

<p>One of the important elements of Ostrom’s principles is that they approached sovereignty from a different, more cooperative viewpoint. Ostrom wasn’t alone in that conception. The idea was in the zeitgeist when I was teaching at Bainbridge Graduate Institute in the early ’10s, just before I began writing about self-sovereign identity. More recently, it’s been articulated in a few published articles.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.gendersecurityproject.com/post/exploring-sovereignty-through-a-feminist-lens">“Exploring Sovereignty through a Feminist Lens”</a>, Vaishnavi Pallapothu advocates for more inclusive understandings of sovereignty and for a transition from rigid hierarchical systems to more interconnected and equitable structures — ones that cleave closer to the ideals of a sovereign self.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sovereignty would move beyond the implication of sovereignty as domination, towards sovereignty as the right to individual agency and prosperity.” – <a href="https://www.gendersecurityproject.com/post/exploring-sovereignty-through-a-feminist-lens">Vaishnavi Pallapothu</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This feminist interpretation of sovereignty fundamentally disrupts the power dynamics traditionally associated with sovereignty. Instead of seeing sovereignty as a tool of domination and control, Pallapothu reframes sovereignty as a means of affirming individual agency and prosperity. Moreover, Pallapothu introduces a sense of fluidity and inclusivity to sovereignty, emphasizing the necessity for cooperation and mutual respect between entities, whether they be individuals, communities, or nations.</p>

<p>This focus on the significance of individual agency within a larger system resonates deeply with the principles of self-sovereign identity and also aligns with the dynamics of living systems and with Ostrom’s principles, which stress interdependence and balance rather than domination.</p>

<p>Pallapothu isn’t the only one to offer a more diverse look at sovereignty. Bethany Webster does so too in <a href="https://www.bethanywebster.com/blog/what-is-sovereignty-13-elements/">“The 13 Elements of Sovereignty”</a>, which talks about women’s sovereignty rather than digital sovereignty, but nonetheless is another great additional to the discussion.</p>

<p>These radical departures from traditional writings on sovereignty, by Pallapothu, Ostrom, Webster, and others demonstrate the importance of including women and marginalized groups (and their too-often overlooked contributions) in the discourse around sovereignty.</p>

<p>Building upon all of these insights, my journey into self-sovereign identity began to take shape, giving rise to principles that mirrored this understanding but were adapted to the unique challenges of the digital age.</p>

 The Sovereignty of Self and Human Rights 

<p>The concept of the sovereign self, championed by the feminist viewpoint, intrinsic to living systems theory, and revealed by Ostrom’s principles, connects to a fundamental pillar of human rights. The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, underlines the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all individuals. This aligns with the concept of self-sovereignty, underscoring the individual’s inherent right to autonomy and self-determination.</p>

<p>However, the concept of self-sovereignty is not merely about autonomy; per the Declaration’s promise of “dignity”, self-sovereign identity is also about the recognition of each individual’s unique identity and experiences. It empowers individuals to freely express themselves, to make choices without coercion, and to be treated with respect. Such principles echo the most basic tenets of human rights, promoting equality, freedom, and justice.</p>

<p>These ideals of autonomy, self-determination, dignity, and respect do not exist in isolation. As we’ve seen in living systems theory, every entity is part of a broader network of relationships and exchanges. Likewise, self-sovereignty operates within a societal context, requiring an environment that respects individual agency and fosters mutual respect among all individuals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Human rights are not only violated by terrorism, repression or assassination, but also by unfair economic structures that create huge inequalities.” - Pope Francis (from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/13/jorge-mario-bergoglio-pope-poverty">2013</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, self-sovereignty is closely linked to the broader quest for social justice and equality. It calls for the transformation of societal structures that perpetuate inequality and injustice, highlighting the imperative to ensure that every individual can exercise their right to self-sovereignty.</p>

<p>It is in this societal and human rights context that the importance of self-sovereign identity becomes even more salient. That’s because self-sovereign identity offers a critical framework for asserting individual autonomy and dignity in an increasingly digital world.</p>

<p>It was also within this context that the idea of self-sovereign identity evolved. “The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” was written just in advance of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/#rwot-2-id2020-2016">RWOT2</a>, which was held in coordination with the <a href="https://id2020.org/">ID2020 Summit</a> at the United Nations. Many of the concepts of self-sovereign identity and many of the original discussions focused on ID2020’s requirement that everyone in the world have the ability to prove their identity. This human-rights approach thus remains a vital component of self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Sovereignty in the Digital Era 

<p>Together, all of these philosophies, histories, and other ideas offered a strong foundation for the ideas of self-sovereign identity, but there was also a precipitating event: a change in the internet.</p>

<p>In the early internet era, personal sovereignty was a growing power, supported by developments such as self-hosted UUCP emails, personal domains, and individual blogs. These innovations demonstrated interconnectivity, with information being exchanged across personally controlled digital borders. It challenged the notion of absolute state sovereignty.</p>

<p>But by the start of the ’10s, globalization was rising, and digital services and platforms were being consolidated. The nature of digital sovereignty began to shift: not only did states with “sovereign power” take increased control of the digital world, but so did corporate giants and global digital platforms, which are sometimes called <a href="https://lawexplores.com/sovereignty-or-post-sovereignty-a-social-systems-theoretical-perspective/">post-sovereignty</a></p>

<p>When the once-impermeable membranes of state sovereignty added new non-state parties to their ecosystems, individuals did not have a voice in this renegotiation of terms. Instead, the new parties only negotiated with the older state sovereigns. This resulted in insufficient mutual obligations being offered to individuals — or only obligations under property law. We once again become “serfs”.</p>

<p>People had already been attacking this problem for a while. I participated in the collaborative event that led to the <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1068/988">ASN white paper</a> and that in turn led to the user-centric models that I wrote about in <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, but as I was poking my head back into the identity field starting at IIW 2014, I felt that these approaches had failed because they’d been co-opted by those with centralized power. We needed better answers.</p>

<p>Consequently, I identified a need for sovereignty to manifest at the individual level not only in the real world, but also online. Digital rights needed a model where individuals, much like living systems, had personal boundaries serving as membranes. Individuals needed to become sovereigns too, so that they could negotiate as peers. Human beings needed identity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As digital systems create representations of us, a free society demands that we be given a voice in deciding how those representations are created and used. Not because we own that data, but because individual human beings are the ONLY valid source for that moral authority. Human dignity demands that individuals be treated with respect no matter which system they interact with, face-to-face or online. Without that, we become nothing but data in the machine — entries in a ledger to be managed, problems to be solved, digital serfs. We are not.” – Christopher Allen (2020)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where my knowledge of all those scattered philosophies and ideas began to merge into my early thoughts on self-sovereign identity: individuals are seen as living systems, intertwined with each other and with other layers of systems, each with permeable boundaries serving as their membranes. As in living systems theory, my principles needed to highlight the need for a balance between maintaining individual autonomy and engaging in an interconnected digital world; as in Ostrom’s principles, that balance would be based on strong boundaries and clear rules; and as in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, those rules needed to protect agency and human dignity.</p>

<p>Together all of these ideas shaped my perspective, deeply informed my original ten principles, and influenced my choice to use the term “self-sovereign identity” as a name for them in 2016. But, some of these origins and influences have been lost, and if there is a desire to return to the original intent behind the self-sovereign principles, we must return to these influences as well.</p>

 Join Me in the Conversation 

<p>As we look forward, it’s clear that we must strive for balance: maintaining personal and collective autonomy while also encouraging connection in an increasingly interconnected world. By upholding the principles of self-sovereign identity, and their original intents and influences, I believe we can shape a future that respects and values every individual’s rights and dignity.</p>

<p>In the seven years since their inception, the original ten principles of self-sovereign identity have been widely accepted. However, these principles were never meant to be an endpoint. Rather, they were written as a starting point for a larger discussion on the essence of self-sovereignty and human rights in the digital world. Back in 2016, I wrote that I saw these principles as a “departure point to provoke a discussion about what’s truly important.” Furthermore, I sought assistance in evolving these principles to the next level.</p>

<p>Today, it is apparent that as self-sovereign systems are being deployed in the EU and elsewhere, there’s an urgent need to delve deeper into these principles, to correct misunderstandings and acknowledge legitimate criticisms. This is not about regressing to past ideas but about reconnecting with the foundational spirit that informed them in the first place. It is crucial to learn from both the triumphs and the setbacks of the early adopters of these principles to guide the development of the next generation of self-sovereign identity technologies. The problem is large: we thus need people from a large number of disciplines to ensure that we do self-sovereign technology right and with the humility required for such a massive and important undertaking.</p>

<p>The upcoming Rebooting Web of Trust conference in <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/rwot12/">Cologne, Germany</a>, starting September 18th, presents an excellent platform for this undertaking. I urge you to <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot12-cologne/blob/main/advance-readings/advance-reading-primer.md">contribute advance readings</a> with your own perspectives on self-sovereign idenity or your own constructive questions. These will allow you to participate in the discussions during an event where we can refine and expand the self-sovereign identity principles.</p>

<p>This is my call to action: let’s collaborate together to ensure that the digital future we’re building is rooted in respecting individual sovereignty and the fundamental human rights of all individuals.</p>

Lissi’s Journey in the Metaverse<p>Welcome to Lissi’s Journey in the metaverse! Today, we are investigating the essential role of trust infrastructure in the metaverse. Identity is the very foundation of every social interaction, regardless of where it happens. While the real world gives us humans countless glues to verify the authenticity of people or organisations we interact with, virtual worlds can be constructed, modified and faked with the press of a button. Hence, the ability to verify the authenticity of people, organisations and content is paramount to the success of the metaverse.</p><p>Over the past four years we collaborated with governments, universities and private organisations alike within <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a> to build a common trust infrastructure, which we now want to leverage to create trust in the metaverse. Our primary focus is the integration of user-friendly applications of ID-Wallets and verifiable credentials. The Neosfer Lounge in Decentraland features a dedicated use case track for Lissi, serving as a showcase to underline the practicality and effectiveness of these tools. Finally, we will wrap-up with reflections on the expedition and look into the future steps towards their widespread adoption.</p> ID-Wallet use cases in the Lissi Lounge — by&nbsp;Neosfer <p>The Neosfer Lounge was published at the beginning of 2023 with the objective to showcase relevant projects and investments of the company as well as host the live streaming of the expert talk Between the Towers. You can find the lounge <a href="https://play.decentraland.org/?NETWORK=mainnet&amp;position=-122,26">here</a>. We now expanded the lounge to include a dedicated track for identity use cases. Join Lissi as our protagonist, demonstrating the practical usage of ID-Wallets with the following use&nbsp;cases.</p>You can speak to our project lead Helge in the Lissi&nbsp;Lounge<p>End-user use cases: ID-Wallets are one of the key tools to build trust in the metaverse. These wallets store digital identity credentials of users, such as customer and membership cards or tickets. They can also be used to identify the real world identity of citizens to comply with know your customer (KYC) requirements, given this is required by law e.g. for opening a bank account or receiving consulting services. But the use cases are not limited to end-users.</p><p>Demonstration Case Customer Cards: A seamless onboarding process enables the user to swiftly sign up and begin exploring the Lissi Lounge — by Neosfer using an ID-Wallet app. The simple, secure onboarding process saves time and ensures one can easily authenticate the next time interacting with the&nbsp;company.</p>Easily get your demo customer card by scanning the&nbsp;QR-code<p>Organisational Use cases: How can you ensure a virtual building you enter is actually representing your favourite retailer brand? How can the company ensure that only their own employees can declare themself as company representatives to prevent fraud and phishing? The answer lies in identities for organisations “ORG-IDs” and digital employee passes. We work together with commercial registers and eIDAS qualified trust service providers to issue organisational identities as verifiable credentials to companies.</p>Proof your customer status to our customer service personell<p>The institutional trust we bring to the metaverse serves as corner-stone to enable business driven use cases and trusted interactions. By facilitating reliable identity verification, we move a crucial step towards a trusted and secure metaverse. Using ID-Wallets in the metaverse gives users the required confidence to explore, interact, and transact in the virtual world. The wallets can also help users maintain control over their relationships as well as transparency of their interaction history.</p>Christian from the Neosfer Team as verified Employee behind the bank&nbsp;counter<p>Demonstration Case Employee Pass: Within the Lissi Lounge you might be lucky and encounter a real person behind the service desk.

Hence, the next steps for us is to integrate the credential workflow with real data for the customer cards and build a holistic story for the customer service representatives together with interested partners. While we focused on the technical integration, we now have to pay attention on use case benefits and UX in the second step. This will also include the task to beautify our lounge&nbsp;;)</p>

<p>As technology advances at a rapid pace, proponents of microchip implants for digital identification herald them as the ultimate solution for convenience and security. However, the implementation of microchip implants as a digital ID system raises significant concerns about privacy, autonomy, and potential abuse. This article explores the dangers associated with microchip implants and argues that they are a bad idea for society.</p>



 
 Invasion of Privacy 
 



<p>Microchip implants, when used for digital ID, essentially turn individuals into walking databases. These chips store personal information, including biometric data and other sensitive details. By integrating such extensive information into a tiny implant, individuals risk becoming vulnerable to privacy breaches and hacking attempts.</p>



<p>Hackers and malicious actors could exploit these microchips to gain unauthorized access to personal information, financial data, and even the ability to track individuals’ movements. As we have witnessed in the past, no system is entirely hack-proof, and the introduction of microchips into our bodies only exacerbates these concerns.</p>



 
 Loss of Autonomy 
 



<p>Adopting microchip implants for digital ID could lead to a loss of personal autonomy. The moment we accept a chip inside our bodies, we hand over control to a system or authority. Such dependence can become precarious, allowing external entities to manipulate our lives, access our data, and possibly even dictate our actions.</p>



<p>In cases where the digital ID is mandated by governments or corporations, refusal to accept the implant might lead to discrimination, exclusion, or limited access to basic services. This coercion to conform infringes upon personal rights and freedom of choice, effectively transforming citizens into passive subjects of surveillance and control.</p>



 
 Ethical and Social Concerns 
 



<p>Microchip implants for digital ID raise significant ethical questions. The prospect of embedding technology inside our bodies blurs the line between humans and machines, potentially reducing individuals to mere data points. This human-machine integration poses a fundamental challenge to our understanding of what it means to be human and how we relate to technology.</p>



<p>Moreover, the adoption of microchip implants may exacerbate existing societal inequalities. Low-income individuals might face barriers to access or be disproportionately affected by a system that favors those who can afford the technology. This could deepen the digital divide, further marginalizing the most vulnerable members of society.</p>



 
 Security Risks and Control 
 



<p>Relying solely on microchip implants for digital ID concentrates power and control in the hands of a select few. Governments or corporations could exploit this control to manipulate public opinion, restrict movement, or even implement social engineering techniques. The potential for mass surveillance raises grave concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and individual rights.</p>



<p>Furthermore, this centralized approach to identity verification presents a single point of failure. If the system experiences a massive breach or a malfunction, it could cause widespread chaos and disruption. Relying on such a fragile system for something as crucial as personal identity is an unnecessary risk that our society should not be willing to take.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>While the concept of microchip implants for digital ID may seem innovative and convenient at first glance, the associated risks far outweigh any potential benefits. The invasion of privacy, loss of autonomy, ethical concerns, and security risks make microchip implants a bad idea for society as a whole. Instead, we should focus on developing alternative solutions that protect privacy, uphold individual autonomy, and bridge the digital divide without compromising our core values and freedoms.</p>

<p>As part of our efforts around <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/mapping-digital-resilience-challenges-in-social-justice-organisations-learnings-from-our-partners/" title="">mapping digital resilience trends, challenges and opportunities</a>, we’ve seen the impact that digital rights threats can have on civil society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, internet shutdowns have become a pertinent issue, particularly during elections. In 2022, the #KeepItOn coalition tracked <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/campaign/keepiton/" title="">187 internet shutdowns in 35 countries</a>. Populations that have recently been on the receiving end of a shutdown during an election include those of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-internet-rights-trfn/100-hours-in-the-dark-how-an-election-internet-blackout-hit-poor-ugandans-idUSKBN29P1V8" title="">Uganda and</a> <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/belarusian-election-tainted-by-internet-shutdown-and-state-sponsored-violence/" title="">Belarus</a>.</p>



<p>An internet shutdown is the <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-and-elections-handbook/" title="">intentional disruption of internet or electronic communications, rendering them inaccessible or effectively unusable, for a specific population or within a location, often to exert control over the flow of information</a>. Shutdowns can last for hours, days, or even weeks, and they often occur during politically sensitive periods, such as elections.&nbsp;The purpose of these shutdowns is often to control the narrative and limit public dissent. Sometimes they’re also used with the purported goal of preventing the spread of false information; however, it’s important to keep in mind who has the power to determine what information is ‘false’.</p>



<p>During a shutdown, citizens are unable to communicate with each other, access critical information (which negatively impacts their ability to make informed decisions), or hold their government to account. This leads to a significant decline in transparency, accountability, and ultimately the democratic process.</p>



<p>Internet shutdowns are a critical threat to internet freedom. International human rights law recognises the right to access information and freedom of expression as a fundamental human right, and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2022/08/activists-internet-shutdowns-violate-human-rights" title="">governments that impose internet shutdowns during elections violate these rights.</a> However, some governments are permitted by national laws and regulations to impose internet shutdowns during elections, citing public safety and security concerns.</p>



 Resources for staying online during internet shutdowns&nbsp; 



<p>By promoting digital capacity and encouraging the use of alternative and secure communication channels, we can strengthen digital resilience and minimise the impact of internet shutdowns on democratic processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are some resources and inspiration of work being done in these areas – with a reminder that developing strategies to respond to internet freedom threats should always be politically, socially and technically contextualised, timely, and, if possible, consulted through a local expert.</p>



 
 <a href="https://devex.shorthandstories.com/how-3-african-activists-are-combating-internet-shutdowns/index.html" title="">Activists in Ethiopia, Sudan and Nigeria are standing up against internet shutdowns</a> in their countries.&nbsp;
 
 In Ethiopia, the <a href="https://www.cardeth.org/" title="">Center for Advancement of Rights and Democracy</a> are attempting to insert digital literacy programs into the existing education curriculum.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.beamreports.com/" title="">Beam Reports</a> in Sudan are doing so by organising workshops and advocacy campaigns.&nbsp; 



 At <a href="https://www.connecthubng.org/" title="">Connect Hub NG</a> in Nigeria, the team is similarly trying to combat shutdowns by building awareness around human rights, democracy, and freedom of expression.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 



 
 For guidance on digital tools, see this list of <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/blackouts-five-ways-to-stay-online/" title="">five ways to stay online during government shutdowns</a> published by restofworld.org. The list recommends, among other things (keeping in mind that some of these tools are illegal in some countries, so make sure to check their legal status in your context beforehand):
 
 Using a&nbsp;trusted VPN provider to allow access to sites and platforms that may be blocked in your country (this should be set up in advance!).&nbsp; 



 A TOR Browser to protect your privacy.&nbsp; 



 Platforms that function via a local mesh network that allow users to send encrypted messages to people nearby via Bluetooth.&nbsp; 
 
 
 



 
 AccessNow has also shared recommendations around <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/ways-circumvent-internet-shutdown-democratic-republic-congo/" title="">browsing securely and using circumvention tools</a>. Extensions such as <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" title="">HTTPS Everywhere</a> ensures that you access websites only via encrypted connections (if the website offers this – most reputable news sites should) and proxy tools such as Lantern, which reroute your requests through other computers, may help you browse more securely and privately.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Further key resources to learn more about internet shutdowns include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 AccessNow’s <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-and-elections-handbook/" title="">Internet Shutdowns and Elections Handbook</a>.&nbsp; 



 AccessNow’s <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/2023-elections-and-internet-shutdowns-watch/" title="">Election Watch 2023</a>, which provides information on elections at risk of internet shutdowns in 2023. 



 Internews’ <a href="https://internews.org/resource/defending-the-internet-with-data/" title="">Defending the Internet with Data</a>, which provides information on its <a href="https://preparepreventresist.org/" title="">OPTIMA Resource Library</a> (which in turn maps existing resources and identifies gaps).&nbsp;

 This year one of our main strategic pillars is to bundle our open-source technology stack into commercial products that are simple to adopt, easy to use, and create material business value for the companies in our ecosystem (and the energy transition at&nbsp;large).  GP4BTC Certification Platform   Green Proofs for Bitcoin is a first-of-its-kind leadership initiative to promote transparency and decarbonization in the bitcoin mining industry. In May we released the <a href="https://gp4btc.org/">GP4BTC registry and platform</a>, which is the first production offering built with the recently released <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions-green-proofs/">EW Green Proofs</a> solution.  <p>New features&nbsp;include:</p>  Bitcoin miners can now <a href="https://miner.gp4btc.org/login">apply for certification</a>,(read more about how the registry works&nbsp;here).  Institutions interested in working with sustainable bitcoin miners can now <a href="https://explorer.gp4btc.org/explorer">explore the certification data here</a> or learn more about potential use cases&nbsp;<a href="https://gp4btc.org/for-institutions/">here</a>.   Digital Spine Public&nbsp;Release   In July we released the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/energywebdevhubgmbh1670375546257.ewf-data-exchange-client-gateway">Digital Spine Integration Client on Azure Marketplace</a>, in tandem with a public message broker. The Digital Spine is a reference implementation of our Data Exchange solution that helps electricity market participants communicate information about distributed energy resources at scale. Originally developed in support of <a href="https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2023/project-edge-der-data-hub-lessons-learnt-final-june-2023.pdf?la=en">Project EDGE</a>, the Digital Spine was previously made available as an <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-releases-digital-spine-toolkit-to-the-public-e65847d468dd">open-source toolkit</a> which required participating organizations to manually configure and deploy multiple components. The Digital Spine is primarily intended to streamline coordination among grid operators and electricity market participants, but any company working with DER or EV can potentially get value from the Digital Spine solution.  <p>A number of new features are now available:</p>  With this release, we are now offering a Digital Spine under a software-as-a-service model featuring a public message broker that companies can integrate with by installing a Client Gateway through an Azure subscription. Once integrated, companies can leverage three preconfigured data exchange applications or customize their own applications tailored to specific business needs. Full details are available in this <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/solutions-2023/data-exchange/use-cases-and-reference-implementations/digital-spine-for-electricity-markets/digital-spine-integration-client-deployment-guide-from-azure-marketplace">user guide on&nbsp;Gitbook</a>.  Existing member organizations can access the Client for free as a benefit of their membership.  Non-members can use the DSI Client and EW-hosted message broker on a limited free trial&nbsp;basis.   Validator Node As-a-Service   In June we announced a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.zeeve.io/">Zeeve</a>, a leading Web3 infrastructure-as-a-service platform provider, to integrate the <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/ew-dos-technology-components-2023/trust-layer-energy-web-chain">Energy Web Chain</a> with Zeeve’s enterprise-grade infrastructure stack.

<p>DIF recently sat down with Pakorn Leesakul, the CEO and Founder of Finema, and his innovation Manager Nuttawut Kongsuwan, to learn more about their decentralized identity platform and how they have been impacting the Southeast Asia region. Finema has been driving adoption within Thai government agencies and through the development of a decentralized identity ecosystem including the Thailand Blockchain Services Infrastructure inspired by the EBSI, (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure) and the development of a standard for digital wallets in Thailand, based on the European digital wallet. Watch the entire interview at <a href="https://youtu.be/FJbl8_LSsGk?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://youtu.be/FJbl8_LSsGk</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>LIMARI: I'm also curious to hear more about your user adoption journey. What were some of the challenges that you confronted when you were getting your platform adopted by the government? Were there challenges with interoperability that you confronted, that you overcame? I would be interested to hear more about that.</p>
<p>PAKORN: I can share about some of our customers like the Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA) under the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society of Thailand.  That’s a big pilot project called the ETDA SSI Project. We helped them build their whole infrastructure of SSI.  We came up with a use case for them on medical and educational certificates. We also worked with the Ministry of Commerce to help them issue their digital certificate attestation.</p>
<p>Another one is from (NBTC) National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission. That’s another client that we helped to create a platform to register and issue digital certificates for licensing.</p>
<p>LIMARI: How have you been able to integrate what you're doing with decentralized identity with the existing technology at the government agencies you’re working with?</p>
<p>PAKORN: It’s all about the discussion of verifiable credentials.  Educate them, that if you have any document on your system, if you're issuing it in the form of verifiable credentials you can be interoperable with other government departments. It’s not a PDF, it's a new generation of a file that you can interop with and you can verify between one another.</p>
<p>We focused on that when we approached the government agencies. I think we talked about verifiable credentials for almost six years, since we set up this company. We helped the Ministry of Digital economy to introduce the verifiable credential open standard in the Thai language. How to use this kind of standard, what is the use case, where it's beneficial, and then, a lot of people became excited about it and tried to implement verifiable credentials here in Thailand.</p>
<p>LIMARI: One thing I'm very curious about is also the discussion of decentralized identifiers, because I know this is a concept that can be a little bit more challenging for people to grasp who are not familiar with decentralized identity. Is that a discussion that you've also broached with people in the government layers about being able to get into maybe the details of decentralized identifiers?</p>
<p>NUTTAWUT: I think that's one of the reasons why we work closely with the main regulator in Thailand to issue standards. Once we had national standards, then it has created awareness in the public about the technology.</p>
<p>We also try to drive the ecosystem in Thailand. In the recent year we have seen a lot of interest of other organizations as compared to years ago. Six years ago we were pretty much the only organization in Thailand talking about this space. In the past one or two years we have seen multiple companies popping up and using similar technology.</p>
<p>LIMARI: Wow, that's amazing. So it sounds like it's really taking off.</p>
<p>PAKORN: We are very happy to see other people figure out the things that we share and then everyone tries to come up with an open standard. That’s what we’re really happy about.</p>
<p>LIMARI: That brings me to my final question, which is, what is the vision for Finema? Where do you see things going? How do you see Finema changing the way we're going to do things in the future?</p>
<p>PAKORN: I think here in the Southeast Asia region, it's not easy to sell a product about decentralized identity. They have to come up with the whole solution. You have to take care of the existing system they have, meaning you build a custom system for them, and then deliver your product inside of this. You can do that, or you can influence them to do something like that. After you have many departments use your product, we can influence them to make something interoperable between each other department. That's the strategy for the government in Thailand.</p>
<p>For me, my mission is not only for Thailand. We focus on the Southeast Asia region like Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, to copy some use cases that we implemented, and had success with in Thailand to approach local partners in these countries and let them bring this to their government departments. That’s the mission. Let’s think about if we can take something like the consular department here in Thailand and consular department in Singapore and we create a bilateral policy of using digital passports on a mobile phone instead of a physical passport. Then a Singaporean and Thai can fly over with their mobile phone.</p>
<p>That’s the vision of our company. We want to help government to transform any citizen service. It’s all about citizen service, because we have the strength in digital identity, how to onboard users, how to maintain the private key verification and authentication. In all the projects we involve ourselves in, it's all about citizen service.</p>
<p>NUTTAWUT: I’d like to add on that as well, so what Leesakul just mentioned is the company vision. I can add, the innovation team’s vision at Finema as well. So currently we’re working on a decentralized organization identity. We are developing a prototype for issuing.<br>
legal entity identity as a verifiable credentials, so that legal representatives of organizations can typically prove that they really represent the organization and get the authority from the person who, legally by that jurisdiction to give the power or the authority to the representative to represent that organization.</p>
<p>LIMARI: Thank you both of you for joining me today for this member spotlight. it's been really eye opening to learn more about Finema and I hope to intersect both of you again soon.</p>

<p>15-day public review ends August 18th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) TC are pleased to announce that Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) Version 2.1.0 Errata 01 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>Software developers use a variety of tools to assess the quality of their programs. These tools can report results on qualities such as validity, security, performance, compliance with legal requirements, etc. To form an overall picture of program quality, developers often need to aggregate the results produced by all of these tools, a task made difficult when each tool produces output in a different format.</p>



<p>SARIF defines a standard format for the output of static analysis tools in order to:<br>– Comprehensively capture the range of data produced by commonly used static analysis tools.<br>– Reduce the cost and complexity of aggregating the results of various analysis tools into common workflows.<br>– Represent analysis results for all kinds of programming artifacts, including source code and object code.</p>



<p>This publication includes:<br>– The errata, in the form of a list of changes. (sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-csd01)<br>– The OASIS Standard with the errata changes applied and highlighted. (sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-csd01-redlined)<br>– The OASIS Standard with the errata changes applied, and not redlined. (sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-csd01-complete)<br>– The SARIF v2.1.0 JSON schemas.</p>

<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p>Since the mid 2010s, chatbots and automated tools have grown in usage and popularity across the humanitarian sector; there has, however, been little published on collective successes, risks and trade-offs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From October 2022–February 2023 we explored the tradeoffs, risks and potential benefits of chatbot use in humanitarian contexts, with support from the IFRC and Global Disaster Preparedness Centre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report looks at the types of chatbots that have been used by humanitarian and civil society organisations, the rationales for their introduction, and the implementation challenges faced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It includes a set of considerations to guide chatbot design and to help organisations assess whether or not a chatbot is an appropriate tool for their specific programmatic needs and for the needs of the communities they aim to serve.&nbsp;</p>



 Findings and recommendations&nbsp; 



<p>Our findings indicate a need for organisations to proceed with caution when considering implementing chatbots in a humanitarian context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our research, we came across a number of cases where implementation and efficacy were stymied by contextual challenges; we also saw that the amount of work required to effectively incorporate chatbot technology can be significant, and requires considering data privacy best practices, user expectations, cultural and situational contexts, maintenance costs and staffing, and the continued need for human interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can read more about our learnings <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/five-considerations-for-humanitarians-before-designing-adopting-chatbots/" title="">on our blog</a>, and we also recommend exploring <a href="https://blog.chayn.co/why-chayn-took-down-its-chatbot-in-2020-and-what-weve-learned-about-culturally-aware-chatbots-a9587cf80df8" title="">Chayn’s report on their chatbot implementation</a> for a close-up look at the significant challenges facing responsible and effective chatbot use.</p>



<p>We hope this report, and the work of others, sparks continued research and conversation over the role of automated tools in humanitarian contexts and ethical design practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Celebrating a Fantastic Time <p>We had an incredible time at the Badge Summit, where the spirit of Open Recognition was at its vibrant best! 🌈 The event brought together a swell of awesome community members who wholeheartedly embraced the power of recognising lifewide learning beyond traditional boundaries.</p><p>From the engaging pre-conference webinars to the unconference workshops and spontaneous house parties, the summit was a whirlwind of inspiring discussions.</p> 🫡 What we stand&nbsp;for cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Open recognition is the original innovation of badges, and it’s the reason technology was pushed towards making decentralised recognition possible. The intention of this community to make learning accessible to marginalised groups also comes into this innovation. A tool is only a tool, it’s the way we use it that makes a difference.</p><p>This community is committed to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">advocating for learners</a>. We work&nbsp;on:</p>  Coalition Building: Empowering people who want to use Open Recognition  Community Building: Reach people who are uneasy about top-down credentials  Building Capacity for Advocacy: Help the community promote and champion Open Recognition  Community Organising: Celebrating people, giving them tools to help in their individual contexts  Communications and Messaging: Providing an understandable story and reusable assets for and with the community   🚀 Rocket fuel for collaboration <p>In our various sessions, we had the opportunity to push a number of community conversations forward. Three key advancements coming out of the Badge&nbsp;Summit</p>  The establishment of a recognised body within the USA that allows community members to go after funding for projects specifically related to Open Recognition. Led by Justin Mason and Krystal Rawls, we’re sure we’ll be hearing a lot more about the tentatively named L.O.R.E.&nbsp;soon.  Further specification around An Open Recognition Toolkit. <a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/open-recognition-modus-operandi/3bb09d51-0133-46af-b6f4-0eff21cda647">The community identified the need</a> for a package of resources before the Badge Summit and took the in-person time to further define what it is. Stella Porto and Philippe Petitqueux led the discussion, and we’ll work together to figure out what’s&nbsp;next.  The welcoming of new community members! Oh geez, what an incredible and inspirational group of people we had the pleasure of meeting at the Badge Summit. Obviously there are too many to mention, but thank you to those who have taken the next step and <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">joined the community here</a>!   🏅Get your&nbsp;badge!

 Transcripts now available for all episodes! <p>We’re excited to bring you some news about our podcast, <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast">The Tao of WAO</a>. If you’ve been following us, you’ll know we’ve recently released Season 6, where we’ve discussed all things related to cooperatives and the future of&nbsp;work.</p><p>Our final two episodes of the season are a deep-dive into the knowledge and insights we’ve gained over seven years of operating our worker co-op, <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open</a>. The conversation between our members is filled with a mixture of hard-earned wisdom and thought-provoking ideas that we’re keen to share with&nbsp;you.</p><p>In addition to the new content, we’ve made some changes to enhance the accessibility of our podcast. We’re delighted to announce that <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">all episodes</a> now feature transcripts, thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-belshaw/">Ben Belshaw</a>. He’s worked efficiently, creating and updating web pages and using <a href="https://sonix.ai">Sonix.ai</a> to help with create the transcripts. Since we’ve used AI, please do note that our transcripts are imperfect! If you find something you think we should update, do <a href="https://mastodon.social/@weareopencoop">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p><p>By adding transcripts to our podcast, we are taking steps towards making The Tao of WAO more inclusive, ensuring all members of our community can engage with our content. It’s also useful if you want to quote a section, as <a href="https://anne-hilliger.de/">Anne</a> recently needed to for her thesis. You can find the transcripts on our <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop">Learn with WAO</a> website, while the podcast remains available on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao">SoundCloud</a> and all the usual podcast platforms.</p><p>Looking ahead, we’re preparing for Season 7, focusing to some extent on the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Further out on the horizon we’re planning to delve into the future of new literacies, such as media literacy and AI literacy. We wrote about this season in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shaping-media-literate-society-exploring-future-landscape/">Shaping a Media Literate Society: Exploring the Future Landscape of Media and Information Literacy</a>. If you’d like to preview some of that work, visit our project page at <a href="https://ailiteracy.fyi/">ailiteracy.fyi</a>.</p><p>We’re delighted with these improvements and plans for upcoming seasons, and we’d love to hear your thoughts.

<p>Korea SIG<br>
The Korea SIG met for the first time on 19th July in the city of Busan, designated a Blockchain Special Zone by the Korean Government.</p>
<p>The Kickoff event was held in conjunction with the Self-Sovereign Identity Technology Project, initiated in the first half of 2023 by the Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology (ICT).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Standardization committee members, professors, and industry officials gathered at the event. DIF was introduced, together with the specifications-compliant stacks being discussed at DIF, and the wider ecosystem DIF operates within.</p>
<p>The topic of a Legal Identity Issuance and Verification Framework for Decentralized Identifiers was introduced in preparation for further discussions at upcoming meetings, with a presentation on the topic from Professor Kim Hyun-il of Kongju University, generating considerable interest and questions.</p>
<p>In Korea, Decentralized Identity demonstration projects are ongoing every year, creating various application cases, but it is true that progress on technology standardization has been slow. Accordingly, DIF Korea SIG agreed to explore and further understand DIF's technology specifications and stacks through periodic meetings, contribute to the standardization of Decentralized Identity technology, and discover exemplary application cases to which DIF specifications will be applied already this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next meeting of the Korea SIG will take place on 14 September at Yongsan Army Hall, hosted by the Korea Institute of Information Security &amp; Cryptology, when DIF will be introduced at the Next Generation Authentication Research Group Workshop 2023</p>
<p>New DIF developer advocates<br>
DIF welcomes Mostafa Nagy and Pratap Mridha as Volunteer Developer Advocates. Mostafa helped to recruit a number of participants for the recent successful did:hack event and both advocates will help recruit participants for a series of upcoming hackathons.</p>

 <a href="https://identity.foundation/Hospitality-and-Travel-SIG/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Hospitality and Travel SIG</a> 
<p>The Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG is hard at work on a decentralized traveller profile and schema which we hope will attract broad interest and participation from the Hospitality &amp; Travel community.</p>
<p>Traveller information is today locked into narrow silos controlled by competing interests all of whom claim to own the customer. No effective data sharing arrangements exist between those parties, preventing traveller information from flowing with the traveller in transit.</p>
<p>While much of the interaction between travel and identity communities has to date been denominated by discussions around border crossing, credentials and trust, SSI offers equal opportunity for traveller experience improvement within the airport and downstream into transport, accommodation, and tourism. Collectively, we describe the targeted outcome as a seamless traveller journey.</p>
<p>Central to unlocking this opportunity is adoption of a common traveller profile and preferences.</p>
<p>The H&amp;T SIG is hoping to use the DIF collaborative process to allow the widest participation in the schema definition and creation.</p>
<p>*The Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG meets each Thursday 10 AM Eastern time for 1 hour</p>
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-IoT/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">📻 IoT SIG</a>

 15. DIAM Identity Odyssey: Journey through the Evolving Ecosystem of Empowerment — Unlocking the Boundless Benefits&nbsp;Within! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction: <blockquote>The DIAM identity ecosystem is a dynamic and evolving landscape that revolutionizes how identities are managed and shared. This article provides an in-depth exploration of the burgeoning DIAM identity ecosystem and the myriad benefits it brings to businesses and individuals alike.</blockquote> The Concept of Identity Ecosystem <p>Our DIAM identity ecosystem encompasses a network of interconnected entities, individuals, and systems that collaborate to enable seamless and secure identity management. It fosters a decentralized, trust-based environment where users have greater control over their identities and&nbsp;data.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in the Ecosystem <p>At the heart of the DIAM identity ecosystem lies the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI). SSI empowers individuals with ownership of their identity data, granting them the freedom to choose when, how, and with whom to share specific attributes, ensuring unparalleled privacy and&nbsp;control.</p> Decentralized Identity Providers <p>Within our DIAM identity ecosystem, decentralized identity providers play a pivotal role. These entities issue verifiable credentials and act as trusted sources for identity verification, significantly reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries.</p> Interoperability and Standardization <p>Our identity ecosystem thrives on interoperability and standardization. Prominent standards like W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) ensure seamless integration across different platforms, fostering a cohesive and interconnected identity&nbsp;network.</p> Expanding Opportunities for Businesses and&nbsp;Users <p>The DIAM identity ecosystem unlocks a plethora of opportunities for businesses and individuals. Enhanced security, streamlined onboarding processes, reduced friction in digital interactions, and improved customer experiences are some of the benefits that await adopters.</p> Trust and Efficiency in Digital Transactions <p>By providing verifiable and tamper-proof identity data, our identity ecosystem establishes a high level of trust in digital transactions. This trust leads to increased efficiency, reduced fraud, and enhanced business integrity.</p> Strengthening KYC and AML Processes <p>We offer robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) capabilities. Verifiable credentials streamline KYC procedures, enabling businesses to meet compliance requirements more efficiently and securely.</p> Privacy-Preserving Customer&nbsp;Insights <p>Through our DIAM identity ecosystem, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer behaviour and preferences while respecting privacy. The ecosystem empowers users to consent to data sharing, creating a win-win scenario for businesses and customers.</p> Seamless Cross-Border Identity Verification <p>Our identity ecosystem breaks down geographical barriers, facilitating seamless cross-border identity verification.

 14. DIAM Fort Knox: Safeguarding Your Digital Frontier — Unveiling the Impenetrable Security and Privacy&nbsp;Armor! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction: <blockquote>In an era defined by digital interconnectedness, safeguarding security and privacy has become paramount. As we navigate the virtual landscapes of our lives, Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM) emerges as a guiding light, transforming how we interact with our digital personas while elevating security and privacy to unprecedented heights.</blockquote><p>This comprehensive article will help us deep dive into DIAM’s multifaceted security and privacy features delves into the bedrock upon which the architecture is built, unraveling the intricate layers that redefine our digital experiences.</p> The Pillars of Security: Encryption and Decentralization <p>At the heart of DIAM’s fortress lie two foundational pillars: encryption and decentralization.</p> Encryption: Shielding the Citadel of Identity&nbsp;Data <p>Central to DIAM’s security architecture is the impregnable shield of encryption. By converting sensitive identity data into an indecipherable code, encryption stands guard, ensuring that confidential information remains veiled from prying eyes, whether in transit or at&nbsp;rest.</p><p>In the digital realm, data is a prized possession, and encryption emerges as the guardian that ensures its sanctity. The process of encryption involves converting plain text into a cipher text using complex algorithms. This encrypted data is nearly impossible to decipher without the corresponding decryption key. As a result, even if unauthorized entities gain access to the encrypted data, they cannot make sense of it without the necessary decryption mechanism.</p><p>For DIAM, encryption goes beyond a mere safeguard. It’s a fundamental philosophy that upholds the sanctity of individual identity attributes. Whether it’s your biometric data, personal identifiers, or financial credentials, encryption ensures that your information remains private and inaccessible to anyone without authorized access.</p> Decentralization: Shattering the Chains of Vulnerability <p>Traditional centralized systems house a single point of failure, rendering them vulnerable to breaches. DIAM’s revolutionary architecture shatters this vulnerability by decentralizing identity management across a network of nodes, significantly diminishing the potential impact of a security&nbsp;breach.</p><p>In centralized systems, all identity data is stored within a central repository. This centralized storage, while convenient, poses a significant risk. If a hacker gains access to this central repository, they can potentially compromise the entire system and access a vast amount of sensitive information. The decentralized approach embraced by DIAM disperses this data across multiple nodes, making it virtually impossible for any single point of entry to grant unauthorized access to the entirety of a user’s identity information.</p><p>Imagine a world where each node acts as a guardian of a fragment of your identity. No single node possesses a comprehensive picture of who you are; rather, they collectively safeguard the pieces of your identity puzzle. Even if one node is compromised, the intruder gains access to only a fraction of your identity, limiting the potential damage and minimizing the risk of a catastrophic breach.</p> Empowering Individuals through Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI) <p>Empowerment takes center stage within DIAM’s design, epitomized by the concept of self-sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI).</p> Selective Sharing: Orchestrating the Symphony of&nbsp;Privacy <p>In the realm of DIAM, users wield the baton of selective sharing, conducting a symphony of privacy. Through SSI, individuals can selectively disclose relevant identity attributes, cementing their control over the information they share and amplifying their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The traditional model of identity sharing follows a binary approach: you either share all or nothing. For instance, when you provide your identification to a service, you expose all your identity attributes, even if the service only requires a subset of them. This overexposure creates a privacy gap, leaving users vulnerable to unnecessary data collection and&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>SSI sweeps away this antiquated model, offering a new paradigm where users retain the sovereignty to reveal only what’s essential. Picture a scenario where you’re interacting with a service that requires your age verification. Instead of revealing your full birthdate, SSI empowers you to share only the fact that you’re above a certain age, without exposing the exact date. This level of selective sharing ensures that service providers receive the necessary information for their functions without accessing more than they&nbsp;need.</p> Elevating Trust through Zero-Knowledge Proofs&nbsp;(ZKPs) <p>DIAM’s arsenal is fortified by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic masterpiece that authenticates identity attributes without compromising data privacy. This innovative approach ensures that trust and authentication can coexist without infringing on individual privacy.</p><p>Imagine a scenario where you need to prove your identity to access a service, but you’re hesitant to reveal all the details. Enter ZKPs, a cryptographic marvel that enables you to prove a statement’s validity without revealing the actual data behind it. This process operates like a magic trick, where you prove you possess specific information without actually divulging that information.</p><p>For instance, consider a situation where you want to prove you’re over 18 years old without disclosing your birthdate. ZKPs allow you to share a “proof” that verifies your age without revealing the specific birthdate. The verifier receives confirmation that your age meets the requirement without gaining access to unnecessary information.</p> Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Anchors of Digital&nbsp;Trust <p>Enter Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), cryptographic keys that serve as the anchors of trust within the DIAM framework. Immutable and verifiable, DIDs instill confidence in the digital realm, laying the groundwork for secure interactions.</p><p>In the digital landscape, trust is often hard to come by. The internet is replete with instances of identity theft, data breaches, and fraudulent activities. Establishing trust within this environment requires a revolutionary approach — one that transcends traditional methods.</p><p>DIDs emerge as the answer to this predicament. Think of them as the digital counterparts of a physical identification document. However, unlike physical documents that can be forged or duplicated, DIDs are unique, cryptographic representations that are nearly impossible to replicate.</p><p>Every individual, business, or entity in the DIAM ecosystem possesses a DID — a virtual passport, if you will. When someone presents a DID, it’s akin to presenting an unforgeable badge of authenticity. DIDs are linked to public keys, allowing anyone to verify their validity. This cryptographic link ensures that the presented DID corresponds to a legitimate entity, eliminating the possibility of identity&nbsp;fraud.</p> Fortifying the Gates with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) <p>In the age of DIAM, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) stands as a formidable guardian, fortifying access to the digital domain. By demanding multiple forms of verification, MFA creates an impervious shield against unauthorized entry.</p><p>We live in an era where the password’s effectiveness has waned. The sheer number of passwords we juggle across various platforms makes it challenging to maintain strong, unique passwords for each account. Hackers exploit this vulnerability, leveraging techniques like brute force attacks and phishing to breach accounts.</p><p>MFA revolutionizes this scenario by introducing an additional layer of defense. Instead of relying solely on passwords, MFA requires users to provide multiple proofs of identity. This could include something you know (like a password), something you have (like a smartphone or security token), and something you are (like biometric data).</p><p>Imagine you’re logging into an online portal. With MFA enabled, the system not only requires your password but also sends a verification code to your smartphone. Only after you enter the correct code can you access your account. Even if someone manages to obtain your password, they would still need your smartphone or security token to breach the&nbsp;account.</p> Blockchain: The Immutable Keystone of Data Integrity <p>DIAM’s architecture is bolstered by the unyielding foundation of blockchain technology. This immutable ledger guarantees data integrity, fortifying the veracity of identity information and transactions.</p><p>In a world plagued by data manipulation and falsification, blockchain emerges as the incorruptible sentinel. Unlike traditional databases susceptible to unauthorized alterations, blockchain records information in a series of interconnected blocks. Once information is recorded within a block, it’s virtually impossible to alter or erase. This immutability safeguards the authenticity of data, ensuring that identity attributes and transactions remain tamper-proof.</p><p>Imagine you’re interacting with a financial institution. Traditional systems require you to trust the institution’s database, which can be manipulated by those with access. With blockchain, your interactions are recorded in a transparent and unalterable ledger. This means that no party can alter the records, and all transactions are traceable and verifiable.</p> Access Control and Consent Mechanisms: Crafting a Symphony of&nbsp;Privacy <p>DIAM’s innovative canvas extends to access control and consent mechanisms, allowing individuals to orchestrate who can access their identity attributes and under what circumstances. This symphony of privacy enhances personal data ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>In the digital age, granting access to personal data is akin to providing the key to your digital kingdom. Unauthorized access can lead to identity theft, data breaches, and a host of privacy violations. Access control emerges as the sentinel at this gateway, dictating who can cross the threshold and under what conditions.</p><p>Imagine you’re sharing your identity information with a service provider. Access control mechanisms empower you to set specific rules for this interaction. You can dictate which attributes the service can access, the duration of access, and the purpose for which the data is being used. If the service provider breaches these rules, access is denied or revoked, safeguarding your privacy and maintaining control over your&nbsp;data.</p> Transparency through Auditable Transaction History <p>Every interaction within the DIAM ecosystem is etched into an auditable transaction history, fostering accountability and bolstering the reliability of the digital identity landscape.</p><p>In an age where accountability is a cornerstone of trust, the concept of an auditable transaction history emerges as a vital tenet. Every action taken within the DIAM framework is recorded in a transparent and tamper-proof ledger. Whether it’s the issuance of verifiable credentials, the sharing of identity attributes, or the verification of claims, each interaction is logged in this immutable record.</p><p>Imagine a scenario where you’re applying for a job and need to verify your professional qualifications. Within the DIAM framework, the verification process leaves an indelible trace. This trace can be audited by relevant parties, ensuring that the verification was conducted ethically and accurately. This transparency builds a foundation of trust and accountability, enhancing the integrity of the entire ecosystem.</p> Compliance: Navigating the Regulatory Currents <p>In an era marked by regulatory currents, DIAM emerges as a guiding beacon. Committed to upholding regulations like GDPR, DIAM ensures that identity data is handled ethically and responsibly, further nurturing the bedrock of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>The digital landscape is governed by a patchwork of regulations designed to protect individual privacy and data security. These regulations reflect society’s collective consciousness, emphasizing the need to uphold ethical standards even within the virtual&nbsp;realm.</p><p>For DIAM, compliance is not a mere obligation — it’s an affirmation of its commitment to user-centricity. Take the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as an example. This European regulation outlines strict rules for the collection, processing, and storage of personal data. DIAM’s architecture aligns seamlessly with GDPR principles, ensuring that user data is handled transparently, ethically, and in accordance with regulatory standards.</p> A Guardian’s Vigilance: Regular Audits and&nbsp;Updates <p>DIAM’s commitment to security is unwavering, evidenced by its regimen of regular security audits and updates. This proactive approach ensures that the fortress remains impregnable, ready to repel emerging&nbsp;threats.</p><p>In the realm of cybersecurity, vigilance is paramount. Threat landscapes evolve, vulnerabilities emerge, and new attack vectors surface. To maintain the highest level of security, DIAM adopts a proactive stance. Regular security audits are conducted, scrutinizing every facet of the framework for vulnerabilities.</p><p>Imagine DIAM as a digital guardian constantly patrolling the boundaries of its fortress. Security experts systematically examine the system’s architecture, codebase, and protocols, seeking any chink in the armor. If vulnerabilities are detected, immediate action is taken to rectify them, often in the form of security updates or&nbsp;patches.</p> Conclusion: <blockquote>As we traverse the intricate pathways of the digital realm, the torchbearers of security and privacy illuminate our way. Within this landscape, DIAM stands as a beacon, guiding us toward a future where security is paramount and privacy is sacrosanct. Through encryption, decentralization, SSI, ZKPs, DIDs, MFA, blockchain, access control, audit trails, compliance, and unwavering vigilance, DIAM crafts a legacy of fortified digital identities and a sanctuary of&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>In this journey, let us stride forth with confidence, for within the realm of DIAM, we find not just a bastion of security, but an embodiment of our unwavering commitment to a digital world where security and privacy reign&nbsp;supreme.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.know.cards/">Know</a> more about&nbsp;us!</blockquote>

 13. Your Digital Trust Vault — Unraveling the Wonders of Verifiable Credentials for a Trustworthy Future! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction: <blockquote>In a world defined by digital interactions, trust serves as the cornerstone of relationships, both personal and professional. However, establishing trust in the digital realm has been an ongoing challenge, given the prevalence of data breaches and identity theft. Enter the concept of verifiable credentials, a technological breakthrough facilitated by Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM).</blockquote><p>In this comprehensive guide, we delve into the very essence of verifiable credentials and explore how they are harnessed within the DIAM framework to revolutionize trust-building.</p> Verifiable Credentials Unveiled: A New Dawn of&nbsp;Trust <p>At its core, a verifiable credential represents a digital claim that an entity possesses certain attributes, qualifications, or certifications. Think of it as a digital equivalent of a driver’s license or a university degree. However, what sets verifiable credentials apart is their ability to be cryptographically secured, tamper-proof, and shareable in a selective manner. These credentials empower individuals to present trusted information without revealing unnecessary details.</p> DIAM’s Role: Fortifying Verifiable Credentials <p>Within the realm of DIAM, verifiable credentials become more than just digital representations; they evolve into trust anchors that shape the way individuals interact, verify, and share information.</p> The Power of Verifiable Credentials within&nbsp;DIAM <p>1. Immutable Integrity: Safeguarding Trust:<br>Verifiable credentials rely on cryptographic techniques to maintain their integrity. Each credential is cryptographically signed by the issuer, ensuring that any attempt to tamper with the information is detected. This tamper-proof nature establishes a new level of trust in the digital&nbsp;realm.</p><p>2. Selective Disclosure: Privacy Meets Transparency:<br>In a world grappling with data privacy concerns, DIAM-powered verifiable credentials offer a solution. Individuals can choose what attributes to share, allowing them to present only the necessary information for a specific context. This selective disclosure strikes a balance between transparency and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>3. Efficient Verification: Streamlining Trust Validation:<br>Verifiable credentials streamline the verification process. Verifiers, the parties seeking to validate the claims, can quickly and securely verify the authenticity of a credential without the need for intermediaries. This not only expedites transactions but also reduces reliance on centralized identity providers.</p> Navigating Verifiable Credentials within the DIAM Ecosystem <p>1. Issuance of Verifiable Credentials: Building Trust Anchors:<br>The journey of a verifiable credential begins with its issuance. Trusted entities, known as issuers, create these credentials and anchor trust in their cryptographic signatures. Whether it’s a university validating a diploma or a healthcare provider confirming vaccination, the issuer’s mark ensures authenticity.</p><p>2. Storage in the Digital Wallet: Your Identity Fortress:<br>Once issued, verifiable credentials find their home within the DIAM identity wallet. This wallet, securely stored on the user’s device, acts as a vault where credentials are under the user’s control. It grants individuals the power to manage and selectively share their verifiable credentials.</p><p>3. Presentation and Verification: Building Bridges of Trust:<br>When a claim needs verification, the user can present the corresponding verifiable credential. Verifiers can then use cryptographic proofs to validate the authenticity of the claim. This process ensures that only legitimate claims are accepted, enhancing the overall trust in digital interactions.</p> Verifiable Credentials in Action: Realizing a Trusted&nbsp;Future <p>1. Professional Identity: Elevating Credentials:<br>Verifiable credentials redefine professional identity. Imagine presenting a tamper-proof credential that showcases your qualifications, licenses, and memberships. These credentials empower professionals to engage confidently in various contexts, from job applications to cross-border work opportunities.</p><p>2. Seamless Access to Services: Redefining Convenience:<br>DIAM-enabled verifiable credentials simplify access to services. Whether it’s boarding a plane, checking into a hotel, or accessing a secure facility, these credentials streamline processes while ensuring data security and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>3. Government Services: Transforming Citizen Engagement:<br>Governments can harness verifiable credentials to modernize citizen services. From digital IDs that eliminate the need for physical cards to verified vaccination records for seamless travel, citizens experience efficient, secure, and privacy-respecting interactions.</p> Conclusion: <blockquote>Verifiable credentials, bolstered by our DIAM framework, have emerged as a beacon of trust in the digital landscape. Through cryptographic signatures, selective disclosure, and secure validation, these credentials redefine how trust is established and maintained. As verifiable credentials take center stage, a new era of secure, efficient, and privacy-respecting interactions dawns — one where trust is no longer a challenge but a fundamental element of the digital tapestry.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.know.cards/">Know</a> more about&nbsp;us!</blockquote>

<p>Phishing and other attacks usually have one goal: passwords. So the world could be a better place without passwords. There have already been several attempts to bury the passwords. All have failed – due to the complexity, the costs for hardware keys, for example, or the inconvenient use. The new approach with FIDO2 and Passkeys sounds more promising. By the way, FIDO stands for Fast Identity Online.</p>

<p>Spherity builds Decentralized Identity management solutions designed to power the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The company participates in standards-setting processes and interacts with developer, industry, and research communities to enable compliance and interoperability in increasingly complex technological and regulatory landscapes. Spherity is active in various industry segments, but currently has a focus on the pharma industry and works on circular economy topics.<br></p><p>We caught up with Dr Susanne Guth-Orlowski, Chief Innovation &amp; Solution Officer, Christiane Wirrig, Product Manager CARO, and Ricky Thiermann, Product Owner Digital Product Passports to learn about their work on Digital Product Passports in the EU, and promoting compliance with new pharmaceutical industry regulations in the US.<br></p><p>Why did you adopt a decentralized approach to implementing the EU Digital Product Passport, Susanne Guth-Orlowski? <br></p><p>The decision was taken by the European Commission (EC), not us. Currently manufacturers have to provide data such as product certifications for chemicals and automotive parts and energy labeling data for electronic products to central systems in order to comply with EU regulations (such as <a href="https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/registered-substances?ref=blog.identity.foundation">REACH </a>and <a href="https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">EPREL</a>). <br></p><p>The EC knows how hard it is to set up and maintain these central systems and keep everybody happy. Supply chain actors in particular do not want to upload their data to centralized systems as they fear sharing business secrets and they have no control over their data, once it is uploaded.<br></p><p>The EC saw that a use case as big as Digital Product Passports across multiple product segments, with supply chain actors scattered around the world, is very complex. It is difficult to set up a single platform to manage it and to satisfy the needs of all supply chain actors concerning business confidentiality.<br></p><p>How is Decentralized Identity being integrated alongside existing systems and standards? <br></p><p>This is an area where we’re working directly with the EC’s policy officers, participating in standardization groups at Stand.ICT and CEN/CENELEC, as well as contributing to research projects such as <a href="https://thebatterypass.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Battery Pass</a>, <a href="https://cirpassproject.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">CIRPASS </a>and others. We’re bringing in decentralized concepts that enable the requirements to be met, incorporating W3C standards into the <a href="https://psqr.eu/publications-resources/all-about-dpp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">EU Digital Product Passport</a> (DPP) specifications and designing and implementing Proof of Concepts (PoCs), such as our latest <a href="https://medium.com/@susi.guth/resolving-digital-product-passports-f08ac8f11b5a?ref=blog.identity.foundation">T-Shirt use case</a>. Textiles are one of the first regulated product segments, and therefore we are using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as a product identifier and resolver technology to reach the Digital Product Passport, and verifiable credentials for the product information. <br></p><p>What Decentralized Identity capabilities are you leveraging? <br></p><p>Information discovery is highly relevant in the DPP use case, and is fully solved by Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Being able to locate a product’s DID and obtain all kinds of information from the DID document or service endpoint(s) enables you to meet so many use cases, from compliance certificates to pointing end customers to the product website. There’s so much flexibility.</p><p>Verifiability is another major driver. If you’re using the DPP to query a product’s carbon footprint, you need to ensure you’re looking at verified data. Products with a large footprint will be taxed more, creating an incentive for fraud. We need to ensure we can validate the data is accurate. <br></p><p>Verifiability has several important ingredients. <br></p><p>The first is cryptographic standards and protocols including signature schemes. <br></p><p>Then there’s trust verification, which is the ability to trace documents and data back to the supply chain’s root of trust (such as the digital signature of a competent authority). <br></p><p>Finally, there are semantics and calculations. It is critical to have standardized definitions (such as <a href="https://www.carbontrust.com/our-work-and-impact/guides-reports-and-tools/briefing-what-are-scope-3-emissions?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Scope 3 emissions</a>) and methods for calculating these values. <br></p><p>How are you handling product identification and data exchange? <br></p><p>For some products such as batteries, it makes sense to use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) from Day One. The end product’s digital passport will include the identifiers of all materials and components, which in turn will have their own passports. This makes it possible to validate the product’s carbon footprint by summing the footprints of the pre-products and checking that it tallies. <br></p><p>For other categories such as textiles, existing systems in retail are built around the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and Global Location Number (GLN). For those systems it will take some time until they can handle Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as globally unique identifiers. &nbsp;<br></p><p>With regards to data exchange, we are looking at using different methods depending on the requirements. For example, a Verifiable Presentation request might be handled via OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP) for human identity use cases. On the other hand, we see the need for ongoing trusted connections between the supply chain actors associated with a finished product, so we are planning to use <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Communications (DIDComm)</a> for data exchange within the supply chain. <br></p><p>Turning to <a href="https://caro.vc/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">CARO</a>, Spherity’s credentialing service for &nbsp;US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) compliance, what value does Decentralized Identity bring in this use case, Christiane Wirrig? <br></p><p>The way the pharma industry is set up in the US requires a decentralized approach. The FDA (US Food &amp; Drug Administration) doesn’t work like the EMA (European Medicines Agency). In the US, you have all these product repos sitting with the manufacturers themselves. Moreover, there’s no central register of participants in the supply chain.<br></p><p>From November 2023, supply chain actors, such as wholesalers and dispensers, will be required to verify the authenticity of the pharmaceutical product they are trading in a new way. Those opting for an automated solution can use a Verification Router Service (VRS) provider for the product verification. However there’s still an unanswered question, namely how do the pharma companies know who’s enquiring and responding?<br></p><p>This is where CARO comes in. The solution enables participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain to obtain a Verifiable Credential confirming their Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) status. In combination with VRS, this enables them to prove their legitimacy and complete an electronic product enquiry in real time.<br></p><p>The US pharmaceutical supply chain sounds quite fragmented. How is this being coordinated? <br></p><p>In a decentralized ecosystem, it’s essential to provide a safe environment for information exchange as well as shared standards as pointed out earlier by Susanne. We saw the need for a neutral body to play the role of ecosystem coordinator. That’s why we are one of the founding sponsors of the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a>. <br></p><p>The OCI is where the industry comes together to agree the format of the ATP credentials, who is authorized to issue, hold and verify these and other considerations such as how to handle credential revocation. <br></p><p>Creating OCI was a stroke of genius because it lowers the barriers to entry for everyone. Service providers understand the required benchmarks and service users can expect interoperability and a degree of consistency across providers.<br></p><p>What Decentralized Identity capabilities are you leveraging in the CARO solution, Ricky Thiermann? <br></p><p>OCI has standardized on W3C Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. CARO allocates Ethereum-based did:ethr as unique identifiers to its users. <br></p><p>Veramo is one of the core libraries we use and to which we contribute. We also use DIF Credential Manifest, and some of the cryptographic signature pieces being standardized in DIF. <br></p><p>Hyperledger Aries RFCs and DIDComm are very important for CARO, and will be the standard for Presentation Issuance and Exchange between OCI-compliant wallet providers. Aside from the technical benefits, it’s also about ecosystem efficiency and lowering the market entry barriers. At the moment the service provider ecosystem is small and we still have the capacity for active collaboration to align on shared standards and processes to avoid homebrewed niche approaches. Imagine if even just a couple of issuers and a handful of wallets had to integrate with each other’s provider-specific hook-ups in every possible combination!<br></p><p>Using DIDComm, there’s no need for issuers and verifiers to integrate. Once you’ve put the work in upfront to comply with the specification, you’re interoperable by design. This allows for an open market to emerge, and will ultimately enable the solution to scale. <br></p><p>What value does DIF bring? <br></p><p>We need the standards to be out there and recognized in order to implement a solution around Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) successfully. For that, we need a home that further develops Decentralized Identity technologies and specifications in a highly professional way, and closes any gaps that emerge around industry needs. For us, that’s what DIF brings to the table. <br><br><br></p>

 12. DIAM: Unleash the Ultimate Secure Channel — Revolutionizing Peer-to-Peer Communication with Unbreakable Privacy! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction: <blockquote>In an era marked by ubiquitous connectivity, the exchange of information transcends physical boundaries. Yet, this increased connectivity also gives rise to heightened concerns regarding privacy and security. Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, enabled by cutting-edge technologies such as Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM), offers a transformative solution.</blockquote><p>This comprehensive guide delves deep into the intricacies of peer-to-peer communication and how DIAM serves as a formidable safeguard for secure, private, and authenticated interactions.</p> Understanding P2P Communication: A Paradigm&nbsp;Shift <p>Peer-to-peer communication marks a departure from the conventional client-server model, where interactions are routed through central intermediaries. In contrast, P2P communication enables direct, encrypted exchanges between parties, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This paradigm shift promises enhanced security, reduced vulnerability to cyber threats, and greater control over data&nbsp;sharing.</p> The DIAM Advantage: Elevating P2P Communication <p>Leveraging the power of DIAM, peer-to-peer communication undergoes a transformation, merging cryptographic security with user-centric principles. The DIAM framework reinforces P2P communication with layers of authentication, trust, and selective disclosure, establishing an ecosystem where individuals and entities can communicate with confidence.</p> Empowering Features of DIAM-Enabled P2P Communication <p>1. Encrypted Conversations: Fortifying Privacy:<br>DIAM employs advanced encryption techniques to shield conversations from prying eyes. Information exchanged between peers is encrypted end-to-end, rendering it inaccessible to unauthorized entities. This cryptographic shield ensures that only intended recipients have access to the shared&nbsp;content.</p><p>2. Identity Verification: Cementing Trust:<br>In a digital landscape where anonymity can breed mistrust, DIAM’s identity verification mechanisms redefine interactions. Peers can verify each other’s identities with cryptographic proofs, minimizing the risk of impersonation or fraudulent engagements.</p><p>3. Selective Disclosure: Sharing with Precision:<br>DIAM-enabled P2P communication empowers users with selective disclosure capabilities. Individuals can choose what information to share, tailoring their responses to the specific context. This not only safeguards sensitive data but also preserves a user’s control over their digital footprint.</p> Navigating Secure P2P Communication with&nbsp;DIAM <p>1. Initiating Conversations: Establishing Trust:<br>Engaging in a secure P2P conversation begins with identity verification. DIAM facilitates this by enabling peers to validate each other’s identities through cryptographic proofs. This step sets the foundation for a trustworthy exchange of information.</p><p>2. Encrypted Messaging: Shields Up, Privacy Intact:<br>Once identities are verified, DIAM ensures that messages are encrypted end-to-end. This cryptographic shield safeguards the content from unauthorized access, ensuring that only the intended recipients can decrypt and comprehend the exchanged information.</p><p>3. Multi-Factor Authentication: Strengthening Security:<br>To elevate security further, DIAM integrates multi-factor authentication (MFA). This additional layer of protection ensures that only authorized individuals with the necessary credentials can engage in P2P communication.</p> Real-World Applications of Secure P2P Communication <p>1. Business Collaborations: Trustworthy Transactions:<br>Enterprises can harness DIAM-enabled P2P communication to foster secure collaborations. Business negotiations, sensitive data sharing, and contractual discussions can occur without intermediaries, preserving confidentiality and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>2. Government-Citizen Interactions: Enhanced Engagement:<br>Governments can streamline citizen interactions with the heightened security of DIAM. From applying for licenses to accessing public services, citizens engage in secure and privacy-focused exchanges with government entities.</p><p>3. Personal Conversations: Elevating Privacy:<br>In an age where privacy is paramount, DIAM-powered P2P communication offers individuals the means to converse privately and securely. Personal exchanges, medical consultations, and confidential discussions remain shielded from unauthorized access.</p> Conclusion: <blockquote>As technology paves the way for an increasingly interconnected world, safeguarding the sanctity of communication becomes imperative. Peer-to-peer communication, enriched by the tenets of DIAM, transcends traditional barriers. With encrypted conversations, verified identities, and selective disclosure, individuals and entities alike can embrace a future where secure, private, and authenticated communication is the norm. As we navigate this digital age, DIAM-led P2P communication stands as a testament to the power of technology harnessed for the greater good, offering a secure haven where communication thrives in the embrace of privacy and&nbsp;trust.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.know.cards/">Know</a> more about&nbsp;us!</blockquote>

 Part 1: Digital Twins in a Surveillance Economy <p>This article is the first in a two-part series. It aims to clarify the benefits and limitations of digital twinning technologies and why recent developments in AI continue to raise global concern regarding the inevitable socio-ethical dangers of digital twinning conscious entities–––a virtual model of "digital self"–––and our quest to protect free will and human agency in the current surveillance economy, where humans hope to leverage insights from digital twins for material objects and processes rather than being beholden to a virtual representation of "self" in the digital space.</p><p>Waking up to an unwelcome reality: Before the Internet of Things (IoT) brought the term "wearables" into fashion, people have been extending our physical and cognitive abilities for generations through supportive inventions such as glasses, watches, walking sticks, hearing devices, and wheelchairs, or used mind-altering consumables to extend our natural capabilities beyond previously known limits to assist us in our daily routines and activities, influencing the imagination of "self" as we evolve as an intelligent species.</p><p>In light of recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), creating a virtual representation of ourselves for self-determined interactions in the digital world is a societal issue as much as a technological one, pointing directly to our species' sense of being. Therefore, delineating between "what is human" and "what is a machine" lies at the heart of technological innovation in determining how humans engage with digital systems, with "human consciousness" a dominant factor in that delineation.</p>







  






















  <blockquote>
    ““It is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for&nbsp;and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy.””
  </blockquote>
  — — Thucydides (c.455-c.400 BC)




  <p>The philosophical concept of "Sovereign Reason" states that all humans possess the inherent right to have supreme or ultimate power of a self-determined cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event, acting as the sole instrument of "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/free-will">free will</a>."</p><p>Analogous to marine life struggling to survive beyond aquatic ecosystems, engaging in a digital world remains overwhelming to humans. Our ability to adapt to and comprehend the ramifications of deploying next-generation technologies is still embryonic. At Human Colossus, implementing any disruptive technology without fully understanding its influence on societal well-being is unfathomable. When AI is intrusive enough to result in coining the term "Digital Twin," societal vigilance is necessary for any technology deployed under that banner. Humans are conscious entities, not material objects. Developing a digital twin of a conscious entity is dangerous. An accurate virtual representation of "self" must never be in the form of a digital twin.</p><p>Refactoring AI innovation could narrow the current analogue/digital divide, providing a more realistic digital representation of real-world interactions with other entities in a virtual environment.</p> Why the notion of a digital twin of a human being continues to raise global concern <p>A "digital twin" is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object or process. They are created by collecting enough data to model an object in the digital space with enough accuracy to serve a specific purpose.</p> The benefits of digital twinning material objects and processes <p>A simple example of a "digital twin" is a digital image captured by a digital camera viewed on the camera's image display. The captured image is the digital counterpart of a negative in a roll of film, a photographic image stored as a single frame captured by an analogue camera. By creating a digital representation of the analogue photo, the photographer can enhance the image through digital image processing, a set of underlying algorithms to process existing data about the digital photograph mathematically. The image processing algorithms may include low-level methods, noise removal, and colour enhancement. AI algorithms provide data actioning recipes to accurately process data packets to represent material objects and processes in the digital domain.

  <p>Organisations use digital twins for compound use cases. By collecting enough data about a physical object or process, digital twinning enables their corresponding representation in a digital environment, where the supporting data is ingested into virtual simulations to observe performance, check for physical limitations (e.g., crash tests), stress test critical components, and verify behavioural response in varying conditions. These simulations significantly reduce operational costs. After all, how often can an aviation company such as The Boeing Company, for example, afford to crash its Boeing 737s to test their handling in harsh weather conditions. Mechanical engineers can repeatedly crash a plane in a simulation without significant financial burdens or consequences. So, digital twins are disruptive to product lifecycle management (PLM) processes in most industries; they enable product owners to access an enormous amount of real-time data collected using sensors to ingest factual information about a physical object (the "product") or behavioural information about how that object responds to changes in environmental circumstance through its digital counterpart in simulation.</p><p>Previous technological limitations confined product owners to only being able to test early-stage life cycles in a lab before releasing a product to market. However, due to the ever-decreasing costs of digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has scaled digital twinning technologies, with digital twins now able to provide algorithmic reasoning for performance monitoring at every stage of a product life cycle, with data insights about consumer products accessible in real-time. Product owners can create digital twins for a product and create digital twins for an instance of a product. That level of granularity makes past impossibilities in trend analysis now possible, with product insights more accessible across the board.</p><p>So, how can we use digital twins? Well, digital twins can run practical simulations to study multiple real-time processes, such as predicting failure, improving response times, and informing customers about maintenance information to prolong a product's functioning life. With simple controlling mechanisms built into the devices, we can monitor responses, inform product customers, and remotely solve issues before they happen, enabling automated self-healing functionality. Digital twins can fully control a device without unnecessarily burdening the consumer, allowing a more seamless user experience.</p><p>Digital twins allow product owners to monitor granular processes across an entire product lifecycle, including at all stages of research and development (R&amp;D), design, manufacturing, service and maintenance, and daily operation.</p> The socio-ethical dangers of digital twinning conscious entities <p>For the most part, developing digital twins for material objects ("products") and processes can significantly benefit organisations wishing to streamline product development and optimise costs, and their customers, who benefit from greater product efficiency. However, if virtual representations of objects can profoundly benefit society, can we produce a digital twin for a conscious entity, such as an intelligent animal or human? A virtual model of "digital self."[1]</p><p>In truth, through corporate surveillance, many companies already have enough data about customer buying behaviour and other traceable patterns to develop virtual representations of consumers (without consent) to benefit the organisation in any digital environments they control, an unwelcome economic reality and, in light of digitally twinning civilians, a sobering thought.</p><p>For large swathes of the global population, humans are well connected as an ever-evolving species reliant on technology. However, through our various online interactions with service providers and product owners, organisations can leverage personal data gathered through their collection processes to benefit their companies. With the sheer amount of personal data collected, by integrating a small amount of consumer behavioural data, companies can run powerful algorithms to process sensitive information about us, directly profiling our deepest desires, no matter how private the information, including our watching, buying, and eating preferences, and this epidemic doesn't stop with probabilistic predictions, as simulated models can coercively tell us what to do without relying on the intricacies of human consciousness.</p><p>Digital twinning conscious entities would inevitably leave human reasoning to machines and the ultimate loss of our God-given right to "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/free-will">free will</a>."</p><p>But Free Will will prevail.</p><p>Luckily, there is an inherent flaw in the logic of profiling using big data. Although relatively simple to explain, exposing this weakness brings awareness of the risks we face in the current digital economy and gives rise to an alternative solution to digitally twinning civilians.</p><p>Even with tech companies collecting an enormous amount of data about us, there remains an unquenchable thirst for them to collect more and more personal data to fuel their algorithms. This frenzy for data is easy to explain.</p><p>So, imagine a scenario where you purchase an appliance, for example. Shortly after buying the product, you'll often receive targeted ads from a different store for a similar product at a lower price. So why do digital companies rely on this type of ad campaign? Despite having access to massive data sets and analytical tooling to generate "digital twins," the business model is flawed. If common sense prevailed, declaring that you've already bought the desired appliance should deter any marketing algorithms from sending you targeted ads for similar products after the purchase event. So, why do companies engage in this type of business model? The simple answer is “cost."&nbsp;</p><p>Correctly identifying helpful information in a database to enable a simple decision process is a complex and largely unsolved problem. With more and more data required for companies to maintain a competitive edge, marketing analytics resort to brute-force correlations, pressing for a tsunami of data that fuels the digital economy, leading to the societal consequences we see today.</p><p>At Human Colossus, we think differently and advocate for a Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) where the integrity of data objects and processes and the authenticity of recorded events in associated key event logs provide the cryptographic assurance and data quality necessary for accurate analytics and improved business insights (see <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/accuratedata1">Blog post from November 2022</a>). A way of visualising this difference is via the Economics of Correlators.&nbsp;</p> The Economics of Correlators <p>In September 2021, the Human Colossus Foundation hosted a webinar titled "Core public utility technologies for a <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">Next Generation Internet</a>." In the context of systems with weak privacy, Dr. Sam Smith presented the concept of the economics of correlators (see Vimeo <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">recording @19m20sec</a>). The correlator is an entity that tries to gather data about you and correlate it with specific behaviour to create a prediction. This correlation is the basis of digital transformation in the advertising industry. In less than a generation, the sector's primary focus evolved from "know-your-customer" to "know-your-data-and-correlate," with collected consumer data enabling companies to propose their "best" offers and products to consumers based on company-controlled algorithms. Unfortunately, the previous example of the purchased appliance demonstrates that this only works as intended occasionally due to the limitations of simple economics where accurate correlation has a cost.</p><p>Gathering real-time data with proper context and accuracy is an ongoing data curation problem for humans today, with technological and economic barriers. This article will ignore governance barriers (e.g., privacy), focusing purely on technology and economics. Today's network architecture may allow sufficient data flow for simple IoT devices or physical objects by measuring a few standardised data points. However, it cannot cope with the nuanced complexity of interactions involving humans in an even more complex ecosystem. Monitoring all that at scale is a challenging technological task with a cost. Therefore the economic constraints of extracting real-time data outweigh the benefits payoff for those companies.</p><p>The economics of the correlators describes a relationship between correlation costs and value from which we can identify the domains in which there is an extractable value in correlation. As we can see in the diagram below, the correlation costs need to be lower than the correlation value, so extracting the value from the data would be profitable. By understanding the dynamics of these curves, one can control the economics around the data, influencing the behaviour of the data market.</p>

  <p>The example we provided above indicates that commercially, the most valuable pieces of information are near "Now." So the services can adapt to your current needs. But, of course, it only helps if you get a proposition of the product you have yet to buy. But as we can see on the diagram, the cost of extraction grows significantly as soon as it approaches "Now." It, therefore, reduces the domain of value extraction from correlated data. As a result, this correlation cost translates into a limit of accuracy for the algorithms attempting to predict individual behaviour.</p> The limits of correlation <p>This limit is good news when considered from a higher societal perspective. Collecting data in real-time is particularly challenging and, in many cases, leads to total surveillance of a person and their community. Whether we like it or not, information is generated by us directly or captured through our interactions on social platforms, online buying behaviour, and via our friends and family through shared personal photos on social media, a personal phone number shared through a specific instant messaging app, etc. Based on collected data, companies can make robust predictions, such as inferring a social profile of a not yet-born child based on the information their mother posts on a social platform, the country in which they are living, areas, parents' background, and more.</p><p>The success of the current digital economy is primarily due to the advertising model mentioned above, with systemic flaws for everyone to observe, where user-generated data aggregated by organisations fuel machine learning algorithms that model behavioural patterns to predict our desires and shape our opinions, enslaving consumers to corporate-driven incentives, a surveillance system.</p><p>In Shoshana Zuboffin's book "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism," the author describes "Capitalism" as "a profit-making incentive that arose as advertising companies, led by Google's AdWords, saw the possibilities of using personal data to target consumers more precisely.", an observation indicating that the current label "Digital Twins" is a misnomer. Perhaps "Digital Puppets" would be more appropriate! However, as digital twins are a reality, what can be done to reverse the trend of our current surveillance society? The wake-up call highlighted above shows that, although de facto, digitally twinning human beings is a bad idea due to known privacy risks.</p> Actualising digital twins in the natural world <p>So, the digital twinning of material objects and processes can provide enough data for humans to understand how to react to and control devices to operate in a particular manner. However, if we were to apply the same principle to living beings, we would have to digitalise the differentiating factors that separate humans from machines, the essential characteristics of living beings, namely, the concepts of "Free Will" and "Sovereign Reason" introduced at the beginning of this article. In addition, we can also highlight the economic dimension, where the human instinct for financial success is the modern equivalent of survival.</p><p>Like any software tool, digital twins can assist both good and bad practices. However, influenced and determined by the community, "Good" and "Bad" are contextual. The trickier question is how to ensure that developing the right digital twinning technology will maximise the "good" and minimise the "bad." In particular, can we provide access to real-time data that makes economic sense without losing control or compromising privacy?&nbsp;</p><p>And our answer is, "Yes, we can!" (and we are working on it.)</p> Step 1: Acting on the economy of correlators as the agent of change <p>As we learned in the "The Economics of Correlators" section, we can manipulate how data reaches the market, influencing the costs of the correlation or the correlation value so that value extraction can happen in desired conditions through de-correlation techniques developed for privacy preservation purposes, for example. The cost of value extraction for near real-time data correlation is high for market actors but quasi-nil for the data source. Therefore, we could change assumptions about who in that situation is a correlator and drive the correlation costs to the minimum for the system. If the user collects the data themselves, costs drop dramatically since they already have devices able to collect data in real-time, with the user deciding what data they generate, record, and share. We not only make it affordable because of the scale (i.e., just one individual instead of millions), but we also change the control over the data.</p><p>Sharing for an explicit purpose will provide a high incentive for adoption and consent.</p><p>This topic becomes critically important in healthcare, where patient data is of high value to many stakeholders. Suppose a patient or an organisation trusted by the patient has complete control of shared data for a specific purpose, not inadvertently used for something else. This scenario is a game changer, facilitating dramatically improved access to purposeful data.</p> Step 2: Restore Sovereignty <p>Individuals must operate the proper tools in a secure environment to transform the end user into the correlator. With this prerequisite, they will perform such activities without worrying about being surveilled or losing sensitive information. For this to happen, individuals must regain confidence in their digital interactions.</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation continues to shape the requirements of a SELF Actioning System (SAS), a core technological piece for human-centric digital engagement in a new Dynamic Data Economy (DDE), in HCF’s SELF Actioning System (SAS) Working Group.</p><p>That concludes Part 1 of this two-part series. Part 2 will describe how a SELF actioning system provides a superior solution for embodying "digital self" to facilitate human-led data actions in the digital realm, where sovereign reason and consciousness reside with the system's owner (a "human"), not with a virtual representation of that person (a "machine").</p><p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Since we last <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Engine-Room-Oxfam-Biometrics-Review.pdf" title="looked into">looked into</a> the use of biometrics in the humanitarian sector five years ago in 2018,&nbsp; the technology has become increasingly embedded in humanitarian programming, with sensitive biometric information being collected from vulnerable individuals in an increasing array of contexts, from Bangladesh to Yemen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the momentum behind using biometric technology in humanitarian contexts has been part of a push toward increased efficiency and more accurate data within the sector. At the same time, however, evidence of harms has mounted, and concerns about risk have increased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From February 2022 to June 2023 The Engine Room, with support from OSF, took a renewed look at the risks and benefits of biometric collection in the humanitarian sector, examined some of the institutional policies that shape their use, and explored recent use cases.</p>



<p>Our findings point towards the need for a more holistic and responsible approach to the deployment of biometrics in the sector. You can read a snapshot of these findings later in this post, and download the full report below.&nbsp;If you’re new to biometrics or looking to gain more background understanding of what biometrics are and how they are used more generally, start with our accompanying Primer. </p>

<p>JOIN OUR UPCOMING COMMUNITY CALL<br><br>In order to share our learnings with civil society organisations, activists and funders, we’ll be holding a community call on 7 September, 2023.   <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUkcuyrqT4qHNA0JFjLaURUDH21ZaEnoo_4" title="">REGISTER HERE</a>: Thurs 7 September  at 10:00-11:00 EDT | 16:00-17:00 CEST | 19:30-20:30 IST.  <br> <br>Come along to hear more about our research findings, hear from other key voices in the discussion around biometric use in the humanitarian sector, and be part of a facilitated conversation on potential new approaches. Anyone with an interest in the topic is welcome – we’d love you to join us!&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



 A snapshot of our research findings 



<p>Against a backdrop of changing conditions, our research sought to map out differing approaches and understandings of biometric use within the humanitarian sector.&nbsp; From increased investment in biometric technology in the private sector and the still latent consideration of biometric information in data governance frameworks, to the manifestation of harm via non-consensual access to biometric data and the growing cyber targeting of humanitarian organisations, we found a sector in a key moment of flux.</p>



<p>Overall, in the last five years there has not been a cohesive change in how the humanitarian sector approaches the use of biometrics, and a growing divergence has emerged between organisations taking a more restrictive approach to biometric technologies, and those who are continuing to expand their use.&nbsp;</p>



 Some of the key learnings from our research include:&nbsp; 



 
 Risks and harms are not fully accounted for. Given the sensitivity of biometric data it is important for humanitarian organisations — with their commitment to doing no harm — to consider potential harms holistically. The majority of current assessments of biometric technologies, however, fail to properly address issues such as function creep.<br> 



 The need for more evidence of benefits remains. A fuller accounting of biometric technologies should also include a deeper investigation into the potential benefits of biometric technology. While there has been increased evidence of harms, a more complex understanding and costing of benefits in relation to harms has not emerged, and evidence of benefits alone remains limited.<br> 



 Organisational policies lack coherence across the sector, and many do not properly account for the specifics of biometric technologies. Policies offer a window into how organisations are approaching the use of biometrics in their work, we reviewed eight different organisational policies looking at accessibility, specificity, proportionality and implementation. In our research we saw a varied approach in the sector – only two organisations had biometric-specific policies; the remaining six did not.<br> 



 Policy implementation is patchy. Having the right policies is only one part of the puzzle — policy success also depends on proper implementation. However we found that a lack of resources and sustained support around policy implementation was resulting in operational challenges, with informal workarounds and disconnects between policies set by organisational headquarters and implementation in regional offices.&nbsp; 



 Technical literacy among key decision makers remains a challenge. In order to make informed decisions around the use of biometrics, staff need to be better equipped to understand and engage in nuanced discussions around the technology. Across our interviews we saw that most organisations were struggling with knowledge-building around biometrics, with both programme officers in regional offices and policymakers at headquarters making decisions about biometric technologies and data protection policy implementation without the proper knowledge to do so safely and responsibly.<br> 



 Donors continue to encourage the use of biometric systems without providing adequate funding for safety measures. Part of the impetus for the uptake of biometric technologies can be traced back to minority world donors. By stipulating funding requirements and encouraging investment and research in biometrics, these large and influential donors have introduced biometric systems into humanitarian operations without providing the investment and support to enable their responsible use.&nbsp; 
 



 What needs to change 



<p>Our research showed a clear need to develop a more coherent and responsible approach to the use of biometrics in the sector, and that in order for humanitarian organisations to uphold their commitment and responsibility to impacted communities it is vital that a shared standard is established in the sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We suggest five key steps towards a more responsible approach:</p>



 
 Continued interrogation of the necessity of biometrics&nbsp; 



 More nuanced policy design and implementation 



 Establishing community-centred standards of practice&nbsp; 



 Strengthening practices around Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) 



 More sophisticated, ecosystem-wide analysis of technologies used in the sector

 11. Know Identity Wallet: Your Personal Identity Backpack— Unveiling the Powerful Features and Functionality! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction: <blockquote>In today’s digitally intertwined world, where every online interaction leaves a digital footprint, the significance of robust identity management cannot be overstated. Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM) solutions have emerged as a beacon of innovation, offering individuals and businesses a paradigm shift in how they control, secure, and utilize their digital identities. Anchoring this revolution is our Identity Wallet — a powerful tool that empowers users to navigate the intricate terrain of digital identity with unparalleled control and security.</blockquote><p>In this comprehensive exploration, we embark on an in-depth journey to uncover the multifaceted features, intricate functionalities, and the transformative potential of the ‘Know’ Identity&nbsp;Wallet.</p> The ‘Know’ Identity Wallet: A Comprehensive Overview <p>Imagine a digital sanctuary, a fortress where your identity is under your jurisdiction, immune to breaches and unauthorized access. The ‘Know’ Identity Wallet isn’t just a digital repository; it’s an intricately designed ecosystem that encapsulates an array of features aimed at safeguarding, streamlining, and enhancing your digital identity experience.</p> Empowering Features of the our Identity&nbsp;Wallet <p>1. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): The Blueprint of Control:<br>At the heart of our Identity Wallet is the revolutionary concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). This groundbreaking principle grants users full control over their digital identities. It not only allows the creation and management of identities but also empowers users to delete identities — a testament to the unparalleled control users&nbsp;possess.</p><p>2. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): A Gateway to Freedom:<br>DIDs serve as the bedrock of user-centric digital identities within the ‘Know’ Identity Wallet. By eliminating the need for centralized registries, DIDs free users from the constraints of third-party control. These cryptographic identifiers are the cornerstone of identity ownership in a decentralized world.</p><p>3. Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Bridging Trust and Transparency:<br>Our Identity Wallet facilitates the sharing of tamper-proof credentials through VCs. These credentials, containing signed identity claims, redefine identity verification. The ability to selectively disclose information empowers users to maintain privacy while fostering transparency.</p><p>4.

 Trace Labs and BSI develop new solution for cross-border food transfers as UK adopts Electronic Trade Documents Bill <p>United Kingdom adopts the Electronic Trade Documents Bill as Trace Labs, core developers of OriginTrail open-source technology, and British Standards Institution (BSI), the business improvement and standards company established under Royal Charter, release a new solution developed for cross-border food transfers.</p><p>In an effort to streamline international trade and enhance efficiency, the United Kingdom has taken a significant step forward by adopting the Electronic Trade Documents Bill. On July 20, 2023, the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3344">Electronic Trade Documents Bill (ETDB)</a> received Royal Assent, and is officially an act of law (now the Electronic Trade Documents Act), promising to transform the way international trade is conducted electronically. This pivotal legislation seeks to digitize trade documents, eliminating cumbersome paperwork and facilitating seamless cross-border transactions.</p><p>The Electronic Trade Documents Bill marks a milestone in the modernization of global trade practices. With this landmark legislation, the UK aims to harness the power of technology to revolutionize the way trade documents are processed, ensuring quicker turnaround times, reduced costs, and improved security.</p><p>This groundbreaking act holds immense potential for businesses engaged in international trade, as it replaces traditional paper-based documentation with secure electronic trade documents. Additionally, it enables the use of digital signatures and advanced encryption technology, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of trade documents.</p><p>Parallelly, in response to the growing demands of cross-border food transfers, Trace Labs, core developers of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG for short), in collaboration with BSI, the business improvement and standards company established under Royal Charter, are pioneering an innovative solution that promises to revolutionize the industry. This new solution has been developed utilizing cutting-edge technology and industry expertise to address the complexities associated with international food transfers.</p><p>The solution is a direct result of the two-year “Trusted Bytes” project launched as part of The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund’s “Manufacturing Made Smarter Challenge”. To support the smoother flow of food products into and out of the UK, BSI used its broad experience to develop a standards-based operating model for the Trusted Bytes Data Trust framework. The model is designed to make it much easier for all parties to source and confirm information about products and ensure compliance, streamlining the processes for border-crossing.</p><p>As part of the project, BSI helped to build the framework by combining the benefits of traditional standards with emerging supply chain standards and innovative technologies such as OriginTrail DKG — the open source software developed by Trace Labs. This approach demonstrates how standards can be leveraged to support future technologies that promote data sharing, enabling users to verify information provenance across industry stakeholders, government agencies, and regulators for seamless and secure international trade. Prior work on data trust led by the University of Lincoln supported this activity.</p><p>BSI and Trace Labs also developed the advanced Trusted Trader framework, which showcases the future of trade compliance, assurance, and risk assessment, building on the globally recognized Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) scheme. The framework transforms supply chain data into discoverable, verifiable, and AI-ready Knowledge Assets. This enables UK customs to assess risk levels associated with incoming shipments in real-time from the departure right up until the arrival on UK soil, with the potential to make customs processes more focused and efficient. Technology enabled by SecureSystem Gmbh and Contained Technologies supported BSI and Trace Labs in showcasing this Trusted Trader demonstrator.</p><p>The project also focused on enabling a trusted data exchange to connect the supply chain with central government and other critical partners, enhancing cross border facilitation, compliance, and security. The framework, developed within Trusted Bytes, is reusable and can be deployed by government agencies globally to help infuse trust and transparency into their cross-border processes.</p><p>Jurij Skornik, Trace Labs’ General Manager: “With the King signing off on the Electronic Trade Documents Bill (ETDB), businesses can now utilize electronic trade documents, laying a robust foundation for improving trade sustainability, increasing trade value, and enabling AI-powered trade solutions. The criteria set out in the bill are perfectly aligned with the logic of OriginTrail Knowledge Assets that can provide discoverability, ownership, and verifiability to any trade document — all backed by blockchain.</p><p>Supported by Innovate UK, Trace Labs already worked with BSI, SecureSystem, and other partners on a solution to facilitate international trade in the UK, using OriginTrail Knowledge Assets and the same principles as set out in the bill. This solution turns paper trade documents such as CMR and Bill of Lading into Knowledge Assets on OriginTrail DKG, giving them ownership (transferability) and verifiability. This provides an easy and trusted way for UK customs to assess the risk of a shipment based on trusted and verifiable trade documents and data. It also sets a strong foundation for AI-powered search of trade data based on OriginTrail trusted knowledge infrastructure, which will be available soon.”</p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a> is the core developer of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> — the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

 By Adrian Doerk  <p></p><p>Decentralized Identity is a rapidly evolving field. Its potential to transform the way digital identities are managed and protected has not gone unnoticed. The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) has been at the vanguard of this movement, working tirelessly to develop the technologies and standards necessary for its realisation. In Europe, the eIDAS regulation has set the stage for the creation of a European Digital Identity Wallet, a secure means for citizens to access online services throughout the EU. DIF and its members have been busy supporting this initiative through a range of activities, such as participating in large-scale pilots and developing concepts and prototypes for hardware binding and wallet attestation. In this blog post, we will explore the role of DIF in advancing the European Digital Identity Wallet and examine the various activities undertaken by its members in support of this crucial project.<br></p><p>Introduction to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</p><p>DIF is a collaborative effort that brings together organisations, developers, and researchers from around the world. It seeks to promote the development and adoption of Decentralized Identity technologies, which have the potential to revolutionise the way we manage our digital selves. By working together, the members of DIF aim to create a future in which individuals have greater control over their personal data and are able to interact with others in a more secure and privacy-preserving manner.<br></p><p>In order to achieve this vision, DIF promotes the development of open standards and protocols. It also provides tools and resources that enable developers to build Decentralized Identity solutions. Since its inception, DIF has attracted a large and diverse membership, which includes both established industry players and innovative startups. This collaborative ecosystem is crucial to driving the adoption of Decentralized Identity technologies and ensuring their long-term success.<br></p><p>Understanding eIDAS, the European Digital Identity Wallet and the Large Scale Pilots</p><p>eIDAS, which stands for Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services, is an EU regulation that was first introduced in 2014. Its purpose is to establish a single framework for the secure and seamless provision of digital services across the European Union. One of the key components of eIDAS is the European Digital Identity Wallet, a software application enabling citizens and organisations the management of verifiable identity information and seamless access to online services.<br></p><p>The legislative process of the revised eIDAS regulation is accompanied by four large-scale pilots, which are being carried out across the EU and aim to provide policy makers with the necessary real world experience and feedback. These pilots serve as testbeds for the development and evaluation of the wallet's features, as well as its integration with online services. The results of these pilots will help inform the development of the wallet and ensure that it meets the needs of European citizens and businesses.<br></p><p>The Role of DIF and Its Members' Activities in Supporting the success of the European Digital Identity Wallet</p><p>DIF members have been actively involved in the design and development of &nbsp;identity solutions and digital identity wallets for years already. Many of them are now participating in the large-scale pilots, where they help to test and refine the wallet's features and functionality. <br></p><p>DIF members have been addressing key challenges in developing a secure European Digital Identity Wallet, including hardware binding and wallet attestation. They have been working on concepts and prototypes to securely bind the wallet to the user's device using techniques like secure hardware modules and cryptographic methods. Wallet attestation involves using cryptographic proofs to verify the authenticity and integrity of the wallet's contents, ensuring trustworthiness for service providers and relying parties. The secure wallet working group spearheaded by German Bundesdruckerei and wallet provider Lissi <a href="https://idunion.org/2023/05/09/konzepte-fuer-wallet-sicherheit-in-ssi/?lang=en&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">demonstrated a working prototype</a> within the scope of IDunion. This work could lay the foundation for the European Digital Identity Wallet and its users.<br></p><p>The Crucial Role of Relationships When Building Trust: A Case for DIDComm</p><p>Trust is a fundamental aspect of any identity system, and Decentralized Identity is no exception. In the context of the European Digital Identity Wallet, the ability to establish and maintain persistent relationships between individuals and organisations is essential for ensuring its success. DIDComm, a protocol developed by DIF, offers a potential solution to this challenge and could be an interesting addition to European Digital Identity Wallets.<br></p><p>DIDComm enables secure and privacy-preserving communication between parties that have been identified using decentralized identifiers (DIDs). This allows individuals and organisations to establish trusted relationships with persistent communication channels, which are persistent and enable organisations to push information to end-users instead of requiring a pull. DIDComm's use of end-to-end encryption and other security features ensures that these relationships remain secure and private, which is vital for preserving user trust and fostering a healthy digital identity ecosystem.<br></p><p>In addition to its potential role in the European Digital Identity Wallet, DIDComm has broad applicability across a range of industries and use cases. Its ability to facilitate secure and privacy-preserving communication makes it an ideal foundation for the development of a wide variety of Decentralized Identity solutions for citizens and organisations alike. <br></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The European Digital Identity Wallet represents an ambitious and transformative initiative that aims to provide a secure and seamless digital identity solution for citizens across the EU. The Decentralized Identity Foundation and its members have played an important role in supporting the development of digital identity wallets in general, contributing their expertise and resources to the advancement of this crucial global development. From participating in large-scale pilots to developing cutting-edge concepts and prototypes for hardware binding and wallet attestation, DIF members have demonstrated their commitment to the success of the European Digital Identity Wallet and the broader Decentralized Identity ecosystem. As we continue to explore the potential of Decentralized Identity technologies, the collaborations and innovations fostered by organisations like DIF will be essential for shaping a more secure and privacy-preserving future for digital identity management.<br><br></p><p>About the Author:</p><p>Adrian Doerk focuses on providing user-centric digital identity services with digital wallets, which ensure privacy and empowerment of the individual.

<p>ZKLadder is a venture studio building products that connect physical and digital environments. They empower creators and brands of all sizes to connect authentic physical objects with digital records, like NFT’s, using a self-sovereign design.</p><p>ZKLadder’s authenticity platform uses an innovative physical labeling solution based on unclonable three-dimensional identifiers and optical scanning technology. A unique 3D tag is adhered to a physical object and can be scanned and validated with the camera on any mobile device.</p><p>“The Ceramic data storage protocol is ideal for extending our core platform guarantees of self-sovereignty, open and permissionless access to data, and censorship resistance,” the ZKLadder team says. </p><blockquote>“Our labels last for decades, so it’s imperative that we leverage a sustainable protocol. You have to believe in the design, but moreover the people and their ability to evolve and thrive in Web3. This is why we selected Ceramic.”</blockquote> The Story of ZKLadder <p>ZKLadder is a seasoned Web3 engineering group that collaborates with mechanical engineering PHD’s and professors at Stony Brook University with deep experience and patented technology in consumer goods authentication. They have married a unique optical scanning and authentication technology with a scalable, trustless Web3 platform.</p><p>ZKLadder utilized ComposeDB on Ceramic to develop a solution that connects patented, tamper-resistant physical labels to NFT’s on any EVM compatible blockchain.</p><p>The tech offers a low cost way to prove the source authenticity of a physical thing using the camera on any phone. While it has wide applicability across many verticals such as merchandise, fashion and cannabis—ZKLadder has gone to market leveraging the real demand that exists today in generative art and photography markets.</p><p>Several well-known and successful artists have used the platform to create authentic physical prints linked to their NFT art collections. This system allows these creators to offer their collectors authentic, one-of-one prints of the NFT tokens they own.</p> The Challenge Before Ceramic <p>When initially designing their stack, one of the key decisions revolved around where and how to store the data necessary for ZKLadder apps, and consequently an end user’s mobile device to authenticate and identify a physical label through a scan.</p><p>Every physical label that gets linked to an NFT through the ZKLadder platform is accompanied by a digital &nbsp;'Certificate of Authenticity' (COA) that encodes the unique label data, describes the underlying physical object, and identifies its NFT counterpart.</p><p>“We could have chosen to store these COA’s in a centralized database for maximal control and convenience, but doing that would ultimately lead us down the path of a centralized (and fragmented) technology provider, and would severely limit our ability to pursue our roadmap of decentralization (open sourcing authentication stack, white labeling mobile app, establishing a DAO, etc.),” said the ZKLadder team.</p><p>Another alternative would have been to pursue an on-chain data storage strategy, which would ensure maximal data availability, but with their goal of eventually certifying hundreds and thousands of physical items across many verticals—it quickly became apparent that this would be cost prohibitive even on a Layer 2 or sidechain. Other challenges with on-chain storage included difficulty in updating the shape of data once it is deployed, and limits in indexing and query functionality.</p><p>“With Ceramic, and specifically ComposeDB, we found a solution that was flexible enough to store many types of data records (through straightforward model creation), and could do it at scale and at lower cost, without sacrificing on our goal of building an open and composable data set,” the ZKLadder team said.</p> Why ZKLadder Chose Ceramic &amp; ComposeDB <p>The ecosystem for application-scale decentralized data storage is in its early stages, according to the ZKLadder team.</p><p>“One major concern with many of Ceramic’s competitors was that they would not be production-ready for some time, with an even greater gap to reaching the kind of battle-tested performance guarantees that developers rely on,” they said.</p><blockquote>What excited us the most about Ceramic, besides all of the useful functionality being built on ComposeDB, was the maturity of the network, with many products and platforms appearing to utilize it in production and an active forum where problems and questions are addressed on a continuous basis.</blockquote><p>Seeing many builder groups utilizing Ceramic made ZKLadder’s team feel secure in following a trodden path. They also understand the power of network effects, and strongly believe that Ceramic will continue to grow and coalesce energy. </p><p>By joining the pool of apps building on ComposeDB, the team is opting into a world where collaborating with other builder groups is possible without having to worry about significant development overhead.</p> How ZKLadder Built With ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>ZKLadder relies on ComposeDB today, in production, to store a data set of 'Certificates of Authenticity' that their application uses to authenticate each physical label, and identify the underlying physical artwork and NFT that it is connected to.</p><p>To power this functionality, they primarily rely on two models:</p>  <a href="https://s3.xyz/streams/stream/kjzl6hvfrbw6ca5y7upkmpt2poqi4zpyt1x4jvjs2jdqzgblzh8go4urodcp4fu?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Label Model</a> - Stores data necessary for the authentication of each <a href="https://docs.iterati.art/core-concepts/inimitable-physical-labels?ref=blog.ceramic.network">unique physical label</a>, primarily the 'imageData' field that encodes each label’s unique combination of microbead colors and positions  <a href="https://s3.xyz/streams/stream/kjzl6hvfrbw6c7n1wzu7mx4xmcundh1r7t3sgsupkb5i10n0ykergeeavfc4wno?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Certificate Model</a> - Stores data necessary to link a label to an NFT, including the contract address and token ID, along with optional descriptions of the underlying physical object  <p>A typical interaction from an end user’s point of view (authenticating an item) would look like this:</p><p>An example of this flow in action can be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsWQ1KNt-BE/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p><p>“Through our art focused POC platform, called Iterati, we have certified over 500 physical artworks from several artists active on <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Artblocks</a>, <a href="https://www.brightmoments.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Bright Moments</a>, and <a href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">FXHash</a>, and distributed them to hundreds of collectors and enthusiasts, all using ComposeDB behind the scenes,” the team says.</p><p>At the moment, ZKLadder is using ComposeDB simply as a data storage solution in order to create a more resilient and censorship-resistant platform, but they are extremely excited about their longer-term roadmap of decentralizing the toolkit, allowing anyone, anywhere to tag and certify any form of physical object and own the COA itself as is possible with Ceramic’s DID-based authentication scheme.</p><p>“We envision a world where hundreds of creators, brands, and builder groups are able to, in a self-sovereign way, attest to the authenticity of any object, and for a wide variety of applications to have the ability to validate this claim of authenticity and then determine if it came from a trustworthy DID,” the team says.</p> Get in Touch <p>Generative artists and photographers looking to transform their digital art into something unique, authentic and physical can check out their platform here: <a href="https://iterati.art/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://iterati.art</a></p><p>Or if you're just curious about the tech and want to learn more feel free to reach out to their team here: <a href="mailto:chris.tiu@zkladder.com">chris.tiu@zkladder.com</a></p>

		<p>Used by more than five hundred institutions around the globe, the CAUDIT Higher Education Reference Models (HERM) are a standard set of business and data architectures relevant to higher education. Institutions can use these resources as a touchstone to increase the value and efficiency of their operations and as a tool to engage key stakeholders. The first version of the HERM models was launched in 2016 and has since evolved after a collaboration between the Council of Australasian University Directors of Information Technology (CAUDIT), UCISA, EDUCAUSE, and European University Information Systems (EUNIS), which adopted and endorsed the global standard in 2021.</p>
<p>One of the HERM models, the Business Capability Model (BCM), is a comprehensive framework for planning and managing adaptive business capabilities in a highly dynamic world. Institutions can use this resource as a reference for business stakeholders, enterprise architects, and technology strategists to engage in informed discussions regarding business effectiveness, needs, and challenges. More specifically, the BCM serves as an anchor for assessing perspectives such as strategic importance, maturity, business operational pain points, capital investment, and organizational structure.</p>
<p>Creating a Common Language<br>
Along with using enterprise storytelling to engage effectively with stakeholders, referencing the HERM models allows institutions to foster a holistic understanding of their organization and gain valuable insight into how they can guide operational and strategic planning. This closer look helps stakeholders to invest in the capabilities that will deliver the most important business outcomes and connect these business objectives to the information and technology necessary to support them. “In the past, organizations didn’t have a common language that identified the capabilities that were required to manageably achieve their business outcomes,” explains Dan Miller, Associate Vice President, EdgeMarket. “Oftentimes, we would have to speak in the language of vendors, which apart from a few standard terms, was vastly different. Now, the promise of a business capabilities model out of the HERM provides a well-developed taxonomy and lexicon that institutions can use as a roadmap to help align their business needs and IT strategies and architectures.”</p>
<p>Adopting these models also supports the exchange of architectural knowledge and best practices throughout the higher education community. “As more members of the consortium map themselves to this framework, we create a common language within the community,” continues Miller. “This agreed upon body of terms and definitions helps accelerate our understanding of member needs, enhance the ability of each institution to prioritize their investments and support interoperability and collaboration between member organizations.”</p>
<p>Adopting the BCM<br>
Seeing the value of the BCM and how these practices could help member institutions succeed in managing their business capabilities, Edge is currently working on adopting this model and will help members of the consortium to understand its uses and benefits. Chris Markham, Edge’s Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, added, “We encourage institutions to explore the BCM and we will be offering educational opportunities to learn more about applying these standards to create a customized roadmap. Edge plans to explore new and extended services and use this model to plan procurements and categorize and evaluate our solutions and vendors in EdgeMarket. I believe the sky’s the limit with what we can accomplish by creating a common language within the higher education community. Much like institutions are cataloging and managing their curriculums to support business goals and serve the needs of their students and faculty, the BCM can empower organizations to apply the same approach to business management. By using the BCM as a tool, institutions can more accurately identify the overarching needs of their organization and better strategize IT solutions that will bring their short- and long-term goals to fruition.”</p>

		<p>A leader in STEM education, research, and economic development, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) recently implemented a plan to upgrade their high performance computing (HPC) resources on campus. As part of this initiative, NJIT partnered with Databank to build this HPC environment at their data center in Piscataway, N.J. Driven by their continued growth in research initiatives, this new addition aims to improve the performance of NJIT’s research computing environment and capabilities. To deploy this HPC environment and have the capacity to utilize this resource, NJIT needed significant bandwidth, both in the number of circuits, the amount of bandwidth per circuit, and the ability for those services to be available one hundred percent of the time.</p>
<p>To fulfill this need for redundant services, NJIT looked to long-time partner, Edge, to provide an exceptional connectivity experience through their optical fiber network, EdgeNet. In the past, Edge has provided external services to NJIT, including connectivity to the Internet, peering infrastructure, and cloud services platform. With this recent expansion, Edge is helping operate internal network resources that the University depends on by building and operating an optical infrastructure that sits inside EdgeNet.</p>

		<p>Tapping into expertise and experience<br>
When first exploring the implementation of this new HPC cluster, NJIT knew these resources would require high bandwidth and highly available services to connect back to the main campus. At first, the University considered investing in the optical hardware, but discovered the operational expenses for the fiber leases, the ongoing hardware support, and staff augmentation and training to build and manage this kind of environment could be challenging and expensive. Plus, multiple circuits needed to be built and maintained over these two geographically diverse fiber paths, in addition to having team members monitor the service, troubleshoot issues, and dispatch the correct resources to restore services in the event of an outage.</p>
<p>With these requirements and responsibilities being native to Edge, NJIT could tap into the knowledge, resources, and support of the consortium and meet the needs of this new HPC environment without having to make their own capital investment in the hardware infrastructure. Working with Edge, NJIT was able to achieve the bandwidth they needed today, while also receiving an economically scalable platform for the future. Plus, by counting on Edge’s experienced network team who are well versed in operating these types of networks across the region, NJIT reduced their need to hire additional staff and train them on these new technologies and hardware platforms.</p>
<p>Meeting current and future bandwidth needs<br>
The majority of Edge’s core infrastructure is a shared service for all member institutions to utilize. For this project, NJIT had specific requirements for the fiber and hardware that would be deployed to support these services. By dedicating the platform to NJIT, the University will have the room to grow and can add bandwidth circuits to the platform without incurring additional expenses. Most importantly, since the service is exclusively dedicated to NJIT and the specific application, they will not have to worry about other members’ activities or common disruptions that can be seen on the consortium network. As one of just three R1 universities in New Jersey, adding these new HPC resources will help NJIT continue to pursue national and international recognition in research and expand their influence within the innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>Through their customized solutions and services, Edge can help boost cost savings and operational efficiency to member institutions like NJIT.

		<p>For many years, Edge has partnered with member institutions to help them develop technology strategies and find solutions that will assist in advancing their missions. As the wave of digital transformation continued to grow and new opportunities arrived, organizations were tasked with finding ways to keep pace in a rapidly changing world. Unfortunately, without the right information or expertise, many institutions have faced challenges in developing a strategic and cost-effective plan that will allow them to digitally evolve. “Oftentimes, institutions may be facing a lack of communication between technology systems or a lack of visibility into both business processes and data,” says Christopher R. Markham, Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Revenue Officer, Edge. They may also have uncertainty around their spend in technology; are their technology investments best matched for their institution’s goals, size, and capabilities? Edge can help reveal valuable insight into their current technology ecosystem and assess digital transformation readiness, along with ensuring that an organization can optimize their return on investment as they continue to grow their technology program.”</p>
<p>Designed to provide a 360-degree view, the Enterprise 360 (E360) Assessment is a comprehensive review of all things technology, where the EdgePro team examines an institution’s current-state technology program and digital footprint and helps pinpoint where they can optimize technology investments in software, equipment, and staff. “The ‘E’ in E360 means everything, so Edge will look at an organization’s IT strategy, operations, governance, economic approach, data, cyber infrastructure, cybersecurity capacity, and their entire technology stack,” explains Markham. “We also spend two days onsite to meet with stakeholders and team members to gain a deeper understanding of the technology program. After the assessment is completed, Edge will provide a detailed report of the areas within the current technology and cyber infrastructure to focus on immediately and then a road map for digital transformation going forward.”</p>
<p>Conducting a Holistic Assessment<br>
The E360 Assessment begins with an investigation of the vision of the institution and the current information technology and enterprise architecture that is in place to support these goals. “Edge will look at all of the key information technology disciplines; what we call reference disciplines,” explains Markham. “This includes groups like applications, cybersecurity, educational technologies, and service management. We then look at the vision of the whole group and how they’re being informed by the enterprise architecture. We investigate the technologies and business processes that gather requirements from the overall institutional groups and look for opportunities and solutions that could improve these processes.”</p>
<p>“Next, we determine what a migration plan might look like, an IT governance model, and how we would implement a governance group,” continues Markham. “We also want to determine how an organization can establish a permanent change management function once this governance group is implemented—allowing the institution to continue to grow and change as their needs evolve.”</p>
<p>As part of the E360 Assessment, Edge will also explore educational technologies and the pedagogical framework that are in place to support the overall technology strategy. “We look at the current instructional design and methodologies and conduct a detailed analysis of existing cyber infrastructure, including wireless connectivity and cloud migration strategy,” shares Markham. “Our chief information officer will conduct a cybersecurity assessment to examine the NSIT framework, as well as the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS). This integrity assessment of an organization’s routing looks at the kind of controls and best practices that are in place to reduce routing threats.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Cybersecurity Program Assessment</p>
<p>Included in the E360 Assessment is a cybersecurity program assessment conducted by Edge’s Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) to evaluate the maturity of the organization’s security program, understand their current risk exposure, and identify ways they can reduce the risk of a data breach.</p>
<p>An organization will receive tailored, actionable recommendations to:<br>
Identify gaps&nbsp; •&nbsp; Improve overall security posture&nbsp; •&nbsp; Reduce risk&nbsp; •&nbsp; Mitigate the impact of security incidents</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Providing Actionable Items<br>
Throughout the six- to eight-week process, the E360 is a blended model of onsite visits and virtual meetings to connect with all functional areas of the college or university. Upon completion of the assessment, along with a final report outlining its findings, an institution will also receive a review of their business process models and the technology solutions and services that aim to support them. “In addition to an executive summary that evaluates all the domains, we provide a customized three-year roadmap for digital transformation,” says Markham. “Edge will also outline ways to measure the return on investment along the digital transformation journey. We show you how to measure if there is an increase in efficiency and productivity of labor units. For example, improving the time it takes to send files or data, or increasing uptime and reducing downtime of systems. The assessment also provides ways to improve workflow and reduce the cost of operation. We see if there are ways to reduce the cost through economies of scale and if there are duplicate systems that can be consolidated.”</p>
<p>“Increased efficiency, improved services, and reduction in cost of operation—these are the key components in a net gain from IT investment,” continues Markham. “E360 is designed to provide a better understanding of an institution’s frameworks and methodologies and how to achieve an optimal return on investment. If you seek the data to make informed decisions, if you wish to calculate your return on investment of your IT infrastructure and systems, and if want to align technology and the academic and administrative mission and vision of your organization, then the E360 Assessment can provide the insight and direction that you need.”</p>

		<p>Providing students and educators with reliable, exceptional IT help desk support is becoming increasingly important in the higher education community. Around five years ago, Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU) set out to find a new help desk service provider for their students, faculty, and staff after their previous provider since 2002 was sold to a new company — leading to degraded service and a dramatic increase in cost. “We were facing a six-figure increase with zero flexibility and degraded service, and I had no time to implement a new system,” explains Neal Sturm, Vice President, and Chief Information Officer, FDU. “I immediately went to Dan Miller at Edge and asked for assistance in building an RFP. We were looking for a long-term relationship with a provider who could offer high-quality support to our students, faculty, and staff. Once we were down to two companies in the RFP process, one being BlackBeltHelp, Edge introduced me to BlackBeltHelp’s leadership team, which was very helpful in making an informed decision.”</p>
<p>BlackBeltHelp is the top AI-powered Contact-Center-as-a-Service provider for students, faculty, and staff in higher education, and is one of the providers offered through EdgeMarket, Edge’s technology, software, and services purchasing co-op. EdgeMarket enables participants to work directly with vendors and accelerate purchasing via a validated contract mechanism. “In looking for a partner who offers superior help desk support, Edge collaborated closely with our members and EdgeMarket participants to craft and award an RFP,” says Dan Miller, Associate Vice President, EdgeMarket. “BlackBeltHelp’s reputation for excellence in 24×7 service for a wide range of applications makes them an ideal partner for EdgeMarket participants looking to lighten the help desk support load on internal teams. Working with them will enable IT staff to focus more on strategic, value-add initiatives, and less on transactional tasks like help desk tickets.”</p>
<p>Offering Seamless Support<br>
In 2022, FDU awarded 24×7 &amp; Blackboard® Help Desk Support RFP to BlackBeltHelp where users can receive support at all hours of the day. The University will also leverage the Simplify Platform to assist users with features such as simplify advisor, chatbot, SMS nudging, and self-help. “We wanted to find a company where the people will provide the same level of support as our own team members,” says Sturm. “The end users need to see the help desk team as if they are your own, not an outsourced company. We achieved this with BlackBeltHelp. They are our Tier 1 Help Desk and IT support and can help with proprietary applications, password changes, or any technology-related issues our users might encounter.”</p>
<p>BlackBeltHelp currently serves over 200 higher education clients, including Cornell University, UCLA, Pasadena City College, and Community College of Baltimore County. Help desk services provided by the organization have historically reduced average time-to-answer to less than 60 seconds, while reducing operational costs by up to 40%. Once the launch date was determined, Sturm says the BlackBeltHelp’s implementation team met with him and his team every single week to monitor progress, gain institutional knowledge, and understand the procedures necessary to ensure a seamless support experience for FDU users.</p>

		<p>“BlackBeltHelp is not a software solution, it’s a people solution,” says Sturm. “In our case, we used their ticketing system which was Salesforce based, for the first year. We are now using our system which is TopDesk, a full ITSM, and that connects to their Salesforce through an application developed by their team which they call Simplify. We selected a model of six U.S.-based dedicated team members, plus international-based shared resources for overflow and evening hours. This service is their core competency and they take care of the hiring, training, and management of the staff.”</p>
<p>For institutions considering outsourcing Tier 1 Help Desk functions, Sturm recommends partnering with Edge and EdgeMarket. “Work with the Edge team to develop, release, and review a comprehensive RFP that includes all the functions and tools you would like to see in use. As part of your due diligence, I would also recommend talking to references directly to better understand how their solutions and services can support your team and overall organization.”</p>

		<p>As the current Vice President for the New Jersey Council of County Colleges (NJCCC) and the Executive Director of the New Jersey Community College Consortium for Workforce and Economic Development, Catherine Frugé Starghill, Esq. has a solid history in workforce development. As a leader of the statewide coalition of partners for the New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities initiative, she aims to help build a stronger economy in the region by aligning education to the needs of the workforce community. “I began my career in workforce development in 2012 at the NJ Department of Labor and that is where I developed a passion for these types of initiatives,” says Starghill. “I experienced many roles, including the Director of Workforce Development, Executive Director of Workforce Development, and then later, Deputy Commissioner of the Department.”</p>
<p>Recognizing that one of the largest workforce development training providers is community colleges, Starghill says her current position allows her to be more effective in driving initiatives forward. “By being entrenched with the community colleges in the region, we have been more successful in ensuring that workforce development and the academic side of community colleges work together to help more New Jersey residents have access to college credit that can lead to a credential or degree attainment opportunity. The New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities is dedicated to building a talent ecosystem and creating roadmaps that align curriculum across educational partners that help students and workers become lifelong learners.”</p>
<p>Pathways for the Future Workforce<br>
The New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities Initiative in partnership with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association (NJBIA) has been very successful and has accumulated over 1,200 industry and education partners. “The NJBIA ensured we had the voice of industry guiding us and helped us make informed decisions,” says Starghill. “During the pandemic, we saw enrollments in all post-secondary education institutions plummet and resources were substantially reduced. This situation created an environment where many institutions that might not have collaborated in the past were now open to connecting and working more closely together.”</p>
<p>Aimed at creating workforce development pathways for the future workforce, the New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities program focuses on four key industries that drive the state’s economy: Health Services; Technology and Innovation; Infrastructure and Energy; and Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management. “There are ten Centers of Workforce Innovation that are each focused on an occupational area,” explains Starghill. “Within each area, we develop pathways and training from high school to community college to four-year colleges and universities, including labor unions, community-based training providers, and workforce development boards. We ultimately want to create on-ramps to opportunity.”</p>

		<p>Aligning Curriculum and Workforce Skills<br>
The initiative celebrated its one-year anniversary in April 2023 with notable accomplishments. “Across the ten Centers of Workforce Innovation, we have twenty high schools and vocational technical schools; nine four-year colleges and universities; eight labor unions; and four community-based training providers and education associations that engage in smaller work groups to connect and enhance the 22 pathways,” says Starghill. “We have multiple pilot programs currently running, like high school career awareness and contextualized adult literacy training. There are also four-year universities, including Rowan University, that participate in our Centers of Workforce Innovation and are reviewing their curriculum and courses. Rowan is building a couple of bachelor’s degree programs in conjunction with community colleges to ensure all credits transfer to the major curriculum courses. This will help maximize transferability of community college credits for the students. We owe this to our New Jersey residents, so their investment and effort result in the maximum credit and degree attainment possible.”</p>
<p>Starghill says having multiple pathways is essential, especially since everyone’s life situation is different. “An individual’s education and training pathway is not linear. Life happens — you get married, have children, or have to take time off to care for a sick parent. We must create multiple on-ramps and off-ramps to make things easier for individuals to return to their education and training pathway.”</p>
<p>Empowering Community College Students<br>
As organizations like NJCCC and the New Jersey Community College Consortium for Workforce and Economic Development continue to better align community college courses to four-year colleges and universities, Starghill says they look to expand their network and make connections with partners like Edge and NJ Transfer to further support these pathways. “We need to better align community college courses to four-year colleges and universities. Through our ongoing&nbsp; meetings and discussions with education and workforce partners, we find many four-year institutions are surprised by how advanced community college students are in only two years. Typically, a student in community college spends the first year taking general education courses and then enters into their major during their second year. We’re seeing many students at the community colleges are actually more advanced by year two than their counterparts at a four-year university.”</p>
<p>“Our employer partners in technology and innovation, for example, are also amazed by this trend and have said during panels that they are changing their perspective to focus more on community college students,” continues Starghill. “Companies like Microsoft and Google have noted that rising juniors from four-year colleges and universities often have not had any IT courses yet, but many community college students are further along. We look forward to exploring more of these insights and finding ways to strengthen partnerships between the education and business community. We will continue to help our partners align curriculum with the future – forward skills and credentials that are in demand within New Jersey’s key industries.”</p>

 8. Smart Contracts Unleashed: Unraveling the Magic of DIAM’s Digital Agreements for a Smarter&nbsp;Future! Image by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> Introduction <blockquote>In the digital era, where autonomy and security are paramount, traditional methods of contract execution fall short of the mark. Enter the realm of smart contracts, an ingenious innovation that’s reshaping the landscape of business interactions and transactions.</blockquote><p>In this comprehensive guide, we embark on a journey to decode the concept of smart contracts and delve into their profound importance within the realm of Decentralized Identity and Access Management (DIAM).</p> Understanding Smart Contracts: A Glimpse into the&nbsp;Future <p>At its core, a smart contract is a self-executing agreement that’s coded onto a blockchain. Unlike traditional contracts that require intermediaries and manual enforcement, smart contracts automatically execute and enforce terms as predefined conditions are met. This revolutionary technology operates on the principle of “if-then” logic, ensuring that agreements are executed without the need for intermediaries.</p> The Role of Smart Contracts in&nbsp;DIAM <p>Smart contracts shine particularly bright in the domain of DIAM. Let’s explore why they’re a game-changer:</p><p>1. Enhanced Security:<br>Traditional identity and access management systems often involve a central authority, introducing vulnerabilities. Smart contracts, on the other hand, operate on a decentralized blockchain, making them inherently more secure. Every action and transaction is cryptographically secured and immutable, minimizing the risk of tampering or unauthorized access.</p><p>2. Immutable Identity Attributes:<br>Smart contracts enable the storage of identity attributes on the blockchain in a tamper-proof manner. This ensures that your personal information, qualifications, and credentials remain unaltered and credible. With the power of blockchain, you’re in control of your identity like never&nbsp;before.</p><p>3. Transparent Identity Verification:<br>The transparency of blockchain underpins the verification of identity claims. Organizations can verify identity attributes without divulging sensitive information. This selective disclosure enhances privacy while building trust between&nbsp;parties.</p><p>4. Streamlined Credential Verification:<br>Smart contracts streamline the verification of credentials. Instead of relying on manual checks, third-party verifications, or lengthy paperwork, the blockchain-enabled process accelerates verification, reducing delays and enhancing efficiency.</p><p>5. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):<br>Smart contracts embody the principles of SSI, where individuals have full ownership and control over their identities. With your identity attributes stored on the blockchain, you determine what to share and with whom, granting you ultimate autonomy.</p> Embracing the Power of Smart Contracts in&nbsp;DIAM <p>1. Transparent Verification:<br>Imagine a world where your academic credentials, professional certifications, and personal information are verifiable at a glance. Smart contracts enable this transparency, allowing swift and trustworthy verification.</p><p>2. Self-Executing Consent:<br>With smart contracts, you can define the terms of consent for sharing identity attributes. These conditions are executed automatically, ensuring that data is shared only as per your predetermined preferences.</p><p>3. Automated Access Management:<br>Smart contracts revolutionize access management. They can automatically grant or revoke access based on predefined rules, reducing administrative burden and enhancing security.</p><p>4. Strengthened Trust:<br>Smart contracts foster trust in transactions and interactions. As identity claims are verified in a transparent and tamper-proof manner, parties can engage with confidence.</p> Conclusion: <blockquote>As we traverse the landscape of DIAM, smart contracts emerge as the bridge between innovation and security. They infuse transparency, security, and automation into identity and access management, fostering a new era of control and trust. In a world where autonomy and privacy are prized, smart contracts redefine the rules, empowering you to take charge of your digital identity like never&nbsp;before.</blockquote><p>Ready to embrace the power of smart contracts in DIAM? Step into a future where transactions and interactions are secure, transparent, and efficient — all powered by the ingenuity of smart contracts.</p><blockquote><a href="http://www.know.cards/">Know</a> more about&nbsp;us!</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://us3r.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R Network</a> is a revolutionary development platform and dApps ecosystem that empowers developers to build with composable data using Ceramic. It offers an integrated suite of toolkits including <a href="https://u3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R dApps Profile</a>, <a href="https://s3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R Data Explorer</a> and <a href="https://console.s3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R dApps Developer Console</a>—enabling developers to harness the power of Ceramic's dynamic and composable data layer for decentralized storage. By leveraging Ceramic, US3R Network enables the easy creation of applications with interoperable and composable data that lives on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).</p> The Story of US3R Network <p>The current state of the web is centralized and controlled by a few large companies. These companies have a monopoly on our data and our identities. They can use our data to track us, target us with ads, and even sell our data to third parties. The current state of the web is not interoperable because user data remains in silos, we’re unable to share our data and interact with each other across different platforms.</p><p>US3R leverages the network effect, a principle that the team says is often exploited by applications such as Google and Facebook through user accounts or logins. These Web2 applications harness the network effect to attract users and extract value from their interactions.</p><p>However, unlike these traditional models, US3R Network incorporates Web3 protocols, which offer users more control by virtue of their accounts being keypairs that the users themselves control. Despite the added control, Web3 protocols also necessitate a different infrastructure to support UI/UX at the protocol layer. This allows users to interact with the protocol via a universal third-party client, removing the reliance on the official dApps. The US3R Network fulfills this need for offchain data, taking inspiration from tools like Metamask and Etherscan.</p><p>US3R Network created U3, a platform-less utility tool designed specifically for managing self-sovereign data and applications. This opens up a new avenue of possibilities, allowing users to gain control over their data. Additionally, US3R Network offers S3, a development platform that enables developers to build dApps utilizing self-sovereign data. This combined suite of tools and platforms makes US3R Network an innovative solution for users and developers alike to gain control of their data and identities.</p><p>US3R Network is built on three core components:</p>  U3 is a decentralized identity wallet that allows users to store their data and credentials on the blockchain. U3 is interoperable with other blockchains, so users can take their data with them wherever they go. U3 is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the EIP-4337 standard for decentralized identities.  S3 is a decentralized data layer that makes it easy to share and manage data across different applications. S3 is built on Ceramic, a scalable and secure data storage platform.  3R is a decentralized social layer that allows users to connect with friends and colleagues across different social networks. 3R is built on ActivityPub, an open protocol for federated social networking. ActivityPub allows users to own their data and control how it is shared.  <p>US3R Network is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the web. By giving users control of their data and identities, US3R Network can make the web more interoperable, and user-centric.</p> How US3R Network Built With Ceramic <p>“The scope of Web3 was primarily focused on DeFi, with little room for non-financial applications,” the US3R team says. “It was a limiting factor, hindering 99% of non-financial use cases from being developed. Ceramic, however, brings about a paradigm shift, enabling the development of applications that extend beyond finance.”</p><p>Before adopting Ceramic, US3R S3 faced the challenge of supporting interactive dApps with dynamic and structured data. Traditional blockchains and storage solutions like IPFS, Arweave, and BNB GreedField were either too slow or lacked support for structured and dynamic data. Recognizing the need for a more powerful data infrastructure, US3R Network sought a solution that would enable them to build decentralized applications without sacrificing interoperability.</p><p>The decision to partner with Ceramic was driven by the recognition of Ceramic's innovative approach to data storage and its strong alignment with US3R Network's goals, the team says. Ceramic's ability to support mutable data and composable data stood out as a game-changer for US3R Network's development ecosystem. By leveraging Ceramic's technology and toolkits, US3R Network could offer developers the flexibility and capabilities required to build purely decentralized and interoperable dApps.</p><p>Integrating Ceramic into their development platform and ecosystem S3, US3R Network unlocked a new realm of possibilities. The seamless integration of S3 Data Explorer, and S3 Developer Console empowered developers to interact with mutable data and leverage composable data structures. These features provided developers with the necessary tools to efficiently build interactive dApps with dynamic and structured data.</p><p>S3 Data Explorer is crucial for the interoperability and composability of decentralized data on Ceramic because it provides a way to understand the structure and semantics of data. This is essential for building applications that can use data from different sources and combine it in new ways. More specifically, S3 Data Explorer can be used to:</p><p>Discover data. Data and data model explorers can be used to discover data that is available on the Ceramic network. This can be helpful for developers who are looking for data to use in their applications.</p><p>Understand the structure of data. Data and data model explorers can be used to understand the structure of data. This can be helpful for developers who want to know how to use data in their applications.</p><p>Learn about the semantics of data. Data and data model explorers can be used to learn about the semantics of data. This can be helpful for developers who want to know what data means.</p><p>S3 Developer Console is another important building block created by US3R. A visual developer Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a game-changer when it comes to improving the developer experience. With the ability to visualize data models, developers can comprehend and manipulate data structures more intuitively, enhancing their understanding and productivity. An embedded GraphQL query playground offers an interactive platform to readily test and debug existing models, simplifying the development process. These combined features facilitate the creation of applications built on decentralized data.</p><p>By enabling a seamless and efficient developmental process, a visual IDE significantly encourages the growth of a dApp ecosystem, where users have full control over their data. This control not only fosters trust in the digital landscape but also opens up opportunities for innovative applications that respect user autonomy and privacy.</p> The Results <p>Integrating with Ceramic yields significant results for US3R Network. Here are two key success metrics that demonstrate the impact of Ceramic on their development ecosystem:</p> Increased Development Efficiency <p>Before Ceramic, developers within the US3R Network ecosystem faced challenges when working with dynamic and structured data. The integration of Ceramic's technology simplified the development process and improved efficiency. Developers are able to leverage Ceramic's data model marketplace, IDE for editing and deploying data models, and powerful querying capabilities, resulting in a substantial reduction in development time and effort. The streamlined workflow and comprehensive toolkits provided by Ceramic empower developers to focus on building innovative dApps.</p> Enhanced Interoperability <p>Interoperability is a critical aspect of decentralized applications, allowing users and applications to seamlessly interact and share data across different platforms. With Ceramic as a foundational layer, US3R Network achieves enhanced interoperability within its ecosystem. By leveraging Ceramic's dynamic and composable data layer, developers are able to create applications that seamlessly communicate and share data with other applications and protocols. This interoperability opens up new possibilities for collaborative and integrated user experiences, enabling the development of truly decentralized and interconnected applications. One such instance is <a href="https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-142?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CIP-142</a>, an interoperable and composable data model for social links aggregators, co-authored by US3R and <a href="https://www.chainfeeds.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ChainFeeds</a>.</p> Join the Paradigm Shift! <p>Are you a developer or strategic partner looking to unlock the full potential of decentralized storage and data interoperability?

<p>Our Light Touch Support programme has been busy! In the second quarter of this year (April, May, June), we worked with 29 partners from 13 different countries. This post looks at some of the challenges organisations came to us with during this period, and what resources, tips and recommendations we offered them. (For further reading, you can find our reflections on the first quarter of 2023 <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/starting-data-journeys-staying-safe-on-comms-tools-support-trends-from-2023-so-far/" title="">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is our Light-Touch Support Programme?&nbsp;Our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support</a> (LiTS) programme offers lightweight, no-fee support to organisations and individuals who come to us with questions about using data or technology in their social justice work. In each LiTS partnership, our goal is to help our partners clarify their vision and identify next steps, in order to move forward independently. Learn more <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">here</a>.</p>



<p>Our 29 LiTS partners we supported in the second quarter of 2023 were based in 13 different countries, including&nbsp;Argentina, Brazil, Congo (DRC), Costa Rica, Haiti, Kenya, Mexico, Uganda, United Kingdom, United States and Zambia. They ranged from established nonprofits to community based organisations and collectives, working on issues such as transparency and accountability, human rights, environmental justice and health.</p>



<p>At the beginning of June we also especially invited Black feminist organisers to reach out to our LiTS programme. Since we launched this call-out we have connected with organisations led by Black women in Brazil, the US and Costa Rica doing incredible work to advance racial justice in their countries (if you are interested, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/calling-all-black-feminist-organizations-for-no-fee-tech-and-data-support/" title="">learn more about this opportunity here</a>!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are some of the challenges our LiTS partners have been grappling with. In the hopes that this post might be useful to groups facing similar issues, we’ve also included some of the tips and resources that we find can help in confronting these challenges.&nbsp;</p>



 1. Documentation and comms&nbsp; 



<p>Many of the organisations and collectives who joined LiTS via our proactive support offer to Black feminist organisations are doing work that is incredibly impactful, tending to urgent needs from their communities and defending Black women’s rights in their countries, and doing so with extremely limited funding.</p>



<p>The huge amount of work required, combined with pressing needs and limited resources, often means that these organisations don’t have enough time and resources to document the work they’re doing and to communicate it to their audiences in the way that they would like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve been working with these partners to collectively think of strategies to tackle this challenge by strengthening existing (and creating new!) tech and data processes for documenting their work. Here are some of the main tips/considerations we share with partners:</p>



 
 GET SPECIFIC: One good place to start can be thinking in more detail about what our partners&nbsp;want to keep track of (and why!). Depending on the work, the activities and milestones an organisation might want to document may vary. For instance, for some organisations it can be important to keep track of how many people attend events they’re hosting; for other groups, it can be relevant to know how many people are reading and/or sharing the resources they’re publishing online; others may want to keep a record of the ways people are using the services they offer. 
 
 Some questions that can help with this process include:&nbsp;
 
 What data is essential about the organisations’ work?&nbsp; 



 Years from now, when we’re telling the story of our work, what will we want to remember?&nbsp; 



 What do our funders and supporters ask about?&nbsp; 



 What is important for our community to know about us/our work?<br> 
 
 
 
 



 START SMALL &amp; KEEP THINGS ACCESSIBLE: Improving internal documentation isn’t something that happens overnight (and dedicating resources or people to documentation can also be difficult for under-resourced organisations). With our partners, we talk about the value of starting small, making it easy for team members to contribute, and building up a practice of documentation incrementally.
 
 There are some practical (and relatively simple) actions that can help teams get started, including:
 
 For some teams, it can be useful to have a dedicated space to informally keep track of the impact or results from their work! It can be a slack or mattermost channel, a specific group chat, or an online pad/document where the team documents comments they receive via email, at events or on social media, for example. At The Engine Room, for instance, we have our own channel on Mattermost where team members share #tinyvictories from our work! 



 Creating&nbsp;templates and/or surveys can make it easier for team members to document more about their work, for instance, by sharing short, concise surveys on Slack or Mattermost, or through forms in Google or in Nextcloud.<br> 
 
 
 
 



 INTERNAL RETROSPECTIVES: Not waiting too long to look back and document the work orgs have been doing can also be a good move! At The Engine Room, every six months our team members complete a short survey asking them to share the highlights of their semester, a practice that helps us with building our annual report at the end of each year. We also do project retrospectives whenever we wrap up a project, which help us look back at the work we did and make sure learnings and impact go into our records. Other practices teams can explore include things like hosting “retrospective meetings” periodically, where teams go over recent activities together, document impact generated and identify any learnings or opportunities they want to share with their audiences.&nbsp; 
 



 2. Bringing responsible data to research or advocacy efforts 



<p>We worked with quite a few partners working on different social justice issues who have identified significant gaps in data about the communities they were working with or about the issues they advocate for: from a lack of data about Black women’s experiences with the health system in certain Latin American countries to the non-existence of user friendly ways to find data about access to education in a Caribbean country.</p>



<p>One of the common challenges our partners have dealt with after deciding that they wanted to produce data themselves is not knowing how to start a research project or data collection project – and, relatedly, how to design a project responsibly. Here are some of our tips:</p>



 
 START BACKWARDS: An idea we often share is that before embarking on a research project or on a data collection initiative, it’s good for teams to collectively imagine and align on what they want the finished product to look like, and what outcomes they expect from it. This can lead to visualising the question they want answered or the data that would most support their work. Essentially, this is about getting specific about the issues organisations are working on and exploring how data can help them reach their goals.&nbsp; 



 START SMALL: Organisations – especially grassroots organisations or informal collectives – can start by collecting data on just one issue, or by answering just one question. This can help organisations to be agile and test out whether an issue or a finding is useful for their work, and it can also be responsible (the less data we collect, the less data we have to keep safe!).&nbsp; 



 THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES: Another important step is considering how the people organisations are working with might be impacted (positively and negatively) by data that is collected. This reflection can impact tool selection, methodology, and choices around how data is shared. We have tons of resources on <a href="http://responsibledata.io" title="">responsible data</a> to support organisations in this process: make sure to check our tips on <a href="https://www.im-portal.org/blogs/how-to-start-your-responsible-data-journey">how to start your </a><a href="https://www.im-portal.org/blogs/how-to-start-your-responsible-data-journey" title="">responsible</a><a href="https://www.im-portal.org/blogs/how-to-start-your-responsible-data-journey"> data journey</a> and our resource <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20becoming%20RAD,a%20life%20cycle%20of%20usefulness." title="">Becoming RAD!</a>, for guidance on how to create a responsible process for retaining, archiving and deleting data. 
 



<p>For those interested in learning more, the <a href="https://the-engine-room.github.io/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-01-designing-a-project.html" title="">first chapter of the Responsible Data Handbook</a> goes deeper into the process of designing responsible projects – we highly recommend taking a look!</p>



 3. Ensuring digital resilience through practices based on care and security&nbsp; 



<p>Another big area of support this past quarter was <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-do-we-think-about-when-we-think-about-digital-resilience/" title="">digital resilience</a>! We worked with partners to support their ability as an organisation to protect themselves from – and respond to – digital security threats to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During each of our LiTS partnerships, we develop a set of tailored recommendations to address the specific challenges our partners are facing. Here are some of the resources that we’ve been sharing with partners lately (and that other organisations may also be interested in!):</p>



 
 <a href="https://pratododia.org/" title="">Prato do dia</a>: an initiative from Transfeminist Digital Care Network inviting everyone to reflect on issues of digital care and providing alternatives for people to adopt healthier tech practices. Available in Portuguese, English and Spanish.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://internews.org/blog/internews-lanza-curso-de-seguridad-digital-para-defensores-de-derechos-humanos-y-del-medio-ambiente/" title="">Internews’ new digital security course</a> for human rights and climate/environmental defenders in Spanish. 



 FRIDA Young Feminist Fund’s new <a href="https://youngfeministfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Young-Feminist-Leadership-Toolkit-English.pdf" title="">Young Feminist Leadership Toolkit</a> for organisers from West, East, Southern and Central Africa who are working for radical systemic change for LGBTQI+ people. It includes a chapter focused on digital security. 



 <a href="https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/cyberpeace-builders/" title="">CyberPeace Builders’</a> offer of <a href="https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/hcc-ngos/" title="">free digital security support</a> to humanitarian and development NGOs to prepare for, defend against and recover from cyberattacks.&nbsp;

<p>We are delighted to announce the joint publication of “<a href="https://openid.net/GAIN-in-2023">GAIN in 2023</a>” which is a collaboration between&nbsp; six organizations who continue to pursue the vision of interoperable high trust identity networks, as articulated in the “<a href="https://gainforum.org/GAINWhitePaper.pdf">GAIN Digital Trust</a>” paper, published in 2021 by 156 independent identity industry experts and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The paper explores all the ways in which the GAIN (Global Assured Identity Network) vision remains relevant in today’s fast-moving landscape – as well as the ways in which technology heightens the stakes. It then reviews the major areas of progress in the proofs-of-concept that are related to the GAIN collaboration:</p>
 
 The cross-border transfer of data that the GAIN Proof of Concept Community Group has achieved: they tested data and trust management protocols, including a demonstration that a government, a bank network and a mobile network can all share identity data across three separate countries.&nbsp; 
 The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation has also made meaningful progress on developing high-trust organizational identities and addressing use cases beyond financial services.&nbsp; 
 The Open Identity Exchange is architecting how trust can be exchanged across countries at the policy-level, and is working diligently through the mapping of trust frameworks in numerous jurisdictions within the Interoperability Working Group. 
 
<p><br>In addition to the OIDF, GLEIF and OIX contributions, we are also delighted to benefit from the thought leadership of the International Institute of Finance, the Cloud Signature Consortium, the Secure Identity Alliance. Together we have over 50 companies and numerous individuals helping to realize the GAIN vision.</p>
<p>We will share more on the final outcomes and recommendations at events throughout 2023-24 and look forward to further collaboration with the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about the technical work of GAIN or to sign the Participation Agreement to join the GAIN POC Community Group, click <a href="https://openid.net/cg/gain-poc/">here</a>. To learn more about trust framework mapping, join the Open Identity Exchange Interoperability Working Group <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/workgroups?action=view&amp;Workgroup=884">here</a>.&nbsp; Other non-profits are welcome to join the initiative by contacting <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a> for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenID Foundation</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate. Find out more at<a href="http://www.openid.net/"> openid.net</a>.</p>

 <br>By Jan Lindquist, Christoph L. Fabianek and Sebastian Haas<br> <p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>In the era of digital transformation, data has become the lifeblood of businesses, especially in the realm of supply chain management. The ability to share and exchange data seamlessly across different organisations and systems is crucial for operational efficiency, cost reduction, and customer satisfaction. This is where data agreements come into play. Data agreements are essentially contracts that define the terms and conditions for data sharing between different entities from a source to a third-party. They set the usage policies for data access, ensuring that all parties involved adhere to the agreed-upon rules and regulations.<br></p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) has established a task force referred to as the "<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/data-agreement?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Data Agreement</a>". This group is actively developing a specification that delineates the structure of data agreements. DIF's data agreements are rooted in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles, and incorporate the recording of consent notices. However, as this post will expound, such an arrangement can be effectively applied across a wide array of supply chain management domains, including but not limited to agriculture, energy, and transportation.</p><p>Domain Specific Data Agreements</p><p>To facilitate data sharing in a more structured and well defined way a vocabulary or ontology is needed. To achieve this a Domain Specific Data Agreements (D2A) is used. Such agreements allow organisations to communicate through an intermediary the allowed usage policies for data access within a specific domain. The intermediary has then all the information to match and validate the usage policy in order to create a Domain Specific Data Disclosure Agreement (D3A).<br></p><p>The following diagram shows a parallel example between domain-specific data agreements and privacy based data agreements. A further explanation of privacy based data agreements can be found in this “<a href="https://igrant.io/papers/iGrant.io_DataExchangeAgreements_v2.2.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Data Exchange Agreements</a>” white paper from iGrant.io.</p><p>Agreement VC</p><p>One of the key technologies enabling data agreements are Verifiable Credentials (VCs). VCs are digital representations of information that a verifier might require, such as the age or the citizenship of an individual. In the context of data agreements, a VC could be created to represent the agreement itself. This VC would contain the details of the agreement and could be cryptographically signed by the parties involved. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the agreement, providing a secure foundation for data exchange. An example for such a VC is provided in the listing below.<br></p><p>{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"],</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": ["VerifiableCredential"],</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"identifier": "https://babelfish.data-container.net/credentials/zQmeC…4H7",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"issuer": [</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"did:oyd:zQme7…Fmp%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"did:oyd:zQmY…W1z%40babelfish.data-container.net"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;],</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"issuanceDate": "2023-02-13T00:36:33Z",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"credentialSubject": [</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"id": "did:oyd:zQme7…Fmp%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "source",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Data Source Name"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"id": "did:oyd:zQmY7…W1z%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "controller",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Data Intermediary"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"id": "did:oyd:zQmY7…W1z%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"dataAgreement": {</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"purposes": ["the actual Domain-specific Data Agreement"]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;],</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"proof": [</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "Ed25519Signature2020",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"verificationMethod": "did:oyd:zQme7…Fmp%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"proofValue": "zqdK…3Ho"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "Ed25519Signature2020",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"verificationMethod": "did:oyd:zQmY7…W1z%40babelfish.data-container.net",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"proofValue": "z2pU…YVt"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;]</p><p>}</p><p>Semantic Overlay Architecture (SOyA)</p><p>Semantic Overlay Architecture (<a href="https://ownyourdata.github.io/soya/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">SOyA</a>) is another crucial component of data agreements.

SOyA includes groups of data records with the same attributes, references between data records, and additional information in the form of overlays for these data structures. It serves as the underlying mechanism for all data management tasks in supply chain management.

For instance, a manufacturer needs to share production data with a distributor, who in turn needs to share inventory data with a retailer. By leveraging DIDs, VCs, SOyA, and Domain Specific Data Agreements, this data exchange can be automated, secure, and efficient. It allows for better coordination, communication, and performance tracking across the supply chain, ultimately leading to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and increased customer satisfaction.

<p>This excellent <a href="https://www.ieai.sot.tum.de/research-brief-on-protecting-and-realizing-human-rights-april-2023-out-now/">research brief</a> from the <a href="https://www.ieai.sot.tum.de/">Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence</a> (IEAI) focuses on a salient issue that we should all be concerned about: the integration of human rights into the AI ethic discourse. I believe that by adopting open standards, AI developers can ensure that their systems are built on principles that promote respect for human rights in developing and deploying AI systems.</p>



<p>Open standards can help to promote transparency by ensuring that the algorithms used in AI systems are open to scrutiny and review by independent experts. This can help identify and address any biases or discriminatory impacts the system may have.</p>



<p>In addition, open standards can also help promote accountability by providing clear guidelines and standards for AI’s ethical development and use. This can help to ensure that AI systems are designed and used in ways that are consistent with human rights principles.</p>



<p>Finally, open standards can help promote non-discrimination by ensuring that AI systems are consistent with international human rights standards, treating all individuals fairly and equitably, regardless of their race, gender, or other personal characteristics.</p>

<p>As we move into a future marked by unprecedented digital innovations, it’s natural to look towards Silicon Valley for the next big thing. Yet, sometimes it’s the simplest of ideas, from the most unexpected places, that can upset the established order. One such contender is Lions Gate Digital, a seemingly modest concept that could significantly disrupt the Silicon Valley tech giants.</p>



 The Power of Simplicity 



<p>Lions Gate Digital is a testament to the power of simplicity. While Silicon Valley giants invest in complex solutions and sophisticated technologies, Lions Gate Digital has taken a different approach, focusing on an easily understandable, yet powerfully effective concept. In a world growing weary of convoluted tech jargon and intricate systems, this simplicity offers a breath of fresh air.</p>



 User-Centric Approach 



<p>Lions Gate Digital also centers its approach around the user, ensuring its solution is not just simple, but also user-friendly and effective. Many tech giants have been criticized for becoming too detached from their user base, prioritizing technical advancements over user experience. This provides an opportunity for Lions Gate Digital to resonate with users, offering them solutions designed with their needs and experiences at the forefront.</p>



 The Advantage of Being Nimble 



<p>Large tech corporations are often compared to massive ships that take a long time to turn. They can be slow to react to changing market trends and customer needs due to their sheer size and bureaucracy. Conversely, smaller, more agile companies like Lions Gate Digital can adapt quickly to changes and pivot their strategy as necessary. This agility allows them to stay ahead of market trends and meet evolving consumer demands more effectively.</p>



 Leveraging Open Source 



<p>Silicon Valley giants have long capitalized on proprietary technology and platforms to maintain their market dominance. Lions Gate Digital, however, leverages the power of open source technology, allowing it to tap into a global community of developers and innovators. This approach not only speeds up innovation but also fosters a sense of community and collaboration that proprietary systems often lack.</p>



 Data Privacy and Security 



<p>In an era where data privacy and security have become significant concerns, the trust between companies and their users is more important than ever. Some Silicon Valley giants have faced criticism for their handling of user data, offering Lions Gate Digital an opportunity to differentiate itself. By prioritizing user privacy and security, Lions Gate Digital can build trust and loyalty among users, critical factors for success in today’s digital landscape.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>While it’s easy to assume that the next big digital innovation will come from a well-known Silicon Valley titan, it’s essential not to underestimate the power of simplicity, user-centric design, agility, open-source innovation, and a strong focus on data privacy. These are the factors that position Lions Gate Digital as a potential disruptor in the digital space, ready to challenge the dominance of established tech giants. Only time will tell whether this David can overcome the Goliath’s of Silicon Valley, but one thing is certain: the battle will be one to watch.</p>

  Working together on a single source to achieve reliable data for medical devices
 
 
     

 
             Exchanging product information of medical devices has traditionally involved time-consuming handling of individual Excel sheets and PDF formats, with different requirements for different partners. 
     

 
             <p>In the Netherlands, suppliers of medical devices and hospitals have joined together to try to standardise and automate the exchange of product information. A uniform dataset has been established in consultation with suppliers, healthcare institutions, and other stakeholders. It has been agreed that data on medical devices, including relevant certification documentation, will be shared through the Global Data Synchronisation Network (GDSN). Since February 2023, the dataset is fully integrated within the network and datamodel.</p>

  In the future, as evidenced by advancing industry standards (e.g., DIDs, 
VCs) and new regulations (e.g., eIDAS), nearly every road to individual 
commercial, civic, and personal engagement will invariably flow through

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>On 23 June the Australian government released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/criminal-justice/files/national-strategy-for-identity-resilience.pdf">National Strategy for Identity Resilience</a>&nbsp;which consists of ten principles to guide digital identity resilience, setting a precedent for how New Zealand’s own digital identity rules could be developed under the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act. For example, it mentions a seamless Commonwealth, state and territory digital ID system, inclusive digital identification systems and, where appropriate and with an individual’s consent, Australian governments will use biometrics to make it harder for criminals to misuse identity credentials.</p>



<p>This Strategy also includes immediate, medium, and long term initiatives that aim to strengthen digital identification security arrangements across jurisdictions. These initiatives will be coordinated by the Department of Home Affairs, with close collaboration across the federal, state, and territory-levels of government. Compared to New Zealand, Australia’s extra legislative and regulatory layers of government mean that for such a plan and initiatives to be agreed to and in such a short timeframe, this is a positive sign of the importance for which the Australian government is signalling their priorities. These priorities we also see mirrored by the New Zealand government in the areas around identity, security and privacy which you will often hear talked about together frequently as they are interconnected when it comes to safe, reliable and secure interactions online.</p>



<p>I would recommend DINZ Members and friends have a read as we learn about what our neighbours across the ditch are doing as New Zealand’s own digital identity rules are developed.

<p>Many industry pros are increasingly channeling their inner&nbsp;Bill Gates in 2004&nbsp;and predicting the decline of the password. The PW prognosticating demonstrates some confidence in the IT world that a&nbsp;passwordless infrastructure&nbsp;is now sufficiently in place. “The most notable shift over the past couple of years has been that every major platform vendor is now supporting open standards for passwordless authentication that are in their flagship operating systems. So, this means for the first time that virtually every modern computing device has the capability to support passwordless authentication,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and chief marketing officer at FIDO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passkeys promise a future without passwords, where we access our accounts as easily as we unlock our phones, with a much higher level of security. “It’s the closest to something that can be scaled to get rid of passwords that we’ve ever seen,” said Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at industry association FIDO Alliance. A passkey is a digital authentication credential that is securely stored on your device. Instead of what Shamas called a “shared secret” method of passwords, passkeys are a unique key pair for every online service you use bound to the domain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce two significant developments to Ceramic that will improve efficiency and reliability of the network. These developments do not require any changes or upgrades to applications built on Ceramic.</p><p>We’ve introduced a new anchor status called REPLACED and the implementation of a more reliable method of communication between a Ceramic node and the anchoring service. Let's dive deeper into these exciting advancements.</p> REPLACED Status <p>Imagine a Ceramic user who creates a stream commit A, only to realize later that a more recent commit B supersedes it. Previously, the anchor request status for commit A would be marked as FAILED, causing unnecessary resource consumption on Ceramic nodes. However, with the introduction of the REPLACED status, we now have the ability to infer the status of commit A immediately after commit B's submission.</p><p>The new REPLACED status is not only more logically sound but also reduces the amount of resources Ceramic nodes need while waiting for a commit to anchor. This is a significant step toward optimizing the operation of the Ceramic network.</p> CAR Files for CAS Responses <p>An anchor commit acts as a reference to a previous commit in a Ceramic stream and an Ethereum transaction. In the past, when CAS (Ceramic Anchor Service) created an anchor, it relied heavily on IPFS to obtain the anchor commit and parts of a merkle tree. However, we recognized that this approach had its limitations.</p><p>To address this issue, CAS now responds with a CAR (Content Addressable aRchive) file instead of just sending the CID of an anchor commit. These CAR files contain the full anchor commit and all the necessary IPLD records in a single package. By eliminating the reliance on IPFS transport, we aim to eliminate any potential bottlenecks and enhance the overall reliability of the Ceramic network.</p><p>It is important to note that this particular feature has been rolled out in a fully backwards-compatible manner, ensuring that a Ceramic node upgrade is not mandatory. However, we strongly encourage all users to upgrade their Ceramic nodes to take advantage of the improved reliability offered by CAR files.</p> Conclusion <p>We are continuously working to optimize the performance and reliability of Ceramic. The introduction of the REPLACED status and the implementation of CAR files for Ceramic-CAS communication mark significant milestones in this journey. With these updates, we aim to enhance the efficiency of Ceramic nodes and provide a more reliable experience for our partners and their users.</p><p>Let us know your feedback on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a>! </p>

<p>Four large scale pilots have been initiated under the EU’s Digital Europe research and innovation programme: The European Wallet Consortium (EWC), DC4EU, Potential and Nobid. Their aim is to test the EU DigitalWallet (EUDIW) and the other components in the eIDAS 2.0 ecosystem and pilot them in practical application across Europe. On this subject the IDunion communications team conducted an interview with Steffen Schwalm, Principal Consultant | Senior Manager Digital Identity &amp; Trust, msg.</p>



<p>What is the role of the Large Scale Pilots?</p>



<p>Their role can be illustrated quite well as a triangular structure: on one side of the triangle is the EU Commission, which is responsible for the regulation, and the eIDAS toolbox, which is used by the EU member states for establishing the technical framework of the EU digital wallet.</p>



<p>Below that we have the reference implementation for the European Wallet, and finally at the other end of the triangle we have the Large Scale Pilots (LSPs).</p>



<p>The idea behind this is to not just adopt regulations and standards where any malfunctions only become apparent during the implementation phase, but to combine regulations and technical specifications with immediate practical implementation.</p>



<p>This is precisely what the LSPs are all about: to provide direct feedback to all regulatory processes with concrete practical results, and to test all technical specifications in practical applications in order to find out what works and what does not. All this is happening in close cooperation with the EU Commission, the eIDAS toolbox and the reference implementation in order to create valid regulatory and technical foundations.</p>



<p>For example, issuing personal identification is not clearly described in the EU Architecture and Reference Framework <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">ARF</a>. Let us assume that there are five different opinions on this across four LSPs, so this is a clear indication to specify this more precisely.</p>



<p>So on the one hand we have a reference implementation that takes on specifications and explores their feasibility, and on the other hand we have the LSPs, which in turn examine the reference implementation in various use cases to check what practically works or needs to be adapted.</p>



<p>So it is much more than just establishing the rules and regulations plus a few technical standards, it is testing everything in time and creating practicality, thus avoiding any mistakes that were made with eIDAS 1.0.</p>



<p>Are all LSPs similar and do they have the same structure?</p>



<p>Yes, there is the basic rule for all of them that a LSP is always formally led by one or more EU member states. The companies are affiliated to them. </p>



<p>EWC is led by Sweden and Finland, DC4EU by Spain, Potential by France and Germany and for Nobid it is Norway and the Baltic States. The duration of all LSPs is two years – the start was on April 1, 2023.</p>



<p>Which of the four LSPs have the biggest opportunities?</p>



<p>All four LSPs have different focuses, so they are not directly comparable with each other. Also, I do not want to give an evaluation because our company msg is involved in the EWC.  In any case, Potential is very strongly focused on non-DLT and deals with a wide range of use cases, from bank account opening to e-prescription to e-government. DC4EU focuses on diploma and social security passport. Nobid focuses purely on non-DLT and payment. EWC’s activities are focusing on organisational ID, payment transactions and use cases in the area of travel, while taking a dual approach, i.e. non-DLT and DLT. </p>



<p>That said, no consortium is more important than the other, they rather need each other.</p>



<p>This brings us to our next question: to what extent do you think the Commission sees room for other DLT-based solutions besides <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">EBSI</a>, such as Hyperledger-Indy or Aries.</p>



<p>This is a good question given the current situation, in light of the fact that the ARF is actually technology-agnostic. On the other hand, the EU is explicitly funding an EBSI project to develop Digital Wallet solutions based on the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure. Since each consortium has to establish interoperability with the other consortia in order to enable mutual cooperation as intended by the EU Commission – all of them definitely have to establish interoperability between DLT and legacy (non-DLT) solutions. The focus of DLT is certainly on EBSI, due to existing EU funding and goals. </p>



<p>What is the motivation of the multitude of companies involved within the four LSPs, because given the large number, the funding amount for each individual organisation is rather small.</p>



<p>Whoever is now participating in the LSPs, even if only as an associated partner, is directly involved in the development of the European digital identity for the next ten to fifteen years. And if eIDAS 2.0 remains as it is currently planned, it makes great sense for both the technology providers and the relying parties to participate. At the end of the day, all companies involved in critical infrastructure services will have to adopt this solution, as well as the whole banking and healthcare sector, as well as the GAFA. Which means a major part of the industry. All companies involved in the LSPs can help shape the technology from the beginning, steer it in the right direction and develop their own business models from it.</p>



<p>In what way is IDunion represented in the EWC consortium?</p>



<p>IDunion is indirectly involved in the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/about-us/members/">EWC</a> through the participation of many consortium partners and associated partners.</p>



<p>Thank you very much for the interview, Steffen.</p>



<p> You’re very welcome!</p>

  <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought humanity to a critical juncture. The recent international conference, AI for Good, organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), underscored the situation's urgency. Our society stands at a tipping point where the potential of AI could either accelerate progress towards the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or drive us towards an uncertain societal future. The ITU secretary general and other senior speakers asked for a global call for action.</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>Such a call for action also comes from other initiatives around the globe. Here are a few examples. Calls for European Health Data Space digitally connecting healthcare practitioners while protecting patients' rights, development of national digital Identities including biometrics, advancing precision medicine and the use of genomic data, strengthening Internet of Things (IoT) governance for more efficient supply chains and many others. All these examples share a common governance requirement: regulating algorithmic decision-making.</p><p>Prioritizing the development of governance models for the deployment of AI is our immediately actionable, best hope for developing an AI that serves as a force for good. The task is complex and far-reaching. Everyone must coherently feed policymakers pertinent information to establish the right governance framework.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the existing multi-stakeholder framework of the SDGs offers a stage to structure the flow of concerns and the experience gained from projects impacting society through digital tooling.</p><p>Data fuel AI. As a result, data is also a promising avenue of progress for governance. To do so, we need to reshape our approach to data. By reimagining our relationship with data and promoting responsible data usage, we can simplify the regulation of AI deployment, leading us towards a sustainable and inclusive society.</p><p>Rethinking our relation to data and building the tools to make it happen is part of the mission of the Human Colossus Foundation. We promote data-centric architecture for the common good. As our contribution to the calls for action, this blog post introduces a series of upcoming publications and activities that link data governance to technological architectures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> AI &amp; SDG <p>Will Artificial Intelligence accelerate United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals ?&nbsp;</p><p>The SDGs represent a comprehensive roadmap towards a better future, encompassing crucial areas such as poverty eradication, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. However, the progress towards achieving these goals must catch up to projections as the 2030 deadline approaches.</p><p>AI has the potential to serve as a catalyst for progress, significantly accelerating our journey towards these goals. Yet, it also risks exacerbating existing disparities and creating a society where control over AI becomes a battle, benefitting only a few. A robust AI governance system can ensure the optimistic scenario's success.</p> The Imperative Role of Data <p>The existence of atoms weaves the very fabric of our physical reality. In the realm of information, data is the one thing AI algorithms hinge on. Brace yourself for an AI-driven data frenzy, with a mind-boggling year-on-year 56% surge in data production in 2020 alone. Brace even harder when you realise that we're sitting on a mind-blowing 64 zeta bytes of data, most of it unstructured. Unstructured data refers to data that does not have a specified format or organisation. This data is typically not easily searchable or categorised. So, get ready to dig deep into your organisation's resources to curate that data or brace for the havoc wreaked by poorly trained AI. The choice is yours, but the consequences are real.</p><p>Practitioners will appreciate the critical role of data in AI operations as they constantly search for more data. Unfortunately, we too often overlook data governance while it is the essential bedrock upon which policy maker can build a sound AI governance. Without data governance, information management systems fail to meet the data accuracy, accessibility, and security standards required to meet their end purpose: successful operations for better decision-making. Therefore, it is imperative to recognise the value of data governance before attempting to rule AI deployment.</p> Promoting Responsible Data Usage <p>AI, as a force for good, is about responsible data usage, a cornerstone of effective data governance. It entails ethical collection, storage, and data utilisation while prioritising privacy and security. Organisations can establish transparent and accountable data practices with robust data governance frameworks. Governance ensures that individuals' rights are respected while also addressing concerns around bias, discrimination, and the potential misuse of data. By fostering a culture of responsible data usage, we lay the foundation for a fair and just AI ecosystem.</p> Regulating AI Deployment <p>The intricate nature of AI that mixes data and algorithms poses challenges to effective regulation. However, we can simplify the regulatory approach by placing data governance at the forefront. By treating data as a first-class citizen, data governance aligns data usage with the values a community wants to protect through regulations and ethics. Then AI governance reduces to Machine governance. In other words, AI governance focuses on regulating AI deployment instead of AI development. In this view, AI governance is closer to AI solution certifications by defining domain-specific standards and assurance levels, for example. A data-centric approach enables policymakers and regulators to focus on data-related aspects, such as data quality, privacy protection, and accountability for algorithmic data transformation.</p><p>Streamlining the regulatory process through data governance has another subtle but essential consequence: decoupling the regulation of AI development from the regulation of AI deployment. Innovation is unstoppable. Thus regulating AI development is complex and will prove virtually impossible to enforce globally. Data governance does not stop AI development. It first structures and limits the data the AI system can ingest. Second, it constrains the algorithmic data transformation process that must respond to lawful purposes. The data governance approach to AI governance provides a granular framework that can meet domain-specific constraints and respect the underlying Human values embedded in responsible data governance.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the data approach has the advantage of not exposing fundamental aspects of the regulation to the ever-changing technological landscape. Ruling data usage is to protect the core values of a community. The specific implementation risks are left to the certification of the deployment of solutions.&nbsp;</p> Responding to a Call for action as a first conclusion <p>The future of AI and its impact on society hinges on our ability to govern it effectively. While AI's potential to drive progress towards the SDGs is immense, responsible practices and regulations must guide the deployment of AI solutions.</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation firmly believes that by embracing data governance as the starting point, a foundation of trust, fairness, and accountability provides the bedrock for practical AI governance. Through responsible data usage, targeted regulations, and a commitment to inclusivity, we can harness the power of AI to reshape our world sustainably and inclusively.</p><p>Our beliefs are backed by actions developed through a data-centric architecture we promote as "Dynamic Data Economy". This architecture builds on the core concepts of distributed governance, decentralised semantics, and decentralised authentication.</p><p>Therefore, a contribution to the call for action within our reach is to expose the Dynamic Data Economy architecture through a stream of publications and events to promote an understanding of the relationship between data governance and technological developments.&nbsp;</p><p>The time for action is now, as the choices we make today will shape the trajectory of our society for years to come. </p><p>Thank You for your attention</p>

<p>The bottom line benefits of taking seven practical steps towards harms reduction</p>



 







 



 Summary 



<p>The recent <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/OvercomingHumanHarmChallenges_Whitepaper-V1.1-2023-05-04.pdf">‘Overcoming Human Harms in Digital Identity Ecosystems</a>’ white paper from Trust over IP’s Human Experience Working Group has deepened our understanding of what happens when trust breaks down on the internet. The paper lays out the moral case for a systemic framework for understanding and mitigating digital identity harms and explains the commercial benefits of enhanced trustworthiness:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Reduced reputational, compliance and fraud risks 



 Reduced human resource management and customer service costs 



 Increased revenues and investment — the ultimate value of trustworthiness 
 



<p>The companion ‘<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Practical-Steps-for-Overcoming-Human-Harm-Challenges-In-Digital-Identity-Ecosystems-V1.0-2023-05-24.pdf">Practical Steps</a>’ guide offers seven steps that business leaders and digital service providers can take starting now to unlock those bottom-line benefits.</p>



 



 Understanding, analysis, systemic framework 



<p>The new Trust over IP white paper, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/OvercomingHumanHarmChallenges_Whitepaper-V1.1-2023-05-04.pdf">Overcoming Human Harms in Digital Identity Ecosystems</a>, was published following a period of public review. The paper is in three parts:</p>



 
 A PESTLE[1] analysis of the human harms that can occur and their impact on real people and communities, including potential mitigations and exacerbations afforded by self-sovereign or decentralized identity solutions. 



 A simple systemic framework for understanding four types of human harm&nbsp; 



 Four harms mitigation strategies and examples of countermeasures 
 



<p>The paper’s human stories make a powerful moral case for addressing the very real human harms that arise (largely unintentionally), from the misuse, failure or appropriation of digital identity systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bottom line: businesses can derive significant commercial benefits by applying the mitigations outlined in the paper—including our guide to practical steps.</p>



 Reduced reputational, compliance and fraud risks 



<p>C-suite executives consistently rank reputational risk as their primary concern, because it accounts for 63% of a company’s market value[2]. A recent survey of 500 business leaders across all sectors, ranked employee and customer abuse as their highest reputational risk (72%)[3].</p>



<p>Societal impacts of online harms lead to higher taxes and increased regulation and compliance requirements such as the UK’s forthcoming Internet Safety Bill, the EU Digital Services Act, and the USA White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse (June 2022). Mindful of their own reputation, government regulators are increasingly using existing powers to impose hefty fines on companies that fail to take account of human vulnerabilities. For example, Meta was fined $435.6m by the EU Commission for violating GDPR by allowing teenagers to create public accounts that shared their digital identity[4]. This followed evidence provided by a whistleblower that Meta’s own internal research showed use of their platforms was damaging teenage girls’ mental health[5].</p>



<p>The rising incidence of identity theft and associated fraud also costs businesses and society dearly. The UK’s National Fraud Database, reports a 22% increase (2020-2021) in identity-related fraud[6], costing companies an average of £398,520 per annum[7]. An EU report found that 24% of fraud victims suffered financial losses (direct harms in the ToIP harms framework), while a whopping 79% suffered emotionally[8] (felt harms in the ToIP framework).</p>



 Reduced human resource management and customer service costs 



<p>Unhappy or harmed customers are of course more likely to call customer care or to use online reporting to abuse management teams. This not only increases the volume and complexity of calls to customer care, but it also impacts employee retention and emotional well-being[9]; one researcher noted that following interviews with commercial content moderators:</p>



<p>A significant number [get PTSD]. And many other employees develop long lasting mental health symptoms that stop short of full-blown PTSD, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia”.[10]&nbsp;</p>



<p>These factors increase business costs in multiple areas, including staff training and lost productivity.</p>



 Increased revenues and investment – the value of trustworthiness 



<p>Investors are starting to put their money into positive social and environmental impacts. The UK Treasure estimates that Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) assets under management (AUM) will be $33.9 trillion by 2026[11]. Deutsche Bank forecast that by 2030, 95% of AUM (€130 trillion) will be against an ESG mandate[12]. Consequently, ESG is a top boardroom priority, with 45% of companies reporting an ESG measure in executive pay, and 78% judging that ESG value contributes to company valuation and financial performance[13].</p>



<p>Consumers too are increasingly led by the values and ethics of brands; according to a recent PwC report, “Eight out of ten consumers said that they would pay up to 5% more for sustainably produced goods”[14]. This is led by GenZ consumers who are powerful influencers of other generations[15]. A recent Deloitte Analysis found that “trusted companies outperform their peers by up to 400%, directly correlating with the bottom line.”[16]&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, harm mitigation substantially adds to a company’s value. For digital identity technology providers, their customers, and the real humans who use those services, addressing human harms is both a moral and a business imperative.</p>



 Practical steps to unlock business value 



<p>In addition to the white paper, ToIP also introduced <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Practical-Steps-for-Overcoming-Human-Harm-Challenges-In-Digital-Identity-Ecosystems-V1.0-2023-05-24.pdf">seven practical steps for overcoming human harms in digital identity</a>. These are steps that businesses and online ecosystems can implement today:</p>



 
 Define the business case for harms in your ecosystem 



 Train your team in ethics 



 Recognise vulnerabilities 



 Promote human agency 



 Balance power between parties&nbsp; 



 Reinforce collective resiliency through cooperation 



 Continuously monitor ‘what could possibly go wrong?’ 
 



<p>Each step is accompanied by quick links to resources from the ToIP Foundation and beyond. The good news is that this is not rocket science—you will find that you are already using many of these tools, such as risk assessment—and you just need to apply them in new ways using a human harms lens.</p>

 Unlocking the Power of Identity and Communication: Our New Messaging Feature The Lissi ID-Wallet, which gets information from different contacts<p>We are proud to announce the release of our new messaging feature for the Lissi Agent and Wallet to transform the way organisations interact with their clients. In today’s world, communication and trust are critical, and secure communication plays a massive role in building that trust. With this in mind, we have developed a new messaging feature that unlocks the true potential of the combination of identity credentials and messaging. In this article, we will explore the benefits of messaging for organisations and their clients, the reasons behind the creation of the messaging feature, and an overview of the feature&nbsp;itself.</p>GIF of the user flow in the Lissi wallet including messaging. The Power of authenticated communication channels <p>In the digital age, we often encounter people and organisations online before meeting them in person, and establishing trust is paramount in forming these relationships. Authentication plays a crucial role in building that trust, as it helps confirm that the person or organisation you are communicating with is genuine. Our Lissi Wallet’s new messaging feature enables organisations to use authenticated communication channels to form trusted relationships with their&nbsp;clients.</p>A man checking his contacts and their last messages within the Lissi identity&nbsp;Wallet Benefits of a messaging feature for end-users and organisations <p>We believe there are several reasons to introduce a messaging feature in the Lissi Wallet app from the perspective of end-users:</p>  Enhanced trust and security: Once a user accepts an authenticated organisation as new contact in the Wallet the encrypted and private channel prevents phishing and&nbsp;spam.  Context: Messages provide valuable context about offered or requested credentials. Receiving a credential without knowing where to use it is quite&nbsp;useless.  Convenience: By seamlessly integrating messaging within the app, users can receive messages without switching between different platforms. This creates a more cohesive and efficient user experience.  Being informed: Be it an update to a product or service, a user account, order status or upcoming events. Users are always informed about the most important topics with a particular organisation.  No phone numbers or email address required: To receive messages from organisations, customers do not have to provide a telephone number or an email address, and if they no longer wish to receive messages, they can just delete the connection. It’s as easy as&nbsp;that!  <p>From an organisational perspective there are plenty of good reasons, but here are the most important ones:</p>  Trusted relationship: As an organisation you provide the necessary trust to your clients so they can be sure the message is authentic, secure and confidential.  Attention: Getting the attention of your target audience, by triggering a push notification on their phone greatly increases the likelihood a client will read your message and engage in your&nbsp;offer.  Conversion: A guided user flow ensures a high conversion rate by providing all the necessary information.  Customer loyalty: Retain your customers by strengthening your customer engagement and access to your services with a digital&nbsp;wallet.  Secure P2P-messages: Send confidential messages and documents to customers instead of providing these in your internal&nbsp;postbox.   Overview of the New Messaging Feature <p>The new messaging feature in the Lissi Wallet app is illustrated as a chat within the wallet. This chat also includes credential related activities such as credential offers or information requests.</p>A woman receiving credentials and information and from a Music Festival within her Lissi identity&nbsp;wallet.<p>The messaging feature in the Lissi Wallet app is currently limited to uni-directional communication. This means users can only receive messages, but not send them. While this sounds limiting at first, it ensures organisations can focus on providing value without being overwhelmed with individual customer requests.</p> Getting Started with the Messaging Feature <p>To make use of the messaging feature as an organisation you can follow these&nbsp;steps:</p>  Fill out our <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/gvDYuzWg">contact form</a> in 1&nbsp;minute.

By utilising the messaging feature, organisations can build stronger relationships with their clients, ultimately enhancing trust and customer satisfaction.</p><p>Should you have a feature request from a user or organisational perspective for our new messaging feature you can fill out our <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/dL0zlI1z">Lissi Wallet feedback form</a>.

We joined some interesting sessions about AI ethics, chatted about <a href="https://ailiteracy.fyi">AI Literacy</a>, listened to panels about online power structures and spoke on a panel focusing on “Collaborating in the Digital Public Space”. We even sat underneath an old beautiful tree and talked about what transparency and bias means to us. Check out all of the official photos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mozfest/albums/72177720309311088">here</a>.</p><p>We also ran a session called ‘Fostering Transparency and Building a Cooperative Economy’. We introduced the idea why we should build a cooperative economy and gave some co-op history background. Ever fans of participatory sessions, after a short introduction, we collected questions from the entire room. We took notes while people were talking and then broke into themed groups.

 Pushing the Envelope 

<p>Some of our most important developments this quarter related to Gordian Envelope, our privacy-protecting structure for the storage and transmission of sensitive data.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Envelope-Intro/"></a></p>

<p>Rust Libraries. Our biggest advance was our conversion of our entire Gordian stack to Rust, including libraries for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-rust">cryptographic primitives</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">other cryptographic components</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-rust">dCBOR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir-rust">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr-rust">SSKR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur-rust">URs</a>, and ultimately <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-rust">Gordian Envelope</a>. Obviously, the memory safety of Rust should provide strong support for cryptographic usage, and we also hope this will enable the development of Android apps.</p>

<p>Educational Use Cases. So why would you use Envelope? We touched on that topic in Q2, starting with a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/assets/pdfs/digital-credentials-next-step.pdf">presentation</a> about educational use cases prepared for the Verifiable Credentials for Education Task Force at W3C. Our basic argument? Digital credentials are great, but they open students to identity theft and discrimination and institutions to liability. Our article on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Dangerous-Educational-Credentials/">“The Dangers of Digital Credentials in Education”</a> explains more.</p>

<p>Wellness Use Cases. As part of our work with <a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a>, we also put together a new set of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Wellness.md">“Wellness” use cases</a> for Gordian Envelope, detailing how you can keep tracker-related information safe, but also share it with health professionals and even use it to support public health, such as clinical trials. Thanks to Proxy for their support and advice in describing how privacy protection can support data collection for such sensitive information!</p>

<p>We’re next considering some use cases related to AI models and their provenance. If you’d like to provide some support on that, <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">let us know</a>.</p>

 Working on CSR 

<p>Obviously, Envelope is ultimately just a tool for creating the applications that we want. Our biggest application-level work continues to be on Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/CSR/README.md"></a></p>

<p>Gordian SeedTool 1.6. Our newest iteration of Gordian SeedTool is intended to show a minimum viable architecture for CSR. We’re still polishing it up, but we’ve already fully integrated Gordian Envelopes into GST, allowing keys, seeds, and shards to be stored (and reconstructed) with their metadata. This is the first, major step for CSR deployment. We’re looking forward to getting this interoperating with a variety of share servers!</p>

 Looking Back at Our Work 

<p>Though Gordian Envelope is our newest specification and our current highest priority, we’ve had a number of successes over the years in creating new technologies that people have wanted to use. We spent some time documenting some of that work in Q2.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsFF5HPKQIk"></a></p>

<p>Animated QRs. Animated QRs were our first big success, because there was a big demand for them: they were necessary for the airgapped transmission of PSBTs, which can grow beyond the bounds of static PSBTs (or at least beyond the bounds of many computer cameras). Our new <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/devs/animated-qrs.html">page</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsFF5HPKQIk">video</a> on Animated QRs talk more about their importance.</p>

<p>URs for PSBTs Tech Article. For developers who haven’t yet worked with PSBTs in URs (which is the foundation that enables Animated QRs), we also put together a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-4-psbt.md">tech article</a> on how the PSBT encoding works. (It’s super simple!) This is part of a series covering <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources</a>, which can be used for so much more than just PSBTs (like transmitting shares and requesting specific keys).</p>

<p>SSI: 5 Years On. Finally, we’ve been talking a lot about self-sovereign identity lately, which was one of our <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">big advances</a> even before Blockchain Commons existed, and which has been widely adopted by the community in projects such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. It’s really what got Blockchain Commons rolling, even though identity has been a relatively small focus for us since then. Two years ago Christopher wrote <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/SSI-5-Years-On/">“SSI: Five Years”</a> for magazine publication. Recently, we realized that many Blockchain Commons patrons and fans may not have read it, so we’ve reprinted it on our blog. (We’re also working on a few new articles to talk about self-sovereign identity seven years on, which you’ll hopefully see in early Q3).</p>

 Working Together on What’s Next 

<p>Of course, Blockchain Commons’ specifications are never just our work. They’re the work of a whole consortium of developers and designers who are working together to create interoperable specification that will work for everyone. Some of our most extensive work in Q2 was with various communities, including three meetings we hosted, and work not just with W3C (via the Verifiable Credentials for Education Task Force) but also the IETF.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/tree/master/meetings#detailed-list-of-meeting-summaries-with-archives-of-video-mp3-and-transcripts"></a></p>

<p>Silicon Salon 4. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon4/">fourth Silicon Salon</a> continued to bridge the gap between semiconductor design and hardware wallet development. Great presentations included <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon4/#andrew-poelstra-presentation">Andrew Poelstra’s look at anti-exfiltration</a>, <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon4/#luke-leighton--david-calderwood-presentation">Luke Leighton’s talk about biginteger problems</a>, and <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon4/#cramium-labs-presentation">Cramium Labs’ discussion of the issues with open hardware</a>. The latter was supported in part by our own musings about <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-open-silicon/">open silicon</a>. It’s a difficult problem that’s very different from the world of open software! Next Silicon Salon is scheduled for October.</p>

<p>Gordian Meetings. We also hosted Gordian Developer meetings in April and June, both of which are archived on our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/README.md#detailed-list-of-meeting-summaries-with-archives-of-video-mp3-and-transcripts">meetings page</a>. Topics included a lot of information detailed in this report, demos of the new rust libraries, discussion of Shamir advances including the new options from Ledger, a presentation from a new Developer member, SeedHammer, and lots more.</p>

<p>Welcome to SeedHammer. <a href="https://seedhammer.com/">SeedHammer</a> is a new member of the Gordian Developer community. They caught our eye with their electric hammer, which allows the engraving of QR codes. It actually uses our Animated QR work, but in a static (engraved!) format, which is a pretty cool medium shift. Take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXP9LjnLAfo">their video</a>, from the most recent Gordian Developer meeting.</p>

<p>dCBOR Advancement. We are continuing our work on a  deterministic CBOR, collaborating directly with the IETF CBOR group. We released our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">second iteration of the Internet-Draft</a> in May, incorporating comments and suggestions. We’re expecting the CBOR community to produce a third iteration, which will split the work into one I-D defining profiles for dCBOR and another discussing dCBOR numeric reduction, which has been one of the biggest topics of discussion. We’re very enthusiastic to see this new iteration, as multiple perspectives and contributions from a number of collaborators is how internet standards come to be.</p>

<p>DID Working Group Work. Meanwhile, we’ve also been supporting the DID Working group at W3C, which finished its initial work in May. There have been proposals made to extend the 1.0 effort, to offer great clarification, or even to expand it into DID 2.0. Our biggest concern has to do with the desire to formalize DID Methods in advance of these efforts, as we think that’s premature and that it could lock inferior methods into the standards. Thus, we’ll continue to offer our support for continuing 1.0 or advancing to 2.0 without those requirements.</p>

<p>IETF 117. Finally, Christopher and Wolf will be attending IETF 117 in San Francisco this July 22-28. If you’d like to talk to us at or around the event, please let us know. We’ve also got a side meeting for Gordian Envelope scheduled for Monday July 24th, 15:30-17:00, in the Golden Gate 4 Room; and have 15 minutes scheduled for dCBOR discussion at the CBOR meeting, which is at 17:30-18:30 that same day, in the Continental 5 room.</p>

 Looking Forward 

<p>As always, we’re looking forward as well. Obviously, a lot of our work is continuing, including dCBOR, CSR, and Gordian Envelope. In particular, we’re hoping to see new versions of dCBOR I-D in this coming quarter, and perhaps another iteration of CSR, but that all depends on communities we’re working with.</p>

<p>Some specific projects that we expect to tackle in the next three months include: releasing the full MVA of Gordian Seed Tool with CSR; finalizing our Rust libraries and initiating a community review; consolidating our documentation into a developer web site; working on legal efforts in Europe and Wyoming; attending IETF in San Francisco in July; and attending Rebooting Web of Trust 12 in Germany in September. (Maybe we’ll see you at one or the other?)</p>

<p>Government officials, policymakers, technologists, legal scholars, and human rights advocates are invited to offer feedback on a new white paper <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OIDF-Whitepaper_Human-Centric-Digital-Identity_Draft.pdf">“Human-Centric Identity: a primer for government officials”</a>. This follows the publication of “<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/05/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-final.pdf">Government-issued Digital Credentials and the Privacy Landscape</a>” (Flanagan, 2023), which delved into challenges of creating a globally viable privacy-preserving Digital Identity landscape. This paper zooms out and takes a higher level view of the role of Digital Identity Systems in delivering on the role of government. In particular, it grounds that role in the international human rights agenda.</p>
<p>Part 1 explores the opportunities and risks inherent in Digital Identity technologies. The paper then moves into Part 2, which analyzes existing and emerging Digital Identity paradigms and identifies common trade-off decisions. Part 3 builds upon existing principles based literature – especially the recently published OECD Recommendations on the governance of Digital Identity – to navigate a path through these decisions. It recognizes that no one size fits all nations, that no technology or architecture is a panacea, and that&nbsp; multiple systems may co-exist even within borders. However, it argues that there are design practices and strategic approaches that will lead to Digital Identity Systems that sustain and promote human rights.</p>
<p>The paper results from many months of due diligence, starting with public listening sessions at Authenticate, the November 2022 OIDF workshop, and IIWs IIWXXXV-XXXVI, and many interviews with active people in this space. In particular, the editors would like to thank the contributors who challenged the paper to give voice to the challenges of vulnerable populations, including stateless people, migrant families, and those “edge cases” that just might be central to our humanity (to quote contributor, Henk Marsman).</p>
<p>Your feedback will help ensure this paper serves as a strong platform to inform further dialog with governments, civil society, and technologists. Further, the OpenID Foundation warmly invites other non-profits that support the contents of the whitepaper to consider co-branding prior to its release for Final publication in September. Contact&nbsp; director@oidf.org for more information.</p>
<p>The comment period will be open until 15 August 2023. You may submit your feedback to <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>. Please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jJcBMy4NKBkB08Y0kDl3P_I39flzwsaI/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=107629249336857518397&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">this template</a> and reference specific line numbers for your proposed changes where appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will share more on the final outcomes and recommendations at events throughout 2023-24 and look forward to further collaboration.</p>

<p>Transmute has been a member of DIF since 2018 and was a leading contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Sidetree</a>, a protocol that enables scalable Decentralized Identifier (DID) networks that can run on top of any existing storage or ledger system. Transmute’s open standards-based digital identity and credential technologies simplify regulatory and business processes. The company is currently focused on enabling digitisation of trade documentation and workflows for global imports and exports.<br></p><p>You’ve consistently highlighted the value of interoperability. Why is this so important to your business? <br></p><p>What really drew us to DIF was the agnosticism towards any specific technology stack and the focus on interoperability. For example, one of the things we’ve collaborated on is open source interoperability tests that support integration of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) within existing infrastructure. You also see a lot of DIF community work on interoperability profiles. <br></p><p>A key moment for us was realizing we didn’t need a blockchain to use DIDs and VCs. We didn’t see demand for blockchain in the market, and you don’t need it to provide cryptographic proof that someone claimed something at a certain point in time. <br></p><p>As a result we shifted to focus heavily on W3C and IETF standards and doubled down on ensuring the Decentralized Identifier specification was adopted as an official web standard last year (Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform offers users did:web and did:key methods out of the box). <br></p><p>The standards are what enables data to cross data silos and organizational boundaries. We can interoperate with anyone that implements standards-conformant DIDs and VCs. Alternatively, we can directly integrate with other parties across the supply chain, other claims sources like ERP systems for instance, where necessary (check out our <a href="https://guide.transmute.industries/verifiable-data-platform/platform-guide/adapter-marketplace?ref=blog.identity.foundation">VDP Adapter Marketplace</a>).<br></p><p>“Let’s solve the data problem by getting on the same [insert blockchain name or other infrastructure du jour]” has not worked. Everyone has made tremendous investments in some kind of system. The purpose of the standards is to insulate the industry from the tech stack. <br></p><p>The terminology used in trade documents was standardized many years ago. How does this affect your work at Transmute? <br></p><p>In addition to our work at DIF, we’re a leading contributor to the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">W3C supply chain traceability vocabulary</a> (a repository of VC schemas for specific trade categories). To ensure the data inside the VCs can be interpreted by all parties, including machines, we’ve gone to the current sources of trust for each product class and mode of transit that touch our customers. <br></p><p>As well as playing the roles of author and editor of several cornerstone specifications at the W3C, we’ve pioneered open standards-based semantic approaches with UN/CEFACT, the body that standardizes terms used in global trade and where Nis Jespersen, Transmute’s Solution Architect<a href="https://uncefact.unece.org/display/uncefactpublic/JSON-LD+Web+Vocabulary?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> leads the UN Linked Data Project</a>. In addition we collaborated with GS1, the kings of ubiquitous product identifiers and formats, having commercialized the literal barcode, to ensure we’re not reinventing definitions. We’ve taken into account many modes of perspective, from <a href="https://www.iata.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IATA</a> to <a href="https://dcsa.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DCSA</a>.<br></p><p>You’ve previously spoken about the power of Linked Data. Please can you unpack that for us a little? &nbsp;<br></p><p>Transmute is focused on solving two big problems in global supply chains and cross-border trade. One is, where did the information flowing through our supply chain come from? The other is, what does it mean?<br></p><p>Supply chains still heavily depend on paper-based information flows. Each and every typical international shipment has a minimum of five documents issued, distributed and verified. What’s more, none of these trade documents or product identifiers are typically issued all at once — or even by the same party in the “chain.” "Digitization" so far has meant scanning and transcribing the piece of paper and emailing PDFs. <br></p><p>Transmute Verifiable Data Platform (VDP) uses Decentralized Identifiers to digitally “sign” trade documents for automatic and traceable persistence. DIDs mean you always know where a piece of data came from — who it came from — which solves the first problem.<br></p><p>Our product also leverages Linked Data (JSON-LD) to both codify the linkages across data types and documentation, and also to surface trends and relationships for interpretation or consideration. Making sure machines can read and understand your data is the first and most critical step towards unlocking actionable business insights that automatically tune with time. &nbsp;<br></p><p>This Linked Data aspect enables documents from multiple issuers to be automatically incorporated into a knowledge graph by matching URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) contained within the files.<br></p><p>Everyone in the ecosystem benefits. For example, knowledge graphs enable manufacturers to answer questions about costs and resilience, such as how many suppliers do we have in a certain country or region and what are the cost and delivery-time trends across certain types of suppliers, or where are the weakest “links” and strongest dependencies within our supply network? Customs authorities, like the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on the other hand want to clear imported goods as efficiently as possible so they can focus on enforcement in problem areas. Incoming import credentials that are built with Linked Data allow them to more rapidly spot anomalies for further investigation. <br></p><p>One of the advantages of Verifiable Credentials in a commercial context is the ability to enable ecosystem collaboration while protecting participants’ confidentiality and Intellectual Property, for example via selective disclosure. How does this fit with the Knowledge Graph concept? &nbsp;<br>The kind of information that’s available on a product should depend on who you are, for example whether you’re CBP or the end buyer. Using Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials means our customers can provision access more granularly to different stakeholders. For example, if one party possesses ten documents, their knowledge graph will include the data from all ten documents, but if they only need to submit six of these to another party, say a regulator or an end customer, that party’s knowledge graph will only include data from these six documents. <br></p><p>Data minimization is a compelling commercial proposition that enables customers to only take liability for the data they need to perform the task at hand. <br></p><p>We have many of the same values as the Self Sovereign Identity community, but applied to businesses rather than individuals. What you get is a view of your information ecosystem that’s private to you. <br></p><p>How do verifiable data and Linked Data relate to AI and machine learning?</p><p>Everyone wants to use AI/ML on their data, but the quality of the output depends on the quality of the inputs. Having high-integrity data structured and connected to sufficient context to enable an AI or any other machine to interpret it is game-changing — we’re still discovering new uses of this data.<br><br><br></p>

<p>The manual nature of inventory management further compounded the challenge, leading to time-consuming and error-prone processes. Additionally, the fragmentation between departments and hospitals hindered the efficient sharing of medical resources.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, a specialised smartphone application was developed. This application leverages GS1 standards and smartphone camera capabilities to scan barcodes.</p>

<p>If you’ll be at IETF 117, we hope you’ll join us for dCBOR discussions there on Monday July 24th. The CBOR meeting will be 17:30-18:30 July 24th (Session IV) in the Continental 5 room. We have 15 minutes to discuss dCBOR. We’ll also be holding a public side meeting on Gordian Envelope immediately before that, at 15:30-17:00 July 24th (Session III) in the Golden Gate 4 room, and we expect to have some discussions of dCBOR there too, since it’s the foundation of Envelope.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoD5_Vr6qzw"></a></p>

<p>CBOR has been Blockchain Commons’ data format of choice since we began work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources</a>. The binary format is  concise, compact, and self-describing. It’s also good in constrained environments and platform and language agnostic. But perhaps most importantly, it’s standardized as an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949">IETF RFC</a>. Altogether, that’s made it a perfect data format for storing and transmitting the crucial data that protects cryptocurrency and other digital assets.</p>

<p>However, CBOR also includes a lightly described option that can make it even more useful: using the requirements of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949#name-deterministically-encoded-c">§4.2 of the RFC</a>, CBOR can be deterministically encoded. This means that the same data will always produce the same output. This ability was crucial for our work on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Envelope-Intro/">Gordian Envelope</a>, which builds out a Merkle Tree of hashes: for the Merkle Tree to be consistent, the hashes must be consistent, and so the underlying data must be consistent. Using the deterministic version of CBOR ensures that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there was not strong support for deterministic CBOR. Though there are certainly a number of use cases that call for data consistency, the major libraries just adopted the main conventions of CBOR. If someone was using the deterministic features, they were doing so in a more ad hoc way, in part because the RFC only partially defines the requirements: there’s the opportunity for different applications to decide to encode elements such as <code>-0</code> or <code>NaN</code> or even numbers in different ways.</p>

<p>As a result, Blockchain Commons has been working with the IETF CBOR community this year to develop an official dCBOR specification.</p>

<p>Our Internet-Draft contains our current interpretation:</p>

 
   <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">dCBOR I-D</a> —&nbsp;dCBOR: Deterministic CBOR Implementation Practices 
 

<p>We’ve supported that with Rust and Swift libraries plus a CLI program:</p>

 
   <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-rust">bc-dcbor-rust</a> — dCBOR for Rust 
   <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftDCBOR">BCSwiftDCBOR</a> — dCBOR for Swift 
   <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/dcbor-cli">dcbor-cli</a> — dCBOR command-line parser/validator 
 

<p>None of this is final! We’ve presented to IETF Dispatch and we’ve been engaging in discussions on the CBOR mailing list since February.</p>

 
   <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/dcbor.md">Many Links</a> — Our dCBOR links page 
 

<p>At this point, we’re expecting the CBOR community to produce the next iteration of the specification, which will split the work into one I-D that defines profiles for dCBOR and another that discusses dCBOR numeric reduction, which has been the focus of much discussion. We’re very enthusiastic to see this new iteration, as multiple perspectives and contributions from a number of collaborators is how internet standards come to be.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in a deterministic version of CBOR and/or if you’re using our own Gordian Envelope, which requires it, we invite you to join our discussions on the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/cbor">CBOR mailing list</a> and as a member of our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe.html#gordian-developers">Gordian Developer community</a>.</p>

<p>On Thursday, July 13, we’re hosting a video-conference AMA (Ask Me – us – Anything) about digital resilience! From 5-6pm CEST, members of our team will gather in a video conference to answer your questions about digital resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This AMA follows on from the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/come-to-our-ama-ask-me-anything-responsible-data-and-social-justice-edition/" title="">first one we held</a>, in June, which we tried out as a potential new format of support. The session went really well and&nbsp;was a great experience to be able to talk to a variety of social justice organisers from different countries about responsible data. So we’re excited to host another AMA – this time focused on digital resilience!</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-do-we-think-about-when-we-think-about-digital-resilience/" title="">we see digital resilience</a> as a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from, and respond to, digital security threats; to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members; and to ensure their wellbeing.</p>



<p>In this call, we’re inviting social justice organisers who want to learn more about digital resilience to come with your questions (or just sit in and listen to what others are asking!). Questions can be quite broad and could be things like:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 What are some of the ways I can make my organisation more digitally resilient? 



 What should we understand about our context in order to use tech tools in ways that protect us?

      <p>Interoperability is the ultimate challenge of a Decentralized Self-Sovereign Identity. Hyperledger Aries is hosting an Interopathon to showcase all the work their community has done to promote Interoperability. We have also started discussions about a standard import/export format that would further improve interop across identity agents.</p>

When it comes to ComposeDB on Ceramic, given that the underlying protocol entails an open and public network, any data streams can be accessed and read by any participating nodes.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will walk through one methodology you can use to encrypt data and decrypt data on ComposeDB. However, before we dive in, let’s first walk through some key concepts that will come into play.</p> What are DIDs? <p>DIDs are the W3C standard for Decentralized Identifiers. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:key:z6Mki...</code>, to a DID document that contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange.</p><p>JOSE is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IETF</a> that stands for JSON Object Signing and Encryption, and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p> Building With Ceramic Libraries <p>Whether you need to authenticate users and create DID-based sessions, or you need to encrypt data to live on ComposeDB, we've created several libraries that can easily be accessed as node package dependencies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519?ref=blog.ceramic.network">key-did-provider-ed25519</a> offers a simple DID Provider that supports both signing and data encryption.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did?ref=blog.ceramic.network">js-did</a> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/StableLib/stablelib?ref=blog.ceramic.network">@stablelib/sha256</a> is a library that allows developers to encrypt data and is a subset of the larger <a href="https://github.com/StableLib/stablelib?ref=blog.ceramic.network">@stablelib</a> collection of encryption algorithms.</p> Setup your environment <p>This tutorial will walk you through how to set up encryption capabilities within an existing repository. However, if you’re looking to start from scratch, we recommend exploring our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/launching-create-ceramic-app/">Use Ceramic App</a> starter.</p> Dependencies   MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet  Ability to successfully run local Ceramic and ComposeDB Clients  Scaffolding to allow for local runtime composite deployments when starting your ComposeDB node   Generate Encryption Key <p>In your application, prompt your users to generate a special DID to be used when encrypting messages or accessing encrypted data on ComposeDB. In order to do so, you will first define a <code>userPrompt</code> variable that will be viewable to the user as the message shown in their wallet when signing the request, while also generating consistent entropy used by the hashing algorithm (resulting in the <code>seed</code> defined below).</p><p>The seed is a secret that will then be used to define a new DID class instance (using the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519?ref=blog.ceramic.network">key-did-provider-ed25519</a> library). Finally, execute the <code>authenticate()</code> method on your new DID instance, returning the new DID to be saved as a session.</p> <code>import * as u8a from 'uint8arrays'
import { hash } from '@stablelib/sha256'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'
import KeyResolver from 'key-did-resolver'
import { DID } from 'dids'

/*
this prompt can be customized to whatever message you want to display for the
user. As long as the same message is signed, it should generate the same entropy
*/

const userPrompt = "Give this app permission to read or write your private data";

const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
const entropy = await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'personal_sign', 
  params: [u8a.toString(u8a.fromString(userPrompt), 'base16'), accounts[0],
],
});

const seed = hash(u8a.fromString(entropy.slice(2), "base16"));
const encryptionDid = new DID({
  resolver: KeyResolver.getResolver(),
  provider: new Ed25519Provider(seed),
});
await encryptionDid.authenticate();

console.log('encryptionDid', encryptionDid.id);
</code>  Encrypting and Decrypting Data <p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll be using a simple direct message data composite. Our top-level model will only make use of two fields—a “recipient” (DID value type), and a “directMessage” (a stringified JWE).</p><p>For the purposes of this tutorial, our simple message model would read as follows:</p> <code>type EncryptedMessage @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A direct message encrypted data model") {
    recipient: DID!
    directMessage: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}
</code> <p>Make sure to compile and deploy your new composite on your Ceramic client, allowing you to mutate and query the models.</p> Encrypt &amp; Write <p>If we want to encrypt data that only the currently authenticated user can decrypt we can simply encrypt it directly with the <code>encryptionDid</code>. In order to avoid escaping the JSON after stringifying your resulting JWE (preventing the data from conforming to the String constraint), we can temporarily replace double quotes with backticks.</p><p>Use your composeClient instance to perform a mutation using the values generated from the encrypted message:</p> <code>
const cleartext = 'this is a secret message';
const jwe = await encryptionDid.createDagJWE(cleartext, [encryptionDid.id]);

//stringify your JWE object and replace escape characters
const stringified = JSON.stringify(jwe).replace(/"/g,"`");

const message = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    mutation {
    createEncryptedMessage(
      input: {
        content: {
          recipient: "${encryptionDid.id}"
          directMessage: "${stringified}"
        }
      }
    ) {
      document {
        recipient{
          id
        }
        directMessage
      }
    }
  }
`)
</code>  Read &amp; Decrypt <p>Similarly, in order to allow only authenticated users to decrypt data, we can also allow access using their <code>encryptionDid</code>. The following example query obtains the first message and uses the authenticated user’s <code>encryptionDid</code> to decrypt the message:</p> <code>const query = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
      query{
        encryptedMessageIndex(first:1){
          edges{
            node{
              recipient{
                id
              }
              directMessage
            }
          }
        }
      }
      `);

const arr = query.data?.encryptedMessageIndex?.edges;

//Reverse-replacement of backticks for double-quotes prior to parsing
const string = arr[0].node.directMessage.replace(/`/g,'"');
const plaintext = await encryptionDid.decryptDagJWE(JSON.parse(string));
</code>  Multiple User Encryption <p>In certain situations, you may choose to grant multiple users access to encrypting and decrypting data on ComposeDB. In this situation, two components of your data composite might be comprised of one model for storing encryption keys for each user.</p> Store Encryption Keys <p>Let’s say your data model for storing encryption keys reads as follows:</p> <code>type PublicEncryptionDID @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A data model to store encryption DIDs for an application") {
    author: DID! @documentAccount
		publicEncryptionDID: DID!
}
</code> <p>And your simplified encrypted message model reads as follows:</p> <code>type EncryptedMessage @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "An encrypted message data model") {
    message: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
    recipients: [DID] @list(maxLength: 200)
}

</code> <p>Hopping back to our application, as we authenticate users, we can store their corresponding encryption keys:</p> <code>//the method below creates a session for your user and returns their DID.id
const auth = await encryptionDid.authenticate();

const storeEncryptionKey = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    mutation {
      createPublicEncryptionDID(
        input: {
          content: {
            publicEncryptionDID:  "${auth}"
          }
        }
      ) {
        document {
          author{
            id
          }
          publicEncryptionDID  {
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);
</code>  Writing Group-Encrypted Data <p>Let’s say you’ve gated a segment of your audience based on their <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/accounts/pkh-did/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">PKH DID CeramicAccount</a> (explained below). This section is intended to show how to encrypt data that multiple users can decrypt.</p><p>Since anyone within the Ceramic network can write to any stream, you can filter based on which CeramicAccount authored each model instance. In our example below, we’ve displayed filtering by the <code>did:pkh</code>. This type of DID account allows interoperability between blockchain accounts and DIDs. Each time you are prompting your users to author mutations using an Ethereum wallet, the corresponding native Ceramic account is the PKH DID.</p><p>For the full specification, please reference the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">PKH DID Method specification</a>.</p><p>The example below shows how to create an encrypted message only two separate users can decrypt:</p> <code>//Query first user based on PKH DID
const query1 = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    query {
      node(id: "did:pkh...") {
        ... on CeramicAccount {
          id
          publicEncryptionDidList(first: 1) {
            edges {
              node {
                publicEncryptionDID{
                  id
                }
              }
            }
          }
        } 
      }
    }
  `);

//Query second user based on PKH DID
const query2 = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    query {
      node(id: "did:pkh...") {
        ... on CeramicAccount {
          id
          publicEncryptionDidList(first: 1) {
            edges {
              node {
                publicEncryptionDID{
                  id
                }
              }
            }
          }
        } 
      }
    }
  `);

const results = [...query1.data?.node?.publicEncryptionDidList?.edges,
				 ...query2.data?.node?.publicEncryptionDidList?.edges];

const users = new Array();
results.forEach(el =&gt; {
  users.push(el.node.publicEncryptionDID.id);
})

const cleartext = 'this is a shared secret message';
const jwe = await encryptionDid.createDagJWE(cleartext, users);

//stringify your JWE object and replace escape characters
const stringified = JSON.stringify(jwe).replace(/"/g,"`");
const encryptedGroupMessage = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
  mutation {
    createEncryptedMessage(
      input: {
        content: {
          message: "${stringified}"
          recipients: 
            ["${users[0]}", "${users[1]}"]
        }
      }
    ) {
      document {
        message
      }
    }
  }
`);
</code>  Decoding Group-Encrypted Data <p>Regardless of how many encryption keys representing individual users are involved in generating a JWE, a single holder of just one of those encryption keys will still be able to decrypt the corresponding message in a similar fashion:</p> <code>const query = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    query{
      encryptedMessageIndex(first:1){
        edges{
          node{
            message
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

const arr = query.data?.encryptedMessageIndex?.edges;

//Reverse-replacement of backticks for double-quotes prior to parsing
const string = arr[0].node.message.replace(/`/g,'"');
const plaintext = await encryptionDid.decryptDagJWE(JSON.parse(string));
</code> <p>That’s it for this tutorial! Hope you enjoyed exploring one encryption methodology you can use, both when encrypting data on behalf of your users, as well as segmenting your application’s user base and allowing only those partitions the ability to decrypt relevant data.</p><p>If you want to get started with ComposeDB on Ceramic and don’t know where to start, dive into the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Developer Docs</a>, or walk through a detailed <a href="https://dev.to/fllstck/decentralized-databases-composedb-49m3?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a> that features end-to-end steps using an article publishing platform as the example use case.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We can trace the history of digital wallets with a Capability-Maturity Model (CMM) from paper and magnetic stripes to chip and mobiles. The fundamentally important trend over the decades has been to use smart technology to prove the properties of the data carried in the wallet. Today’s smart phone wallets prove the origin of each credential, possession by its rightful owner, the manufacturer and history of the wallet, and other metadata.</p>

      <p>What if instead, you could securely and selectively share your ID with an expiring link? Your name and photo will be visible but other private details will be blurred out. Your Airbnb now believes you are who you say you are because they also trust the issuer of your digital credential. Likewise, you don’t have to worry that a copy of your full license is on a stranger’s phone forever. Everyone rests easy, and you enjoy the heck out of your vacation.</p>

      <p>In the offline world, we typically store credentials in a physical wallet — it keeps them all in one place, protects them by keeping them close to our body, and makes them easy to carry around and access when we need them. The job of a digital wallet is no different:</p>

       
         Store your credentials, keys/keycards, bills/receipts, etc 
         Protect them from theft or prying eyes. 
         Keep them handy — easily available and portable across all your devices.

Paper VC’s are hard to bring to parity with “digital VC’s”. The biggest issue is binding subject to holder and verifying that. There were also callouts on how do you prevent replication. 
       

      <p>Traditionally, QR codes with the entire VC can be put onto a piece of paper. We proposed compression on those QR codes using CBOR-LD that reduces size of codes by 50%.</p>

      <p>Alternative ways include adding VC’s into NFC chips and adding the NFC identifier as a claim to the VC preventing duplication. There is a cost overhead to this compared to paper but is a cost potentially worth occurring.</p>

      <p>If an identity is tied to a single persistent private key, then loss or compromise of the private key will mean total loss of the identity. Since key compromise and/or loss do happen there needs to be a way to recover from this in order to have a persistent digital identity. <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/shared_terminology_for_digital_identity_systems.md">See here for definitions used</a>.</p>

      <p>If the user of the identity suspects that a key is or may be compromised the user can rotate their key by submitting a new key to the system, signed by the old key. After this the old key can be revoked.</p>

      <p>Under our analysis of trust and the digital world, we define different types of trust relationships and find out the factors that are needed to ensure a fully representative model.Next, to meet the challenges of digital trust modelling, comprehensive trust model evaluation criteria areproposed, and potential securities and privacy issues of trust modelling are analyzed. Finally, we provide awide-ranging analysis of different methodologies, mathematical theories, and how they can be applied totrust modelling</p>

How are organizations trying to monetize trust frameworks? What’s going right, and what’s going wrong with the way trust frameworks are being implemented?

      <p>Trust frameworks are not a new concept. They are commonly used outside of the world of digital identities, to govern a variety of multi-party systems where participants desire the ability to engage in a common type of transaction with anyone of the other participants, and to do so in a consistent and predictable manner. In such cases, they are proven to work and scale. Common examples include credit card systems, electronic payment systems and the internet domain name registration system, which all rely on a set of interdependent specifications, rules, and agreements. This set of specifications, rules and agreements is referred to by various names, such as “operating regulations,” “scheme rules,” or “operating policies.” In the world of identity systems they are commonly referred to as a “trust framework.”</p>

<p>FAGE sees GS1 GDSN as a key part of their digital transformation. Using the Network has allowed them to deliver product data to their customers in just 20% of the time that they needed before. The company has also seen their internal operations and processes become faster and smoother. And GDSN has already allowed FAGE to penetrate new customers in Europe, as their product listings already met the high-quality digitised expectations of these customers. Going forward, FAGE intends to start adding to their GDSN listings information about packaging recyclability and sustainability.</p>

<p>Business Situation</p>



<p>Intuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for more than 100 million consumers and businesses around the world using TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks and Mailchimp. The company’s long- held commitment to Design for Delight principles has been a key ingredient of its success in fueling innovation across its products, services and customer touchpoints to create bold new AI and data-driven personalized experiences at scale.</p>



<p>To execute on a user-centric focus, Intuit’s customer authentication products team, led by Rakan Khalid, Intuit Group Product Manager, Identity, justifies and prioritizes development of new authentication capabilities based on user research, security trends and technology advancements in the industry. This has led to an overarching strategy that emphasizes secure and convenient authentication experiences on its platform.</p>



<p>Intuit saw the potential of the FIDO (Fast ID Online) Alliance early on and began a multi-year FIDO journey in 2018 to reduce customer friction and enhance security, at lower operating costs.</p>



<p>Business Challenges</p>



<p>Intuit set out to address several challenges when evolving its customer authentication strategy to serve a growing customer base across a diverse set of product offerings and user personas:</p>



 
 Customers experienced friction when logging on, which negatively impacted key business metrics. 
 



 
 Sign-in times (time to successful sign-in) were getting longer, and calls into customer care for account sign-in-related issues were increasing. 



 Product teams were challenged to balance ease-of-use and convenience for users with appropriate levels of security. 
 



<p>Business Objectives</p>



<p>The team set out to achieve the following business objectives for customer authentication across Intuit’s product portfolio:</p>



<p>Results and Benefits</p>



 
 Deliver a delightful and seamless customer authentication experience that “just works” across multiple devices. 



 Push the envelope on customer authentication technology to further enhance the security posture of Intuit. 



 Build a resilient, scalable, durable customer authentication capability for its current and future business needs. 
 
 



  
 


<p></p> <p>OVERVIEW</p>“As an early adopter of FIDO, we’ve seen<br>significant business benefits and are completely on board with continuing to leverage the latest FIDO innovations with our partner, Nok Nok.”<br> <br>Rakan Khalid, Intuit Group Product Manager, Identity<br><br>Intuit was able to reduce customer friction, resulting in authentication success rates of 95% to 97% and 70% faster sign-in speeds. <p></p>


 
 


 


 
 


 


 
 


 


 
 


 


 
  
 



<p>FIDO Authentication Deployment – Measured Steps</p>



<p>Intuit implemented a FIDO-based customer authentication solution in line with the FIDO Alliance’s founding members’ goals. FIDO protocols are based on an asymmetric cryptographic authentication framework designed to enhance security, provide a better user experience (compared to traditional passwords) and reduce cost and complexity.</p>



<p>Although FIDO is an open standard, the expertise required to code and deploy a scalable FIDO solution for millions of consumer and small business customers led Intuit to license a FIDO authentication platform.</p>



<p>Intuit selected the Nok NokTM S3 Authentication Suite (S3 Suite) for its advanced FIDO features and capabilities; optional on-prem deployment model; and speed, scale, and resilience, which was validated by Nok Nok enterprise customers.</p>



<p>Intuit’s authentication team placed a high priority on working with a FIDO leader with deep and relevant experience in customer authentication and therefore well-equipped to keep pace with industry progress with this fast- evolving technology.</p>



<p>Build vs. Buy: Intuit recognized that the company would benefit from the expertise of a vendor with experience working with other major companies on its authentication journey, and enjoy access to innovative product enhancements along the way.</p>



<p>Progressive Deployment: Intuit opted to deploy Nok Nok’s customer authentication solution across multiple apps in a controlled and measurable manner:</p>



 
 Intuit’s authentication team initially tested Nok Nok’s FIDO passwordless customer authentication on the mobile iOS version of an Intuit product with a small customer base. 
 



 
 Over the next few months, the team rolled out Nok Nok’s FIDO passwordless solution on mobile iOS and Android platforms for a broader customer base on multiple Intuit products. 
 



 
 The team added FIDO as an option to Intuit’s passwordless customer onboarding flow, which improved onboarding conversion rates and reduced subsequent sign-in times. 



 Over the last 5 years, Intuit has grown its total FIDO registrations to over 77 million. 
 



<p>Authentication Solution Delivers on Business Objectives </p>



<p>Intuit has been able to achieve all of its business objectives, while simultaneously addressing new use cases for a growing customer base:</p>



 
 Delightful Customer Sign-in – FIDO-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) for customer sign-in dramatically improves and simplifies the user sign-in experience because it’s completed in a single user step. This reduces the need for a multi-step authentication process (e.g., password, texting one-time passcodes). Using FIDO, Intuit users are presented with a seamless, passwordless flow using device-based platform authenticators, such as biometrics with which they’re already comfortable. 
 



<p>Today, more than 85% of all customer authentications on Intuit’s mobile apps are now done using FIDO</p>



 
 Enhanced Customer Security – When FIDO authentication is used, it eliminates the passing of passwords and one-time tokens between apps and services, which can reduce the risk of interception attacks. 



 Global Scale – Since Nok Nok’s S3 platform is trusted by some of the largest banks, telcos and fintech brands across five continents and has been proven to scale across demanding customer environments, it’s given Intuit the confidence that it will continue to scale with the company’s future growth to match uptime and authentication speeds. 
 



<p>Business Results</p>



<p>By deploying a passwordless solution for customer authentication, Intuit was able to reduce customer friction, thereby reducing operating expenses. Users who adopted the FIDO passwordless authentication option experienced authentication success rates of 95% to 97% when compared to a baseline of 80% for legacy multi-factor authentication and 70% faster sign-in speeds over non-FIDO sign-ins.</p>



<p>Looking Ahead</p>



<p>Over the past several years, Intuit has experienced the power of FIDO customer authentication for its consumer and small business customers, and validated its benefits with its product, technology, security, user experience and customer care teams. Looking ahead, the company intends to explore multi-device passkey technology as the next frontier on its authentication journey.</p>

<p>The Findynet Cooperative is soliciting answers to a request for information (RFI) from SSI solution vendors. Our goal is to build a list of candidate solutions to be used in our pilots and later in our production network.</p>
 Scope of the RFI 
<p>To support organizations participating in the pilots, we will create a list of SSI solutions and their vendors. Of course, participating organizations can choose their own solutions, as long as they are interoperable with the protocols and formats selected for the pilot.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting organizations participating in the Findynet pilots, we will use the data collected to evaluate the potential future provision of SSI services as part of our own service portfolio.</p>
<p>We are interested in solutions that enable organizations to:</p>
 
 hold and present Verifiable Credentials issued to them 
 issue Verifiable Credentials to other parties and 
 verify Verifiable Credentials presented to them by other parties. 
 
<p>Some vendors refer to these as “all-in-one SSI solutions.”</p>
 Background and previous work 
<p>We have already worked with TNO to <a href="https://findyfi.github.io/wallet-overview/">add more SSI solution providers</a> to their <a href="https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/wallet-overview/">Wallet Overview</a>. This list is well suited for technical comparison of solutions. Next, we want to learn about the advanced features, APIs, support, business models, etc. of the SSI solutions.</p>
 Findynet pilots 
<p>The Findynet Cooperative together with its members and other stakeholders, is launching a series of projects to test and pilot Self-sovereign identity (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials. We will run the pilots during 2023 and 2024, aiming to be ready for production in early 2025.</p>
<p>In some pilots, we may require compatibility with our current test network (<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>). In some pilots, there may be a requirement to be <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">EUDI ARF</a> compatible. In yet another pilot, we may require <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Conformant+wallets">EBSI compliant</a> technology. We are not looking for one solution to be used on all pilots (although that is a very welcome option), but rather a list of solutions to choose from based on each pilot’s requirements.</p>
<p>Our pilots are not directly linked to the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-wallet-implementation">EUDI Large Scale Pilots</a>. Findynet is an associated partner in the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EUDI Wallet Consortium</a>, and there may be some synergies between some Findynet pilots and the EUDI Large Scale Pilots.</p>
 How to participate 
<p>You can answer to the RFI by filling in the <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/NE7V50bx6f">online RFI form</a>. You can also send additional information to an email address included in the form. The deadline for submission is August 6th, 2023.</p>
<p>For more information, please contact:<br>Samuel Rinnetmäki, CTO, Findynet Cooperative, tel. +358 40 534 4332, <a href="mailto:samuel.rinnetmaki@findy.fi">samuel.rinnetmaki@findy.fi</a></p>

<p>This white paper describes the need for a more secure and convenient solution for authentication. Passwords have long been the standard for authentication, but the risks inherent to passwords reduce their efficacy as an authentication mechanism. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions have been on market for some time, but their widespread adoption has been slow due to various barriers. Passkeys are an authentication solution that reduces the adoption barriers of traditional MFA mechanisms, while offering improved security, ease of use, and scalability over passwords and classic MFA solutions. Passkeys utilize on-device biometrics or PINs for authentication and provide a seamless user experience. This white paper outlines the benefits of passkeys, the user experience, and adoption considerations for enterprises.</p>

<p>Half-day virtual Authenticate Summit to educate on how passkeys can fit into a variety of enterprise environments</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 27, 2023 – <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are a gamechanger for signing to online services and apps, providing phishing-resistant security and easy user experience far superior to passwords and other phishable forms of authentication. Enterprises globally are interested in passkeys but may be wondering: how do I start? And “what type of passkey is right for my environment?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance addresses these questions in a new series of papers providing considerations for leveraging passkeys across different enterprise use cases. The series was developed by the FIDO Alliance’s Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) and can be found at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers in the series are:</p>



 
 FIDO Deploying Passkeys in the Enterprise – Introduction 



 Replacing Password-Only Authentication with Passkeys in the Enterprise 



 FIDO Authentication for Moderate Assurance Use Cases&nbsp; 



 High Assurance Enterprise FIDO Authentication&nbsp; 
 



<p>A fifth paper in the series, “Displacing Password + SMS OTP Authentication with Passkeys,” is expected to publish later this summer.</p>



<p>“Passkeys are a new concept to many enterprise organizations, in terms of both terminology and FIDO authentication capabilities,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “These papers demystify synced and device-bound passkeys and provide the decision points for how to leverage them across a variety of use cases, whether they are using passwords alone, legacy MFA or FIDO-based solutions today. These papers provide a great foundation for anyone looking to understand how passkeys can increase their organization’s security posture, meet legal and regulatory requirements and decrease support and other costs associated with authentication.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get an Overview Live at Authenticate Virtual Summit: Considerations for Passkeys in the Enterprise</p>



<p>Those interested in this topic are encouraged to join the FIDO Alliance and members of its Enterprise Deployment Working Group on June 29, 2023 at 9:00 am PT / 12:00 pm ET for the free <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/passkeys-in-the-enterprise/">Authenticate Virtual Summit: Considerations for Passkeys in the Enterprise</a> to learn how passkeys can fit into a variety of enterprise environments.</p>



<p>Sessions will cover introductory material, considerations across various use cases, and criteria to evaluate how synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys can meet varying legal, regulatory, and security requirements across enterprise environments.</p>

 Corporate overview and challenge 



<p>As the “CASE” trend is gaining ground in the automotive industry, Toyota Motor Corporation, a leader and evolving company in the industry, is changing its model from a “car company” to a “mobility company”. In the area of “C: Connected,” Toyota is working to realize its vision of “Mobility for All – Freedom and Enjoyment of Mobility for All People,” and is developing a number of new services, including a “digital key” that allows the use of smartphones as keys, as well as a website and smartphone applications, for a wide range of users.</p>



<p>The “TOYOTA/LEXUS common ID” (“common ID”), a customer authentication service for safe and comfortable use of various services provided by Toyota, plays an important role in the provision of a series of services. The 5 million TOYOTA common IDs are linked to about 40 different services, and the multiple smartphone applications provided to customers required the input of IDs/passwords for each application.</p>



 FIDO 2 deployment 



<p>Toyota Motor Corporation has decided to deploy FIDO authentication as an optional authentication function for the “Common ID,” the major advantage of which is that by registering FIDO authentication credentials in advance, users will no longer need to go through the process of entering their ID/password each time they use each smartphone application.</p>



<p>Prior to deploying FIDO authentication, Toyota Motor Corporation had been using one-time password authentication and backup code authentication as a means of multi-factor authentication for common IDs. The main reason for choosing FIDO as one of the new options for multi-factor authentication this time was the consideration of the robust security and usability of FIDO authentication. By utilizing FIDO, which is a multi-factor authentication that involves possession using biometrics on the smartphone used in everyday life, a high level of security was ensured, and it also contributed to an improved user experience.</p>



<p>NRI Secure Technologies, Inc. (NRI Secure), which manages common IDs, has an authentication infrastructure called “Uni-ID Libra” that is compliant with FIDO authentication, and we requested their cooperation for implementation.</p>



<p>Until the introduction of FIDO authentication for iOS and Android devices, the differences in behavior depending on the OS (whether or not Discoverable Credential (formerly known as Resident Key) is supported, explicit user interaction during key registration is required for Safari for iOS, etc.) The issue was the impact on the UX.In the end, we were able to absorb the differences in UX by modifying the authentication web screen, and this led to a solution.</p>



<p>With this implementation, Toyota Motor Corporation has also focused on the importance of designing the life cycle of FIDO authenticators together. In providing services, it is necessary to prepare not only for authentication, but also for registration, device switching, and account recovery in case of loss. If other companies that provide services to consumers consider FIDO authentication, they should have a method that can maintain security strength when switching devices or recovering accounts.</p>

<blockquote>
 “With the expansion of the connected strategy, the number of operations that can be carried out on smartphone applications and websites has been increasing. While convenient, they can also lead to accidents if misused, so more security measures are required. We believe that FIDO authentication will contribute as one piece to continue providing convenient and safe mobility services to our customers.”

<p>The event will gather industry leaders, cybersecurity experts, and government representatives across the region to explore the latest developments in authentication technologies.</p>



<p>Singapore, June 26, 2023 — The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today its first-ever FIDO APAC Summit 2023, the premier event dedicated to advancing and promoting phishing-resistant FIDO authentication in the region. The summit, co-hosted by Vietnam Ministry of Information and Communications, will take place in Vinpearl&nbsp;Nha Trang, Vietnam, on August 28 – 30, 2023.</p>



<p>For more information and to register your interest in the summit, please visit the website <a href="https://fidoapacsummit.com/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cybersecurity landscape in Asia-Pacific has undergone significant growth and transformation in recent years, driven by the rapid digitalization, increased internet penetration, and the rapid adoption of advanced technologies such as cloud computing, AI, and the Internet of Things (IoT). As businesses and governments become more reliant on digital infrastructure, cyber threats have grown increasingly sophisticated and widespread, resulting in a surge in prominent cyberattacks and data breaches. With Asia-Pacific accounting for <a href="https://in.newsroom.ibm.com/2023-02-22-IBM-Report-Asia-Pacific-Felt-the-Brunt-of-2022-Cyberattacks">31%</a> of all incidents globally in 2022, there is a crucial need for more robust authentication methods — and there is no better time than now for organizations to take the necessary steps forward.</p>



<p>The theme for this year’s event is “Connecting for a Safer Digital Future” which aims to highlight the importance of secure, phishing-resistant authentication methods, specifically focusing on FIDO standards and <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>. The summit will bring together various industry leaders, cybersecurity experts, and government representatives from the region to discuss the latest developments and share best practices and success stories. Attendees can expect insightful keynote presentations, engaging panel discussions, comprehensive technical workshops, and ample networking opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The FIDO Alliance is excited to host its first Asia-Pacific Summit 2023 in Vietnam. Around the globe, we are witnessing an increasing number of cyberattacks and scams stemming from weak or stolen credentials — and this is no different in the APAC region. Fortunately, there has been a steady momentum toward adopting passkeys based on phishing-resistant, FIDO authentication by organizations here to combat these threats,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. “Through this summit, we hope to facilitate knowledge sharing in the various areas of authentication, and we encourage anyone interested to learn more to join us.”</p>



<p>Deputy Minister of Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications, Nguyen Huy Dung, said, “We are delighted to take part in organizing this event.” He emphasized, “We fully endorse the adoption of passwordless authentication technology to secure Vietnam’s digital economy.” He continued, “Our aspiration is to foster connections and collaborations with the FIDO Alliance and other APAC region countries for a safer digital future.”</p>



<p>The conference will feature more than 25 VIP guests and speakers from the APAC region, with over 300 attendees expected. Key summit speakers this year include member companies from the FIDO Alliance, such as VinCSS, Google, Mastercard, Samsung Electronics, NTT Docomo, SK Telecom, SecureMetric, AirCuve, ETDA and Thales, among many others.</p>



<p>Registrations are now open to the public. While the event is offered free of charge, all delegates are required to book a minimum of three nights at the event venue, Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang.

<p>Global interoperability, a common cause among many national and industry groups, seems especially urgent these days, especially in matters of security. Interop requires open standards, a “best idea wins” debate among experts and patience, lots of patience. The Financial-Grade API Working Group has a singular focus on developing its security profile as a complementary component to the functional specifications in open banking “standards.” Patience is paying off as adoption momentum builds as demonstrated by HSBC’s recent certification of conformance to the FAPI Standard.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is pleased to announce the expansion of the FAPI-RW certification program to cover <a href="https://openid.net/2019/10/21/guest-blog-implementing-app-to-app-authorisation-in-oauth2-openid-connect/">app2app implementations</a>. The App2app pattern for enhances the all-important user experience for OpenID Connect on mobile devices when the user has a native app from the OpenID Provider installed. The importance of the app2app experience for end users is <a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Opinions/2020/884569/EBA%20Opinion%20on%20obstacles%20under%20Art.%2032%283%29%20RTS%20on%20SCA%26CSC.pdf">emphasized by a recent opinion from the European Bank Authority</a>, where they make it clear that under the “Payment Services Directive 2” (PSD2), most European banks are required to support the app to app pattern.</p>
<p>The Foundation announced the addition of FAPI certifications to the Certification Program in late 2018 with the first certifications posted in early 2019. Since launch, a wide variety of implementations have been certified. Many, like HSBC, are following the lead of the UK Open Banking Implementation Entity, with more currently testing and in the pipeline:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The app2app certification tests are run in the standard browser on the mobile OS, and need to be repeated for each supported platform (typically Web, Android, and iOS). This means that for many banks, vendors and other organizations looking to fully certify to FAPI-RW, they would run the tests 3 times:</p>
<p>1. Test standard web authentication/authorization experience<br>2. Test Android app experience<br>3. Test iOS app experience</p>
<p>The tests have been run against a number of app implementations. The OIDF Certification Program team continues to help organizations during testing discover interoperability and security issues present in their mobile implementations.</p>
<p>To encourage implementers to “test the tests”, app2app certifications will be in pilot mode and free of charge to members until July 31, 2020. This offer is for any implementation that has achieved FAPI-RW certification already as well as those that achieve a standard FAPI-RW certification prior to July 31st.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with app2app, <a href="https://openid.net/2019/10/21/guest-blog-implementing-app-to-app-authorisation-in-oauth2-openid-connect/">please reference this OIDF blog post for more information</a>. And for those interested in taking a deeper dive into app2app, Joseph Heenan from the OpenID Certification Program team will be presenting on app2app at:</p>

<p>The emergence of verifiable credentials (VCs), has paved the way for secure and reliable digital identification and authentication. Today, we stand witness to a significant milestone as verifiable credentials have reached a level of maturity that enables their practical application in various real-world use cases. In New Zealand, the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Bill passed earlier this year, setting the legal basis, and rightly creating an open accreditation scheme for service providers to proliferate the use of VCs and digital identity more broadly in our everyday lives. What an exciting time to be in digital identity in New Zealand! The on-the-ground mahi and fun starts now.</p>



<p>I’m of the opinion that the conditions are ripe for enterprises to forge ahead with real world applications and we’re already seeing some great success especially from our DINZ members. As part of this newsletter I thought I’d use this opportunity to highlight some great Kiwi trailblazers paving the way for digital identity proliferation, and give them a platform to shine.</p>



<p>MyMahi –&nbsp;Bringing inclusion to our young rangatahi</p>



<p><a href="https://mymahi.com/">MyMahi&nbsp;</a>a Palmerston North based company epitomises listening to their customers, starting out as an NCEA credit counter in 2014, and very quickly solving and iterating on their learner users challenges, becoming a learning pathway and journey platform. Building on their learner’s feedback, MyMahi has developed a verified digital student ID, breaking down barriers in inclusion for our youngest Kiwis. Most recently putting out a petition to parliament urging financial institutions to recognise verified digital identities helping bank our youngest New Zealanders. MyMahi creates equity and inclusion for our future generations through digital identity.</p>



<p>JNCTN – Keeping lives safe through trusted health &amp; safety record keeping</p>



<p><a href="https://jnctn.nz/">JNCTN</a>&nbsp;a Petone based company is blazing the trail in real world use of Verifiable Credentials, solving a pertinent problem of workforce health &amp; safety record keeping assurance. Pen and paper methods of verifying health and safety records in high risk industries have been prolific, and pose existential risks to both workforce and employer.&nbsp;JNCTN’s credential management system allows for high assurance capture of workforce training and compliance records, assuring every worker that enters a high risk worksite not only the evidence of training, but the assurance that they have the practical training to respond. JNCTN saves lives through verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>These are just two wonderful DINZ members taking a lead in the world of digital identity, and from my personal interactions with organisations both large and small, 2023 will be a breakout year for digital identity, so watch this space and Kia Kaha!</p>

<p>We just finished the pilot of our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/applications-are-open-learn-how-to-bring-a-responsible-data-approach-to-your-work-with-our-cohort-learning-programme/" title="">new cohort learning programme</a>, designed to equip social justice leaders with the knowledge and tools needed for implementing responsible data! Back in April, my colleague Bárbara wrote about <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/updates-from-our-responsible-data-cohort-learning-programme/" title="">the first half of the programme</a> and in this blog post, I’m sharing updates and learnings as we wrap up this pilot.</p>



 Getting practical&nbsp; 



<p>Our hope for this programme was for participants to not just understand why practising Responsible Data is important, but also to get a sense of what RD actually looks like in their day-to-day work. With this in mind, in the last two weeks of the programme we shifted to more practical applications of responsible data in participants’ work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the fourth session we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">became ‘RAD’</a> and covered how to map an organisation’s data and set up&nbsp;practices for data retention, archival and deletion (RAD). Participants walked away with templates and processes that they can continue to iterate on with their teams and incorporate into their own organisational processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the fifth session we talked about how participants can begin to think about their data and RD practices at the systems level,&nbsp;using assessment frameworks to determine where they were at currently, developing plans for next steps, and determining progress made. We also took some time to talk about how participants will incorporate these new learnings into tech tool selection.&nbsp;</p>



 Where we are: a few takeaways from the second half of the programme 



<p>During the course, I was able to chat with some of the participants individually, through one-on-one calls. Originally, the purpose of these calls was to provide additional Responsible Data guidance outside of class time for those that were interested. However, these calls also opened my eyes to the amazing work already being done by our participants. More about this in our next blog post!</p>



 Making everyday tweaks to how teams work with data, and celebrating “tiny victories”, can be powerful moves toward establishing a sustainable RD approach &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>For some participants,&nbsp;their next step will be to get their team and peer organisations more involved and to get buy-in for moves towards more robust RD practices. For these organisations, sharing the importance of RD and implementing small, immediate actions that will give the organisation ‘tiny wins’ may provide the momentum for the organisation to continue to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, while thinking through their RAD plan in Module 4 – which asked participants to think about the what, who, how and why of their data processes – one organisation mentioned that simply acknowledging and looking at the potential unintended consequences of working with data was in itself an invaluable process and extremely eye-opening.&nbsp;</p>



 Not a checklist: seeing responsible data as an ongoing practice 



<p>As part of the final module, we asked participants to plan out the data journey they intended to take after completing the course. Participants planned out their short-, mid-, and long term goals, but more importantly also acknowledged that their participation in this programme was just a part of the journey, and that there was still much work to be done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One organisation planned to speak to their funders in order to make sure they were aligned when it came to data collection and sharing. By remaining cognizant of the fact that adopting responsible data practices is a continuous learning process, and by prioritising daily practice over achieving a final ‘endpoint’, organisations can continue to make progress.</p>



 Taking one step at a time and getting ready to dive deeper&nbsp; 



<p>I found that although many organisations have already begun practising responsible data (RD) in some capacity, they often lack clear guidance and resources to take their efforts to the next level. For example, while preparing RAD plans together in Module 4 we learned that many of our participants had already developed guidelines around the data they collect, but could benefit from more information on securing and deleting it. In Module 5, we dived further into what implementing these changes might look like when it comes to the platforms participants are using, or could be using, in their day to day work.</p>



 What’s next?&nbsp; 



<p>In the coming weeks you can expect to hear from us on how we put this programme together, as well as our learnings from the experience. We’ll also go into the factors that went into the selection of the topic and participants, as well as considerations around the technologies used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Energy Web will leverage Polkadot’s interoperable multichain technology to bring decarbonization to&nbsp;Web3 <p>LONDON, ZUG, June 20, 2023 — <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a>, the world’s largest ecosystem of companies using open source, decentralized technologies to accelerate the energy transition, is coming to <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a>, the next-generation blockchain network powering the movement for a better web. The move will allow Energy Web to create the framework for a new technology, Energy Web X, helping its partners — which include major players like Shell, Vodafone, Volkswagen, and RMI — accelerate their decarbonization strategies.</p><p>Having developed digital solutions with dozens of major energy companies and nonprofit organizations from more than 25 countries, Energy Web is focused on two key areas. One is to help electric utilities digitize and integrate distributed energy resources to the grid; the second is about bringing deep levels of transparency and verifiability to emerging green product supply chains — including 24/7 matched renewable electricity, sustainable aviation fuel, and sustainably produced&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><blockquote>Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web, said: “Energy Web and our global enterprise partners are collectively on a mission to make clean energy an integral and widely-accessible part of the global electricity system. To achieve this important goal, we decided to search for a blockchain platform that offers real enterprise-grade security and seamless upgradeability to ensure a safe and future-proof environment. Polkadot excels on both of these fronts with its shared security model and best-in-class core technology. We couldn’t be more excited to build out the energy transition vertical on Polkadot. Energy Web X will be based on worker node networks. Each of these is a decentralized group of computers jointly executing sensitive business processes that involve or impact multiple companies. Enterprises will be able to deploy thousands of independent worker nodes, coordinate them in cohesive networks, and allow the public to verify the results of their&nbsp;work.”</blockquote><blockquote>Björn Wagner, CEO of Parity Technologies, a leading contributor to the Polkadot network, said: “The energy transition vertical is a perfect use case to take advantage of the the benefits of blockchain technology, and it’s a space where Polkadot is well positioned to be a market leader. We’re especially pleased to see Polkadot bring competitive advantages to initiatives and enterprises making a positive environmental and social impact. In choosing to build a custom Polkadot parachain, Energy Web will get the performance and security its industry partners require, as well as faster time to market and access to Polkadot’s best-in-class interoperability. I’m excited to partner with the Energy Web team to accelerate the transition to clean&nbsp;energy.”</blockquote><p>Energy Web is launching a bid for a parachain slot on Polkadot with the joint aim of building a thriving ecosystem focused on the global energy transition. Further details about Energy Web X’s plans will follow at <a href="https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/events/decoded-2023/">Polkadot Decoded</a>, the network’s flagship summit, to be held in Copenhagen, June 28–29. Ana Trbovich, vice chair of the Energy Web Foundation, will also appear on a regulatory panel at the&nbsp;event.</p><p>This announcement follows hot on the heels of others involving big names from diverse sectors like music, gaming and accounting joining the Polkadot ecosystem. The Energy Web X parachain will join the many other projects that are already building on the Polkadot Relay Chain. By the end of Q1, a total of 42 parachains had joined Polkadot, representing sectors such as DeFi, privacy, social media, sustainability, NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse. Many of these parachains are platforms in themselves, collectively hosting hundreds of Web3 applications.</p><p>Parachains help projects expand at scale by leveraging each other’s strengths to unlock new use cases, and enjoy the shared security advantages provided by Polkadot.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers. Our solutions for enterprise asset management, data exchange, and Green Proofs, our tool for registering and tracking low-carbon products, are underpinned by the Energy Web Chain, the world’s first public blockchain tailored to the energy sector. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, renewable energy developers, grid operators, corporate energy buyers, automotive, IoT, telecommunications leaders, and more.

<p>We recently interviewed Otto Mora, Business Development Lead in the Americas for PolygonID and discovered more about their platform and vision. The full interview can also be viewed on <a href="https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?ref=blog.identity.foundation">YouTube</a></p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Thanks for joining us today Otto. Really glad to have you here today representing Polygon ID. Before we get further into the details of Polygon ID and what you guys are up to, I'd like to hear a little bit about yourself. Can you give our audience a little bit of an introduction of who you are and how you came to the decentralized identity space?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Yeah, Absolutely. I'm originally from San Jose, Costa Rica. My original exposure to decentralized identity, and I guess SSI was in early 2016 at a ConsenSys Conference in New York, where I remember Christopher Allen was first talking about identity 2020, and you know, bringing in the concept of SSI. It just became clear to me that solving identity on blockchain, specifically blockchain ecosystems was a hugely important thing that would really help out blockchain adoption.</p><p>So, I first became conscious of that back then. &nbsp;It kind of stayed in the back of my mind and I followed various decentralized identity projects such as uPort. &nbsp;I think I applied like seven times to work at uPort, but it didn't come through. I did eventually get into web3 full time around 2018. &nbsp;I was working at EY leading a team of developers, and I kind of got engaged with the community in Costa Rica and I was a founding member of the Costa Rican Blockchain Association.</p><p>We did the first Ethereum Hackathon and all that kind of eventually led into getting into Polygon. That original knowledge around identity and some of the things we did at EY helped me get into PolygonID and leveraging ZK (zero-knowledge) technology for identity.</p><p>That's a little bit about my story and yeah, I really feel fortunate to be in this space and it's been super interesting.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Yeah, great and I know I spoke to you a few weeks ago, and I asked you a little bit of the story of Polygon ID, but you didn't tell me the whole story. So I've been waiting for this moment to hear it, because it really is interesting, some of the background. Can you give us a little bit on that?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Yeah, absolutely. &nbsp;You know, back then it was called Hermez Identity and it’s actually quite fascinating. All three founders, Jordi Baylina, Anthony Martin and David Schwartz are all from Barcelona, Catalonia Spain. As you know there's some tensions between the regions in Spain and the central government, and Catalonia is no exception. Catalonia back then was heavily into this independence referendum that they were trying to do, and tried to make it kind of a demonstrable referendum to convince people that there was a chance to be independent.</p><p>They started playing with the idea of an online referendum using blockchain technology. So that's when the identity project was born. How do we do identity on top of a blockchain system to be able to do this voting that they wanted to do? All of that kind of came to “You know what? The blockchain actually doesn't scale quite well, the transactions per second are not that great.” That led them to founding another initiative, in addition to the Iden3 initiative which was called Hermez.</p><p>Both initiatives kind of matured over time, and eventually Polygon was looking to acquire companies. Polygon actually got started a little bit earlier than them. They got started around 2017 or so and they had been looking at scaling blockchains, they had looked at the original proof of stake blockchain. They were now looking for the next iteration of that. What's the next scaling solution that they can bring to the market? Then they kind of stumbled upon the Hermes project at a conference in Paris. Eventually they agreed to acquire Hermez and bring them into Polygon.</p><p>Then both of those things came together. So both the Hermez project, which is like the zkEVM scaling project that was there, as well as the Iden3 project, which is also kind of an a project that Polygon decided to just embrace and then build Polygon ID using all of the Iden3 technology that was really developed by Jordi and the team in Catalonia.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: That's so fascinating. That's why I really love hearing the stories of these various companies because a lot of times it's not a linear path. There was a problem they were trying to solve, and it led into a new enterprise. So that's really fascinating. One thing that I'm curious to hear, if I were someone coming to Polygon ID and I wanted to use your services, what would be my journey into the Polygon ID ecosystem?</p><p>[Link to video on youtube:<a href="https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?t=332&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation"> https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?t=332</a>]</p><p>OTTO MORA: &nbsp; There's various items that we have. I'll just share my screen to kind of show you a little bit of a walkthrough of what that looks like, and a little bit of the features of our DID method. The polygon ID protocol is a protocol that aims to keep user’s privacy. We have a DID method and our DID method has various features such as key rotation, it allows you to do a private revocation, it allows you to manage profiles so users can have multiple profiles that they can expose. If you're interacting with a verifier, you can choose which profile to use and independent of that, you can use any of the credentials that were issued to you. It also has CKQuery language which allows verifiers to ask questions about the profiles, and then present those credentials and generate proofs to respond to the questions from the verifier.</p><p>We have a couple of methods to issue credentials, one that is kind of gas-less, and another one that enables on-chain, which is the MTP Method. (Merkle Tree Proof) It also uses Baby JubJub keys for optimized generation of ZK proofs in mobile devices. And then an interesting thing for anybody looking to use our DID method is that It's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible, the DID method could be used in any kind of EVM chain, and it's also fully open source under an MIT Apache license. The heart of the protocol is really that you have a verifiable credential, the credential will say, a few attributes about your identity. Maybe it'll have information about your date of birth. Maybe it'll have information about your country of citizenship, it could have information about your credit score. Then you'll interact with the verifier, the verifier will ask a set of questions around that set of credentials that you have in your wallet and then in order to answer those questions, you'll be generating a zero-knowledge proof directly from your device be it your mobile phone or be it your browser that you're using to interact with the blockchain at that point.</p><p>So you generate those proofs, and then in doing so, you present those proofs to the verifier. They can check the validity of those proofs. They can check that the data is correct. What you've done now at this point is that you reveal just enough information to answer the questions from the verifier instead of the whole credential data. So this is the famous thing in centralized identity. &nbsp;Show me that you're over 18 without telling me where you live, what's your full name and where you were born? All these things are just not revealed, but just the specific answers to the question that is being asked by the verifier. This is the heart of the protocol, this is kind of the innovation that we bring.</p><p>If it's okay with you, I can show you a brief video of what that looks like and kind of just a more practical use case.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Sure that'd be great.</p><p>OTTO MORA: Let me just jump into that. This is just a quick sample demo of what this looks like. [Link to demo: https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?t=516] This is just showing you our polygon ID application. It's a sample application. We are enabling multiple wallet providers to integrate with us.</p><p>At this point this is just the wallet creation process. You’re creating your wallet. You're getting it set up for the first time. You have no credentials inside of your wallet. You're now going to go to a website that's going to issue you credentials. So the first step is connecting your wallet. You're connecting your wallet to get the basic authentication. &nbsp;Now that the authentication has been done, now your wallet is connected.</p><p>At this point, you may be asked to show some credential data. Maybe if it's a university, if you passed a test, maybe some other thing. Whatever set of data is required by the issuer in order to be able to offer you the claim. It could be an identity verification process, it could be any sort of thing. Eventually the verification is successful, and then you're offered a set of claims. So now you continue to add claims. You can see that QR code there that has the claims that you are now able to scan with your device.</p><p>You're seeing that now a set of claims are being offered, one is a proof of personhood. Another claim is showing you as a member of a DAO. Another claim is your date of birth and then another claim is your country of residence. These claims are just like a set of credentials or cards that are stored in your wallet at this point and the claims get added.</p><p>Now you can go into the wallet app and you can see these purple cards in there. These various credentials that were issued to you and the data that's inside of them. So now you have those credentials and now we're going to actually make use of the credentials. Now is that process of interacting with the verifier being asked the question and then satisfying that. So now we're going to go into this sample DAO interface, which is Grail. We're going to connect our wallet just like we did the last time.</p><p>Now we're going into voting for a proposal. So for voting for the proposal, here's a kind of proposal that we want to vote on, but before we can vote we have to prove our eligibility to vote. In order to vote we're now being asked, prove to me that you're a member of this DAO. So from the various credentials that we have, we're now going to use one of them, and we're going to answer the question, are you a member of this DAO? Yes or no. That is kind of what's going to trigger now, this cryptographic proof generation in which now you can generate the proof to answer your question from the verifier. Once the proof is generated, you can now vote.</p><p>Now you've successfully voted on the DAO. So that's just kind of illustrating a little bit of that process of, you have a credential that's issued to you, you go to a verifier, and you would get asked a bunch of questions about your credentials to generate some proofs on your device. Then you've successfully revealed data about your credentials without revealing the full credential. So that’s the main kind of innovation that we bring. That’s a little bit of the flow of what that looks like.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Okay, and this can be used in various contexts as well, such as credentials for workplace, credentials for education? Could also be applied in those cases as well?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Our intention is that you could go with the number of verifiers and reveal data about yourself. Prove to me that you're a graduate of a computer science degree, yes or no. That kind of question. Or prove to me that your credit score is between 500 and 600 and that makes you eligible for a loan or something like that.</p><p>Then we have other more elaborate ones. Maybe you're at a traffic stop and you're interacting with a cop, and you use your phone with an NFT and you quickly answer yes or no to a bunch of questions such as; is your car’s kind of insurance up to date? Do you have the proper registration? Is your license not expired? You're able to answer all those questions very quickly, generating a proof without revealing more data than what's required.</p><p>So yeah, it's use cases like that where we envision this being used. Both web3 and web2 use cases. Within web3 we think DAOs, these online cooperatives, would benefit a lot from this. Defi protocols as well, looking to do some KYC, things like that. But there's also web2 use cases. We’re starting with web3 that's our initial focus area, but we want to go further than that, if possible.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Can you share a little bit about your business model? I know people are always curious about that. How are you going to market at this point?</p><p>OTTO MORA: It's fully open source. We don't really charge for Polygon ID. At this point we see it more as a complement to the Polygon ecosystem. We're not intending to directly monetize the identity protocol, but it's more just a reason for people to build on top of the Polygon blockchain. We get additional incentives and revenue by more people using our blockchain, we get more fees, and that helps everybody in the ecosystem. So that's a little bit of why this is being released fully open source, and as a benefit to the community at Polygon.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: I know you have been involved in our community over the past few months. Polygon ID joined as a DIF member earlier this year, and you've been involved in some of the various work groups. Can you share a little bit about what are some of the work items that you followed and integrated into some of the work at Polygon ID?</p><p>OTTO MORA: We have various items from the DIF that we are already integrated with or are intending to do integration with or engagement. So one of them is the DIF Universal Resolver, [https://dev.uniresolver.io/] which we've already implemented and I know Marcus was nice enough to review it for us, so very thankful for that. We are intending to support the well known DID configuration. It's in our roadmap along with creating more trust in the ecosystem of who are the issuers, trust registries and things of that nature. We're also looking to get some support for Credential Manifest. [<a href="https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/</a>] It's this thing called output descriptors that provide guidance for wallets on how to display the credential cards, what logo to use, what color to use when displaying. That was brought to our attention by Thierry from the AltMe wallet. We’re open to input on the product and adopting these standards is important to us where we see it makes sense.</p><p>Then from the last Internet Identity Workshop I saw this work around the standard wallet container that's being led by Sam Curren. That's also something that's of interest to us. We do have a growing ecosystem of wallets, and we ideally would want them to follow standards and bring data vaults and things of that nature.</p><p>So that's something that we're also looking to engage with. We're open to more, and it's all about building together in the community with the folks at DIF so we're looking forward to contributing.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Then my little side plug is to anyone who's viewing, you can get involved in these work items at DIF. We are an open-source community, and we also have membership options, so you can join and get involved in that. [<a href="https://identity.foundation./join?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://Identity.foundation/join</a>}</p><p>The other thing I wanted to ask is in terms of the vision of Polygon ID. Where do you guys see things going in the next 5-10 years? How do you see some of the work that you're doing, impacting the economy and the way we do things?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Absolutely, I think for us it's solving at least in the more immediate term the need for identity verification in the web3 space, solving identity for DAOs, solving identity for Defi protocols and getting more adoption from the various wallet providers. I think that the issue perhaps now is, people don't really care so much about privacy or keeping their data private as much. I think over time that'll change. So I think maybe we're a little bit early with this whole ZK Technology, that some people are happy to show their full credentials and be done with it, they'll say they'll have nothing to hide.</p><p>But I think over time privacy will become more and more relevant, and we see this as one tool that will get people to care about it and be able to implement privacy.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: If there are any companies out there who are interested in working with Polygon ID, should they get in touch with you? What would be the easiest way for them to do that?</p><p>OTTO MORA: They can get in touch with me, also on Twitter as well my handle is @ottomorac [<a href="https://twitter.com/ottomorac?s=20&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://twitter.com/ottomorac?s=20</a>] Also we have a Discord channel on the Polygon site that you can access. [https://discord.gg/0xpolygon]</p><p>If you want to get in touch with our Business Development team for Polygon ID, you can do so as well from the Polygon website. [https://polygon.technology/contact-us] You go to Polygon ID, and then there's a contact form there.</p><p>If you have specific questions, or if you want to engage with us because you have a project, or you have a wallet, and you would like to talk to us, that's another way to engage with us.</p><p>Then, finally we're also open to code contributions. It's fully open source, so if somebody has a unique feature they would like to contribute to us, we're definitely open to that. We can do a pull request on Github as well if you have something you want to contribute.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Sounds great, and for our viewers I'll make sure to have all those links in the notes on our Youtube Channel as well. It was great having you today Otto and hearing more about Polygon ID and your journey as well, and I'll &nbsp;also encourage our listeners if you get a chance, go to our website<a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> https://identity.foundation</a> as well to join and become a member.</p><p>Thank you so much once again Otto and if anyone else joins in the community you can you'll be able to see Otto there as well.</p><p>OTTO MORA: Awesome. Thank you.</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 16, 2023 –&nbsp; The <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3574062-1&amp;h=1964299261&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fidoalliance.org%2F&amp;a=FIDO+Alliance">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today that two of its specifications, FIDO UAF 1.2 and CTAP 2.1, are recognized as international standards by the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Pages/default.aspx">International Telecommunication Union’s Telecommunication Standardization Sector</a> (ITU-T). This milestone establishes these standards as official ITU standards (ITU-T Recommendations) for the global infrastructure of information and communication technologies (ICT).</p>



<p>ITU-T is the standardization arm of ITU, the United Nations specialized agency for ICT. The FIDO Alliance specifications were approved as official ITU-T Recommendations by ITU members including national administrations and the world’s front-running ICT companies. The new ITU-T Recommendations are under the responsibility of ITU’s standardization expert group for security, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=h2uksEW6vztNCZspihTRhrVWtNNbUo0tPRk0YHzGEM-yo7JS7O56YYzuluDXWTsE3QwhOCS2ujB3BqL8I8vjsBzZ5vQ-g61N2X2Q1NGRFbXag2fPyu3zqKwgvAwlSC-XUuE96CPNujODt2rdmRRpyg==">ITU-T Study Group 17</a>.</p>



<p>“The FIDO Alliance is improving online authentication through open standards based on public key cryptography that make authentication stronger and easier to use than passwords or one-time passcodes. One of the ways that we fulfill this mission is by submitting our mature technical specifications to internationally recognized standards groups like ITU-T for formal standardization,” said David Turner, senior director of standards development at the FIDO Alliance. “This recognition from ITU-T illustrates the maturity of FIDO authentication technology and complements our web standardization work with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).”</p>



<p>“Predecessors of these FIDO UAF and CTAP specifications were first adopted as ITU standards in 2018. ITU-T Study Group 17 will continue to strengthen its collaboration with the FIDO Alliance. These two FIDO Alliance specifications, adopted as ITU standards recently, are being widely used in various industries such as the financial sector to provide strong online authentication based on public key cryptography and various user verification methods,” said Heung Youl Youm, Chairman of ITU-T Study Group 17. “These new ITU standards will provide a concrete basis for the two FIDO specifications to be adopted across the 193 ITU Member States.”</p>



<p>“Our working group within ITU-T Study Group 17 was pleased to be able to collaborate with the FIDO Alliance to promote the standardization of state-of-the-art security technologies,” said Abbie Barbir, Rapporteur for ITU-T’s working group on ‘Identity management and telebiometrics architecture and mechanisms’ (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0vqmC84tYiwa2gXDiKhL_u0vrU7nmpak1cKMTTXa_gJl3VNJ7a-DU_yOSxi1IQTcZLP6bu27UY2s_UyrK5LVEvLN95Xl4vCtp9kwMjN_gUdRC29joDmh--9rjLN0BsVA">Q10/17</a>). “This work will help address and solve the security limitations of passwords and move the world closer to passwordless solutions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifications that are now ITU-T Recommendations are:</p>



 
 FIDO UAF 1.2 (Recommendation ITU-T <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-x/recommendation.asp?lang=en&amp;parent=T-REC-X.1277.2">X.1277.2</a>). A mobile standard providing authentication without passwords by using biometrics and other modalities to authenticate users to their local device. 



 CTAP 2.1 (Recommendation ITU-T <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-x/recommendation.asp?lang=en&amp;parent=T-REC-X.1278.2">X.1278.2</a>). Part of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 specifications</a> along with the W3C Web Authentication standard,&nbsp; allows the use of external authenticators (FIDO Security Keys, mobile devices) for authentication on FIDO2-enabled browsers and operating systems over USB, NFC, or BLE for a passwordless, second-factor or multi-factor authentication experience.

<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3675645-1&amp;h=118128989&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fidoalliance.org%2F&amp;a=www.fidoalliance.org">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3675645-1&amp;h=1704427835&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ffidoalliance.org%2Fspecifications%2F&amp;a=standards">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

 As we navigate the fallout of the global health crisis, governments worldwide have proposed solutions to ensure public health safety and restore normality.

<p>As we navigate the fallout of the global health crisis, governments worldwide have proposed solutions to ensure public health safety and restore normality. Among these, health passports stand out as a prominent tool in managing the pandemic. The planned Government-Issued Health Passport and the German Gesundheitpass are significant examples of this development. However, while these initiatives might seem beneficial, they raise considerable ethical, privacy, and equality concerns. In contrast, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) presents an alternative that could provide a more democratic, secure, and equitable solution.</p>


 
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/lionsgate.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/health-passport.jpg?ssl=1"></a> 


<p>Government-Issued Health Passport and the Gesundheitpass, although different in name, serve a similar purpose. They aim to document and certify an individual’s health status concerning COVID-19. However, the data collection, storage, and usage that these systems demand pose significant challenges.</p>



<p>A Government-Issued Health Passport system could potentially place immense power and sensitive data into the hands of governmental authorities. This data, beyond the control of the individual, could be susceptible to misuse, raising valid concerns about privacy and surveillance. This implementation may inadvertently result in an invasive surveillance system under the disguise of public health safety.</p>



<p>Similarly, the German Gesundheitpass, despite being well-intentioned, does not escape these privacy concerns. The scale of data collection and potential for tracking that it allows can also give rise to a surveillance state. Furthermore, being digital, it assumes an even level of digital literacy and access, which is far from reality, particularly for the elderly and socio-economically disadvantaged populations.</p>



<p>Moreover, both systems can lead to a divide between those who can access vaccines or tests, and thus the passport, and those who cannot. Consequently, this can result in a bifurcated society, where the passport holders enjoy more freedoms than those without.</p>



<p>The alternative solution to these issues lies in the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). SSI provides individuals with control over their personal data, offering a secure, democratic, and inclusive system for verifying health status. It upholds the principles of privacy and equity, presenting a significant advantage over the Government-Issued Health Passport and Gesundheitpass.</p>



<p>SSI operates on the principle of decentralized identities, with users retaining control over their personal data. In the context of health passports, an SSI-based system would allow individuals to prove their health status without revealing more information than necessary. The possibility of surveillance diminishes significantly, as the underlying health data remains private.</p>



<p>Moreover, SSI’s approach can help bridge the digital divide. It doesn’t require extensive digital literacy and can be adapted to various interfaces, making it accessible to a wider population. This inclusive solution respects the privacy and autonomy of all individuals, reducing systemic biases and discrimination risks.</p>



<p>The technology underpinning SSI, typically blockchain, provides a secure, tamper-proof system for verifying identities and claims. It enhances trust in the system, even in the absence of a central authority.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the Government-Issued Health Passport and Gesundheitpass may seem to offer a solution to managing the pandemic, they carry the risk of increasing surveillance, perpetuating inequality, and undermining privacy. In contrast, SSI offers a promising alternative, putting the control of personal data back into the hands of individuals. This approach respects individual autonomy, promotes equality, and ensures privacy – a far cry from the inherent concerns of the health passports. As we navigate these complexities, we must prioritize solutions that uphold both public health and personal freedoms. SSI is a promising step in this direction.</p>

<p>Why PNC Opted for FIDO</p>



<p>Security is of critical importance to PNC and its customers. PNC’s approach to provide digital services is founded on a strong commitment to privacy protection to those who use its services. Multi-factor authentication is a key component to protecting customer identities and data, and FIDO’s standard helped provide a roadmap to implementation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, PNC has been able to provide customers authentication options that are easy to use but still afford consistency in terms of protection. This translates into high-quality identity assurance to verify and validate that the right customer is enrolled and minimize the risk of impersonation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We needed to find a way to create a user-friendly mechanism to improve customer security without creating a burdensome process that required so many steps that it dissuaded customers from enrolling or engaging,” said Susan Koski, Chief Information Security Officer at PNC.</p>



<p>Benefits Realized</p>



<p>By using FIDO standards, PNC has been able to manage the authentication experience in such a way that it leverages the security features of a customer’s device, applying industry best practices for designing this identity protection mechanism.&nbsp;Ultimately, FIDO standards have been a core component to PNC’s cybersecurity strategy to minimize the risk of authorized access to customer credentials.</p>



<p>“We continue to identify ways to improve security for our customers, ultimately reducing the reliance on passwords and other phishable credentials from our ecosystem is a critical aspect to protecting our customers” Koski said.</p>

<p>ComposeDB on Ceramic is a decentralized, composable graph database that empowers developers to store and interact with their application data efficiently and swiftly. By integrating Ceramic infrastructure with an indexer, reusable data models, and GraphQL, ComposeDB paves the way for the creation of truly interoperable and composable Web3 applications.</p><p>The core Ceramic team recently unveiled a new CLI tool named <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network#installation-using-wheel">Wheel</a>. This tool simplifies the process of running Ceramic nodes locally. Moreover, it incorporates a straightforward Web3 social application that developers can utilize to interact with ComposeDB on Ceramic, or even leverage it as a foundation for their unique projects. This tutorial will guide you through using Wheel and the embedded example Web3 social application, enabling you to engage with ComposeDB on Ceramic in a matter of minutes.</p><p>By adhering to this guide, you will accomplish the following:</p>  Configure your development environment  Run a local Ceramic node  Operate a fully functional example dApp on your local machine  Understand the subsequent steps to continue building on Ceramic  <p>If you'd like a visual walkthrough, check out this video that illustrates all of the setup steps written below:</p> Requirements <p>For this tutorial, ensure you have the following tools and resources installed on your system:</p>  A code editor that suits your preferences (for example, VSCode)  A web browser that you're comfortable with (we'll be using Chrome for this guide)  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Node.js v16</a> or a newer version  <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">jq</a>  <p>After you've installed the necessary dependencies and prepped your development tools as outlined above, you can dive into setting up your work environment with Wheel.</p> Configure your working environment <p>When it comes to building applications using ComposeDB, it's essential for every developer to run their own node. This step ensures your node can connect to the Ceramic Anchor Service to generate commits on a blockchain, thereby enabling seamless data composability between applications.</p><p>First, let’s create our project folder where we will keep all the files and directories used for this tutorial. Open your terminal and run the following commands:</p> <code>mkdir ceramic-getting-started
cd ceramic-getting-started
</code> <p>The most straightforward path to configure and run a Ceramic node is through Wheel—a user-friendly CLI tool. Wheel not only allows developers to run Ceramic nodes locally, but it also walks you through the entire configuration process with a clear, easy-to-understand prompt. </p><p>Note, for more visual walkthrough, check out this video which illustrates all of the setup steps written below:</p><p>To download the Wheel on your local machine, run the command below. This command will download the Wheel in your working directory:</p> <code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceramicstudio/wheel/main/wheel.sh | bash
</code> <p>Once downloaded, start the Wheel by running the following command:</p> <code>./wheel
</code> <p>Executing this command will kick-start the environment configuration prompt. Here, you'll have the ability to select which Ceramic-specific dependencies you'd prefer to install, and how you'd like your Ceramic node to be configured.</p><p>If you're brand new to ComposeDB on Ceramic, we suggest you begin with the default setup. This configuration is lightweight and easy to manage.</p><blockquote>📌 The default configuration will run your Ceramic node in-memory, meaning it won't connect to the Ceramic Anchor Service or create commits on a blockchain. Therefore, your app data will only be saved locally on your machine. The indexed data will be housed in a straightforward and lightweight SQLite database, requiring no additional configurations on your part. This setup serves as an excellent launchpad to start engaging with ComposeDB on Ceramic and to experiment with its features.</blockquote><p>Simply follow the prompt and confirm the following default configurations by hitting <code>return</code> key on your keyboard:</p>  Project Type: <code>InMemory</code>  Project Name: <code>ceramic-test-app</code>  Project Path: <code>default</code>  Include Ceramic?: <code>Y</code>  Include ComposeDB?: <code>Y</code>  Include ComposeDB Sample Application?: <code>Y</code>  Admin DID Configuration: <code>Generate DID and Private Key</code>  File to save DID private key to?: <code>default</code>  Wheel config file location: <code>default</code>  Configure Ceramic?: <code>Defaults: Use default configuration based on network</code>  <p>At this point, the Wheel will start the process of installing dependencies. Once complete, you'll be prompted with the question, <code>Would you like Ceramic started as a daemon? (Y/n).</code> Choose option <code>Y</code>. This action will fire up your local Ceramic node and construct an example app for you to experiment with. You'll know everything is up and running smoothly if you see the following output in your terminal:</p> <code>Application demo is available at 
Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app. To run the demo application:

cd /Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
npm run nextDev
</code> <p>Keep this terminal running and now let’s dive into the example Web3 social application!</p> Example Web3 social application <p>The example Web3 social app, a simple example of decentralized Twitter, is a creation of the 3Box Labs team. It's designed to offer developers a glimpse into how applications work with ComposeDB on Ceramic, and serves as an example of how to implement the basic core functionality using Ceramic tools.</p><p>The application comes packed with the following features:</p>  Sign-in using DID Key or your Metamask wallet  User profile creation  Post creation  The ability to follow other users  Access to the posts of those you follow on an 'Explore' page  <p>So, you may ask, how do you launch this application? At the end of the previous section, we noted the output you should expect to see in your terminal if everything is operating smoothly:</p> <code>Application demo is available at 
/Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app. To run the demo application:

cd /Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
npm run nextDev
</code> <p>Follow the provided instructions to navigate to the example app directory and start the application:</p> <code>cd /Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
</code>  <code>npm run nextDev
</code> <p>The output of this command will look similar to the one shown below.</p> <code>&gt; demo@0.1.0 nextDev
&gt; next dev

</code> <p>Copy the provided url <code>http://localhost:3000</code> and open it in your browser. This will launch the example application in your browser for you to interact with.</p> Interacting with the application <p>Once you open the URL that your application is running on, you should be greeted with the following user interface:</p><p>At this point ,you can start interacting with the application by choosing your authentication method. You can choose from the following options:</p>  Key DID—an authentication method using <code>did:key</code> method  Ethereum DID PKH—an authentication method that uses an Ethereum wallet (e.g. Metamask)  <p>Choose the authentication method that you prefer and start interacting with the application:</p>  Click on Profile tab and create your profile:  <p>2. After creating your profile, head to Home tab and create your first post:</p><p>3. Head to Explore tab and check out currently existing posts. You should see your own post posted there:</p><p>If other users started using your application, you would be able to see their posts in the Explore section as well. This would also give you an option to follow other users. You can simulate this behavior by logging out and signing up for the application using a different authentication method.</p> Explore what’s under the hood <p>One of the best things about this example application is that you can see everything under the hood, including all of the implementation, data models, and frontend components.</p><p>Remember the path that was provided to you by Wheel? You can find all of the application files there:</p> <code>Application demo is available at 
/Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
</code> <p>Once you navigate to the project directory you should see the following files:</p><p>When you navigate to the <code>composites</code> directory, you'll discover all the data models utilized by this application defined using the GraphQL schema definition language. The application comes with four data models:</p>  <code>basicProfile.graphql</code> - This data model offers a GraphQL implementation of a fundamental user profile data model  <code>post.graphql</code> - This data model provides a GraphQL implementation of a user post. It also delineates a relation to the <code>basicProfile</code> model  <code>postsProfile.graphql</code> - This data model establishes a relation between the <code>basicProfile</code> model and the <code>post</code> model  <code>following.graphql</code> - This data model outlines a schema for preserving the data of the users being followed. Notably, this model also defines a relation to the <code>basicProfile</code> model, enabling user profile data retrieval  <p>Make sure to open these files to explore how data models are defined and how they tie to the details you see on the frontend. For example, if you open <code>basicProfile.grapqh</code> you’ll probably recognize the fields like <code>name</code>, <code>username</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>gender</code> and <code>emoji</code> you set when creating your profile:</p> <code>type BasicProfile @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "A basic Profile") {
  name: String! @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  username: String! @string(minLength: 5, maxLength: 255)
  description: String @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  gender: String @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  emoji: String @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 2)
}
</code> <p>In addition to data models, you can explore the the <code>pages</code> directory that contains the implementation of pages you see when you interact with the application. There you can see some examples of how <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-interactions/queries?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Grapqhl queries</a> are used to retrieve and display the information you see. For example, if you open the <code>explore.ts</code> file, you will see an example query that is used to extract the data that is displayed once your open the <code>Explore</code> page on your app:</p> <code>query {
        postsIndex (last:300) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              body
              created
              profile {
                id
                name
                username 
                emoji
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
</code>  Interact with the data using Graphiql server <p>As you engage with the example Web3 social app, you're creating user data that's stored on the Ceramic network (this depends on the project-type you selected when setting up your Ceramic node). You can smoothly interact with this data using a straightforward <code>Graphiql</code> server and crafting GraphQL queries. Here’s how you can accomplish this:</p>  Open a new terminal and generate a runtime representation of your composite:   <code>npx composedb composite:compile src/__generated__/merged.json src/__generated__/runtime-composite.json
</code> <p>2. &nbsp;Start the <code>Graphiql</code> server:</p> <code>npx composedb graphql:server --ceramic-url=http://localhost:7007 --graphiql src/__generated__/runtime-composite.json --port=5005</code> <p>You will know that the server is successfully up and running if you see the following output in your terminal:</p> <code>GraphQL server is listening on &lt;http://localhost:5005/grapqhl&gt;
</code> <p>3. &nbsp;Copy the provided URL and open it in your browser. This should open a Graphiql interface. This interface has 3 core parts:</p>  Top left terminal for writing the GraphQL queries  Bottom left section for providing variables and headers for your queries  Section on the right for displaying the query output  <p>4. Run the following query to get the first 2 records of the user profile stored:</p> <code>query{
 basicProfileIndex(first: 2) {
   edges {
     node {
       name,
       description
     }
   }
 }
}
</code> <p>The output of this query looks as follows:</p> Next steps <p>The integration of Wheel and the example Web3 app aims to provide developers with an easy starting point. It simplifies the process of running Ceramic nodes and offers a tangible application to experiment with. If you've followed this tutorial, here are some promising next steps to continue your journey as a Ceramic developer:</p>  Dive into the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB documentation</a> to familiarize yourself more with the technical concepts discussed in this tutorial  Interact with the data by constructing more advanced GraphQL queries, or even update an existing record by executing a <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-interactions/mutations?ref=blog.ceramic.network">mutation</a>  Launch the example app on <code>clay-testnet</code> which will connect your node to Ceramic Anchor Service and create commits on a blockchain. You can achieve this by selecting the <code>clay-testnet</code> project type when following the Wheel prompt  Improve the application—introduce a new feature or use it as a foundation for your own unique project. Here are some ideas for you to consider:    Add a feature to "like" a post.  Create more sophisticated queries to filter the posts displayed on the "Explore" page  Introduce a feature to comment on a post  <p>We're eager to see what you'll create!

<p>Oamo, a decentralized data broker, aims to revolutionize the data economy by allowing users to own and monetize the value of their data. It replaces the outdated cost-per-click model, compensating users directly for their attention. This creates a fair and transparent data economy aligned with the trend of zero-party data. The platform enables users to share their on-chain and off-chain data anonymously with trusted companies in exchange for exclusive token rewards and promotions. </p><p>Data privacy is a growing concern for individuals, organizations, and governments around the world. Scandals, such as those involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, have highlighted the need for greater data privacy protections. Data brokers, who make billions of dollars by collecting and selling user data without their consent, are facing increasing scrutiny and regulation. Oamo aims to address these challenges by giving users control over their data and empowering them to monetize it.</p><p>As more of the world’s economy moves on chain, organizations need a better understanding of their target audience across Web2 and Web3 to reach consumers directly. Oamo foresees a new paradigm where companies build consensual relationships with their audience, with users willingly sharing behavioral information and accepting offers.</p><p>Ceramic and <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> are at the heart of Oamo’s architecture—as they gear up for their launch later this year, users will be able to build their Oamo Profile (a Ceramic DID), connect their wallets across chains and social profiles, and generate credentials based on their on-chain and off-chain behaviors. These credentials can be shared anonymously with trusted companies for rewards, opening up the potential for personalized offers.</p> User-Centric Design: Oamo's Use of ComposeDB on Ceramic for Data Ownership and Control <p>One of the significant challenges that Oamo faced in its mission was ensuring data privacy and user control. The founders wanted to create a data economy where users truly own their data in a private manner and share behaviors with selected companies without revealing any personally identifiable information. One key challenge was designing a data-sharing platform that allowed users to connect multiple wallets and social profiles to a single profile, while still maintaining ownership and privacy. Oamo also aimed to enable companies to send personalized offers without revealing personal information. These challenges required a robust and secure solution that could handle decentralized data storage, encryption, and messaging capabilities.</p><p>ComposeDB on Ceramic became the backbone of Oamo's architecture. Users create their Oamo Profiles as Ceramic DIDs and generate verified credentials that align with their on-chain and off-chain behaviors. User credentials are then stored in ComposeDB and encrypted with Lit Protocol, ensuring users have complete control over their data. This solution allows companies to send personalized offers to users without revealing personal information, ensuring user anonymity while reaching the target audience trustlessly.</p><blockquote>"Ceramic accelerated our product development process exponentially by providing a robust ecosystem of tools that covered all our design goals. We believe it’s the only solution that could power true private ownership of data spanning across Web2 and Web3," - Yannick Folla, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Oamo</blockquote><p>Oamo's founders had been following Ceramic's journey from the early days of SelfID to Ceramic's current all-in-one package of DIDs, verified credentials, multi-chain support, decentralized data storage, and encryption support via Lit Protocol—this array of tools and capabilities perfectly aligned with Oamo's core design goals.</p> Building a Secure Data Economy With Ceramic and Lit Protocol <p>In Oamo's architecture, when a user generates a DID, the data saved in that stream is in plain text and publicly accessible. Given the sensitive nature of user data, it's crucial to encrypt this data and set permissions to restrict access. To achieve this, a user creates a salt and generates a DID using that salt. Then, the backend creates the requisite dataset and sends it to the user for encryption using Lit and storage in Ceramic. During the encryption process, the user sets permissions so that only the Oamo smart contract has decryption rights. </p><blockquote>"Through our research, we saw Ceramic as the only viable solution that would package DIDs, verified credentials, multi-chain support, decentralized data storage, and encryption support via Lit Protocol. It’s an all-in-one solution that ticks all the core design goals at Oamo."</blockquote><p>This approach ensures user data privacy and gives users control over where their data is stored. Ceramic's unique capabilities, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), verified credentials, multi-chain support, messaging capabilities with ComposeDB, decentralized data storage, and Lit Protocol encryption, made it the clear choice for Oamo.</p> Get Involved <p>If you're interested in participating in the new data economy, where you truly own your data and its value, <a href="https://spearmint.xyz/p/oamo-beta-waitlist?ref=blog.ceramic.network">join Oamo's allowlist</a> today and prepare for the upcoming launch!</p>

<p>Presenter&nbsp;</p>



 
 Stephen Curran, Open Source Community Lead and Senior Architect, Government of British Columbia&nbsp; 
 



<p>Privacy-preserving digital credentials built on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be game changers for digital identity and trust as they enable online trust without tracking. In fact, ZKPs allow entities to prove something is true to another party without conveying any additional information. For instance, a person can prove they are over the age of 19 without revealing the date of birth. In this session, Stephen provided an overview of the AnonCreds project, a high school math level introduction into the magic of ZKPs, and how they enable privacy-preserving online identity solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journey goes on&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, the response we received in sharing the B.C. Government’s work on digital trust alongside contributions from other ToIP members from our home province is a testament to the power of open innovation and the impact it can have on public service delivery. As a resident of British Columbia, I am proud to see our home province recognized on a global stage for their leadership and innovation in open source.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This month we kicked off our collaboration with Education as a Vaccine (<a href="https://www.evanigeria.org/" title="">EVA</a>), a Nigeria-based organisation working on improving the health and development of children and young people in the country. Through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Matchbox Programme</a>, we will provide intensive support to EVA Nigeria for a period of six to eight months.&nbsp;</p>



 Get to know EVA Nigeria: Improving the health and development of children and young people 



<p>EVA is a young-women-led and youth-focused organisation that envisions a Nigeria where children, adolescents and young people reach their full potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EVA believes that adolescents and young people, especially young women and girls, should be provided with the skills, resources and opportunities to lead on matters affecting their lives. To this end, they work in partnership with children, adolescent girls and young people to advance their rights to health and protection from all forms of violence by strengthening capacities, providing direct services and influencing policies for improved quality of life.</p>



<p>EVA’s work focuses on young people’s and women’s rights, addressing their sexual and reproductive health and well-being as well as gender-based violence, other human rights violations, and discrimination they face. The organisation’s work ensures the legal, policy and sociocultural environment enables and supports the enjoyment of their sexual and reproductive health and rights, and their rights to freedom from violence.</p>



<p>Since its founding, EVA Nigeria has successfully contributed to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Reaching over 41 million individuals (offline and online), of which over 3 million are children or young people reached in person. 



 Trained over 4,000 individuals in providing services. 



 Strengthening the capabilities of 10,000 individuals and 98 groups, including those most marginalised and excluded, to participate in and give input into law and policy-making processes that uphold the human rights of children and young people.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Learn more about their work on <a href="https://www.evanigeria.org/" title="">their website</a> and social media channels (they’re on <a href="https://twitter.com/EVA_Nigeria" title="">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/education-as-a-vaccine/" title="">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eva_nigeria/" title="">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJi5-L-klmJbiMnIYeGpQMg" title="">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/evanigeria/" title="">Facebook</a>).</p>



 Working together on effective and responsible data management&nbsp; 



<p>Throughout Matchbox, The Engine Room and EVA Nigeria will work together to assess the organisation’s current practices for data collection, analysis, storing and sharing. This will culminate in strengthening EVA Nigeria’s capacity to work with data in more responsible and effective ways.</p>

<p>This May brought us two of the oldest and largest digital identity conferences: the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity Conference</a> in Berlin and <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> in Las Vegas. Both were attended by ToIP Executive Director Judith Fleenor and a full contingent of ToIP members. In this post we’ll summarize our key observations and takeaways from each.</p>



 European Identity Conference, May 9-12, Berlin 



<p>EIC is the largest digital identity event of the year in Europe, running for four days every April or May for the last 16 years. Hosted by German-based analyst firm Kuppinger Cole, last year it moved from Munich to Berlin to give it even more room. This year had over 1,000 attendees and several dozen exhibitors.</p>



<p>While EIC has always had a major focus on conventional Identity and Access Management (IAM), Privileged Access Management (PAM), and Enterprise Cybersecurity, it was also the first conference to host a session on SSI and decentralized identity back in 2016. The following years that grew into an dedicated all-day track on SSI curated by Andy Tobin, formerly GM Europe for Evernym and now for Gen.</p>



<p>This year Andy and other ToIP attendees were amazed to see that half the conference was now focused on decentralized identity: digital wallets, credentials, exchange platforms, orchestration engines, and governance solutions. In retrospect this makes sense given the worldwide attention on the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Digital Identity Wallets initiative</a> (EUDIW). However even the KuppingerCole analysts were surprised by the level of interest. On Wednesday, the entire mainstage presentation track was devoted to Decentralized and Verifiable Credentials, and on Friday (the last day of the conference and usually the slowest day) the EU Digital Identity Wallet track curated by Andy was standing-room-only.</p>



<p>Equally encouraging was the level of interest in the OpenWallet Foundation (OWF). The conference opened on Tuesday with a half-day OWF deep-dive—seven sessions with over 40 panelists, including Andy, Judith, André Kudra (esatus), Dan Bachenheimer (Accenture), and Drummond Reed (Gen). These sessions covered the OWF mission, code contributions (including two SD-JWT libraries), technology (including OpenID for Verifiable Issuance, OpenID Verifiable Presentation, and ISO 18013-X mDL), and verifiable credential use cases in travel, finance, and government.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Judith facilitated the ToIP panel on<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.kuppingercole.com_sessions_5293_2&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=eIGjsITfXP_y-DLLX0uEHXJvU8nOHrUK8IrwNKOtkVU&amp;r=lkG7i97OmZFU0gIh3HpvAZd0UWN8W2EqVHo8fBfdWqr3likaTHZ12akxKlASQZz8&amp;m=4KH2D5qw2714mmH8RAyew31ySxL7Bg_u9_5cUHb00jJGwH5fhMRZ_Uk1ok0IDV9S&amp;s=tz0ndaLaAQYCR9ywwcuZs17y5EMr5tEgktXhdwJB9UM&amp;e="> Defining the Protocol for Internet-Scale Digital Trust</a> (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKZeXYDIgiI">YouTube video of panel recording</a>) with Andre, Daniel, Drummond, and Christoph Schneider (GLEIF) as panelists. At the start of the session the audience was polled if they were familiar with the topic of a trust spanning layer and the response was near 0%. After the panel explained how and why we were building such a layer and what this layer would do for interoperable digital trust (see the graphic we used below), we polled the audience a second time to ask if they felt a trust spanning protocol was valuable. This time the response was 100% affirmative.</p>







<p>On Thursday Judith delivered a well-received keynote presentation Decentralized Identity – Why is it all the Rage? The video is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhv5-xbcmkw">here</a>. But the ultimate highlight of the conference were the two ToIP members honored with the prestigious European Identity Conference Awards:</p>



 
 <a href="https://monokee.com/en/homepage/">Monokee</a> won the award in “Enterprise IAM” category for their work with Italian manufacturer Gibus, where Monokee implemented a secure, compliant, modern and future-proof single sign-on solution in a business-to-business environment with an estimated 5000 users. KuppingerCole noted that Monokee’s solution integrated a significant number of identity providers and in a highly regulated environment. 



 <a href="https://www.gleif.org/">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a> (GLEIF) took home the award for “Future Technologies &amp; Standards” for their suite of organizational identity services leveraging the new verifiable LEI (vLEI) model of digital identity, offering a standard for organizational identities, a trustworthy governance structure for assigning these, and a secure and reliable way of verifying the end-to-end identity of an organization. 
 



 Identiverse, May 30-June 2, Las Vegas 



<p>Identiverse is to North America what EIC is to Europe—in fact even larger. Last year the conference was sold by Ping Identity to <a href="https://www.cyberriskalliance.com/">CyberRisk Alliance</a>, a business intelligence company serving the high-growth cybersecurity industry. This year CyberRisk Alliance moved the conference to the sprawling Aria Resort hotel in Las Vegas, ensuring plenty of room for over 2500 attendees and 125 exhibitors.</p>



<p>As always, the conference opened with a riveting talk from Ping CEO Andre Durand. This year it began with Andre coming on stage and sitting down as we listened to his pre-recorded voiceover narrative to a powerful three-minute slideshow about how generative AI was now about to impersonate almost anyone almost anywhere. It ended with this warning:</p>







<p>At which point Andre stood up and announced that every single bit of the voiceover narrative and slide show we had just watched—including his voice, the script, the slides, and all the images—had been generated by AI.</p>



<p>In keeping with that theme, the dominant topics at Identiverse were tilted towards the cybersecurity side of digital identity. <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO passkeys</a> were a particularly strong focus, featuring in at least a dozen of the 175+ sessions.</p>



<p>However decentralized identity and trust was far from absent. A number of sessions and exhibitors covered various facets of digital wallets and verifiable credentials. However, the difference between the North American and European perspectives on decentralized identity and trust infrastructure was palpable. For example, while the Wednesday keynote presentation from Alex Simons of Microsoft included their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Entra Verified ID</a> decentralized identity platform, it was just one of four major topics he covered. And the talk given by Jeremy Grant, coordinator of the Washington D.C.-based <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/">Better Identity Coalition</a>, was titled, “The Four Horsemen of the SSI Apocalypse” (Jeremy assured several ToIP members that it was “constructive criticism”).</p>



<p>Thankfully, that skeptical view of decentralized identity was contrasted with a Thursday keynote session featuring the OpenWallet Foundation. Led by OWF Executive Director Daniel Goldscheider, that session helped paint a strong picture of the progress of digital wallets and credentials, leaving the impression that the EU is leading the world in digital wallet infrastructure much as the EU GDPR regulations have led the world in privacy.</p>



<p>To the ToIP members attending, this Identiverse was a clarion call that we need to advance our work on all aspects of the ToIP stack as quickly as possible and be prepared to shine a brighter light on it in the next season of digital identity conferences.</p>
