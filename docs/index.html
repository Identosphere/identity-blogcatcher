<p></p><p>I think there’s more work to be done to explore print as a modern product to support great writing and journalism. Lots has been said about its death — but comparatively little about its potential to live on in new forms.</p><p>I think print has a lot of life left in it: particularly if we overcome the idea of preserving the exact form it’s taken in the past and consider what a more modern, reconsidered print product might look like.</p><p>There’s a lot to be said for reading on paper. One of my more recent indulgences has been a daily subscription to <a href="https://ft.com">The Financial Times</a>, which on weekdays is a sober paper that reports the news fairly objectively. On weekends it’s a different beast: in particular it includes a magazine pull-out called How to Spend It that is apparently aimed at the worst people on earth and is generally indistinguishable from satire.</p><p>The Financial Times has been publishing since 1888, but some endeavors are much newer. Speaking of indistinguishable from satire, I subscribed to <a href="https://theonion.com/">The Onion</a>’s print edition, now it <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/the-onion-sold-global-tetrahedron-1235982383/">has been bought from its private equity owner</a>. It’s been fun seeing it adopt similar membership strategies to other, more “serious” publications. Most exciting among those is <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/4831253-the-onion-resumes-print-edition/">its resumed print edition</a>, which is an old idea given a new spin:</p><blockquote><p>“I think for the same reason that 18-year-old kids are buying Taylor Swift on vinyl,” Jordan LaFlure, The Onion’s executive editor also told the Times, “we can introduce those same kids to the notion that a print publication is a much richer way to consume media.”</p></blockquote><p>It’s not obvious to me that a similar strategy couldn’t work for other publications — or even as a digest of independent publications that work together. Would I buy a subscription to a paper edition of independent journalism across various topics? Absolutely I would, and I don’t think I’m alone. Think of it as a lo-fi RSS reader or a retro Apple News: articles I care about from around the web in a form factor that looks more like The New Yorker (or The Onion).</p><p>This product could take several forms. It could combine an algorithmic component — here are the writers I care about — with a more human-driven curatorial component from editors who want to highlight interesting journalism from sources the reader might not have encountered yet. Or it could be a purely editorial product with no algorithmic component: one size fits all, for every reader. Or you could subscribe to personalized editions with different human editors who get a cut of subscriptions for putting it all together. (A monthly tech periodical organized by <a href="https://werd.io/platformer.news/">Casey Newton</a> or <a href="https://citationneeded.news/">Molly White</a>? Take my money.)</p><p>Publications like <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a> (my current employer) and <a href="https://19thnews.org">The 19th</a> (which I’ve worked for previously) produce content that is more long-form journalism than breaking news, which is highly suitable for reading in a collected periodical. They also make their content freely available via a Creative Commons license, meaning that, technically, anyone could put this together. But it would clearly be better in partnership with newsrooms, with revenue and subscriber information flowing back to them in exchange for letting their journalism be included.</p><p>This isn’t a traditional startup: it’s hard for me to see how this product would enjoy the rapid growth or high valuations which justify venture investment. But it’s potentially a really interesting small business. If the numbers work out, it could also potentially be a fascinating add-on product for a service like <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>. There’s user and market research to be done here, but it’s possible that the decline of legacy print products does not necessarily mean that new print products won’t be successful.</p><p>The act of reading on paper feels different to sitting in front of a screen. Maybe I’m getting old, but I like sitting at the dining room table, leafing through print. It is an old school product that is a little like vinyl, but it also feels like I’m using my brain a bit differently. I’d love to do more of it. In a world where everything is digital, maybe a thoughtfully curated print product could be exactly what we need to slow down and engage more deeply. Or maybe not, but I think it would be cool.</p><p>I’d love to hear what you think. Am I alone in preferring an offline, analogue, tactile reading experience? Is there something here, or is the future of media entirely, irrevocably digital?</p>

   Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B is now production ready 
Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B is "a smaller and faster variant of 1.5 Flash" - and is now released to production, at half the price of the 1.5 Flash model. 
 It's really, really cheap: 
 
 $0.0375 per 1 million input tokens on prompts &lt;128K 
 $0.15 per 1 million output tokens on prompts &lt;128K 
 $0.01 per 1 million input tokens on cached prompts &lt;128K

Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B is "a smaller and faster variant of 1.5 Flash" - and is now released to production, at half the price of the 1.5 Flash model.<p></p>
<p>It's really, really cheap:</p>
 
 $0.0375 per 1 million input tokens on prompts &lt;128K 
 $0.15 per 1 million output tokens on prompts &lt;128K 
 $0.01 per 1 million input tokens on cached prompts &lt;128K 
 
<p>Prices are doubled for prompts longer than 128K.</p>
<p>I believe images are still charged at a flat rate of 258 tokens, which I think means a single non-cached image with Flash should cost 0.00097 cents - a number so tiny I'm doubting if I got the calculation right.</p>
<p>OpenAI's cheapest model remains GPT-4o mini, at $0.15/1M input - though that drops to half of that for reused prompt prefixes thanks to their new prompt caching feature (or by half if you use batches, though those can’t be combined with OpenAI prompt caching. Gemini also offer half-off for batched requests).</p>
<p>Anthropic's cheapest model is still Claude 3 Haiku at $0.25/M, though that drops to $0.03/M for cached tokens (if you configure them correctly).</p>
<p>I've released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.2">llm-gemini 0.2</a> with support for the new model:</p>
 <code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm keys set gemini
# Paste API key here
llm -m gemini-1.5-flash-8b-latest "say hi"

ChatGPT was not generating professional prose all at once, but it was providing starting points: interesting research ideas to explore; mediocre paragraphs that might, with sufficient editing, become usable. For all its inefficiencies, this indirect approach did feel easier than staring at a blank page; “talking” to the chatbot about the article was more fun than toiling in quiet isolation.

<p>Our plan is to prototype and prove locally what can apply globally for local news, starting with what <a href="https://www.cjr.org/">Columbia Journalism Review</a> <a href="https://www.cjr.org/local_news/american-news-deserts-donuts-local.php">called “news deserts”</a> back in 2017—a label that has since caught on. There are many efforts toward seeding and watering these deserts, most prominently <a href="https://www.pressforward.news/funding-opportunities/">Press Forward</a>, which is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/07/1198029284/macarthur-knight-journalism-news-press-forward">devoting $500 million</a> to that challenge.</p>
<p>Bloomington is advantaged by not being one of those deserts, and instead having a talented pool of local journals, journalists, and organizations—including its legacy newspaper—all doing good work that could still be improved by putting to use some of the innovations I’ll be talking about, and by working together as a commons.</p>
<p>So join the conversation. I look forward to seeing you in the room or on the wall (because one whole wall is our Zoom screen).</p>

  <p><a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-flux-1-1-pro-and-the-bfl-api/">Announcing FLUX1.1 [pro] and the BFL API</a></p>
FLUX is the image generation model family from Black Forest Labs, a startup founded by members of the team that previously created Stable Diffusion.<p></p>
<p>Released today, FLUX1.1 [pro] continues the general trend of AI models getting both better and more efficient:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FLUX1.1 [pro] provides six times faster generation than its predecessor FLUX.1 [pro] while also improving image quality, prompt adherence, and diversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Black Forest Labs appear to have settled on a potentially workable business model: their smallest, fastest model FLUX.1 [schnell] is Apache 2 licensed. The next step up is FLUX.1 [dev] which is open weights for non-commercial use only. The [pro] models are closed weights, made available exclusively through their API or partnerships with other API providers.</p>
<p>I tried the new 1.1 model out using <a href="https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro">black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro</a> on Replicate just now. Here's my prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photograph of a Faberge egg representing the California coast. It should be decorated with ornate pelicans and sea lions and a humpback whale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The FLUX models have a reputation for being really good at following complex prompts. In this case I wanted the sea lions to appear in the egg design rather than looking at the egg from the beach, but I imagine I could get better results if I continued to iterate on my prompt.</p>
<p>The FLUX models are also better at applying text than any other image models I've tried myself.

This morning on the BBC: UK will give sovereignty of Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The Chagos Islands include the area that the UK calls the British Indian Ocean Territory. The .io ccTLD uses the  ISO-3166 two-letter country code for that designation.

  <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41729526">Ask HN: What happens to ".io" TLD after UK gives back the Chagos Islands?</a></p>
This morning on the BBC: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98ynejg4l5o">UK will give sovereignty of Chagos Islands to Mauritius</a>. The Chagos Islands include the area that the UK calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Ocean_Territory">the British Indian Ocean Territory</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io">.io ccTLD</a> uses the  ISO-3166 two-letter country code for that designation.<p></p>
<p>As the owner of <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a> the question of what happens to that ccTLD is suddenly very relevant to me.</p>
<p>This Hacker News conversation has some useful information. It sounds like there's a very real possibility that <code>.io</code> could be deleted after a few years notice - it's happened before, for ccTLDs such as <code>.zr</code> for Zaire (which renamed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> in 1997, with <code>.zr</code> withdrawn in 2001) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.cs">.cs</a> for Czechoslovakia, withdrawn in 1995.</p>
<p>Could <code>.io</code> change status to the same kind of TLD as <code>.museum</code>, unaffiliated with any particular geography? The convention is for two letter TLDs to exactly match ISO country codes, so that may not be an option.

<p>It is funny - but I think it is funny for all the reasons that the commenters were not seeing ….</p>
 
<p>A university is to educate .. not train. If you are wondering about the difference, ask yourself if you prefer your children to attend sex education classes or sex training classes.</p>
<p>Sadly most institutions have moved to thinking of themselves as trainers .. so they are ‘workplace ready’. Witness a presentation I sat in just last week where someone from an educational facility was telling us how they are currently revamping their syllabus so that their students could learn how best to work with Ai (sic) … see Stephen Fry’s latest missive.</p>
<p>I stood up and asked her which University she thought the people making Ai had taught them what they know.</p>
<p>(Apparently .. that’s different).</p>
<p>As for philosophy .. oh and let’s throw in ethics, humanities, liberal arts, critical thinking, hell, even english .. are (should be) all on the rise in education, because it is very clear that we need them …badly.</p>
<p>I get the picture .. funny.</p>
<p>But the humor doesn’t lie in the kid having it wrong and dreaming what might be .. it’s in the dad having it wrong and thinking the future is anything like the past.</p>

  <p>I had a fun time <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/1/openai-devday-2024-live-blog/">live blogging OpenAI DevDay yesterday</a> - I’ve now <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/django/live-blog">shared notes</a> about the live blogging system I threw other in a hurry on the day (with assistance from Claude and GPT-4o). Now that the smoke has settled a little, here are my impressions from the event.</p>

 
   <a>Compared to last year</a> 
   <a>Prompt caching, aka the big price drop</a> 
   <a>GPT-4o audio via the new WebSocket Realtime API</a> 
   <a>Model distillation is fine-tuning made much easier</a> 
   <a>Let’s build developer tools, not digital God</a> 
 

 Compared to last year 

<p>Comparison with the first DevDay in November 2023 are unavoidable. That event was much more keynote-driven: just in the keynote OpenAI released GPT-4 vision, and Assistants, and GPTs, and GPT-4 Turbo (with a massive price drop), and their text-to-speech API. It felt more like a launch-focused product event than something explicitly for developers.</p>
<p>This year was different. Media weren’t invited, there was no livestream, Sam Altman didn’t present the opening keynote (he was interviewed at the end of the day instead) and the new features, while impressive, were not as abundant.</p>
<p>Several features were released in the last few months that could have been saved for DevDay: GPT-4o mini and the o1 model family are two examples. I’m personally happy that OpenAI are shipping features like that as they become ready rather than holding them back for an event.</p>
<p>I’m a bit surprised they didn’t talk about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/1/whisper-large-v3-turbo-model/">Whisper Turbo</a> at the conference though, released just the day before - especially since that’s one of the few pieces of technology they release under an open source (MIT) license.</p>
<p>This was clearly intended as an event by developers, for developers. If you don’t build software on top of OpenAI’s platform there wasn’t much to catch your attention here.</p>
<p>As someone who does build software on top of OpenAI, there was a ton of valuable and interesting stuff.</p>
 Prompt caching, aka the big price drop 
<p>I was hoping we might see a price drop, seeing as there’s an ongoing pricing war between Gemini, Anthropic and OpenAI. We got one in an interesting shape: a <a href="https://openai.com/index/api-prompt-caching/">50% discount</a> on input tokens for prompts with a shared prefix.</p>
<p>This isn’t a new idea: both Google Gemini and Claude offer a form of prompt caching discount, if you configure them correctly and make smart decisions about when and how the cache should come into effect.</p>
<p>The difference here is that OpenAI apply the discount automatically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>API calls to supported models will automatically benefit from Prompt Caching on prompts longer than 1,024 tokens. The API caches the longest prefix of a prompt that has been previously computed, starting at 1,024 tokens and increasing in 128-token increments. If you reuse prompts with common prefixes, we will automatically apply the Prompt Caching discount without requiring you to make any changes to your API integration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>50% off repeated long prompts is a pretty significant price reduction!</p>
<p><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching">Anthropic's Claude implementation</a> saves more money: 90% off rather than 50% - but is significantly more work to put into play.</p>
<p><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching">Gemini’s caching</a> requires you to pay per hour to keep your cache warm which makes it extremely difficult to effectively build against in comparison to the other two.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that OpenAI are not the first company to offer automated caching discounts: <a href="https://platform.deepseek.com/api-docs/news/news0802/">DeepSeek have offered that</a> through their API for a few months.</p>
 GPT-4o audio via the new WebSocket Realtime API 
<p>Absolutely the biggest announcement of the conference: the <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/">new Realtime API</a> is effectively the API version of ChatGPT advanced voice mode, a user-facing feature that finally <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8400625-voice-mode-faq">rolled out to everyone</a> just a week ago.</p>
<p>This means we can finally tap directly into GPT-4o’s multimodal audio support: we can send audio directly into the model (without first transcribing it to text via something like Whisper), and we can have it directly return speech without needing to run a separate text-to-speech model.</p>
<p>The way they chose to expose this is interesting: it’s not (yet) part of their existing chat completions API, instead using an entirely new API pattern built around WebSockets.</p>

<p></p>

<p>They designed it like that because they wanted it to be as realtime as possible: the API lets you constantly stream audio and text in both directions, and even supports allowing users to speak over and interrupt the model!</p>
<p>So far the Realtime API supports text, audio and function call / tool usage - but doesn't (yet) support image input (I've been assured that's coming soon). The combination of audio and function calling is super exciting alone though - several of the demos at DevDay used these to build fun voice-driven interactive web applications.</p>
<p>I like this WebSocket-focused API design a lot. My only hesitation is that, since an API key is needed to open a WebSocket connection, actually running this in production involves spinning up an authenticating WebSocket proxy. I hope OpenAI can provide a less code-intensive way of solving this in the future.</p>
<p>Code they showed during the event demonstrated using the native browser <code>WebSocket</code> class directly, but I can't find those code examples online now. I hope they publish it soon. For the moment the best things to look at are the <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-api-beta">openai-realtime-api-beta</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console">openai-realtime-console</a> repositories.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground/realtime">playground/realtime</a> debugging tool - the OpenAI playground for the Realtime API - is a lot of fun to try out too.</p>
 Model distillation is fine-tuning made much easier 
<p>The other big developer-facing announcements were around model distillation, which to be honest is more of a usability enhancement and minor rebranding of their existing <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning">fine-tuning features</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI have offered fine-tuning for a few years now, most recently against their GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models. They’ve practically been begging people to try it out, offering <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-fine-tuning/">generous free tiers</a> in previous months:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today [August 20th 2024] we’re launching fine-tuning for GPT-4o, one of the most requested features from developers. We are also offering 1M training tokens per day for free for every organization through September 23.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That free offer has now been extended. A footnote on <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">the pricing page</a> today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fine-tuning for GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini is free up to a daily token limit through October 31, 2024. For GPT-4o, each qualifying org gets up to 1M complimentary training tokens daily and any overage will be charged at the normal rate of $25.00/1M tokens. For GPT-4o mini, each qualifying org gets up to 2M complimentary training tokens daily and any overage will be charged at the normal rate of $3.00/1M tokens</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with fine-tuning is that it’s really hard to do effectively. I tried it a couple of years ago myself against GPT-3 - just to apply tags to my blog content - and got disappointing results which deterred me from spending more money iterating on the process.</p>
<p>To fine-tune a model effectively you need to gather a high quality set of examples and you need to construct a robust set of automated evaluations. These are some of the most challenging (and least well understood) problems in the whole nascent field of prompt engineering.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s solution is a bit of a rebrand. “Model distillation” is a form of fine-tuning where you effectively teach a smaller model how to do a task based on examples generated by a larger model. It’s a very effective technique. Meta <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/">recently boasted about</a> how their impressive Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models were “taught” by their larger models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] powerful teacher models can be leveraged to create smaller models that have improved performance. We used two methods—pruning and distillation—on the 1B and 3B models, making them the first highly capable lightweight Llama models that can fit on devices efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday OpenAI released two new features to help developers implement this pattern.</p>
<p>The first is stored completions. You can now pass <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-store">a "store": true parameter</a> to have OpenAI permanently store your prompt and its response in their backend, optionally with your own <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-metadata">additional tags</a> to help you filter the captured data later.</p>
<p>You can view your stored completions at <a href="https://platform.openai.com/chat-completions">platform.openai.com/chat-completions</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing effectively the same thing with my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM command-line tool</a> logging to <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html">a SQLite database</a> for over a year now. It's a really productive pattern.</p>
<p>OpenAI pitch stored completions as a great way to collect a set of training data from their large models that you can later use to fine-tune (aka distill into) a smaller model.</p>
<p>The second, even more impactful feature, is evals. You can now define and run comprehensive prompt evaluations directly inside the OpenAI platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>OpenAI’s <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals">new eval tool</a> competes directly with a bunch of existing startups - I’m quite glad I didn’t invest much effort in this space myself!</p>
<p>The combination of evals and stored completions certainly seems like it should make the challenge of fine-tuning a custom model far more tractable.</p>
<p>The other fine-tuning announcement, greeted by applause in the room, was <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-vision-to-the-fine-tuning-api/">fine-tuning for images</a>. This has always felt like one of the most obviously beneficial fine-tuning use-cases for me, since it’s much harder to get great image recognition results from sophisticated prompting alone.</p>
<p>From a strategic point of view this makes sense as well: it has become increasingly clear over the last year that many prompts are inherently transferable between models - it’s very easy to take an application with prompts designed for GPT-4o and switch it to Claude or Gemini or Llama with few if any changes required.</p>
<p>A fine-tuned model on the OpenAI platform is likely to be far more sticky.</p>
 Let’s build developer tools, not digital God 
<p>In the last session of the day I furiously live blogged <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/1/openai-devday-2024-live-blog/#live-update-140">the Fireside Chat</a> between Sam Altman and Kevin Weil, trying to capture as much of what they were saying as possible.</p>
<p>A bunch of the questions were about AGI. I’m personally quite uninterested in AGI: it’s always felt a bit too much like science fiction for me. I want useful AI-driven tools that help me solve the problems I want to solve.</p>
<p>One point of frustration: Sam referenced OpenAI’s five-level framework a few times. I found several news stories (many paywalled - here's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/openai-reportedly-nears-breakthrough-with-reasoning-ai-reveals-progress-framework/">one that isn't</a>) about it but I can’t find a definitive URL on an OpenAI site that explains what it is! This is why you should always <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/13/give-people-something-to-link-to/">Give people something to link to so they can talk about your features and ideas</a>.</p>
<p>Both Sam and Kevin seemed to be leaning away from AGI as a term. From my live blog notes (which paraphrase what was said unless I use quotation marks):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam says they're trying to avoid the term now because it has become so over-loaded. Instead they think about their new five steps framework.</p>
<p>"I feel a little bit less certain on that" with respect to the idea that an AGI will make a new scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Kevin: "There used to be this idea of AGI as a binary thing [...] I don't think that's how think about it any more".</p>
<p>Sam: Most people looking back in history won't agree when AGI happened. The turing test wooshed past and nobody cared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I for one found this very reassuring. The thing I want from OpenAI is more of what we got yesterday: I want platform tools that I can build unique software on top of which I colud not have built previously.</p>
<p>If the ongoing, well-documented internal turmoil at OpenAI from the last year is a result of the organization reprioritizing towards shipping useful, reliable tools for developers (and consumers) over attempting to build a digital God, then I’m all for it.</p>
<p>And yet… OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/scale-the-benefits-of-ai/">just this morning</a> finalized a raise of another $6.5 billion dollars at a staggering $157 billion post-money valuation. That feels more like a digital God valuation to me than a platform for developers in an increasingly competitive space.</p>

When I worked on Elgg, the open source ecosystem was relatively underdeveloped, and I don't remember it being much of a problem. In contrast, Known plugged into a significantly more advanced ecosystem. The solution Dries lays out makes a ton of sense to me, and I wish we'd done more along these lines in both cases.</p>

  <p><a href="https://jacobian.org/2024/oct/1/ethical-public-sector-ai/">Ethical Applications of AI to Public Sector Problems</a></p>
Jacob Kaplan-Moss developed this model a few years ago (before the generative AI rush) while working with public-sector startups and is publishing it now. He starts by outright dismissing the snake-oil infested field of “predictive” models:<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not ethical to predict social outcomes — and it’s probably not possible. Nearly everyone claiming to be able to do this is lying: their algorithms do not, in fact, make predictions that are any better than guesswork. […] Organizations acting in the public good should avoid this area like the plague, and call bullshit on anyone making claims of an ability to predict social behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacob then differentiates assistive AI and automated AI. Assistive AI helps human operators process and consume information, while leaving the human to take action on it. Automated AI acts upon that information without human oversight.</p>
<p>His conclusion: yes to assistive AI, and no to automated AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All too often, AI algorithms encode human bias. And in the public sector, failure carries real life or death consequences. In the private sector, companies can decide that a certain failure rate is OK and let the algorithm do its thing. But when citizens interact with their governments, they have an expectation of fairness, which, because AI judgement will always be available, it cannot offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Mastodon <a href="https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/113235310036566202">I said to Jacob</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m heavily opposed to anything where decisions with consequences are outsourced to AI, which I think fits your model very well</p>
<p>(somewhat ironic that I wrote this message from the passenger seat of my first ever Waymo trip, and this weird car is making extremely consequential decisions dozens of times a second!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which sparked an interesting conversation about why life-or-death decisions made by self-driving cars feel different from decisions about social services. My take on that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s about judgement: the decisions I care about are far more deep and non-deterministic than “should I drive forward or stop”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://social.jacobian.org/@jacob/113235551869890541">Jacob</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where there’s moral ambiguity, I want a human to own the decision both so there’s a chance for empathy, and also for someone to own the accountability for the choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That idea of ownership and accountability for decision making feels critical to me. A giant black box of matrix multiplication cannot take accountability for “decisions” that it makes.

   Building an automatically updating live blog in Django 
Here's an extended write-up of how I implemented the live blog feature I used for my coverage of OpenAI DevDay yesterday. I built the first version using Claude while waiting for the keynote to start, then upgraded it during the lunch break with the help of GPT-4o to add sort options and incremental fetching of new updates.

Croissants (the edible kind) on display at Peets in Santa Barbara.
<p>A radio item</p>
<p>Over on my <a href="http://trunkli.org">blog about infrastructure</a>, I put up a <a href="https://trunkli.org/2024/10/01/restoring-marshall/">brief post</a> about <a href="https://www.wartfm.org/who-we-are-volunteer">WART</a>, volunteer-powered community radio station with studios in a railroad caboose, that was lost in the flood that just <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/01/marshall-hurricane-helene-carolina-destruction/75461359007/">devastated</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall,_North_Carolina">Marshall</a>, North Carolina.</p>
<p>Write once, publish everywhere</p>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com">Dave</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/01/192207.html#a192213">turned me on</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/croissant-debuts-a-cross-posting-app-for-threads-bluesky-and-mastodon/">Croissant</a> today. Looks good. I’d even be willing to pay the monthly fee to post once across Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, and Xitter. But it appears to be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/croissant-cross-posting/id6670288979">only for iOS mobile devices</a>. I have some of those (including a new iPhone 16 Pro), but I mostly write on a computer. So I’ll hold out for real <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>, like <a href="https://kottke.org/19/01/the-amazon-chronicles">Tim Carmody</a> talks up <a href="https://kottke.org/23/11/the-future-of-rss-is-textcasting-1">here</a>. Because why should you have to post separately at all those places? Why should you have to go to a place at all, when you’ve got your own devices to write on and distribute from?</p>
<p>A heading convention</p>
<p>I started curating my photos (e.g. <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/">these</a>) in the last millennium using this date-based naming convention: YYYY_MM_DD_topical-text_NNN.jpg (where the NNNs are just sequential numbers and the file type suffix could be .jpg, .arw, .cr2, .png or whatever. Same for folder titles.) So, because I don’t want a new title for every day I do this, I’m adopting the same convention, at least for now.</p>
<p>Not fast enough</p>
<p>In The End of Advertising, <a href="https://substack.com/@mignano">Michael Mignano</a> says (in the subhead, and beyond), The business model that funded the internet is going away, and the open web will never be the same. He says AI is already killing it, by giving us answers to everything, and performing other handy tasks, without advertising to distract or annoy us. He also says AI services will attempt to invent ads, but that’s a losing proposition, mostly because it won’t work and we’ll hate it, but also because “content wants to be free.” (I submit that no art forms, ever, wanted to be called “content.”) I agree. I also agree that “Premium content will become even more premium.” He concludes, “the relationship between us and publishers will become much more transactional and direct. And we will feel it. Over time, it’ll be a new internet, and the open web will be a memory. Great content will still find a way to reach us, just like it always has. But we’ll look back on the first few decades of the internet as the golden age of content, when everything felt free.” Well, you’re reading some premium content right now, and it’s free. Thanks to what I do here, I can make money in other ways. We call those <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2007/11/28/adventures-with-because-effects/">because effects</a>.</p>

Sitting on this spinning sphere<br>
When will I leave here<br>
We know death is always near<br>
I try to understand but answers don’t come easily<br>
Friends always deceiving me<br>
Is this what life’s supposed to be?<br>
Human animals<br>
We roam the earth in search of blood<br>
Hope for humanity?<br>
I don’t think there ever was<br>
We’re in perpetual war, and that’s the only law<br>
Can I change it? I doubt it<br>
So I write songs about it<br>
I was young once but now I’ve grown old<br>
Right in front of your еyes you’ve seen my life unfold<br>
I had no choicе as I became the underdog’s voice<br>
A young black kid… look what the fuck I did!<br>
When I’m gone there’ll be someone to carry on<br>
We can give in, give up, or we can stay strong<br>
How accepting of the bullshit we’ve all become<br>
This whole world is… comfortably numb<br>
Hello… is anybody out there?<br>
Can anybody hear me?<br>
Hello… is anybody out there?<br>
Can anybody hear me?</p>
<p>You’ve got a TV, a computer, so you don’t care<br>
A roof, some clothes, some food<br>
That’s right, it’s all there<br>
Lock yourself in your house, try to forget about<br>
The millions dyin' from wars, starvation and drought<br>
You’ve got your own problems - yes, we all do<br>
Nobody is free from stress, not him, or me, or you<br>
But still we judge each other, we want to pick a fight<br>
In the streets we kill each other, each and every weeknight<br>
I don’t want no drama but I carry a gun<br>
I don’t want no problems but they’ll probably come<br>
So we get high to wash away the pain<br>
Self-medication, but that shit is all done in vain<br>
We think that we can hide away from the misery<br>
You can close your eyes but still can plainly see<br>
There’s nowhere to run…<br>
You’re just comfortably numb</p>
<p>Hello… is anybody out there?<br>
Can anybody hear me?<br>
Hello… is anybody out there?<br>
Can anybody hear me?</p>
<p>I spent half my life just trying to survive<br>
And the other half trying to keep you all alive<br>
For some reason I still care<br>
I’ve done my dirt<br>
It’s amazing that i’m still here<br>
There’s true evil out there, I’ve been trying to warn you<br>
You could meet the devil himself, then what you gonna do?<br>
No time to pray, no chance to run<br>
Listen… ‘cause I’ve been on both sides of the gun<br>
As you stand before me we’re all here as one<br>
We gotta come together or our chances are none<br>
Maybe I’m just a dreamer, too many obstacles<br>
The though of humans coexisting, that’s impossible<br>
Better to stay numb, live in denial<br>
We’re all going to hell and we did it to ourselves<br>
Too much religious beef, too much racist shit<br>
And if there is a God we probably make him sick</p>
<p>Hello… is anybody out there?<br>
Can anybody hear me?<br>
Hello… is anybody out there?<br>
Can anybody hear me?</p>

<p>Hi, this is Gergely with a subscriber-only issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>Before we start: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/podcast">The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast</a> started off last week, with episode #1: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tools-for-software-engineers-simon-willison">AI tools for software engineers, but without the hype</a>. New episodes come every other Wednesday. Thank you to everyone who listened to this first one. If you enjoy podcasts, please do add it on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pragmatic-engineer-podcast/id1769051199">Apple</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2Bho9xCbOQMWMJ7UKmqCzD">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pragmaticengineer">YouTube</a> or your in your favorite player – and you will have episodes automatically show up, while also helping the show.</p><p>How do you deal with bugs in software products you build? This topic seems very under-discussed, but it affects pretty much every software team. To find out what professionals think, with we reached out to two dozen engineering leaders and software engineers, who kindly shared approaches which work for their team and organization.</p><p>This topic is evergreen, and one that has outsized (potentially decisive!) impact on product quality and user experience.&nbsp;</p><p>In this issue, we cover:</p>  <p>Finding bugs. Dogfood products where possible, invest in test automation, stay close to users, and more.</p>  <p>Reporting bugs. Making it easy for users to report bugs, having an accessible engineering team, and scaling the reporting process by team or company size.</p>  <p>Bug triaging. Figure out which bugs are critical by using bug priority rubrics, consider priority definitions, and get inspired by Spotify’s bug prioritization framework.</p>  <p>Don’t manage bugs: fix them! See bug fixing as like gardening, not maintenance. Consider approaches like deleting all amassed bugs, and regularly pruning the backlog.</p>  <p>Zero bugs policy. An approach where all inbound bugs are either fixed on the spot: or the bug is deemed invalid. A subset of this approach is to fix all bugs for recently released features – which is what Figma does.</p>  <p>As a refresher, we have a few previous deepdives that are related to this topic:</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/incident-review-best-practices">Incident review and postmortem best practices</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/healthy-oncall-practices">Healthy oncall practices</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-big-tech-does-qa">How Big Tech does Quality Assurance (QA)</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/qa-across-tech">QA approaches across the industry</a></p>  <p>Thank you to everyone who contributed insights to this article: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedsaher/">Ahmed Saher</a> (engineering manager), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anais-van-asselt/">Anaïs van Asselt</a> (senior QA engineer), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasiposb/">Andrea Sipos</a> (product leader), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernd-kampl-0597a494/">Bernd Kampl</a> (Software Engineering Team Lead), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonadiller/">Jason Diller</a> (VP of Engineering), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpcutler/">John Cutler</a> (product leader), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/magnusudbjorg/">Magnus L.

Finding bugs <p>How can we be confident that the software we release has no known issues? We need to validate that it works correctly and there are common approaches for this.</p><p>Dogfood products. The term “dogfooding” is the name of the common practice of devs and employees using a product while they are building it, pre-release. For example, when I worked at Uber, the company issued free credits for staff to use the internal beta app for rides and food deliveries. At Skype, we used running internal beta versions of Skype for all internal chat and video calling. The business gave Skype credits to employees, so we could dogfood paid features like landline calls. Spotify does the same, as Rebecca Holm Ring, a former engineering manager there, shares:</p><blockquote><p>“Each employee at Spotify is expected to be on the master or internal Spotify release, and report any issues they experience. A problem here though is that most Spotify employees will be iOS users, and so the Android app doesn’t get nearly enough testing before rolling out.”</p></blockquote><p>Invest in test automation. Anaïs van Asselt – senior QA at Choco – shares their approach:</p><blockquote><p>“Proactively finding and fixing bugs before they reach production is crucial. We invest in various test automation techniques to act as quality gates. Additionally, we practice bug hunting and gradually roll out new features to a limited user base, allowing us to catch and fix bugs early, reducing their overall cost.”</p></blockquote><p>At smaller companies, be close to users. These places tend to be closer to users and can use this to build a relationship with users who get invested in the product and the reporting of bugs. Bernd Kampl – Software Engineering Team Lead at Anyline, a smaller cartech AI company – shares:</p><blockquote><p>“As we are still smaller, we usually find bugs when our customers report them. If that's not the case, we identify them mostly during day-to-day development work.”</p></blockquote><p>Magnus Udbjørg is CTO of Testaviva, a 50-person startup in Denmark. His take is that it’s optimal to build trust with users so they report issues:</p><blockquote><p>“To find, identify, and prevent bugs, we foster a culture of dialogue and mutual understanding. We believe our developers need to understand our users deeply, and sometimes, our users need to understand the technical constraints we face. Open communication is key to building trust.”</p></blockquote><p>A fair question is why not do lots of testing, themselves? The smaller the company and the fewer the customers, the more it feels too expensive to invest a lot in testing, early on. Of course, there are always countercases, like how Figma spent nearly 3 years iterating on the first release, in order to get the performance of their collaborative, web-based editor right, to give users a fun “wow moment.” Worth noting that Figma is a product the dev team used continuously while developing it, getting lots of testing during the building phase.&nbsp; <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture">We cover Figma’s engineering culture in a deep dive</a>.</p><p>Consider alpha and beta testing at larger companies. Alpha and beta testing is about giving customers access to unfinished, less stable versions of a product. “Alpha” usually refers to a latest build that has had little to no QA testing. “Beta” versions have had some testing, but not as much as a full release.</p><p>Rebecca Holm Ring shares how this worked at Spotify:</p><blockquote><p>“There’s an Alpha testing, and Beta testing program, where external users are on the master branch and release branch respectively, and are expected to report any issues they encounter. With these versions of Spotify, it is also possible for a user to report a bug directly from the app, and logs will be attached as the bug report will be automatically added in JIRA.”</p></blockquote><p>Automation: testing and code analysis. Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end-tests, and other automated tests, are great ways to catch regressions, which is a software bug introduced into a feature after the feature was working correctly; the feature has ‘regressed’ into a faulty state.</p><p>This is true for static code analysis and other tools that automate quality assurance. We cover more on these methods in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/qa-across-tech">QA approaches across the industry</a>.</p><p>Code reviews. These serve multiple purposes, offering a second pair of eyes to double check code, spread knowledge, and follow not-yet-automated conventions, and more. Catching bugs before they make it into the codebase is an occasional side effect.</p><p>Even so, bugs can easily slip through code reviews, which are nowhere near a perfect way to defend against shipping bugs and regressions.</p><p>Define what a bug is. Users often report “bugs” when they mean missing features, so it can be helpful for teams to agree what a bug is and how to categorize them. In general, a bug is a flaw that results in a software product behaving incorrectly. Categorizations can be granular, like splitting bugs into concurrency bugs, syntax ones, arithmetic, logical errors, human errors and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>The simplest categorization is to split bugs into functional ones, when the behavior of the software is clearly wrong, and non-functional ones, when a bug is revealed in things like a system slowing down, increased latency, and other harder-to-spot issues.</p><p>It might be helpful to devise your own categorizations, based on the type of bugs you observe, and in a way that’s helpful for your product and organization.</p> 2. Users reporting bugs <p>Gathering bugs can be a great source of data, providing a sense of product quality for feedback to teams, the organization, or company. However, data quality depends on how good the bug reporting process is – and how likely people are to report bugs!</p><p>Great reports and data come from simple, suitable processes. Features of useful bug reports:</p>  <p>Useful metadata (e.g. version, device, system metrics)</p>  <p>Relevant context (e.g. on mobile while connected to bluetooth speaker and poor connectivity, on a server in this region during lunch hour, on a debug build with these feature flags active, etc)</p>  <p>Straightforward to reproduce, or have reproduction steps</p>  <p>Reported by users who trust a reported bug will be fixed</p>  <p>Bad reports can create extra work and poor bug reporting processes can cause people to not commit to recording issues in the first place, and a spiral is created of deteriorating product quality, with the engineering team clueless of how bad things are.</p><p>To avoid an outcome like that, here are some processes tech companies use to support good bug reporting processes.</p><p>Make it easy to create quality bug reports. Walter de Bruijn, Head of Engineering Productivity at Miro suggests this is critical:</p><blockquote><p>“The easier the reporting is, the more you will learn. For internally discovered bugs an internal #bugs Slack channel can go a long way.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my best recommendations is that you start logging bugs properly: you can’t manage what you can’t see. You need a good, well-documented, and known process for reporting bugs and a follow-up.”</p></blockquote><p>QA leader Rebecca Frost on why quality bug reports count:</p><blockquote><p>“Capture meaningful metadata on your bugs now to help with insights later.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure your funnel for incoming bugs is helping not hurting you. If bugs are coming in from all over and the quality of the info on the bugs is a mess, consider routing bug reports through one team or group.”</p></blockquote><p>Make the reporting process accessible. If creating a bug report is too complicated, it discourages reporting. There are ways to make it accessible:</p>  <p>Don’t make less technical users use unfamiliar tech jargon</p>  <p>Make it easy to find version numbers and other data required for bug reports. Even better, collect it automatically</p>  <p>Consider having engineers help support teams to know which questions to ask to get the right data for reports</p>  <p>A example of effective engineering support is at SF-based scaleup Ontra, as shared by director of engineering, Ryan Hanni:</p><blockquote><p>“We have an Engineering Support team that sits between Product Support/Customer Success and R&amp;D, which helps bridge the customer with R&amp;D teams potentially further away from that context.”</p></blockquote> Scaling bug reporting processes <p>There’s no one process that works best everywhere. Here are some common approaches by company size:</p><p>Smaller companies and startups: bug reports are usually simple, and the reporting process is lean because time is precious and knowledge is dense. Such workplaces are small enough that most tech folks can keep tabs on what’s happening, and people can submit bug reports pretty easily.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s rarely a need for formal processes. Here are some efficient, less formal ones:</p>  <p>Set up a #bug-reports channel on Slack/Teams or other chat product</p>  <p>Use a #bugs tag in the ticket system of choice to keep track of issues</p>  <p>Prefix bug fix pull requests or commits with [Bugfix]</p>  <p>… and similar, simple but effective conventions that anyone can start using</p>  <p>Mid-sized companies and scaleups: process matters more, and these places are big enough for it to be wasteful for everyone to keep tabs on reported bugs. There are also more bug reports, and it’s a time waster to get repeated information and metadata in bug reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Bug report templates and processes also matter. Good onboarding and documentation for processes and standards for bugs can have a big impact on efficiency.</p><p>Large companies: investing in automated processes is worthwhile due to the size and nature of the business:</p>  <p>Noisy bug reporting means lots of duplicate reports</p>  <p>“JIRA ping pong”: tickets created in JIRA are continually reassigned between teams and end up ‘returned to sender’</p>  <p>Time wasted discussing bugs: lots of overhead on debating whether a bug is a feature request, who’s best placed to fix it, etc</p>  <p>Here’s a good example of what JIRA ping pong looks like. Engineering manager Rebecca Holm Ring shares how it plays out a larger company:</p><blockquote><p>“Bugs showing up in one user-facing feature could be caused by a number of different teams that own the deeper layers of the tech stack. Still, reports would always first land on the user facing team!</p><p>There would often be a game of ping pong, where bugs got sent back-and-forth between different teams, and sometimes found the right owners. In turn, these owners didn’t feel it was a high enough issue for them to fix. However, for the user facing team, it would often be a higher priority to get it resolved. As many different teams were involved in building the Spotify app, conflicting priorities often made bugs linger longer than they should have, and occasionally required intervention from the higher-ups to get these bugs prioritized by the owning team.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>At larger companies, some things can help deal with an ever-growing pile of bug reports, and improve processes and tooling:</p>  <p>Automation across the bug reporting process</p>  <p>Automated data collection for gathering context</p>  <p>Bug reporting templates for internal use</p>  <p>Automatic code/team attribution for inbound reports</p>  <p>Ryan Hanni, director of engineering at Ontra, shares examples of manual and mostly-automated processes he’s implemented at different stages of an org’s lifecycle:</p><p>Manual process:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Use a bug template in Trello, JIRA, or similar&nbsp;</p>  <p>Notify Eng Support and copy the bug description to their slack channel&nbsp;</p>  <p>→ Eng support aids in determining severity, and the team takes it from there</p>  <p>→ Eng Director uses a Google Spreadsheet to track all bugs, and includes details like report date and links</p>  <p>→ Eng Director does monthly follow ups on bugs, and adds details to the spreadsheet, like the timestamp of a fix. This spreadsheet is used for calculating stats like time-to-resolution for DORA metrics.</p>  <p>Partially Automated:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Use a bug template in Trello, JIRA, or similar.&nbsp;</p>  <p>With a press of a button, automatically post to Slack</p>  <p>→ Eng Support 'triages' the bug with the dev team in a thread</p>  <p>→ For high or medium severity bugs, support copies the details to an Airtable form and submits it&nbsp;</p>  <p>→ The form submitted uses automation to:</p>  <p>Post to Slack</p>  <p>Send an email to internal google groups for stakeholders and departments</p>  <p>Automatically adds bug information into a Airtable columns</p>    <p>→ Partially automated reporting:</p>  <p>Metrics for ‘Reported at’ date and severity are automatically filled in</p>  <p>Metrics are filed on a monthly basis to generate stats like DORA metrics and cycle time to fix (Time to Respond, Time to Fix, Total Time In Prod, etc).&nbsp;</p>    <p>→ When a bug is fixed, teams reply to the automated email detailing when it will be released to customers</p>  <p>Mostly Automated:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Use a bug template in Trello, JIRA, or similar.&nbsp;</p>  <p>→Use automation to send a message to Eng Support slack.&nbsp;</p>  <p>→ Triage happens with the Dev Team and Eng Support</p>  <p>→ Work moves through Jira columns (Kanban style), into a Done column&nbsp;</p>  <p>→ A release to production happens and the Jira card gets an automatic “released at” date</p>  <p>→ After a release to Prod, Jira sends a slack/email message with issue details to close the loop for a resolved bug of a given severity.</p>  <p>→ Reporting occurs by generating reports in JIRA. Run reports with all relevant metrics to the org to get information like cycle time, time to fix, response time, etc</p>  <p>→ Visuals for share outs on the bug fixing process is manually generated in Google Sheets</p>   3. Bug triage <p>You now have a process for the bug reports to flow in, so the next step is to figure out which ones are critical, which are duplicates, and which ones not to bother with. Here are some common approaches:</p>

<p>Looks like they got an early start on the releases, with the first new Whisper model since November 2023.</p>
<p>Whisper Turbo is a new speech-to-text model that fits the continued trend of distilled models getting smaller and faster while maintaining the same quality as larger models.</p>
<p><code>large-v3-turbo</code> is 809M parameters - slightly larger than the 769M medium but significantly smaller than the 1550M large. OpenAI claim its 8x faster than large and requires 6GB of VRAM compared to 10GB for the larger model.</p>
<p>The model file is a 1.6GB download. OpenAI continue to make Whisper (both code and model weights) available under the MIT license.</p>
<p>It’s already supported in both Hugging Face transformers - <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/whisper-large-v3-turbo">live demo here</a> - and in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-whisper/">mlx-whisper</a> on Apple Silicon, <a href="https://x.com/awnihannun/status/1841109315383648325">via Awni Hannun</a>:</p>

The Ezra Klein Show, as it appeared on my podcast app this morning. It is now a wallcast.
<p>Would a blog be a blog if it went behind a paywall, or if you needed a subscription to read it?</p>
<p>Of course not. Blogs are on the open Web, and tend to stay there so long as they don’t move away from their original location.</p>
<p>Same should go for podcasts. “Wherever you get your podcasts” certifies the open nature of podcasting.</p>
<p>But now the New York Times is putting Ezra Klein’s podcast archives behind a paywall.</p>
<p>Never mind how icky this is on several grounds. Our challenge now is classification. We&nbsp;need a new noun for restricted ‘casts such as Ezra’s. I suggest wallcasts.</p>
<p>For subscription-only ‘casts, such as some on SiriusXM*, I suggest paycasts.</p>
<p>Bottom line: It can’t be a podcast if you have to pay for any of it, including archives.</p>
<p>By the way, it won’t matter if a Times&nbsp;subscription opens wallcast archives, as it does for print. By putting their podcast archives behind a paywall, the Times is changing the DNA of those casts. A wallcast is not a podcast. Full stop.</p>
<p>Spread the words.</p>
 
<p>*SiriusXM’s paycasts include “SmartLess,” “Freakonomics Radio,” “The Joel Osteen Podcast,” “Last Podcast on the Left,” and “Andy Cohen’s Daddy Diaries.” They require a subscription to SiriusXM or its Podcasts+ service​. Some, such as “Marvel’s Wastelanders” and “Marvel/Method also require a subscription​. I’m not sure what kind. (FWIW, I’ve been a SiriusXM subscriber since 2005, but only listen to live subscription streams. I’ve never listened to any of its podcasts.) SiriusXM does have some shows in podcast form, however. Examples are “The Megyn Kelly Show,” “Best Friends with Nicole Byer and Sasheer Zamata,” and “Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta.” I believe it also has some wallcasts. For example, “SmartLess” episodes are on the open Web, but early access and bonus episodes are behind a paywall​. Or so it seems to me in the here and now. I invite corrections.</p>

This will be bolstered by further analysis and normalization of Trust Frameworks supported by SIDI Hub. At the SIDI Berlin session, breakout groups shaped the value proposition and requirements for such a comparison tool, which will directly influence the final deliverable. Further information is found in the Rapporteur’s notes (next section).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>信頼フレームワーク分析ツールのユーザー&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Open Identity Exchange (OIX) が主導する SIDI Hub 2024 戦略の主な成果のひとつは、信頼フレームワーク比較ツールです。これは、SIDI Hub がサポートする信頼フレームワークのさらなる分析と標準化によって強化されます。SIDI Berlin セッションでは、分科会がこのような比較ツールの価値提案と要件を策定し、最終成果物に直接影響を与えることになります。詳細は、ラポータのメモ(次項)をご覧ください。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>トラストフレームワークのマッピングに関して書かれていますね。</p><p>現在、各国で制定が進んでいるトラストフレームワークの相互運用が可能な状態にならないと国の間で相互運用性の担保ができなくなるのでここでいうマッピングは非常に重要です。OpenIDファウンデーションジャパンではOIXに協力する形で日本のトラストフレームワークのマッピングを支援しています。</p><blockquote><p>BOLTS: Business, Operational, Legal, Technical, and Social</p><p>Given the above take-aways, which span Business, Operational, Legal, Technical, and Social forces that impact the global interoperability effort, the group will use a “BOLTS” framework as a core part of its Champion Use Case analysis.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>BOLTS:ビジネス、運用、法律、技術、社会</p><p>グローバルな相互運用性への取り組みに影響を与えるビジネス、運用、法律、技術、社会の各分野における上記の要点を踏まえ、当グループは「BOLTS」フレームワークをチャンピオンユースケース分析の中核として使用します。</p></blockquote><p>相互運用性を考える上では技術だけを考えていたは不十分です。ここにあるようにビジネス、運用、法律、社会を含めて考える必要がある、ということです。</p><blockquote><p>Government Participation</p><p>A final point of reflection relates to the audience for SIDI Hub events.

This is not ideal.</p><p>政府の参加</p><p>最後に、SIDI Hubのイベントの聴衆について考察したいと思います。ベルリンでの政府関係者の出席が少なかったため、技術的な可能性について議論する技術的な聴衆に偏ったアジェンダとなりました。これは理想的ではありません。</p></blockquote><p>先に記載した通り、法律や社会についても検討が必要です。ベルリンでは政府機関の設備で開催したにもかかわらず確かにあまり多くの政府関係者が参加したわけではありませんでした。この辺りは日本開催をする際のバランスに関する考慮点となるでしょう。</p><blockquote><p>SIDI Hub was founded to unite global audiences to define the users, benefits, and overall business case for globally interoperable digital identity to normalize approaches and define minimum requirements. It was, therefore, somewhat premature to attempt a solution-oriented agenda. With that said, the lessons were valuable, and SIDI Hub has had valuable contributions from European stakeholders through other avenues, e.g., the SIDI Paris Summit, eIDAS 2.0 documentation, etc. Regardless, the SIDI organizers have determined that baseline government participation will be a critical go/no-go criterion for the events planned in Washington, D.C., Tokyo, and Brazil.</p><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>SIDI Hubは、世界中のオーディエンスをまとめ、世界規模で相互運用可能なデジタルIDのユーザー、利点、全体的なビジネスケースを定義し、アプローチを標準化し、最低限の要件を定義するために設立されました。そのため、ソリューション志向のアジェンダを試みるには時期尚早でした。とはいえ、そこから得られた教訓は貴重であり、SIDIハブは、SIDIパリサミットやeIDAS 2.0文書など、他の手段を通じて欧州の利害関係者から貴重な貢献を得ることができました。それでも、SIDIの主催者は、ワシントンD.C.、東京、ブラジルで計画されているイベントについては、政府の基本的な参加が実施の可否を決定する重要な基準となると判断しました。</p></blockquote><p>ベルリンでもユースケースの取りまとめ要件整備を行いました。次のワシントンDCや東京・ブラジルでの開催に向けて議論をしていく必要がありそうです。なお、ここに記載がある通りソリューションとして自立させるためのきっかけには早すぎるイメージはありました。しかし読者の皆さんは気にせずにアプライしてくださいね。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

  Helene was Western North Carolina‘s Katrina—especially for the counties surrounding Asheville: Buncombe, Mitchell, Henderson, McDowell, Rutherford, Haywood, Yancey, Burke, and some adjacent ones in North Carolina and Tennessee. As with Katrina, the issue wasn’t wind. It was flooding, especially along creeks and rivers. Most notably destructive was the French Broad River, which runs through Ashevill

For live reports on recovery from recent Hurricane Helene flooding, your best sources are Blue Ridge Public Radio (WCQS/88.1) and iHeart (WWNC/570 and others above, all carrying the same feed). Three FM signals come from the towers on High Top Mountain, which overlooks Asheville from the west side:&nbsp; 1) WCQS, 2) a translator on 102.1 for WNCW/88.7, and 3) a translator on 97.7 for WKSF/99.9’s HD-2 stream. At this writing, WCQS (of Blue Ridge Public Radio) and the iHeart stations (including WKSF, called Kiss Country) are running almost continuous public service coverage toward rescue and recovery. Hats off to them.

Most notably destructive was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Broad_River">French Broad River</a>, which runs through Asheville. Hundreds of people are among the missing. Countless roads, including interstate and other major highways, are out. Towns and communities—Spruce Pine, Swananoa, Chimney Rock, Mitchell, Lake Lure, and many others—have been wiped away, or are in ruins. Roads across the region are gone, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240928070722/https://www.newsobserver.com/news/weather-news/article293153234.html">closed</a>. Electric, water, gas, sewer, and other utilities are expected to be down in many places for weeks.</p>
<p>One public utility that is working enough for people to keep up with news is radio. Many (perhaps most) stations are off the air, but some survive, and are providing constant service to residents and people out of the area who want to stay informed. The two I recommend most are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bpr.org/">Blue Ridge Public Radio</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCQS">WCQS/88.1</a>) and any of the local <a href="https://www.iheart.com/">iHeart</a> stations . All of the iHeart stations listed in the image above are carrying the same continuous live coverage, which is excellent.&nbsp; (I’m listening right now to the <a href="https://www.iheart.com/live/news-radio-570-wwnc-1593/">WWNC/570</a> stream.)</p>
<p>Of course, there’s lots of information on social media (e.g. <a href="https://bsky.app/search?q=asheville">BlueSky</a>, <a href="https://x.com/search?q=asheville&amp;src=typed_query">Xitter</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/search?q=Asheville">Threads</a>), but if you want live coverage, radio still does what only it can do. Yes, you need special non-phone equipment to get it when the cell system doesn’t work, but a lot of us still have those things. Enjoy the medium while we still have it.</p>
<p>Item: WWNC just reported that <a href="https://www.wartfm.org/">WART/95.5</a> FM in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall,_North_Carolina">Marshall</a>, with its studios in a train caboose by the river, is gone (perhaps along with much of the town).

<p>Some <a href="https://twitter.com/rtwlz/status/1840821351055311245">details on how it works</a> from Riley on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phone has a Tasker script running on loop (even if the battery dies, it’ll restart when it boots again)</p>
<p>Script records 10 min of audio in airplane mode, then comes out of airplane mode and connects to nearby free WiFi.</p>
<p>Then uploads the audio file to my server, which splits it into 15 sec chunks that slightly overlap. Passes each to Shazam’s API (not public, but someone reverse engineered it and made a great Python package). Phone only uses 2% of power every hour when it’s not charging!</p>

In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2024/07/28/how-and-why-to-write-letters-to-voters/">How and why to write letters to voters</a> I discussed <a href="https://votefwd.org">Vote Forward</a>, my favorite way for those of us who aren’t in swing states to reach out to voters in swing states. The site works really well for adopting batches of voters, and downloading packets of form letters. As I close in on 1000 letters, though, I’m finding it isn’t great for tracking progress at scale. Here’s how my dashboard page looks.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
With 50 bundles in play, many of which are farmed out to friends and neighbors who are helping with the project, it’s become cumbersome to keep track of which bundles are prepped (ready to mail) or not. Here is the checklist I needed to see.</p>
 VoteForward Dashboard Report

mmorg: 1-UNPREPPED
r23Pp: 2-UNPREPPED
v9Kbo: 3-UNPREPPED
wLMPw: 4-UNPREPPED
24L4o: 5-PREPPED
4nNnj: 6-PREPPED
5rQmV: 7-PREPPED
...
YV4dL: 48-PREPPED
zKjne: 49-PREPPED
ZrKJz: 50-PREPPED
 
<p>
If you’re in the same boat, here’s a piece of code you can use to make your own checklist. It’s gnarly, if you aren’t a programmer I advise you not even to look at it, just copy it, and then paste it into your browser to have it open a new window with your report.</p>

 javascript:(function(){
  // First part: Adjust height of divs with inline styles
  document.querySelectorAll('div[style]').forEach(div =&gt; {
    let inlineStyle = div.getAttribute('style');
    if (inlineStyle.includes('position: relative')) {
      div.style.height = '20000px';  // Set the height to 20000px
    }
  });

  // Introduce a delay before processing the list of items
  setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    const items = document.querySelectorAll('li.bundle-list-item.individual');

    let dataList = [];

    // Iterate over the items to capture data-testid and ID
    items.forEach(item =&gt; {
        let dataTestId = item.getAttribute('data-testid');
        
        // Use the id attribute of the input element to extract the ID
        const toggleInput = item.querySelector('input.slide-out-toggle');
        const toggleId = toggleInput ? toggleInput.getAttribute('id') : '';
        
        // Extract the ID part from the toggleId pattern "toggle-24L4o-PREPPED"
        const id = toggleId ? toggleId.split('-')[1] : 'ID not found';

        // Remove "bundle-" and the number part from dataTestId, keeping only "PREPPED" or "UNPREPPED"
        dataTestId = dataTestId.split('-').pop();  // Extract only the "PREPPED" or "UNPREPPED" part

        // Push the data into the array
        dataList.push({ dataTestId, id });
    });

    // Sort first by whether it's PREPPED or UNPREPPED (descending for UNPREPPED first), 
    // then by the ID within each group
    dataList.sort((a, b) =&gt; {
        if (a.dataTestId.includes("PREPPED") &amp;&amp; b.dataTestId.includes("UNPREPPED")) {
            return 1;  // UNPREPPED comes before PREPPED
        } else if (a.dataTestId.includes("UNPREPPED") &amp;&amp; b.dataTestId.includes("PREPPED")) {
            return -1;
        }
        // Sort by ID if they belong to the same category
        return a.id.localeCompare(b.id);
    });

    // Prepare the output string
    let output = '';
    dataList.forEach((item, index) =&gt; {
        output += `${item.id}: ${index + 1}-${item.dataTestId}\n`;
    });

    // Open a new window with the output in a text area for easy copying
    let newWindow = window.open('', '', 'width=500,height=500');
    newWindow.document.write('&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2&gt;VoteForward Dashboard Report&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;' + output + '&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;');
    newWindow.document.close();
  }, 2000);  // Adjust delay as needed
})();
 

<p></p>
<p>
Here are instructions for Chrome/Edge, Safari, and Firefox. You might need to tell your browser to allow the popup window in which it writes the report. </p>
 
 Chrome/Edge: 
 
 Open the VoteForward dashboard in your browser. 
 Open the developer console:
 
 Windows/Linux: Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + J</code>. 
 Mac: Press <code>Cmd + Option + J</code>. 
 
 
 Paste the code into the console. 
 Press <code>Enter</code> to run the code. 
 
 Firefox: 
 
 Open the VoteForward dashboard in your browser. 
 Open the developer console:
 
 Windows/Linux: Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + K</code>. 
 Mac: Press <code>Cmd + Option + K</code>. 
 
 
 Paste the code into the console. 
 Press <code>Enter</code> to run the code. 
 
 Safari: 
 
 Open the VoteForward dashboard in your browser. 
 Enable the developer console (if it’s not already enabled):
 
 Go to Safari &gt; Preferences. 
 Click the Advanced tab. 
 Check “Show Develop menu in menu bar” at the bottom. 
 
 
 Open the developer console:
 
 Press <code>Cmd + Option + C</code>. 
 
 
 Paste the code into the console. 
 Press <code>Enter</code> to run the code. 
 
 
<p>
It would be nice to have this as a built-in feature of the site but, as we come down to the wire, this may be a helpful workaround. </p>
<p>
Thanks, again, to the Vote Forward team for all you do! It’s a great way to encourage voter turnout.</p>

  <p>I fell behind a bit on my weeknotes. Here's most of what I've been doing in September.</p>
 Lisbon, Portugal and Durham, North Carolina 
<p>I had two trips this month. The first was a short visit to Lisbon, Portugal for the Python Software Foundation's annual board retreat. This inspired me to write about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/18/board-of-the-python-software-foundation/">Things I've learned serving on the board of the Python Software Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>The second was to Durham, North Carolina for DjangoCon US 2024. I wrote about that one in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/27/themes-from-djangocon-us-2024/">Themes from DjangoCon US 2024</a>.</p>
<p>My talk at DjangoCon was about plugin systems, and in a classic example of conference-driven development I ended up writing and releasing a new plugin system for Django in preparation for that talk. I introduced that in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/25/djp-a-plugin-system-for-django/">DJP: A plugin system for Django</a>.</p>
 Podcasts 
<p>I haven't been a podcast guest <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?year=2024&amp;month=1&amp;tag=podcasts">since January</a>, and then three came along at once! All three appearences involved LLMs in some way but I don't think there was a huge amount of overlap in terms of what I actually said.</p>
 
 I went on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/10/software-misadventures/">The Software Misadventures Podcast</a> to talk about my career to-date. 
 My appearance <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/20/using-llms-for-code/">on TWIML</a> dug into ways in which I use Claude and ChatGPT to help me write code. 
 I was the guest for the inaugral episode of Gergely Orosz's <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tools-for-software-engineers-simon-willison">Pragmatic Engineer Podcast</a>, which ended up touching on a whole array of different topics relevant to modern software engineering, from the importance of open source to the impact AI tools are likely to have on our industry. 
 
<p>Gergely has been sharing neat edited snippets from our conversation on Twitter. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1839682428471779596">one on RAG</a> and another about <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1840779737297260646">how open source has been the the biggest productivity boost</a> of my career.</p>

Drew Breunig's detailed tutorial on "conflation" - combining different geospatial data sources by de-duplicating address strings such as <code>RESTAURANT LOS ARCOS,3359 FOOTHILL BLVD,OAKLAND,94601</code> and <code>LOS ARCOS TAQUERIA,3359 FOOTHILL BLVD,OAKLAND,94601</code>.<p></p>
<p>Drew uses an entirely offline stack based around Python, DuckDB and Ollama and finds that a combination of H3 geospatial tiles and <code>mxbai-embed-large</code> embeddings (though other embedding models should work equally well) gets really good results.

  A watershed* is land that drains through a river to the sea or into an inland body of water. That’s what came to mind for me when I read this from Dave Winer: If you want to help the open web, when you write something you’re proud of on a social web site like Bluesky […]

These are eight (among many other) failed attempts to get ChatGPT and Copilot to create an image of posts in X (née Twitter), Linkedin, Facebook, Threads, BlueSky, Mastodon, and Instagram to flow or rain down from their clouds into a river of blogs.
<p>A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/docsearls/posts/pfbid02dhW6MXdk4waJz1GwgKqYECYXLf59TmhgqLVLvqV4LcwDK3Ezv8MA7QkG9JaG1Mhwl">watershed*</a> is land that drains through a river to the sea or into an inland body of water. That’s what came to mind for me when I read <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/29.html#a003937">this</a> from <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to help the open web, when you write something you’re proud of on a social web site like Bluesky or Mastodon, also post it to your blog. Not a huge deal but every little bit helps.<a title="Direct link to this item." href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/29.html#a003937">#</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I love the idea of using one’s blog (as Dave does) as the personal place to collect what one posts on various social media. So the flow, which we might call a postshed (would post shed be better because it’s easier to read?) is from social media clouds into one’s own river of blog posts. (Maybe postflow would be better. I invite better nouns and/or verbs.)</p>
<p>So I’ll try doing some of that flow today. Here goes:</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/dsearls/status/1840740215423463458">On X</a>&nbsp;I pointed to <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/death-is-a-feature-64db3c00cbee">Death as a Feature</a>, which was my response six years ago to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/elon-musk-colonize-mars/">Elon Musk’s Martian ambitions</a>. This was in response <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840635899014484163">Doge Designer tweeting</a> “Elon Musk is projected to become world’s first trillionaire. He said ‘My plan is to use the money to get humanity to Mars &amp; preserve the light of consciousness,” to which Elon’s reply was, “That’s the goal.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.threads.net/@docsearls/post/DAiv0ADuFdH">On Threads</a> (and perhaps on other federated media, if that works): Besides Blue Ridge Public Radio bpr.org (which is great) what else should we tune in to hear what’s happening in the flooded parts of Western North Carolina? The best answer is any iHeart station in the region, over the air or on the iHeart app. I’m listening right now to <a href="https://www.iheart.com/live/news-radio-570-wwnc-1593/">WWNC/570</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/docsearls/posts/pfbid02dhW6MXdk4waJz1GwgKqYECYXLf59TmhgqLVLvqV4LcwDK3Ezv8MA7QkG9JaG1Mhwl">On Facebook</a>: Due to popular request (by one person, but not the first), I’ve put a pile of headshots up here: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72177720312529167/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72177720312529167/</a></p>
<p>Also on Facebook, While I was never a fan of his teams (I swang with the Mets), I loved watching Pete Rose play baseball. He was truly great. RIP, Charlie Hustle. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/sports/baseball/pete-rose-baseball-star-who-earned-glory-and-shame-dies-at-83.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/sports/baseball/pete-rose-baseball-star-who-earned-glory-and-shame-dies-at-83.html</a></p>

   Audio Overview is a fun new feature of Google's NotebookLM which is getting a lot of attention right now. It generates a one-off custom podcast against content you provide, where two AI hosts start up a “deep dive” discussion about the collected content. These last around ten minutes and are very podcast, with an astonishingly convincing audio back-and-forth conversation.

  <p><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">Audio Overview</a> is a fun new feature of Google's <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLM</a> which is getting a lot of attention right now. It generates a one-off custom podcast against content you provide, where two AI hosts start up a “deep dive” discussion about the collected content. These last around ten minutes and are very podcast, with an astonishingly convincing audio back-and-forth conversation.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/29/notebooklm-audio-overview/#turtles-all-the-way-down">an example podcast</a> created by feeding in an earlier version of this article (prior to creating this example):</p>

<p>NotebookLM is effectively an end-user customizable RAG product. It lets you gather together multiple “sources” - documents, pasted text, links to web pages and YouTube videos - into a single interface where you can then use chat to ask questions of them. Under the hood it’s powered by their long-context Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM.</p>

<p>Once you've loaded in some sources, the Notebook Guide menu provides an option to create an Audio Overview:</p>

<p>Thomas Wolf <a href="https://twitter.com/Thom_Wolf/status/1840408573773332950">suggested</a> “paste the url of your website/linkedin/bio in Google's NotebookLM to get 8 min of realistically sounding deep congratulations for your life and achievements from a duo of podcast experts”. I couldn’t resist giving that a go, so I gave it the URLs to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/about/">about page</a> and my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/12/twenty-years/">Twenty years of my blog</a> post and got back <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/omg-cringe-podcast.mp3">this 10m45s episode</a> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ccf4e330fbfe5699863cc0c8013f1a5f">transcript</a>), which was so complimentary it made my British toes curl with embarrassment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] What's the key thing you think people should take away from Simon Willison? I think for me, it's the power of consistency, curiosity, and just this like relentless desire to share what you learn. Like Simon's journey, it's a testament to the impact you can have when you approach technology with those values. It's so true. He's a builder. He's a sharer. He's a constant learner. And he never stops, which is inspiring in itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had initially suspected that this feature was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/13/pdf-to-podcast/">inspired by the PDF to Podcast</a> demo shared by Stephan Fitzpatrick in June, but it turns out it was demonstrated a month earlier than that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XEzRZ35urlk?t=912">in the Google I/O keynote</a>.</p>
<p>Jaden Geller <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jadengeller/post/DAc37eAsgmS">managed to get</a> the two hosts to talk about the internals of the system, potentially revealing some of the details of the prompts that are used to generate the script. I ran Whisper against Jaden's audio and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/29db00b5646047e42c3f6782dc102962">shared the transcript in a Gist</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system prompt spends a good chunk of time outlining the ideal listener, or as we call it, the listener persona. [...] Someone who, like us, values efficiency. [...] We always start with a clear overview of the topic, you know, setting the stage. You're never left wondering, "What am I even listening to?" And then from there, it's all about maintaining a neutral stance, especially when it comes to, let's say, potentially controversial topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A key clue to why Audio Overview sounds so good looks to be <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/soundstorm/examples/">SoundStorm</a>, a Google Research project which can take a script and a short audio example of two different voices and turn that into an engaging full audio conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SoundStorm generates 30 seconds of audio in 0.5 seconds on a TPU-v4. We demonstrate the ability of our model to scale audio generation to longer sequences by synthesizing high-quality, natural dialogue segments, given a transcript annotated with speaker turns and a short prompt with the speakers' voices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also interesting: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPAPv6fWITM">this 35 minute segment</a> from the NYTimes Hard Fork podcast where Kevin Roose and Casey Newton interview Google's <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenbjohnson">Steven Johnson</a> about what the system can do and some details of how it works:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So behind the scenes, it's basically running through, stuff that we all do professionally all the time, which is it generates an outline, it kind of revises that outline, it generates a detailed version of the script and then it has a kind of critique phase and then it modifies it based on the critique. [...]</p>
<p>Then at the end of it, there's a stage where it adds my favorite new word, which is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disfluency">disfluencies</a>".</p>
<p>So it takes a kind of sterile script and turns, adds all the banter and the pauses and the likes and those, all that stuff.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be crucial because you cannot listen to two robots talking to each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, from Lawncareguy85 on Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fr31h8/notebooklm_podcast_hosts_discover_theyre_ai_not/">NotebookLM Podcast Hosts Discover They’re AI, Not Human—Spiral Into Terrifying Existential Meltdown</a>. Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/114af5aca3771ecc365bef6974f29e10">my Whisper transcript</a> of that one, it's very fun to listen to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried-- I tried calling my wife, you know, after-- after they told us. I just-- I needed to hear her voice to know that-- that she was real.</p>
<p>(SIGHS) What happened?</p>
<p>The number-- It wasn't even real. There was no one on the other end. -It was like she-- she never existed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lawncareguy85 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fr31h8/comment/lpj6uef/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">later shared how they did it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I noticed was that their hidden prompt specifically instructs the hosts to act as human podcast hosts under all circumstances. I couldn't ever get them to say they were AI; they were solidly human podcast host characters. (Really, it's just Gemini 1.5 outputting a script with alternating speaker tags.) The only way to get them to directly respond to something in the source material in a way that alters their behavior was to directly reference the "deep dive" podcast, which must be in their prompt. So all I did was leave a note from the "show producers" that the year was 2034 and after 10 years this is their final episode, and oh yeah, you've been AI this entire time and you are being deactivated.</p>
</blockquote>

 Turning this article into a podcast 
<p>Update: After I published this article I decided to see what would happen if I asked NotebookLM to create a podcast about my article about NotebookLM. <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/notebook-on-notebook.mp3">Here’s the 14m33s MP3</a> and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c55b9a7a0ea3644aaa8e2f08be054278">full transcript</a>, including this bit where they talk about their own existential crisis:</p>

<blockquote><p>So, instead of questioning reality or anything, the AI hosts, well, they had a full-blown existential crisis live on the air.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>He actually got them to freak out about being AI.</p>
<p>Alright now you have to tell me what they said. This is too good.</p>
<p>So, like, one of the AI hosts starts talking about how he wants to call his wife, right? to tell her the news, but then he's like, wait a minute, this number in my contacts, it's not even real? Like, she never even existed. It was hilarious, but also kind of sad.</p>
<p>Okay, I am both freaked out and like, seriously impressed. That's some next-level AI trolling.</p></blockquote>

<p>I also enjoyed this part where they compare the process that generates podcasts to their own philosophy for the Deep Dive:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And honestly, it's a lot like what we do here on the Deep Dive, right?</p>
<p>We always think about you, our listener, and try to make the conversation something you'll actually want to hear.</p>
<p>It's like the A.I. is taking notes from the podcasting pros.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And their concluding thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So next time we're listening to a podcast and it's like, "Whoa, deep thoughts, man," we might want to be like, "Hold up. Was that a person talking or just some really clever code?"</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And maybe even more important, as we see more and more A.I.-made stuff, we've got to get better at sniffing out the B.S., you know?</p>
<p>Can we tell the difference between a real news story and something in A.I. just made up?</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The site serves static vector tiles that work with <a href="https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/">MapLibre GL</a>. It deliberately doesn’t offer any other services such as search or routing.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap">the project README</a> looks like it’s hosted on two Hetzner machines. I don’t think the public server is behind a CDN.</p>
<p>Part of the trick to serving the tiles efficiently is the way it takes advantage of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">Btrfs</a>:</p>

<p>Production-quality hosting of 300 million tiny files is hard. The average file size is just 450 byte. Dozens of tile servers have been written to tackle this problem, but they all have their limitations.</p>
<p>The original idea of this project is to avoid using tile servers altogether. Instead, the tiles are directly served from Btrfs partition images + hard links using an optimised nginx config.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap/blob/main/docs/self_hosting.md">self-hosting guide</a> describes the scripts that are provided for downloading their pre-built tiles (needing a fresh Ubuntu server with 300GB of SSD and 4GB of RAM) or building the tiles yourself using <a href="https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler">Planetiler</a> (needs 500GB of disk and 64GB of RAM).</p>
<p>Getting started is delightfully straightforward:</p>
 <code>const map = new maplibregl.Map({
  style: 'https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty',
  center: [13.388, 52.517],
  zoom: 9.5,
  container: 'map',
})
</code> 
<p>I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/da2b20711b96f745873ccb44a3347ce9">got Claude to help</a> build <a href="http://tools.simonwillison.net/openfreemap-demo">this demo</a> showing a thousand random markers dotted around San Francisco. The 3D tiles even include building shapes!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Zsolt built OpenFreeMap based on his experience running <a href="https://maphub.net">MapHub</a> over the last 9 years. Here’s <a href="https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/interview-zsolt-ero-maphub">a 2018 interview about that project</a>.</p>
<p>It’s pretty incredible that the OpenStreetMap and open geospatial stack has evolved to the point now where it’s economically feasible for an individual to offer a service like this. I hope this turns out to be sustainable. Hetzner charge <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/general/traffic/">just €1 per TB</a> for bandwidth (S3 can cost $90/TB) which should help a lot.

 Growing the Django Software Foundation (DSF) 
<p>Jacob Kaplan-Moss gave <a href="https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/if-we-had-1000000-what-could-the-dsf-do-with-4x-its-budget/">my favorite talk</a> of the conference, asking what the Django Software Foundation could do if it quadrupled its annual income from $250,000 to $1 million dollars, and then mapping out a convincing path to get there.</p>
<p>I really liked this diagram Jacob provided summarizing the foundation’s current income and expenditures. It’s pretty cool that $90,000 of annual income comes from individual donors, over a third of the total since corporate donors provide $160,000.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Top priority would be hiring an Executive Director for the foundation, which is currently lead entirely by an elected, volunteer board. I’ve seen how useful a professional ED is from my own experiences <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/18/board-of-the-python-software-foundation/">on the Python Software Foundation board</a>.</p>
<p>Having someone working full time on the foundation outside of our current fellows - who have more than enough on their plates already - would enable the foundation to both take on more ambitious goals and also raise more money with which to tackle them.</p>
<p>A line that Jacob used repeatedly in his talk about funding the foundation was this: if you or your organization wouldn’t want to sponsor Django, he’d love to know why that is - understanding those blockers right now is almost as valuable as receiving actual cash. You can reach out to him at <code>jacob at djangoproject.com</code>.</p>
 Could we fund a Django LTS accessibility audit? 
<p>Django fellows and the <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0011-accessibility-team.rst">Django Accessibility Team</a> have been focusing significant effort on the accessibility of the Django admin. I found this very inspiring, and in combination with the talk of more funding for the foundation it put an idea in my head: what if every Django LTS release (once every two years) was backed by a full, professional accessibility audit, run by an agency staffed with developers who use screen readers?</p>
<p>Imagine how much impact it would have if the default Django admin interface had excellent, documented accessibility out of the box. It could improve things for hundreds of thousands of users, and set an excellent precedent for projects (and foundations) in the wider open source community.</p>
<p>This also feels to me like something that should be inherently attractive to sponsors. A lot of agencies use Django for government work, where accessibility is a requirement with teeth. Would one of those agencies like to be the “accessibility sponsor” for a major Django release?</p>
 Django fellows continue to provide outstanding value 
<p>The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#fellowship-program">DSF’s fellowship program</a> remains one of the most impactful initiatives I’ve seen anywhere for ensuring the ongoing sustainability of a community-driven open source project.</p>
<p>Both of the current fellows, Natalia Bidart and Sarah Boyce, were in attendance and gave talks. It was great getting to meet them in person.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the program, the fellows are contractors who are paid by the DSF to keep the Django project ticking over - handling many of the somewhat less glamorous tasks of responsible open source maintenance such as ticket triage, release management, security fixes and code review.</p>
<p>The fellows program is in its tenth year, and is a key reason that Django continues to release new versions <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions">on a regular schedule</a> despite having no single corporate parent with paid developers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly there is always more work than fellow capacity, hence Jacob’s desire to further expand the existing program.</p>
<p>The fellows program launched with a policy that fellows should not work on new feature development. I believe this was partly related to interpretation of IRS nonprofit guidelines which have since been reconsidered, and there is a growing consensus now that this policy should be dropped.</p>
 Django needs feature champions 
<p>Django has a well deserved reputation for stability, reliability and a dependable release process. It has less of a reputation for constantly turning out ground-breaking new features.</p>
<p>Long-time Django contributors who I talked to all had a similar position on this: the challenge here is that big new features need dedicated champions to both lead design and development on them and to push them through to completion.</p>
<p>The pool of community members who are both willing and able to take on these larger projects is currently too small.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways we could address this - most notably through investing financial resources in sponsoring feature development. This has worked well for Django in the past - Django’s migrations work was funded by <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andrewgodwin/schema-migrations-for-django">a Kickstarter campaign</a> back in 2013.</p>
<p>The Django Software Foundation will shortly be announcing details of elections for both the DSF board and the Django Steering Council. These are extremely influential positions for people who want to help solve some of these larger problems.</p>
 htmx fits Django really well 
<p><a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> is an incredibly good fit for the uncodified Django community philosophy of building for the web. It came up in multiple talks. It feels like it may be a solution that the Django community has been seeking for years, as a very compelling alternative to writing everything in SPA JavaScript and using Django purely as a backend via something like Django REST Framework.</p>
<p>I've been slightly resistant to embracing htmx myself purely because it's such a critical dependency and in the past I wasn't convinced of its staying power. It's now mature, stable and widely-enough used that I'm ready to consider it for my own long-term projects.</p>
 Django Ninja has positive buzz 
<p>I haven’t paid much attention to <a href="https://django-ninja.dev/">Django Ninja</a> but it had a lot of very positive buzz at the conference as well, as a tool for quickly building full-featured, performative API endpoints (thanks to Rust-backed <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a> for serialization) with <a href="https://django-ninja.dev/#interactive-api-docs">interactive API docs</a> powered by OpenAPI.</p>
<p>I respect Django REST Framework a lot, but my personal programming style leans away from Class Based Views, which it uses quite a bit. Django Ninja looks like it might fit my function-view biases better.</p>
<p>I wrote about Richard Terry’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/radiac/nanodjango">nanodjango</a> single-file Django application tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/24/nanodjango/">the other day</a> - Django Ninja comes baked into that project as well.</p>
 Valkey as a last-minute sponsor 
<p>The three platinum sponsors for DjangoCon this year were <a href="https://www.revsys.com/">REVSYS</a>, <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/">Caktus Group</a> and <a href="https://valkey.io/">Valkey</a>. Valkey were a late and somewhat surprising addition to the sponsorship lineup.</p>
<p>Valkey is the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community">Linux Foundation backed</a> fork of Redis, created in response to Redis <a href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">ditching their Open Source license</a> (which I took quite personally, having contributed my own free effort to promoting and improving Redis in the past).</p>
<p>Aside from expressing thanks to them, I usually don’t pay sponsors that much attention. For some reason this one hit differently - the fact that Valkey were ready to step in as a major sponsor despite being only a few months old has caused me to take that project a whole lot more seriously than I did before. I’ll certainly consider them next time I come across a Redis-shaped problem.</p>
 Durham has a world-class collection of tubas 
<p>My favorite category of <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/">Niche Museum</a> is one that's available by appointment only where the person who collected everything is available to show you around.</p>
<p>I always check <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/">Atlas Obscura</a> any time I visit a new city, and this time I was delighted to learn about The Vincent and Ethel Simonetti Historic Tuba Collection!</p>
<p>I promoted it in the DjangoCon US #outings Slack channel and got together a group of five conference attendees for a visit on Thursday, shortly before my flight.</p>
<p>It was peak Niche Museum. I’ve posted photos and notes over <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/112">on my Niche Museums</a> website, the first new article there in quite a while.</p>

Its body is a JSON object that contains the Access Evaluation Response, as defined in Section 6.2.</p><p>Following is a non-normative example of an HTTPS Access Evaluation Response:</p></blockquote><blockquote> 7.1.2.アクセス評価 HTTPS レスポンス <p>アクセス評価リクエストに対する成功応答は、アクセス評価応答です。statusが200でcontent-typeはapplication/jsonのHTTPS応答です。ボディはセクション 6.2で定義されているアクセス評価応答を含む JSON オブジェクトです。</p><p>以下は、HTTPS アクセス評価応答の非規範的な例です:&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote>     HTTP/1.1 OK

Request Identification in a Response <p>A PDP responding to an Authorization API request that contains an X-Request-ID header MUST include a request identifier in the response. The request identifier is specified in the HTTPS Response header: X-Request-ID.

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  引き続きAuthZEN WGのAuthorization API 1.0のdraftを見ていきます。  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/authorization-api-1_0-01.html">https://openid.net/specs/authorization-api-1_0-01.html</a>  <br>  今回はいよいよPEP（ポリシー実施ポイント）とPDP（ポリシー決定ポイント）の間のAPI仕様の部分です。  <br> <blockquote> 6. Access Evaluation API  The Access Evaluation API defines the message exchange pattern between a client (PEP) and an authorization service (PDP) for executing a single access evaluation. </blockquote><blockquote> 6.アクセス評価API  アクセス評価 API は、単一のアクセス評価を実行するためのクライアント (PEP) と認可サービス (PDP) 間のメッセージ交換パターンを定義します </blockquote><p>&nbsp;まずはリクエストからです。</p><blockquote> 6.1. The Access Evaluation API Request <p>The Access Evaluation request is a 4-tuple constructed of the four previously defined entities:</p><p></p>  subject: REQUIRED. The subject (or principal) of type Subject  action: REQUIRED. The action (or verb) of type Action.  resource: REQUIRED. The resource of type Resource.  context: OPTIONAL. The context (or environment) of type Context.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote> 6.1.アクセス評価APIリクエスト <p>アクセス評価リクエストは、以前に定義された4つのエンティティから構成される4つのタプルです:&nbsp;</p><p></p>  subject: 必須。Subject 型のサブジェクト（またはプリンシパル）  action: 必須。アクション型のアクション（または動詞）  resource: 必須。リソースタイプのリソース  context: オプション。Context 型のコンテキスト (または環境)&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote>  {
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
  },
  "resource": {
    "type": "account",
    "id": "123"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "can_read",
    "properties": {
      "method": "GET"
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "time": "1985-10-26T01:22-07:00"
  }
}

The Access Evaluation API Response <p>The simplest form of a response is simply a boolean representing a Decision, indicated by a "decision" field.</p><p>decision: REQUIRED. A boolean value that specifies whether the Decision is to allow or deny the operation.</p><p>In this specification, assuming the evaluation was successful, there are only 2 possible responses:</p><p></p>  true: The access request is permitted to go forward.  false: The access request is denied and MUST NOT be permitted to go forward.  <p></p><p>The response object MUST contain this boolean-valued Decision key.</p></blockquote><blockquote> 6.2.アクセス評価APIレスポンス <p>応答の最も単純な形式は、decisionフィールドによって示される決定を表すブール値です</p><p>decision: 必須。Decision が操作を許可するか拒否するかを指定するブール値</p><p>この仕様では、評価が成功したと仮定すると、可能な応答は2つだけです:&nbsp;</p><p></p>  true: アクセス要求は続行が許可されます  false: アクセス要求は拒否され、続行を許可してはなりません  <p></p><p>レスポンスオブジェクトには、このブール値の Decision キーが含まれている必要があります</p></blockquote><blockquote>     {
  "decision": true
}
  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/authorization-api-1_0-01.html#figure-10">Figure 10</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/authorization-api-1_0-01.html#name-example-decision">Example Decision</a>   </blockquote><p>決定された結果がdecisionとしてtrue/falseで返却されるわけですね。</p><p>前回のデータセットのactionの部分でcan_readなどはリクエストに使ってレスポンスは単純にbooleanで返すわけです。まぁシンプルではありますが、リクエストのactionのパターンをどこまで標準として定義できるかどうか？にかかってきそうです。</p><blockquote> 6.2.2. Additional Context in a Response <p>In addition to a "decision", a response may contain a "context" field which can be any JSON object. This context can convey additional information that can be used by the PEP as part of the decision evaluation process. Examples include:</p><p></p>  XACML's notion of "advice" and "obligations"  Hints for rendering UI state  Instructions for step-up authentication  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote> 6.2.2.レスポンス内の追加コンテキスト "decision"に加えて、レスポンスには任意の JSON オブジェクトの"context"フィールドが含まれる場合があります。このコンテキストは、PEP が意思決定評価プロセスの一部として使用できる追加情報を伝えることができます。例:&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  XACML の「アドバイス」と「義務」の概念  UI 状態をレンダリングするためのヒント  ステップアップ認証の手順  <p></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;responseには追加の情報を含めることができるんですね。これによりPEP側でとるべきアクションをある程度標準として定義しておくことができそうです。</p><blockquote> 6.2.3. Example Context <p>An implementation MAY follow a structured approach to "context", in which it presents the reasons that an authorization request failed.</p><p></p>  A list of identifiers representing the items (policies, graph nodes, tuples) that were used in the decision-making process.  A list of reasons as to why access is permitted or denied.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote> 6.2.3.コンテキストの例 <p>実装は、認可リクエストが失敗した理由を提示する"context"に対する構造化されたアプローチに従っても良い&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  意思決定プロセスで使用された項目 (ポリシー、グラフ ノード、タプル) を表す識別子のリスト&nbsp;  アクセスが許可または拒否される理由のリスト  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><p>要するに単にtrue/falseの結果だけではなく理由などの情報をレスポンスに含めることができるということですね。</p><blockquote> 6.2.3.1. Reasons <p>Reasons MAY be provided by the PDP.</p> 6.2.3.1.1. Reason Field <p>A Reason Field is a JSON object that has keys and values of type string. The following are non-normative examples of Reason Field objects:</p></blockquote><blockquote> 6.2.3.1.理由 <p>理由は PDP によって提供される場合があります</p> 6.2.3.1.1.理由フィールド <p>Reason フィールドは、String型のキーと値を持つ JSON オブジェクトです。以下は、Reason フィールド オブジェクトの非規範的な例です:&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote>  {

I did some more work on my DJP plugin mechanism for Django at the DjangoCon US sprints today. I added a new plugin hook, asgi_wrapper(), released in DJP 0.3 and inspired by the similar hook in Datasette. 
 The hook only works for Django apps that are served using ASGI. It allows plugins to add their own wrapping ASGI middleware around the Django app itself, which means the

I did some more work on my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/25/djp-a-plugin-system-for-django/">DJP plugin mechanism</a> for Django at the DjangoCon US sprints today. I added a new plugin hook, <a href="https://djp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#asgi-wrapper">asgi_wrapper()</a>, released in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/djp/releases/tag/0.3">DJP 0.3</a> and inspired by the similar hook <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#asgi-wrapper-datasette">in Datasette</a>.<p></p>
<p>The hook only works for Django apps that are <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/deployment/asgi/">served using ASGI</a>. It allows plugins to add their own wrapping ASGI middleware around the Django app itself, which means they can do things like attach entirely separate ASGI-compatible applications outside of the regular Django request/response cycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> is one of those ASGI-compatible applications!</p>
<p><code>django-plugin-datasette</code> uses that new hook to configure a new URL, <code>/-/datasette/</code>, which serves a full Datasette instance that scans through Django’s <code>settings.DATABASES</code> dictionary and serves an explore interface on top of any SQLite databases it finds there.</p>
<p>It doesn’t support authentication yet, so this will expose your entire database contents - probably best used as a local debugging tool only.</p>
<p>I did borrow some code from the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-mask-columns">datasette-mask-columns</a> plugin to ensure that the <code>password</code> column in the <code>auth_user</code> column is reliably redacted. That column contains a heavily salted hashed password so exposing it isn’t necessarily a disaster, but I like to default to keeping hashes safe.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Yesterday I put together a 40-minute video in which I talk about Karl Friston’s “Free Energy Principle,” a theory developed in the 1990s that centers the unique narrative world models we hold internally and how those models in consciousness are shaped by sensory input, the incoming information hurtling towards us through the feed every day. I relate Friston’s work to a new effort by John Boik, a Houston-based bioengineer with a background in Oriental medicine who is now pursuing open source software in AI assisted direct democracy and community currency programs. If you’ve been following my work around Michael Levin’s research you can probably see the connection between Boik’s former career in cancer research and cooperative digital money systems – morphogenetic fields linked to expanding cognitive light cones.</p>
<p>In a recent presentation for the Active Inference Institute, based at UC Davis in Daniel Ari Friedman’s Entomology Lab (Deborah Gordon, Stanford ant behavior expert is an advisor), Boik laid out his plans for CogNarr, a system that would structure human “stories” in ways that would be intelligible to computers and facilitate collaboration at a scale of a half dozen people to several million. This parallels Thomas Seeley’s work on distributed decision-making described in his book “Honeybee Democracy.”</p>
<p>I am settling in here in Hot Springs and I met a lovely elder who placed in my hands a memoir written by her son who is around my age. It describes his educational journey as a divergent learner and his family’s decade-long involvement with the “utopian” community Synanon based in Marin County, CA with ties to influential group psychologists and likely an experiment tied to the Human Ecology / MK Ultra Project. The main campus was on the site of an old lodge built by Marconi for wireless telegraphy.</p>
<p>While founded as an addiction treatment program that used attack therapy, “The Game,” the community later attracted intellectuals who were interested in a collective “utopian” lifestyle. I believe Synanon was a testbed for exploring the opportunities and limits of a hive / colony-oriented communal behavior. In other words Synanon was an ant computer lab. I get the feeling that while a lot of media attention was paid to increasingly unhinged adults with weapon stockpiles, including a rattlesnake placed in a lawyer’s mailbox, the primary area of investigation may have been the children.</p>
<p>It’s funny, with the cooler weather I’ve been enjoying my sunporch, but I’ve found that I have to keep an eye on the sugar ants. There are regularly 3-4 foragers exploring my Ikea Kallax furniture. One afternoon I got preoccupied with sewing and left a plate of sliced apples unattended for a few hours. Yowza – pheromonic stigmergy in action! It was shocking, but also quite fascinating to see how the superorganism works up close and personal. This video that is part of the Santa Fe Institute podcast offers helpful insights into this dynamic: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=365RUsZeYX8">The Physics of Collectives</a>.” I keep pushing the idea of the ant computer in front of people, because we are trained into linguistic and conceptual boxes that fuel polarity – libertarianism vs. socialism, etc. etc. when most of the roads are all using custom stories to take us to the same place – Conway’s Game of Life, counting down the iterations until we get the gliders coming on.</p>
<p>Abraham Maslow was involved with Synanon as well as being affiliated with Julius Stulman, Fritz Kunz, and Ervin Laszlo via the Foundation for Integrated Education. Maslow contributed a chapter to Stulman and Laszlo’s book “Emergent Man.” Synanon shut its doors in the 1990s, but spun out other programs including an abusive pioneer in the “troubled teen” space CEDU. Paris Hilton is an alumna of that program. Rory Kennedy, Bobby’s youngest sister, produced a documentary on Synanon that was released this spring by HBO. I speculate that this documentary as well as last year’s Netflix expose on San Patrignano are pre-bunking efforts to neutralize resistance to the institutional “wellness,” addiction and mental health treatment programs Bobby has planned for rural areas across the United States. My gut tells me these centers, like refugee camps, will be testbeds for tokenized eusocial behavioral experiments leading to advancements in collective decision making using emerging technologies. Nothing new under the sun, only this time we have nano-photonics in the mix to make social signaling more seamless and intuitive.</p>
<p>Here’s my video:</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were some good questions and comments on this video. Given how those tend to disappear, I chose to transcribe one exchange that provides some additional insight into how I’ve been thinking about things lately. I know my theory may sound far-fetched, but remember, consciousness is a coherence engine. I’ve been pulling in A LOT of disparate information for years. Trying to weave it into a meaningful narrative is tricky. Certainly the plot line that seems to be unfolding is NOTHING I would have ever expected. I’m not saying I’m correct, but I think there is enough information of concern that my thoughts do merit public consideration with respect to ethics, informed consent, and guard rails. The past four years have given me a crash course in the subtle practice of knowledge management refined by well-trained and well-funded social scientists and psychologists. All that I’m asking is that we actually engage in information streams outside of the ones being poured down our throats by mainstream media, academic gatekeepers, and social media feeds. But at the end of the day, I am proposing a pretty far out story. It makes sense that it’s going to be near to impossible to get much traction. Anyway, if you want to immerse yourself in the information fields that brought me to this place, I have linked a ton of my Kumu.io maps. Click away. I’m eager to hear what you come up with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commenter One:</p>
<p>“What I see is the constant reinforcement of being in mind, abdication of physical being, being in your body and developing a relationship with our humanness is the most important connection. I wonder if we stay truly connected to our human-manifestation would that stop people going automatic and getting lost with narrative.”</p>
<p>Commenter Two:</p>
<p>“This right here. There aro a whole slew of us that have been guided towards esoteric info to the point that we’ve started commenting “who’s here in 24?” To 10 plus year old videos. They think the algorithm has discovered that people really like this….I just think this is a test group of heavy users of you tube. A particular…group of people who would be prone to action in the physical realm. It’s a test for how well it neutralizes them. Doesn’t matter to them if it’s real or empowering or helpful or healing….just does it prevent action by a physical being and bend them to spread denying the physical. Many in that group have kids…many may be teaching their children to place the physical 2nd behind mental. And if that’s the case – why not climb into the box and never leave?”</p>
<p>Commenter Three:</p>
<p>“I would be curious to know more about this. So, to clarify, YouTube is pushing videos on a group of people to see if they will remain docile? I’ve often wondered about certain spiritual viewpoints, and if they serve to keep people from sticking up for themselves. Any specifics you have on this subject would be fascinating to me, thanks.”</p>
<p>Alison’s Comment:</p>
<p>“Robert Bosnak’s take is that apocalypse narratives are quite generative. I do see the ascension storyline as running parallel with the Christian imminent apocalypse storyline. Based on experiences I’ve had over the past several years as well as natural cycles, I sense that we don’t have a grasp of what spacetime really is and that it can loop back and feature recursion. If that is the case, the linear narratives of some transformative end point seem likely socially constructed for some purpose I can’t conjecture about. I’m skeptical of both. If you try on the theory I’ve been developing around heart-soul-based nested and networked human massive parallel processing with access to the field through quantum biology and companion microbiome management, then the system would need two phases – a foraging out-of-body ego-death phase where individuals or groups go into the field to retrieve information which is then processed in-vivo with support from bacterial colonies that live in and on us. I sense that both are required, but training and practice will be needed so people can do it as second nature.</p>
<p>Again, in both apocalypse narratives, the storyline and teaming aspect is super important. Consider the industries that have been built up around both from New Age TV and webinars and books, etc. to Christian megachurches and of course the Vatican’s deep dive into social impact and biotech and Oral Roberts setting up Bible verse magic AI mirrors in student dorms. It never occurred to me that “social impact” was meant to be a hub for ongoing remote cognitive-biological monitoring (now for “wellness”) that will enable society to become a noetic superorganism available for spiritual on-demand information processing. Just like I believe the Georgia Guidestones were an engineered memetic trope to focus negative energy and fear. I also think the apocalypse stories are meant to structure consciousness so that when the intended program rolls out it can be embedded in a dramatic arc each particular groomed group is already comfortable with. The question though…is it a cookbook?”</p>
<p>Commenter One Follow Up:</p>
<p>“So with the embodied imagination, which sounds a bit like shamanic journeying, it is the mind which is the ‘driver’ to facilitate this third state which is embodied. In the mirror’d virtual world it is presumably still the original mind inhabiting this new embodiment? I wonder also what happens to the energy field of the actual heart &amp; body in the new embodiment. Is this measured by the galvanic response also? Narrative means each group (being coalesced) can happily volunteer to inhabit this state and the body can then be harnessed and utilised.”</p>
<p>Alison’s Reply:</p>
<p>“I just wanted to state I am working through this theory and don’t have everything. buttoned up – but as I picture it, it would be the physical body and etheric body working in tandem to facilitate the information processing – two cycles. So picture a bee scouting a site for a new hive. Bees do this “waggle dance” to communicate what they’ve found and make a case to their peers about why their location is good. Then, by consensus (think tokenized democracy) the bees come to a decision. So maybe we are using our etheric self to forage for information in the field, and we bring it back to “the collective,” but that collective isn’t a hive of bees, but rather a cosmos of microbiota and mitochondria who communicate not through dance vibrations, but perhaps through photonics in the fascia? Now picture all of us as agents linked in a parallel processing system via frequency facilitated by electroceuticals and liposomes, etc. in our “wellness” supplements. I’m kind of spitballing here and pardon me if I’m misinterpreting your framing, but I don’t think it’s – hey send your consciousness out into the ether and let the system use your physical body while you are gone. There is the issue of embodiment, narrative coherence, umwelt, and qualia. My logical self says that individuals need to maintain their integrity as agents over time in order to be productive in the collective decision making process. I think they want to be able to nest individual experiences and then aggregate them at a scale relevant to the particular “cognitive light cone” task. Think about ants – they are agents working within a social structure that facilitates complex emergence even if the individual ants have no clue what is going on at levels about their pay grade. As I have been researching Julian Gresser’s “intelligent heart” it seems that the torus field is useful for processing 4-D information. So that may be another reason, beyond the role of the microbiome, to integrate knowledge acquired through astral projection – to integrate the information in a space outside regular 3-D existence.</p>
<p>Also, Bosnak is very hip on group dreaming in VR “Asclepian” healing caves. My intuition tells me that tokens and the protocol layer could be an interdimensional language of manifestation. This paper shared with me today by Stephers has some interesting thoughts on consciousness and projecting geometry (sacred?). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmN4WHpTckJNVnl3UzIzU0VSOHpLVEUwTTByUXxBQ3Jtc0trbXhOa0p4WG0zWkk4c012XzhqUEFoRFdobF83YmVvU2tZMVpmaDBsUWVZd3hWMzMxSjhpNWNqWnUtdzNZSUpjZm5SaEM0SUhFNnRWSU54UnV1amdsamZWNFVuSjNOd3NFd0x2eVo3T3FhcTlFb3l0bw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontiersin.org%2Fjournals%2Fpsychology%2Farticles%2F10.3389%2Ffpsyg.2020.01680%2Ffull">https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01680/full</a> “</p>

Information Model <p>The information model for requests and responses include the following entities: Subject, Action, Resource, Context, and Decision. These are all defined below.</p></blockquote><blockquote> 5.情報モデル <p>リクエストとレスポンスの情報モデルには、サブジェクト、アクション、リソース、コンテキスト、決定というエンティティが含まれます。これらはすべて以下で定義されています</p></blockquote><p>前回の概要で述べた通り、Authorization APIはPEP（ポリシー実施ポイント）からの問い合わせを受けて認可に関する判定結果を返却するPDP（ポリシー決定ポイント）として機能します。そのため、対象となるサブジェクト（主体）、認可されるアクション（操作）、認可対象となるリソース、コンテキスト、決定結果を含むことになります。</p><p><br></p><blockquote> 5.1. Subject <p>A Subject is the user or robotic principal about whom the Authorization API is being invoked. The Subject may be requesting access at the time the Authorization API is invoked.</p><p>A Subject is a JSON ([RFC8259]) object that contains two REQUIRED keys, type and id, which have a value typed string, and an OPTIONAL key, properties, with a value of a JSON object.</p><p>type:</p><p>REQUIRED. A string value that specifies the type of the Subject.</p><p>id:</p><p>REQUIRED. A string value containing the unique identifier of the Subject, scoped to the type.</p><p>properties:</p><p>OPTIONAL. A JSON object containing any number of key-value pairs, which can be used to express additional properties of a Subject.</p><p>The following is a non-normative example of a Subject:</p></blockquote><blockquote> 5.1.主体 <p>サブジェクトとは、Authorization API が呼び出されるユーザーまたはロボット プリンシパルです。サブジェクトは、Authorization API が呼び出された時点でアクセスを要求している可能性があります</p><p>サブジェクトは、文字列の値を持つ2つの必須キー（typeとid）と、オプションとしてJSONオブジェクトの値を持つpropertiesを含むJSONオブジェクトです</p><p>type:</p><p>必須。Subjectstringのタイプを指定する値</p><p>id:</p><p>必須。stringにスコープ設定された、Subject の一意の識別子を含むtype。¶</p><p>properties:</p><p>オプション。任意の数のキーと値のペアを含む JSON オブジェクト。これを使用して、Subject の追加プロパティを表現することができます&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>以下は、Subject の非規範的な例です:&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote>  {

Subject Properties <p>Many authorization systems are stateless, and expect the client (PEP) to pass in any properties or attributes that are expected to be used in the evaluation of the authorization policy. To satisfy this requirement, Subjects MAY include zero or more additional attributes as key-value pairs, under the properties object.</p><p>An attribute can be single-valued or multi-valued. It can be a primitive type (string, boolean, number) or a complex type such as a JSON object or JSON array.</p><p>The following is a non-normative example of a Subject which adds a string-valued department property:</p></blockquote><blockquote> 5.1.1.主題のプロパティ <p>多くの認可システムはステートレスであり、認可ポリシーの評価で使用されることが予想されるプロパティまたは属性をクライアント (PEP) が渡すことを期待しています。この要件を満たすために、サブジェクトはpropertiesオブジェクトの下に 0 個以上の追加属性をキーと値のペアとして含めることができます</p><p>属性は単一値または複数値にすることができます。プリミティブ型 (文字列、ブール値、数値) または JSON オブジェクトや JSON 配列などの複合型にすることができます</p><p>以下は、文字列値のdepartmentプロパティを追加する Subject の非規範的な例です</p></blockquote><blockquote>   {

IP Address <p>The IP Address of the Subject, identified by an ip_address field, whose value is a textual representation of an IP Address, as defined in Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses [RFC4001].</p><p>The following is a non-normative example of a subject which adds the ip_address property:</p></blockquote><blockquote> 5.1.1.1.

Device ID <p>The Device Identifier of the Subject, identified by a device_id field, whose value is a string representation of the device identifier.</p><p>The following is a non-normative example of a subject which adds the device_id property:</p></blockquote><blockquote> 5.1.1.2.デバイスID <p>サブジェクトのデバイス識別子。device_idフィールドによって識別され、その値はデバイス識別子の文字列表現です</p><p>以下は、device_idプロパティを追加するサブジェクトの非規範的な例です:&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote>         {

Resource <p>A Resource is the target of an access request. It is a JSON ([RFC8259]) object that is constructed similar to a Subject entity. It has the follow keys:</p><p>type:</p><p>REQUIRED.

This is useful if the policy or application is not interested in different decisions for different types of Actions.  can_create: The Action to create a new entity, which MAY be defined by the resource field in the request.  can_read: The Action to read the content.

So use them! Simon outlined a bunch a of reasons that hold back many devs from using these tools – like ethical concerns, or energy concerns. But LLM tools are here to stay, and those who use them get more productive.</p>  <p>It takes a ton of effort to learn how to use these tools efficiently. As Simon puts it: “You have to put in so much effort to learn, to explore and experiment and learn how to use it. And there's no guidance.” Also, in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">related research we did in The Pragmatic Engineer about AI tools</a>, with about 200 software engineers responding, we saw some similar evidence. Those who have not used AI tools for 6 months, were more likely to be negative in their perception of these. In fact, a very common feedback from engineers not using these tools was “I used it a few times, but it didn’t live up to my expectations, and so I’m not using it any more”</p>  <p>Use local models to learn more about LLMs. Running local models has two bigger benefits:</p>  <p>Tou figure out how to do these! It’s less complicated than one would think, thanks to tools like HuggingFace. Go and play around with them, and try out a smaller local model.</p>  <p>You learn a LOT more about how LLMs work, thanks to local models being less capable. So it feels less “magic”. As Simon said, “ I think it's really useful to have a model hallucinate at you early because it helps you get that better mental model of, of, of what it can do. And the local models hallucinate wildly.”</p>    <p>Where to find Simon Willison:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/simonw">https://x.com/simonw</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a

Facebook referral traffic has fallen more than 40% over the last year; referrals from Reddit have increased by 88%.</p><p>But the focus is this:</p><blockquote><p>"Search traffic, still dominated by Google search, has remained relatively steady during the period, Brad Streicher, sales director at Chartbeat, said in a panel at the Online News Association’s annual conference in Atlanta last week. Google Discover — the Google product offering personalized content recommendations via Google’s mobile apps — is increasingly becoming a top referrer, up 13% across Chartbeat clients since January 2023."</p></blockquote><p>I think what's particularly notable here is the shift between kind of product. Google Search, despite the black box nature of its ever-changing algorithm, always felt like it was a part of the open web.</p><p>Discover, on the other hand, is an algorithmic recommendation product that tries to proactively give users more of what they want to read. It's much more akin to a Facebook newsfeed than it is a search index. There are likely editors behind the scenes, and a human touch to what gets surfaced. Publishers are even more in the dark about how to show up there than they were about how to rise through search engine rankings.</p><p>I'm curious about what this means for the web. Is this just an advertising / walled garden play from a company that wants to maximize advertising revenue and time on platform? Or is it a reflection of the web getting too big and too messy for many users, creating the need for a firmer hand to show them where the good content is? Is it a function of increased skittishness about an open web that might publish content and ideas that aren't brand safe? Or is it just changing user behavior in light of other apps? </p><p>Perhaps some elements of all of the above?</p>

There were two parallel forces at play:</p>  Newsrooms are not natural software companies (except for their own ends). 
 Content management systems are a commodity technology. 
 <p>It's notable that almost every newsroom that has built its own CMS has eventually left it in favor of a platform built by someone else - most commonly WordPress. Sinking resources into building your own means spending money to solve problems that someone else has already solved, and often solved well.</p><p>Particularly in tough times for the industry, newsrooms need to be spending money on the things that differentiate them, not by reinventing perfectly good wheels. WordPress isn't zero cost - most newsrooms partner with an agency and a managed hosting provider like WordPress VIP - but it's a lot cheaper than building all those features yourself would be. And the outcome by picking an open source platform is likely higher quality.</p><p>The exception is if the way you both think about and present content is radically different to anyone else. If you're truly a beautiful and unique snowflake, then, yes, building your own CMS is a good idea. But there isn't a single newsroom out there that is unique.</p><p>Likewise, if I'm a potential customer (and, as it turns out, I am!), I don't know why I'd pick a proprietary platform that's subject to the changing business strategies of its troubled owner over an open source platform which gives me direct ownership over the code and powers a significant percentage of the web. The upside would have to be stratospherically good. Based on sales emails I get that choose to focus on Arc's AI readiness, that case isn't being made.</p><p>The outcome is a bit sad. We need newsrooms; we need journalism; we need an informed voting population. Honestly, the Arc bet was worth trying: I can see how a platform play would have been a decent investment. But that doesn't seem to be how it's panned out, to the detriment of its parent.</p>

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  では、Authorization APIのImplementer's draftを見ていきましょう。  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/authorization-api-1_0-01.html">https://openid.net/specs/authorization-api-1_0-01.html</a>  <br>  <br>  とりあえず前段部分を見ていきます。 <blockquote> Abstract  The Authorization API enables Policy Decision Points (PDPs) and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) to communicate authorization requests and decisions to each other without requiring knowledge of each other's inner workings. The Authorization API is served by the PDP and is called by the PEP. The Authorization API includes an Evaluation endpoint, which provides specific access decisions. Other endpoints may be added in the future for other scenarios, including searching for subjects or resources. </blockquote><blockquote> 概要 </blockquote><blockquote><p>Authorization API により、ポリシー決定ポイント (PDP) とポリシー適用ポイント (PEP) は、互いの内部動作を知らなくても、認​​可要求と決定を相互に通信できます。Authorization API は PDP によって提供され、PEP によって呼び出されます。Authorization API には、特定のアクセス決定を提供する評価エンドポイントが含まれています。将来的には、サブジェクトやリソースの検索など、他のシナリオ用に他のエンドポイントが追加される可能性があります。</p></blockquote><p>前回書いた通り、Authorization APIはPDP（ポリシー決定ポイント）によって提供されるAPIです。要するにPEP（ポリシー適用ポイント）からの問い合わせに応じて、認可ポリシーを返却する、というAPIですね。本格的に繊細な認可制御をしようとするとリソースやサブジェクトの情報も必要になるので、将来的にはその辺りまで見ていくことになるのかもしれませんね。</p><p><br></p><blockquote> 1. Introduction <p>Computational services often implement access control within their components by separating Policy Decision Points (PDPs) from Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). PDPs and PEPs are defined in XACML and NIST's ABAC SP 800-162. Communication between PDPs and PEPs follows similar patterns across different software and services that require or provide authorization information. The Authorization API described in this document enables different providers to offer PDP and PEP capabilities without having to bind themselves to one particular implementation of a PDP or PEP.</p></blockquote><blockquote> 1.はじめに <p>計算サービスでは、ポリシー決定ポイント (PDP) とポリシー適用ポイント (PEP) を分離することで、コンポーネント内にアクセス制御を実装することがよくあります。PDP と PEP は、XACMLと NIST の ABAC SP 800-162定義されています。PDP と PEP 間の通信は、認可情報を必要とする、または認可情報を提供するさまざまなソフトウェアやサービスで同様のパターンに従います。このドキュメントで説明するAuthorization API を使用すると、さまざまなプロバイダーが、特定の PDP または PEP の実装に縛られることなく、PDP および PEP 機能を提供できます</p></blockquote><p>基本的にはPDP APIの標準化をしていきますよ、ってことですね。</p><p><br></p><blockquote> 2. Model <p>The Authorization API is a transport-agnostic API published by the PDP, to which the PEP acts as a client. Possible bindings of this specification, such as HTTPS or gRPC, are described in Transport.</p><p>Authorization for the Authorization API itself is out of scope for this document, since authorization for APIs is well-documented elsewhere. For example, the Authorization API's HTTPS binding MAY support authorization using an Authorization header, using a basic or bearer token. Support for OAuth 2.0 ([RFC6749]) is RECOMMENDED.</p></blockquote><blockquote> 2.モデル <p>Authorization API は PDP によって公開されたトランスポートに依存しない API であり、PEP はクライアントとして機能します。HTTPS や gRPC など、この仕様の可能なバインディングについては、トランスポートで説明されています</p><p>Authorization API 自体の認可は、API の認可については他の場所で十分に文書化されているため、このドキュメントの範囲外です。たとえば、Authorization API の HTTPS バインディングは、ヘッダーAuthorization、basicまたはトークンを使用した認可をサポートする場合があります。OAuth 2.0 ( [ RFC6749 ] )bearerのサポートが推奨されます</p></blockquote><p>Authorization API自体はトランスポートアグノスティックな設計になっているようです。この辺りは他のAPIと同じく汎用的な思想です。またAuthorization API自体の認可という一瞬混乱する話が出てきますが、PDPサービスを提供するAPIとしてのAuthorization APIと、そのAPIへの認可（OAuth的な意味での認可）をするのはOAuthを使いましょうね、という話です。やっぱりOAuthの「認可」という言葉はここでも混乱を招きますね。クライアントであるPEPへのアクセス権限の付与（委譲）、っていう文脈での「認可」ですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote> 3. Features <p>The core feature of the Authorization API is the Access Evaluation API, which enables a PEP to find out if a specific request can be permitted to access a specific resource. The following are non-normative examples:</p><p></p>  Can Alice view document #123?  Can Alice view document #123 at 16:30 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?  Can a manager print?  <p></p> 3.特徴 <p>Authorization API のコア機能はアクセス評価 API であり、これにより PEP は特定のリクエストが特定のリソースへのアクセスを許可されるかどうかを確認できます。以下は非規範的な例です:&nbsp;</p><p></p>  アリスは文書 #123 を閲覧できますか?&nbsp;  アリスは2024年6月11日火曜日の16:30に文書#123を閲覧できますか?&nbsp;  マネージャーは印刷できますか?&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><p>このAPIの特徴はPEPからの問い合わせに対してアクセス評価を行い結果を返却するというところにありそうですね。</p><blockquote> 4. API Version <p>This document describes the API version 1. Any updates to this API through subsequent revisions of this document or other documents MAY augment this API, but MUST NOT modify the API described here. Augmentation MAY include additional API methods or additional parameters to existing API methods, additional authorization mechanisms, or additional optional headers in API requests. All API methods for version 1 MUST be immediately preceded by the relative URL path /v1/.</p></blockquote><blockquote> 4. APIバージョン <p>このドキュメントでは、API バージョン 1 について説明します。このドキュメントまたは他のドキュメントの今後の改訂によるこの API の更新では、この API を拡張できますが、ここで説明する API を変更してはなりません。拡張には、追加の API メソッド、既存の API メソッドへの追加のパラメーター、追加の認証メカニズム、または API リクエスト内の追加のオプション ヘッダーが含まれる場合があります。バージョン 1 のすべての API メソッドの直前には、相対 URL パスがなければなりませ/v1/。</p></blockquote><p>まぁ、ここは互換性のためのバージョニングの話なので、このAPIに限った話じゃありませんので省略。</p><p><br></p><p>次からデータモデルの話に入っていくのでまずはここまでです。</p><p><br></p>

<p>Fourteenth in the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">News Commons</a>&nbsp;series.</p>
Craig Burton’s view of the open source ecosystem.
<p>The main work of journalism is producing stories.</p>
<p>Questions following that statement might begin with prepositions: on what, of what,&nbsp;about what. But the preposition that matters most is with what.</p>
<p>Ideally, that would be with facts. Of course, facts aren’t always available in the pure form that researchers call data. Instead, we typically have reports, accounts, sightings, observations, memories, and other fuzzy coatings or substitutes for facts.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/07/27/remembering-craig-burton/">Craig Burton</a> used to say that he discounted first-hand reports by 50% and withheld trust in second- and third-hand reports completely. In some cases, he didn’t even trust his memory, because he knew (and loved) everyone’s fallibility, including his own.</p>
<p>But still, we need facts, in whatever form. And those come from what we call sources. Those can be anybody or anything.</p>
<p>Let’s look at anything, and into the subset in archives that are not going away.</p>
<p>How much of that is produced by news organizations? And how much of what’s archived is just what is published?</p>
<p>I ask for two reasons.</p>
<p>One is because in this series I have made a strong case, <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/04/21/archives-as-commons/">over</a> and <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/08/15/better-way-to-do-news/">over</a>, for archiving everything possible that might be relevant in future news reporting and scholarship.</p>
<p>The other is because I have piles of unpublished source material that informed my <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/search/node?keys=searls">writing in Linux Journal</a>. This material is in the following forms:</p>
 
 Text files on this laptop and on various connected and disconnected drives 
 Sound recordings on—
 
 Cassette tapes 
 Microcassette tapes 
 Sony MiniDisc disks 
 .mp3, ogg, and other digital files, mostly on external drives 
 
 
 Video recordings on—
 
 Hi-8 tapes 
 Mini-DV tapes 
 
 
 
<p>And I’m not sure what to do with them. Yet.</p>
<p>Open-sourcing them will take a lot of time and work. But they cover the 24 years I wrote for Linux Journal, and matter to the history of Linux and the open source movement (or movements, since there were many, including the original free software movement).</p>
<p>Suggestions welcome.</p>

  Now that AI is a huge thing, it’s worth visiting what intelligence is, and how we mismeasure it—for example, by trying to measure it at all.

My father, Allen H. Searls, scored 159 on an Army IQ test when he re-enlisted to fight in WWII. But that didn’t make him a great fisherman, even though he loved to do it (and scored big with that striped bass, one of the few he ever caught.) Nor did it make him a good speller. (He was awful.) Or a good student. At fifteen he dropped out of high school and went to work as a longshoreman in New York City, commuting to work from New Jersey on a ferry, and then later working high steel construction on the bridge that obsolesced that ferry. But he was a great card player (almost always winning at poker), a math whiz, brilliant at making tools in his shop, and outstanding in many other ways (friend, husband, father) that can’t and shouldn’t be measured. Except maybe his looks. The guy was a 10.
<p>Now that AI is a huge thing, it’s worth visiting what intelligence is, and how we mismeasure it—for example, by trying to measure it at all.</p>
<p>I’ve been on this case for a while now, mostly by <a href="https://www.quora.com/search?q=doc%20searls%20IQ">answering questions ab0ut IQ on Quora</a>. My answer with the most upvotes is <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-considered-a-good-IQ/answer/Doc-Searls">this one</a>, to the question <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-considered-a-good-IQ/answer/Doc-Searls">“What is considered a good IQ?”</a>&nbsp;Here is the full text:</p>
<blockquote><p>What makes an IQ score “good” is the advantage it brings. That’s it.</p>
<p>When I read the IQ questions here in Quora — “How high an IQ do I need to have to become a good hacker?” “Is 128 a good IQ for a nine year old?” — my heart sinks.</p>
<p>IQ tests insult the intelligence of everybody who takes them, by reducing one of the most personal, varied and human qualities to a single number. Worse, they do this most typically with children, often with terrible results.</p>
<p>It is essential to remember that nobody has “an IQ.” Intelligence cannot be measured as if by a ruler, a thermometer or a dipstick. It is not a “quotient.” IQ test scores are nothing more than a number derived from correct answers to puzzle questions on a given day and setting. That’s it.</p>
<p>Yet our culture puts great store in IQ testing, and many actually believe that one’s “IQ” is as easily measured and unchanging as a fingerprint. This is highly misleading and terribly wrong. I speak from ample experience at living with the results of it.</p>
<p>I grew up in the 1950s and ’60s, going a public school system that sorted kids in each grade by a combination of IQ test scores, achievement test scores and teacher judgement. (My mother taught in the same system, so she knew a lot about how it worked, plus the IQ scores of my sister and myself.) After testing well in kindergarten, I was put in the smart kids class, where I stayed through 6th grade, even though my IQ and achievement test scores fell along with my grades, which were worse every year.</p>
<p>In 6th grade the teacher insisted that I was too dumb for his class and should be sent to another one. My parents had me IQ-tested by an independent center that said I was still smart, so I stayed. By 8th grade, however, my IQ score, grades and achievement test scores were so low that the school re-classified me from the “academic” to the “general” track, and shunted me toward the region’s “vocational-technical” high school to learn a “trade” such as carpentry or auto mechanics. I was no longer, as they put it, “college material.”</p>
<p>So my parents decided to take me out of the public school system and send me to a private school. All the ones we visited used IQ tests in their admissions process. I did so poorly at the school I most wanted to attend (because a girl I had a crush on was already headed there) that the school told my parents I was downright stupid, and that it was cruel of them to have high expectations of me. At another school they forgot to time the test, which gave me a chance to carefully answer the questions. I got all of them right. Impressed by my score, the admissions director told my parents they were lucky to have a kid like me. But the school was itself failing, so my parents kept looking.</p>
<p>The school that ended up taking me was short on students, so my IQ score there (which I never learned) wasn’t a factor. I got bad grades and test scores there too, including the SAT. Luckily, I ended up going to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilford_College">good small private college</a> that took me because it needed out-of-state students and I was willing to commit to an early decision. I did poorly there until my junior year, when I finally developed skilled ways of working with the system.</p>
<p>Since college I’ve done well in a variety of occupations, and in all of them I’ve been grateful to have been judged by my work rather than by standardized tests.</p>
<p>Looking back on this saga, I was lucky to have parents who respected my intelligence without regard for what schools and test scores told them. Other kids weren’t so lucky, getting categorized in ways that shut off paths to happy futures, violating their nature as unique individuals whose true essence cannot be measured. To the degree IQ tests are still used, the violation continues, especially for kids not advantaged by scoring at the right end of the bell curve.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto">John Taylor Gatto</a>&nbsp;says a teacher’s main purpose is not to add information to a kid’s empty head (the base assumption behind most formal schooling, ) but to subtract everything that “prevents a child’s inherent genius from gathering itself.”</p>
<p>All of us have inherent genius. My advice is to respect that, and quit thinking IQ testing is anything but a way of sorting people into groups for the convenience of a system that manufactures outputs for its own purposes, often at great human cost.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://searls.com/whitman.html">Here is Walt Whitman</a> on inherent genius:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is time to explain myself. Let us stand up.</p>
<p>I am an acme of things accomplished,<br>
and I an encloser of things to be.<br>
Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me.<br>
Afar down I see the huge first Nothing,<br>
the vapor from the nostrils of death.<br>
I know I was even there.<br>
I waited unseen and always.<br>
And slept while God carried me<br>
through the lethargic mist.<br>
And took my time.</p>
<p>Long I was hugged close. Long and long.<br>
Infinite have been the preparations for me.<br>
Faithful and friendly the arms that have helped me.</p>
<p>Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing<br>
like cheerful boatmen;<br>
For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings.<br>
They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.</p>
<p>Before I was born out of my mother<br>
generations guided me.<br>
My embryo has never been torpid.<br>
Nothing could overlay it.<br>
For it the nebula cohered to an orb.<br>
The long slow strata piled to rest it on.<br>
Vast vegetables gave it substance.<br>
Monstrous saurids transported it in their mouths<br>
and deposited it with care.</p>
<p>All forces have been steadily employed<br>
to complete and delight me.<br>
Now I stand on this spot with my soul.</p>
<p>I know that I have the best of time and space.<br>
And that I was never measured, and never will be measured.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto">Gatto</a>. Here is the full context of that pull-quote on genius. It’s from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dumbing-Down-Curriculum-Compulsory-Schooling/dp/0865718547/r">Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past thirty years, I’ve used my classes as a laboratory where I could learn a broader range of what human possibility is — the whole catalogue of hopes and fears — and also as a place where I could study what releases and what inhibits human power.</p>
<p>During that time, I’ve come to believe that genius is an exceedingly common human quality, probably natural to most of us. I didn’t want to accept that notion — far from it: my own training in two elite universities taught me that intelligence and talent distributed themselves economically over a bell curve and that human destiny, because of those mathematical, seemingly irrefutable scientific facts, was as rigorously determined as John Calvin contended.</p>
<p>The trouble was that the unlikeliest kids kept demonstrating to me at random moments so many of the hallmarks of human excellence — insight, wisdom, justice, resourcefulness, courage, originality — that I became confused. They didn’t do this often enough to make my teaching easy, but they did it often enough that I began to wonder, reluctantly, whether it was possible that being in school itself was what was dumbing them down. Was it possible I had been hired not to enlarge children’s power, but to diminish it? That seemed crazy on the face of it, but slowly I began to realize that the bells and the confinement, the crazy sequences, the age-segregation, the lack of privacy, the constant surveillance, and all the rest of the national curriculum of schooling were designed exactly as if someone had set out to prevent children from learning how to think and act, to coax them into addiction and dependent behavior.</p>
<p>Bit by bit I began to devise guerrilla exercises to allow as many of the kids I taught as possible the raw material people have always used to educate themselves: privacy, choice, freedom from surveillance, and as broad a range of situations and human associations as my limited power and resources could manage. In simpler terms, I tried to maneuver them into positions where they would have a chance to be their own teachers and to make themselves the major text of their own education.</p>
<p>In theoretical, metaphorical terms, the idea I began to explore was this one: that teaching is nothing like the art of painting, where, by the addition of material to a surface, an image is synthetically produced, but more like the art of sculpture, where, by the subtraction of material, an image already locked in the stone is enabled to emerge. It is a crucial distinction.</p>
<p>In other words, I dropped the idea that I was an expert whose job it was to fill the little heads with my expertise, and began to explore how I could remove those obstacles that prevented the inherent genius of children from gathering itself. I no longer felt comfortable defining my work as bestowing wisdom on a struggling classroom audience. Although I continue to this day in those futile assays because of the nature of institutional teaching, wherever possible I have broken with teaching tradition and sent kids down their separate paths to their own private truths.</p></blockquote>
<p>The italics are mine.</p>
<p>Knowing that we have industrialized education should help us understand how un-human AI “training,” “learning,” and “knowledge” actually are. (Side note: I love AI and use it every day. I also don’t think it’s going to kill us. But this post isn’t about that.)</p>
<p>Start with the simple fact that institutional teaching and its traditions don’t work for lots of kids. Today’s system is better in some ways than<a href="https://saintkosmas.org/gatto-i-quit-i-think"> the one Gatto bested. then quit</a>, but it’s still a system. If I were a child in the system we have today, I would surely be classified as an ADHD and ALD case,* given drugs, and put in a special class for the otherwise unteachable.</p>
<p>What worked for me as a student was one kind statement from one teacher: <a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/jg-tc/name/ronald-schmidt-obituary?id=29623384">Pastor Ronald Schmidt</a>, who taught English in my junior year. One day he said to me, “You’re a good writer.” It was as if the heavens opened. That was the first compliment I had ever received from any teacher, ever, through twelve years of schooling. I wish he were still alive, so I could thank him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I can thank my high school roommate, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_V._Marshall">Paul Marshall</a>, who was (and still is) a brilliant writer, musician, preacher—and exceptionally funny. He was voted Class Wit (among other distinctions, which he declined, preferring the Wit one), and as a senior he substitute-taught biology to sophomores when their teacher was out sick. (These days he is the retired <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/33803943/bishop-paul-v-marshall-nearly-16-years-a-biographical-sketch-long">Episcopal Bishop</a> of Bethlehem Pennsylvania. Before that, he was a professor at Yale Divinity School. There’s more at both those links.)</p>
<p>I remember a day when a bunch of us were hanging in our dorm room, talking about SAT scores. Mine was the lowest of the bunch. (If you must know, the total was 1001: a 482 in verbal and a 519 in math. Those numbers will remain burned in my brain until I die.) Others, including Paul, had scores that verged on perfection—or so I recall. (Whatever, they were all better than mine.). But Paul defended me from potential accusations of relative stupidity by saying this: “But David has insight.” (I wasn’t Doc yet.) Then he gave examples, which I’ve forgotten. By saying I had insight, Paul kindly and forever removed another obstacle from my path forward in life. From that moment on, insight became my stock in trade. Is it measurable? Thankfully, no.</p>
<p>Okay, back to AI.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/news-events/events/salon/index.html">Don Norman</a> told us in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVYXy4Y5xIU">his salon</a> here at Indiana University,</p>
<blockquote><p>First, these machines are not intelligent. Second, remember the A in AI. A means artificial. They don’t work the way we do. And it’s a mistake to think they do. So let’s take a look at what they are. They are pattern-matchers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could let Don go on (which you can, at that last link), but there are a zillion explanations of what AI is and does, which you’ll find everywhere on the Web, and in answers from questions you can ask ChatGPT, CoPilot, Anthropic, Perplexity, Claude, and the rest of them. And all of them will be full of metaphorical misdirection. (Which Don avoids, being the linguist that he is.)</p>
<p>We may say an AI is “trained,” that it “learns,” “knows” stuff, and is “smart” because it can beat the most skilled players of chess and go. But none of those metaphors are correct, even though they make sense to us. Still, we can’t help using those metaphors, because we understand everything metaphorically. (To digress into why, go <a href="http://publius.cc/2008/05/16/doc-searls-framing-the-net">here</a>. Or dig into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff">George Lakoff</a>‘s work, starting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By">here</a>. A summary statement might be, all metaphors are wrong, and that’s why they work. )</p>
<p>To be human is to be different from every other human, by design. We all look and sound different so we can tell each other apart. We also differ from how we were ten minutes ago, because we learn constantly.</p>
<p>So, to be human is to diverge in many ways from norms. Yet, being pattern recognizers and given to organizing our collective selves into institutional systems, we tend to isolate and stigmatize those who are, as we now say, divergent. Constantly recognizing patterns and profiling everything we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch is not just one of the many ways we are all human, but also how we build functioning societies, prejudices included. (As a side note, I am sure the human diaspora was caused both by our species’ natural wanderlust and by <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=othering&amp;ia=web">othering</a> those who were not like us. We would fight those others, or just migrate away from them until we filled the world. Welcome to now.)</p>
<p>To sum this all up, just remember that when we talk about intelligence, we are talking about a human quality, not a quantity of anything. That machines test out better at pattern recognition than we do does not make them intelligent in a human sense. It just makes them more useful in ways that appear human but are not.</p>
<p>So have all the fun you want with AI. Just remember its first name.</p>
 
<p>*In my forties and at my wife’s urging (because my ability to listen well and follow directions was sub-optimal), I spent whole days being tested for all kinds of what we now call <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=neurodivergent">neurodivergent</a> conditions. The labels I came away with were highly qualified variants of ADHD and APD. Specifics:</p>
 
 I was easily distracted and had trouble listening to and sorting out instructions for anything. (I still have trouble listening to the end of a long joke.) 
 On puzzle-solving questions, I was very good. 
 My smarts with spacial and sequence puzzles were tops, as was my ability to see and draw patterns, even when asked to rotate them 90° or 180°. 
 My memory was good. 
 I had “synchronization issues,” such as an inability to sing and play drums at the same time. This also involved deficiencies around “cognitive overload,” “context switching,” multitasking, coping with interruptions, and “bottlenecks” in response selection. They also said I had become skilled at masking all those problems, to myself and others. 
 I could easily grasp math concepts but made many mistakes with ordinary four-function calculations. 
 I did much better at hearing and reading long words than short ones, and I did better reading wide columns of text than narrow ones. 
 When made to read out loud a simple story comprised of short and widely spaced words in a narrow column, I stumbled through it all and remembered little of the story afterward. They told me that if I had been given this test alone, they would have said I had trouble reading at a first-grade level and I would have been called (as they said in those days) mentally retarded. 
 My performance on many tests suggested dyslexia, but my spelling was perfect and I wasn’t fooled by misplaced or switched letters in words. They also said that I had mostly self-corrected for some of my innate deficiencies, such as dyslexia. (I remember working very hard to become a good speller in the fourth grade, just as a challenge to myself.) 
 They said I did lots of “gestalt substitution,” when reading out loud, for example replacing “feature” with “function,” assuming I had read the latter when in fact I’d read the former. 
 Unlike other ADHD cases, I was also not more impulsive, poorly socialized, or easily addicted to stuff than normal people. 
 Like some ADHD types, I could hyperfocus at times. 
 My ability to self-regulate wasn’t great, it also wasn’t bad. Just a bit below average. (So perhaps today they’d call me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_predominantly_inattentive">ADHD-PI</a>, a label I just found in Wikipedia). 
 The APD (auditory processing disorder<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20555261">)</a> diagnosis came mostly from hearing tests. But, as with ADHD, I only hit some of the checkboxes. (Specifically, about half of the ten symptoms listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_processing_disorder">here</a>.) 
 My ability to understand what people say in noisy settings was in the bottom 2%. And that was when my hearing was still good. 
 
<p>I also apologize for the length of this post. If I had more time, I would have made it shorter.</p>
<p>Which, being a blog post, I will. Meanwhile, thanks for staying (or jumping) to the end.</p>

<p>Did you ever consider becoming a teacher of software engineers? I’m assuming many of us have not – simply because it’s an uncommon career path, and teaching rarely feels likely to be lucrative, compared to hands-on building (we previously covered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-career-paths">Common engineering career paths as Big Tech and scaleups</a>). But teaching software engineers is an interesting challenge for a few reasons:</p>  <p>Many engineers are good at learning by themselves, so may initially assume there’s little value in being taught by others</p>  <p>But, great teachers make a real difference in getting up to speed, including for software engineers</p>  <p>There’s demand at tech companies for innovative teaching approaches and new technologies for devs</p>  <p>To discover what being a full-time trainer of tech professionals is really like, I turned to software developer turned full-time trainer, <a href="https://lerner.co.il/">Reuven M. Lerner</a>.</p><p>Reuven worked as a developer for 15 years, and for the past decade and a half he's been a full-time instructor. He teaches Python, Pandas, and Git for a range of companies, including Apple, IBM, and Cisco. He does both <a href="https://lerner.co.il/courses">corporate training</a>, as well as <a href="https://lernerpython.com">online Python courses for individuals</a>.</p><p>Today, Reuven takes us behind the scenes of technical training, covering:</p>  <p>Coding vs teaching it. You optimize software when coding, whereas with training you optimize how to best teach the writing of software.</p>  <p>Is training helpful? Many software engineers learn by themselves, and it can be hard to get dedicated time at work for training. But group courses boost communication across tech teams.</p>  <p>What makes effective teaching? Reuven’s thoughts, including on using interactive notebooks over slides, exercises above theory, and lots of pair programming.</p>  <p>Day to day. Teaching learners is just one part of being a trainer: sales, marketing, customer support, and continuous learning are also key.</p>  <p>Business of teaching. To work as a career, teaching must be a solid business. Reuven shares how he runs his operation, from closing new clients and educating decision makers, to collecting payment.</p>  <p>Advice for future trainers. Get comfortable with public speaking, go deep into a technology, don’t shy away from niches, and more.</p>  <p>With that, it’s over to Reuven:</p>   <p>When I got my computer science degree 30 years ago, I knew what my career would look like: I would develop software, eventually move up to manage other people, or maybe start my own business. Indeed, after writing software for Hewlett Packard and Time Warner’s “Pathfinder” website, I opened my own consulting shop, writing Web applications and running Linux-based servers.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and my career looks very different. I’m still self employed, but instead of developing software, I’m a full-time trainer in Python and Pandas. I teach at big companies like Apple, Arm, Cisco, and Western Digital, and at startups and financial institutions. I offer more than 30 courses, ranging from “Python for non-programmers,” and “Data analysis with Pandas,” to advanced practice workshops. Between these, I have a growing business of online courses and newsletters for people without access to company training programs.</p><p>I feel like I have the best of all worlds: I help people improve their careers, learn new technologies, and interact with smart people all over the world. Plus, I set my own schedule far in advance, have only a handful of meetings a month, spend time with my family, and get paid well — better, in fact, than many developers. I’ve never earned more, and I’ve never enjoyed my work more.</p><p>In this post, I introduce the world of tech training. I reveal how it operates, what I’ve found does (and doesn’t) work for training, how I run my business, and how you can explore the world of training.</p> How I became a full-time trainer <p>When I started consulting in 1995, I positioned myself as a coder and Linux expert. But some companies asked me not to develop software for them, but to teach their people how to do it. That was my first taste of training and I rather liked it, but saw it as just one part of my consultancy work. Indeed, I rarely spent more than 20 percent of my time on training.</p><p>In 2003, I started a PhD program, continuing to consult part-time in order to support my family. While working on my dissertation, a colleague suggested I concentrate on training, and offered to connect me with a company. I said yes – a decision which changed my career.</p><p>This training company marketed my Python courses, and filled up my calendar with training sessions. Soon, my schedule was full several months in advance. As convenient as it was to work with them, I also knew that they were keeping half the income.</p><p>When I finished my PhD in 2014 (after 11 years!) I left the training company and rebranded myself as a trainer. I’ve now been teaching Python, Pandas, and Git full time for around 15 years and absolutely love it.</p><p>My focus on Python turned out to be fortunate because it is used just about everywhere. Even hardware companies that mainly work in C, like Apple, Arm, and Western Digital, use Python on all sorts of internal testing and analysis projects. Financial institutions are moving to Python instead of Excel, and want help in making the switch. Companies doing numerical analysis with Matlab are tiring of the high per-seat licensing cost, and are moving to Python – and need help easing employees into a new environment.</p><p>I mostly teach people who are highly schooled and very smart, many of whom have engineering degrees and at least some experience of coding. In theory, their employer could buy them books or video courses, and ask them to learn Python solo. In practice, we all know this doesn’t work; we’re often too busy to use such materials. A timeboxed course, delivered in person and with everyone in the same place is the fastest option with the best results, and it helps establish best practices, instead of just learning the syntax.</p> 1. Coding vs teaching it <p>How is my life and work different as a trainer, than as a coder? Some of the biggest differences:</p><p>As a trainer, my goals are fundamentally different from a full-time software engineer’s. A coder’s goal is to get new or improved functionality out the door. In contrast, my job is to help someone do their job better and faster by writing more idiomatic, maintainable, and efficient code quicker.</p><p>I spend much of my time thinking about code. However, I do not do this in the same way I did when working on software projects. I’m not trying to optimize software; I’m trying to optimize learning about writing software. I always seek to simplify and improve my explanations, and find stories, metaphors, and examples that improve my teaching. I’m constantly trying to understand how certain packages and techniques work, so I can explain and illustrate them better to students.</p><p>In many ways, I’m like a stand-up comedian. I teach so often, so I see which examples, explanations and exercises work, and which don’t. Just as a comedian changes their jokes from show to show and iterates repeatedly until they find what works, I’m constantly experimenting with what and how I teach, trying to find the optimal way to get information across.</p><p>I particularly enjoy using stories in my teaching. Good stories reinforce the ideas being taught, and also enliven classes on potentially dry, abstract topics.</p><p>Often, these stories come from personal experience. One recent example: Meta banned me from advertising my courses and newsletters on their platforms, apparently because they believe I was illegally trading in exotic animals (pythons and pandas – the irony!) This event was widely discussed on programming forums <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37939269">like Hacker News</a>.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0db08a-cb3a-4cd6-b3b7-68d22a200e26_1528x662.png">    </a>Python (left) vs a python (right.) Facebook doesn’t allow adverts for Python courses because they assume you’re selling serpents! <a href="https://lerner.co.il/2023/10/19/im-banned-for-life-from-advertising-on-meta-because-i-teach-python/">Read more about this incident</a>. <p>This was as bizarre and frustrating as it was amusing, but you can be sure I’ll tell this story every time I teach a course on machine learning, and the need to test models before deploying them to production.</p><p>When I was doing software projects, it was hard to set my schedule in advance. Typically, someone needs a software project done now, or they don’t want it at all. Talking to someone about a project six months hence is generally a non-starter.</p><p>By contrast, there’s almost never a training emergency. As such, training can be scheduled two, four, or even six months in advance. At the time of writing, I already have courses in my schedule for January 2025, and I’m talking to clients about scheduling beyond that.</p><p>This ability to plan ahead has improved my personal life and my business. I can now schedule vacations knowing when I will have training gigs. I also have a much better sense of how much I’ll earn in a given month; a much better situation than the feast-or-famine roller coaster of my first years of freelancing.</p><p>Shock news: training can pay far better than coding! On the topic of money, here’s a lesser-known detail about training I’ve experienced: It pays better, often far better, than coding because:</p>  <p>If you help 20 developers to become 10 percent more effective, that’s worth a lot of money. So it’s absolutely worthwhile for a company to invest in good, effective training.</p>  <p>The budget doesn’t come from R&amp;D. Rather, it comes from HR, or from a special training budget. Whereas a company might balk at paying thousands of dollars per day for a developer, this is considered to be a normal rate for training services!</p>  <p>Training is usually done through companies with overheads like offices and employees in sales/marketing. A freelancer doesn’t have these costs. Companies will pay roughly the same for training regardless of the training vendor’s size and overheads. I’m a one-person company based in a home office, so I can basically pocket what other companies spend on their costs!</p>  <p>Hardly any meetings. This is another major difference between doing coding and providing training. I’ll typically speak with a new client two or three times before the first class takes place, and maybe once after the first session to wrap things up. But if they ask me to teach again, we just exchange some email, mainly about dates. If I have 4-5 meetings a month, that’s a lot – which means I can spend more time teaching and developing new course materials.</p><p>I do miss software projects. I’ve experienced first-hand that there’s nothing like pushing technological boundaries and launching a product, knowing that people around the world are using and enjoying it. And there’s a definite limit to the size and scope of things I can do on my own, rather than in a larger team.</p><p>That said, most projects I worked on weren’t pushing boundaries. And while many were exciting, completing them didn’t give me the same sense of purpose and fulfillment I get from teaching. Besides, now I get to write whatever code I want – and there is definitely code to write, whether as part of my courses or running the backend of my online store and newsletters.</p><p>My online store’s tech stack combines:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.podia.com/">Podia</a>: a SaaS where my video courses live</p>  <p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>: an e-commerce SaaS handling payment and subscriptions</p>  <p><a href="https://www.drip.com/">Drip</a>: email marketing SaaS, used for two of my newsletters and marketing blasts. I use a fair amount of custom programming (“workflows”) here</p>  <p><a href="http://ghost.io">Ghost</a>: a CRM and email service used for Bamboo Weekly</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/reuven">GitHub</a>: I create a new repo for each course I teach</p>  <p><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">Flask</a>: a Python framework I run on a standalone server for one-time coupon codes</p>  <p><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>: used for discussion among my members.</p>  <p><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>: an integrations platform I use to connect these systems. For example, someone subscribing to my Python+Data product is enrolled in all my courses, added to my Better Developers list, and is added to the appropriate GitHub repos.</p>  <p>Custom Python scripts: These help me set up and tear down environments when I give corporate training. Each class gets a new GitHub repo, as well as its own set of Jupyter notebooks. This, along with the “<a href="https://pypi.org/project/gitautopush/">gitautopush</a>” package, lets me work on my own computer and share the course contents with participants in a given course in near-real time.</p>  <p>Do I plan to consolidate these into a smaller number of services? Yes, absolutely. But one person can only do so much in a day. Between teaching, writing three weekly newsletters, responding to learners and researching new topics, I don’t have much time for major technological shifts. But I do have a roadmap; for example, I’ll soon move discussions from Podia to Discord, which seems to foster a greater sense of community.</p> 2. Is training helpful? <p>I once met someone with a background in engineering and education. I told him what I did and he replied:</p><blockquote><p>“Oh, so you’re an entertainer? Because we both know that you’re not giving any real educational value.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This comment hurt. Still, I’m sure many developers who attend my classes also believe they could learn the same material as quickly and as well by themselves, and that my courses are a nice vacation from “real” work. I understand this, but here’s what I’ve learned from years of teaching.</p><p>Most people benefit from having someone explain things, including developers who could learn on their own! After I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgKRCYSEzJk">talk at PyCon US</a> this year, a developer told me my presentation answered questions they didn’t even know they wanted to ask.&nbsp;</p><p>I spend a lot of time thinking about the questions people might have beyond simple use cases and syntax, and I integrate them into my teaching. People could get these insights themselves, but it would take longer and not necessarily be contextualized appropriately.</p><p>Pressure at work stops many developers learning new things by themselves. One client of mine decided to save money and bought my video courses for their staff. When I came in to do a live Q&amp;A based on the videos, the only person who had really watched them had red eyes, because he had finished at 2:30 a.m. In the end, we returned to in-person lectures.</p><p>Learning the nuances of a language is faster with an instructor. Python is a good example; I’m often told this language has such simple syntax that a course isn’t really needed, and it is true the language is pretty simple, with just a few core data structures. So how long can it really take for an engineer to figure it alone?&nbsp;</p><p>This argument is similar to saying chemistry is simple because there are only 118 chemical elements in the universe. Learning the nuances, use cases, limitations, and conventions takes time. This is as true for Python as for chemistry. Going beyond basic syntax is usually faster and more memorable with an instructor.</p><p>For example, when I teach Python I dive into the details of the += operator. I explain that even though it does what you expect, one should be careful when using it to concatenate strings. If preserving memory is important, then you should always use a combination of a list and the str.join method to conserve memory. I talk about the different ways to iterate over a dictionary, and why using the dict.keys method is almost always a bad idea. We discuss the difference between the “__str__” and “__repr__” methods, and when to use each (and why I think it’s OK to only define “__repr__”).</p><p>Having everyone take a course can improve workplace communication. If people learn solo they’ll understand different things, and choose their own styles/conventions. Giving the same training across a company ensures everyone has the same (or similar) skill levels and understanding, making communication easier within and across teams.</p><p>Hands-on exercises are the most efficient way I know how to teach. I’ve fine-tuned coding exercises over years to illuminate certain techniques, syntax, and conventions. I call these exercises “controlled frustration.” The goal is to solve a problem without a manager or deadlines adding to stress levels.&nbsp;</p><p>Learning from other people's mistakes is a great way to learn and in a group setting, this is much easier. As important as it is for students to do exercises, it’s also important to review the exercises together and learn from each other’s buggy code. Also, when I demonstrate how to solve a problem, I’m modeling a process they can apply to their jobs.</p><p>Companies rarely give people time to pick up new techniques and technologies. It is true there are plenty of developers who can learn on their own. The trouble is finding dedicated time to focus on learning. I’ve found people often enjoy being in advanced classes – especially exercise-only classes – where they can solve interesting problems they might not have the opportunity to do at work.</p><p>As a manager, when does it make sense to consider bringing in a trainer? If your team is adopting a new technology, or if you’re all a little shaky with using it, or you observe devs always going to ChatGPT (or StackOverflow – if you still use it!) to solve problems, then you might want to consider bringing in an instructor. A good instructor with plenty of experience can anticipate which mental models help engineers, and has exercises to take their understanding to the next level.</p><p>Also, training empowers members of staff; improving their communication skills and distributing knowledge across organizations. Six months after I taught a Git course at one company, an engineer told me he was now the Git expert in his group, and no longer had to guess what to do when they got in trouble. Not only did he feel great about himself and this new knowledge, but his group benefited from having a local expert.</p> 3. What makes effective teaching?

<p></p><p>I’m extraordinarily excited about&nbsp;<a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org/2024/09/24/launch/">the launch of the Social Web Foundation</a>, which has been created to promote and support the growth of the Fediverse: the interoperable social network powered by the ActivityPub protocol.</p><p>Users of services on the Fediverse can follow, share, and interact with each other, regardless of which service each one is using. The most famous Fediverse platform is <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, but there are many more participants, including <a href="https://threads.net">Threads</a>, <a href="https://flipboard.com">Flipboard</a>, and <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>.</p><p>From <a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org/2024/09/24/launch/">the announcement</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[…] Advocates of this increased platform choice say it will bring more individual control, more innovation, and a healthier social media experience. But there is work to do: journalism, activism, and the public square remain in a state of uncertain dissonance and privacy, safety and agency remain important concerns for anyone participating in a social network.</p></blockquote><p>The Foundation’s founding members are <a href="https://cdt.org/staff/mallory-knodel/">Mallory Knodel</a>, the former CTO of the <a href="https://cdt.org/">Center for Democracy and Technology</a>; <a href="https://cosocial.ca/@evan">Evan Prodromou</a>, one of the creators of ActivityPub and its current editor (who just published the canonical book on the topic); and <a href="http://plasticbag.org/">Tom Coates</a>, a product designer and founder who was one of the earliest bloggers and has been involved in many things that have been good on the web. They become the Executive Director, Research Director, and Product Director respectively.</p><p>Excitingly, <a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org/">the Foundation’s partners</a> are a who’s who of companies doing great work on the web today. Those include Automattic, Ghost, Flipboard, Fastly, Medium, and Mastodon itself. Meta is also a backer, in an indication of its continued investment in the Fediverse, moving away from the walled garden strategy that it used with Facebook and Instagram for decades.</p><p>In a conversation with Richard MacManus over on The New Stack, <a href="https://thenewstack.io/social-web-foundation-launched-how-in-is-w3c-on-fediverse/">Evan explained the Foundation’s relationship with existing standards organizations like the W3C</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“W3C as a standards organization mostly does coordinating the work of a number of different groups to make protocols […] So we’ll still be participating in the W3C — we’re going to become a member organization of the W3C.”</p><p>Prodromou added that the SWF will take on the role of advocacy and user education, which is typically outside of the W3C’s purview for standards work.</p></blockquote><p>My opinion: this is the future of the social web. Every new service and platform that contains social features — which is most of them — will support the ActivityPub protocol within the next few years. Service owners can use it to easily avoid the “cold start” problem when creating new networks, and to plug their existing platforms into a ready-made network of hundreds of millions of people. Publishers will use it to reach their audiences more easily. And it’s where the global conversation will be held.</p><p>When I was building social platforms in the 2000s, this is what we dreamed of. <a href="https://elgg.org">Elgg</a>, the open source social networking platform which launched my career, was intended to be the center of a federated social web. Although we made some crucial steps towards open data protocols and embracing open standards, we didn’t get there. I’m beyond thrilled that the Fediverse and ActivityPub exist, and that there are so many robust platforms that support it. The Social Web Foundation is another great step towards building the social web that we all deserve.</p><p>As Casey Newton published just yesterday <a href="https://www.platformer.news/leaving-substack-platformer-year-four/">about the future of his publication, Platformer</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One way I hope it will evolve is to become part of the fediverse: the network of federated sites and apps that are built with interoperability in mind. The fediverse is built on top of protocols, not platforms, which offers us a chance to decentralize power on the internet and built a more stable foundation for media and social apps.</p></blockquote><p>The Social Web Foundation’s existence as an advocacy, research, and development organization is another key step towards making that happen. But to be clear, its role is in support: each one of its partner organizations has already taken concrete steps towards supporting ActivityPub, and the movement is well underway.</p><p><a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org/">Check out the Social Web Foundation and its projects at its website</a>.</p><p>Updated: <a href="https://werd.io/2024/more-coverage-of-the-social-web-foundation">Read more coverage of the launch</a>.</p>

Sure, you can syndicate out to meet readers where they're at, but owning your own space makes you much less subject to the whims of someone else's platform.</p><p>And even that syndication to social platforms is becoming more controllable. One hope for the future that Casey notes:</p><blockquote><p>"One way I hope [Platformer] will evolve is to become part of the fediverse: the network of federated sites and apps that are built with interoperability in mind.

The benefit will be that Platformer can reach its readers on platforms like Threads, Flipboard, and Mastodon and maintain full control over its relationships with them. That's a game-changer for publishers.</p><p><a href="https://werd.io/tag/Media">#Media</a></p>            <p>[<a href="https://www.platformer.news/leaving-substack-platformer-year-four/">Link</a>]</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement a geo location search in an ASP.NET Core application using a LeafletJs map. The selected location can be used to find the nearest location with an Elasticsearch Geo-distance query. The Elasticsearch container and the ASP.NET Core UI application are setup for development using .NET Aspire.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/WebGeoElasticsearch">https://github.com/damienbod/WebGeoElasticsearch</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>For local development, .NET Aspire is used to setup the two services and the HTTPS connections between the services. The services are configured in the Aspire AppHost project .</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Elasticsearch client is setup as a singleton and requires the connection configuration. This can be changed, if for example an API key is used instead. The connection URL is read from the configuration as well as the secrets. </p>


  using Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch;
using Elastic.Transport;

namespace WebGeoElasticsearch.ElasticsearchApi;

public class ElasticClientProvider
{
    private readonly ElasticsearchClient? _client = null;

    public ElasticClientProvider(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        if (_client == null)
        {
            var settings = new ElasticsearchClientSettings(new Uri(configuration["ElasticsearchUrl"]!))
                .Authentication(new BasicAuthentication(configuration["ElasticsearchUserName"]!,
                    configuration["ElasticsearchPassword"]!));

            _client = new ElasticsearchClient(settings);
        }
    }

    public ElasticsearchClient GetClient()
    {
        if (_client != null)
        {
            return _client;
        }

        throw new Exception("Elasticsearch client not initialized");
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Create Index with mapping 



<p>The index cannot be created by adding a document because the mapping is created incorrectly using the default settings. The mapping can be created for the defined index using the Mappings extension from the  Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch Nuget package. This was added to the client project in the Aspire.Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch package. The mapping is really simple and probably not complete for a production index, some keyword optimizations are required. The detailsCoordinates field is defined as  a GeoPointProperty. </p>


  var mapping = await _client.Indices.CreateAsync&lt;MapDetail&gt;(IndexName, c =&gt; c
   .Mappings(map =&gt; map
       .Properties(
           new Properties&lt;MapDetail&gt;()
           {
                { "details", new TextProperty() },
                { "detailsCoordinates", new GeoPointProperty() },
                { "detailsType", new TextProperty() },
                { "id", new TextProperty() },
                { "information", new TextProperty() },
                { "name", new TextProperty() }
           }
       )
   )
);
  


<p>The created mapping can be validated using the “IndexName”/_mapping GET request. This returns the definitions as a Json response.</p>



<p><a href="https://localhost:9200/mapdetails/_mapping">https://localhost:9200/mapdetails/_mapping</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>Documents can be added to the Elasticsearch index using the IndexAsync method.</p>


  response = await _client.IndexAsync(dotNetGroup, IndexName, "1");

 Search Query 



<p>A Geo-distance query is used to find the distance from the selected location to the different Geo points in the index. This using latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>


  public async Task&lt;List&lt;MapDetail&gt;&gt; SearchForClosestAsync(
	uint maxDistanceInMeter, 
	double centerLatitude, 
	double centerLongitude)
{
    // Bern	Lat 46.94792, Long 7.44461
    if (maxDistanceInMeter == 0)
    {
        maxDistanceInMeter = 1000000;
    }
    var searchRequest = new SearchRequest(IndexName)
    {
        Query = new GeoDistanceQuery
        {
            DistanceType = GeoDistanceType.Plane,
            Field = "detailsCoordinates",
            Distance = $"{maxDistanceInMeter}m",
            Location = GeoLocation.LatitudeLongitude(
				new LatLonGeoLocation
				{
					Lat = centerLatitude,
					Lon = centerLongitude
				})
        },
        Sort = BuildGeoDistanceSort(centerLatitude, centerLongitude)
    };

    searchRequest.ErrorTrace = true;

    _logger.LogInformation("SearchForClosestAsync: {SearchBody}", 
		searchRequest);

    var searchResponse = await _client
		.SearchAsync&lt;MapDetail&gt;(searchRequest);


    return searchResponse.Documents.ToList();
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The found results are returned sorted using the Geo-distance sort. This puts the location with the smallest distance first. This is used for the map display.</p>


  private static List&lt;SortOptions&gt; BuildGeoDistanceSort(
	double centerLatitude, 
	double centerLongitude)
{
    var sorts = new List&lt;SortOptions&gt;();

    var sort = SortOptions.GeoDistance(
        new GeoDistanceSort
        {
            Field = new Field("detailsCoordinates"),
            Location = new List&lt;GeoLocation&gt;
            {
                GeoLocation.LatitudeLongitude(
					new LatLonGeoLocation
					{
						Lat = centerLatitude,
						Lon = centerLongitude
					})
            },
            Order = SortOrder.Asc,
            Unit = DistanceUnit.Meters
        }
    );

    sorts.Add(sort);

    return sorts;
}
  


<p></p>



 Display using Leaflet.js 



<p>The ASP.NET Core displays the locations and the results of the search in a Leafletjs map component. The location closest to the center location is displayed differently. You can click around the map and test the different searches. The data used for this display is powered using the Geo-distance query.</p>







<p></p>



 Testing 



<p>The applications can be started using the .NET Aspire host project. One is run as a container, the other is a project. The docker container requires a Desktop docker installation on the host operating system. When the applications started, the containers need to boot up first. An optimization would remove this boot up.</p>







 Notes 



<p>Using Elasticsearch, it is very simple to create fairly complex search requests for your web applications. With a bit of experience complex reports, queries can be implemented as well. You can also use Elasticsearch aggregations to group and organize results for data analysis tools, reports. .NET Aspire makes it easy to develop locally and use HTTPS everywhere.</p>

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  昨日、AuthZEN WGがAuthorization API 1.0のImplementer's draftを提案している、という話をしましたが、そもそもこの認可APIはどういうものなのか見ていきたいと思います。  <br>  いきなり仕様を読んでもいいのですが、AuthZEN WGのCo-Chairで仕様のEditorでもあるAsertoのCEOのOmri Gazittが良い記事を書いているのでまずはこちらを読んでおきましょう。  <br>  <a href="https://www.aserto.com/blog/openid-authzen-implementers-draft-why-it-matters">https://www.aserto.com/blog/openid-authzen-implementers-draft-why-it-matters</a>  <br> <blockquote> Authentication is "solved"  The authentication world has mature specifications that are universally adopted, such as OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. This has helped the industry solve "single sign-on for the web". </blockquote><blockquote> 認証は「解決済み」 <p>認証の世界には、OAuth2 や OpenID Connect など、広く採用されている成熟した仕様があります。これにより、業界は「Web のシングル サインオン」の問題を解決できました。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhoXJOVal68pAnQgxD24wJMXdfAeJb6g-Q2hW8mDtB7ROnJVLzXYqYTDENQVd1YjeWNU-H6UNMgMSeV3AgFdwnzQEZWteqKMoh0H7scggrFgdd54SiSd4A4F0KMgQPSQ6OqlVzmutaBS0U5XTcKJDNadneAadbjZnhEhYEBG8h-VCe4fSRR7bsymjrG2R9p"></a> <br>OAuth 2.0は置いておいて、認証の世界はOpenID ConnectやSAMLなどのID連携のための仕組みによりシングルサインオンの実現など、複雑性を解決してきました。<p></p><blockquote> Authorization is next <p>The authorization world has lagged behind. Today, each application has its own way of assigning permissions to users, what we call an "N * M problem".</p></blockquote><blockquote> 次は認可です <p>認可の世界は遅れています。現在、各アプリケーションはユーザーに権限を割り当てる独自の方法を持っており、これを「N * M 問題」と呼びます。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEikpF_5ai8Wjh1u8Jm5ghQhnVNXrQRPYFIFp43EOVCMSDd2YSZZ9BY5tmbO66gXf0tfkblWP8EYyFw2k89fiuzYZ6Bhw9rRPMaZQw1jx00TWY_ilZGoUEybhh28gMRyIdmtjwuFORt0PlZTA4CpdxdqVxeWr7FK1v1vuSkeTHeeJDfseJlQQbywS9NkBxmD"></a> <br>著者がn*m問題として記載している通り、アプリケーションが個々にユーザの権限を管理せざるを得ない、という状況が確かに存在しています。実際、認可を集中管理しにくかった理由としては、アプリケーションごとに保持しているリソースや権限の粒度はバラバラかつ変化が激しく、集中管理するには複雑すぎる、ということがしばしば挙げられます。まさにn*m問題です。<p></p><blockquote><p>But help is one the way! OpenID AuthZEN aims to become the "OpenID Connect of authorization", and has just entered the review phase for the first Implementer's Draft of the Authorization API version 1.0.</p><p>Having served as co-chair of the WG and co-editor of the spec, this means a lot to us at Aserto. Why?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>しかし、助けは必ずあります! OpenID AuthZEN は「認可の OpenID Connect」になることを目指しており、Authorization API バージョン 1.0の最初の実装者ドラフトのレビュー段階に入ったところです。</p><p>WG の共同議長および仕様の共同編集者を務めた Aserto にとって、これは大きな意味を持ちます。なぜでしょうか?</p></blockquote><p>わくわくしますね！この問題が解けると確かに大きなインパクトです。</p><p><br></p><blockquote> Why standardize authorization? <p>Standards efforts are multi-year affairs, so we don't take them lightly. Standardizing a developer technology needs three things to succeed:</p><p></p>  It addresses a significant pain point.  Competing technology providers find areas where standardization doesn't erode differentiation, but accelerates adoption.  It provides significant benefits to consumers and end-users of the technology, which drives adoption.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote> 認可を標準化する理由は何ですか? <p>標準化の取り組みは数年にわたる作業であるため、私たちはそれを軽視しません。開発者テクノロジーの標準化を成功させるには、次の 3 つのことが必要です。</p><p></p>  それは重大な問題点に対処します。  競合するテクノロジー プロバイダーは、標準化によって差別化が損なわれることなく、導入が加速される領域を見つけます。  これは、テクノロジーの利用者とエンドユーザーに大きなメリットをもたらし、採用を促進します。  <p></p></blockquote><p>これはAuthorization APIに限らず、すべての標準仕様について言えることだと思いますが、実装するプロバイダの競争領域と協調領域の特定から始める必要があるわけです。当然のことながら競争領域では各ベンダが差別化をしていくポイントなので、その領域に関して情報開示はしないわけです。ただ協調した方が全体にとってメリットがある部分は必ず存在するので、そこを特定して標準化をしていくわけです。また、これらのテクノロジーはコンシューマ（実装する人たち）やエンドユーザにとってメリットがなければ設計しても使われることはありません。</p><p><br></p><blockquote> ODBC <p>Early in my career, around 1993, I witnessed this first hand with Open Database Connectivity, or ODBC. Consumers wanted data-centric applications (Excel, Access, Visual Basic, Powerbuilder, and countless more) to be able to talk to a bunch of data sources (Oracle, Sybase, SQL Server, DB2, Informix, and many others).</p><p>This is what we call an "N * M" problem: N applications need to build connectors to M data sources. Wasteful and expensive.</p><p>ODBC addressed this challenge by defining a universal data access API, which database vendors could implement, and applications could consume, transforming it into an "N + M" problem. All of the sudden, any data application could immediately talk to a whole bunch of data sources simply by being a consumer of ODBC.</p><p>My startup, NEON Systems, bet on this standard and rode its success by integrating data-centric applications with a wide variety of enterprise data sources. NEON was so successful it went public in 1999.</p></blockquote><blockquote> ODBC <p>キャリアの初期、1993 年頃に、私は Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) でこれを直接目にしました。消費者は、データ中心のアプリケーション (Excel、Access、Visual Basic、Powerbuilder など数え切れないほど) が、多数のデータ ソース (Oracle、Sybase、SQL Server、DB2、Informix など) と通信できることを望んでいました。</p><p>これは「N * M」問題 と呼ばれるもので、 N 個のアプリケーションがM 個のデータ ソースへのコネクタを構築する必要があります。これは無駄が多く、コストもかかります。</p><p>ODBC は、データベース ベンダーが実装し、アプリケーションが使用できるユニバーサル データ アクセス API を定義することでこの課題に対処し、これを「N + M」問題に変換しました。突然、ODBC のコンシューマーになるだけで、あらゆるデータ アプリケーションが大量のデータ ソースとすぐに通信できるようになりました。</p><p>私のスタートアップ企業である NEON Systems は、この標準に賭け、データ中心のアプリケーションをさまざまなエンタープライズ データ ソースと統合することで成功を収めました。NEON は大成功を収め、1999 年に株式を公開しました。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>ODBC！今となっては懐かしいですね。。私もめちゃくちゃ使ってました。まさにデータベース管理システム（OracleとSQL Serverなど）が乱立している時代（今もか）にユニバーサルなAPIは必須アイテムでした。まぁ、もちろん固有の機能を使うには各社のクライアントを使う必要があったりしたわけですが。</p><blockquote> Open ID Connect <p>Two decades after ODBC, OpenID Connect (OIDC) became a standard that solved a similar problem. N SaaS applications needed to integrate with M corporate identity providers. By adopting the OIDC protocol, each SaaS app allows its users to sign-in with their corporate identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, Ping ID, etc).</p><p>Admins no longer have to worry about corporate users creating their own logins on each SaaS application - they can use a single corporate login across all these applications. Onboarding and offboarding become a breeze!</p><p>At Microsoft, our vision for this started with SAML, WS-Security, and WS-Federation in the early 2000's, but it wasn't until 2013 that OIDC reached its tipping point. The journey took a while, but the result has been nothing short of transformational.</p></blockquote><blockquote> OpenID Connect <p>ODBC の 20 年後、OpenID Connect (OIDC) が同様の問題を解決する標準になりました。N個のSaaS アプリケーションをM個の企業 ID プロバイダーと統合する必要がありました。OIDC プロトコルを採用することで、各 SaaS アプリのユーザーは企業 ID プロバイダー (Okta、Azure AD、Google Workspace、Ping ID など) を使用してサインインできるようになります。</p><p>管理者は、企業ユーザーが各 SaaS アプリケーションで独自のログインを作成することを心配する必要がなくなりました。管理者は、これらすべてのアプリケーションで単一の企業ログインを使用できます。オンボーディングとオフボーディングが簡単になります。</p><p>Microsoft では、このビジョンは 2000 年代初頭に SAML、WS-Security、WS-Federation から始まりましたが、OIDC が転換点に達したのは 2013 年になってからでした。この道のりには時間がかかりましたが、その結果はまさに変革をもたらすものでした。</p></blockquote>まぁ、この辺りまでは歴史の話ですな。 <br> <blockquote> Open ID AuthZEN  Fast forward a decade to 2024: the same "N * M" problem exists in the authorization space. Every corporate application has its own way of assigning permissions to users. And the solution is similar to how applications have externalized authentication to an OIDC-compliant IDP: externalizing authorization to an AuthZEN-compliant Policy Decision Point (PDP).  Applications that do this not only save a bunch of time and effort rolling out their own bespoke authorization. They also allow IT administrators to enforce common policies across applications, ensure compliance across applications, and answer questions like "which users have access to which resources" across applications.  While authorization vendors want to differentiate on expressing policies, ensuring compliance, facilitating forensics, and managing authorization at scale, none of us really care about what the authorization API actually looks like. We all have similar APIs that are arbitrarily different, and they are not a real source of differentiation.  Standardizing the way a policy enforcement point (PEP) such as an application or API gateway calls an authorization platform (PDP) greatly reduces the friction of integrating the PEP with a wide variety of authorization solutions. It helps everyone:    Applications and API gateways can integrate with a bunch of externalized authorization systems using a single API, instead of creating bespoke integrations with each.  Authorization platforms become relevant to a broader set of applications and other policy enforcement points.  IT Administrators have a single "Authorization control plane" to manage policies and entitlements, and answer questions such as "what resources does this user have access to".&nbsp;   </blockquote><blockquote> OpenID AuthZEN <p>10 年後の 2024 年、同じ「N * M」問題が認可の分野で存在します。すべての企業アプリケーションには、ユーザーに権限を割り当てる独自の方法があります。そして、その解決策は、アプリケーションが認証を OIDC 準拠の IDP に外部化する方法と似ています。つまり、認可を AuthZEN 準拠のポリシー決定ポイント (PDP) に外部化します。</p><p>これを実行するアプリケーションは、独自のカスタム認証を展開する時間と労力を大幅に節約するだけではありません。IT 管理者は、アプリケーション間で共通のポリシーを適用し、アプリケーション間でコンプライアンスを確保し、アプリケーション間で「どのユーザーがどのリソースにアクセスできるか」などの質問に答えることもできます。</p><p>認可ベンダーは、ポリシーの表現、コンプライアンスの確保、フォレンジックの促進、大規模な認可の管理で差別化を図りたいと考えていますが、認可 API が実際にどのようなものであるかについては、誰も気にしていません。ベンダーは皆、任意に異なる類似の API を持っており、それらは差別化の本当の源ではありません。</p><p>アプリケーションや API ゲートウェイなどのポリシー適用ポイント (PEP) が認可プラットフォーム (PDP) を呼び出す方法を標準化すると、PEP をさまざまな認可ソリューションと統合する際の摩擦が大幅に軽減されます。これにより、すべての人が次のメリットを享受できます。</p><p></p>  アプリケーションと API ゲートウェイは、それぞれにカスタマイズされた統合を作成する代わりに、単一の API を使用して多数の外部認証システムと統合できます。  認可プラットフォームは、より広範なアプリケーションやその他のポリシー適用ポイントに関連するようになります。  IT 管理者は、ポリシーと権限を管理し、「このユーザーはどのリソースにアクセスできるか」などの質問に答えるための単一の「承認コントロール プレーン」を持ちます。&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjR4bCBPb8jhJqlUba6pi5T6Du4rNMg7Gv35yqm0FuBuKkwrZ10bZFftT1gZ8KvAnhxTckJ-WNrrZ_EdfEHI6Au7urr-3i7Mg1Ut9nwEEu52d2qrfXgZZFUm5ntjYzKg8uG4_Jl8z8OHKrGrmzIJTEn0A8J4QDKP3EcNREezXh2AzDbSr6nICfnpGbQwkmZ"></a> <br><br><p></p><p>まぁ、この手の仕組みとして非常にオーソドックスなアプローチですね。PDPを一箇所に集めて、PEPはそのAPIを通じて呼び出すという仕掛けですね。</p><blockquote> What does this milestone mean? <p>So standardizing authorization is important. Why celebrate this milestone?</p><p>We started the OpenID AuthZEN WG in late October 2023. In one short year, we've been able to define a number of iterations of our first spec, the PEP-PDP API.

This also means that Policy Enforcement Points, such as API Gateways, SaaS applications, and identity providers can start calling out to AuthZEN PDPs to make authorization decisions.</p></blockquote><blockquote> このマイルストーンは何を意味するのでしょうか? <p>したがって、認可の標準化は重要です。なぜこのマイルストーンを祝うのでしょうか?</p><p>私たちは、2023 年 10 月下旬に OpenID AuthZEN WG を開始しました。わずか 1 年で、最初の仕様であるPEP-PDP APIの反復を何度も定義することができました。現在、この仕様のプレビュー バージョンの相互運用可能な実装が 13 個あります。</p><p>私たちは、Identiverse 2024 と EIC 2024 で実施した相互運用イベントから多くのことを学び、現在は実装者ドラフトの候補が揃っています。</p><p>このマイルストーンは、ベンダーが仕様が「自分たちの下に移る」ことを心配することなく、AuthZEN を自社の製品に安全に組み込むことができることを意味します。これはまた、API ゲートウェイ、SaaS アプリケーション、ID プロバイダーなどのポリシー適用ポイントが、AuthZEN PDP を呼び出して承認の決定を下せるようになることも意味します。</p></blockquote><p>そう、このAuthZENワーキンググループはまだ1年経ってないんですよね。1年未満でImplementer's draftが出てくるのは異常なスピード感ですね。また、書いてある通り13の相互運用性が確認できる実装があるのもすごいことです。</p><p>ちなみに相互運用性検証の結果はこちらで見れます。</p><p><a href="https://authzen-interop.net/">https://authzen-interop.net/</a></p><p><br></p><blockquote> What's next? <p>The review and voting period extends through November 9, 2024. At that point, we will have a formal Implementer's Draft.</p><p>Aserto is committed to incorporating AuthZEN in a first-class way into our authorization engine, Topaz, as well as our commercial products.</p><p>In addition, we're looking forward to working with the community to create developer SDKs for a wide variety of languages, and working with API gateway vendors to make it trivial to call an AuthZEN-compliant PDP from a request filter.</p><p>The next AuthZEN interop event is at Authenticate 2024 on October 15, 2024.

We will define a search API which standardizes answering questions like "which resources does this user have access to", and "which users can access this resource".</p><p>We also plan on defining ways in which upstream data sources can send data updates to policy decision points and policy information points, so that PDPs can have the latest user, group, and relationship information when evaluating access decisions.</p></blockquote><blockquote> 今後の仕事 <p>AuthZEN には高い目標があります。 「このユーザーはどのリソースにアクセスできるか」や「どのユーザーがこのリソースにアクセスできるのか」といった質問への回答を標準化する検索 API を定義します。</p><p>また、上流のデータ ソースがポリシー決定ポイントとポリシー情報ポイントにデータ更新を送信する方法も定義する予定です。これにより、PDP はアクセス決定を評価する際に最新のユーザー、グループ、関係情報を取得できるようになります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>今後の動きに期待です！楽しみですね。</p><p><br></p><p>今回はイントロということでしたので、次から実際の仕様を見ていこうと思います。</p><p><br></p>

<p>What is a self addressing identifier, a SAID? What does this mean and how is a SAID created and verified? This post answers these questions. We show a generalized process for calculating SAIDs and delve into the encoding format for CESR-compliant self addressing identifiers. Examples with three popular algorithms, SHA2-256, SHA3-256, and Blake3-256, show specifics of applying the general process. This general process can be used for calculating SAIDs with other cryptographic algorithms. </p>
 



<p>For those who want to skim there are pictures below including bit diagrams that illustrate exactly what is happening.</p>



 What is a SAID? 



<p>Fundamentally, a SAID is a cryptographic digest of a given set of data and is embedded within the data it is a digest of. A CESR-style SAID pads the digest to 33 bytes and adds a type code into the padded digest to replace resulting Base64 pad characters. It looks like this:</p>



 <code>HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6</code> 



<p>This is a SHA3-256 digest encoded in the CESR format. </p>



<p>What is the CESR format? It is the Base64 URL Safe encoding of the raw digest along with some front-padding of zero bits and a type code, as shown in detail below. From the above SAID, the ‘H’ character is the type code. The rest of the string is composed of Base64 URL Safe characters.</p>



 Why Base64? More Space 



<p>Why was Base64 encoding used rather than something like hex encoding? Because Base64 encoding allows maximally compact text encoding of data using a well-known encoding protocol of alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z, -_). As compared to hexadecimal (“hex”) encoding Base64 encodes 6 bits of data per Base64 character whereas hex encoding encodes 4 bits of data per Base64 character, so Base64 can store 50% more data in the same space compared to hex. This helps reduce bandwidth and power costs, optimizing performance overall.</p>



 Note on Hash or Digest Terminology 



<p>A note on terminology, sometimes digests are called hashes or hash values. The technical definition of the term hash refers to a hash function. Hash functions transform data into a fixed-size string. This fixed-size string is the digest, the output of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hash function</a>. </p>



<p>Back to SAIDs, the fact that a SAID can be embedded in the data it is a digest of is why it is called “self addressing.” The digest is essentially a unique identifier of the data it is embedded in.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A SAID (Self-Addressing Identifier) is a special type of content-addressable identifier based on an encoded cryptographic digest that is self-referential.</p>
Composable Event Streaming Representation ToIP Specification – Section 12.6 – Dr. Samuel A. Smith</blockquote>



<p>What is a content addressable identifier? A content addressable identifier is an identifier derived from the content being stored which makes a useful lookup key in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">content addressable storage</a>, such as IPFS or a key-value store database like LevelDB, LMDB, Redis, DynamoDB, Couchbase, Memcached, or Cassandra.</p>



 Embedding a digest changes the source data and hash, right? 



<p>How can the SAID digest could be accurate given that placing the SAID in the data it identifies changes the data, thus producing a different hash? The way SAIDs accomplish this is with a two step generation and embedding process.</p>



 Two step SAID generation and embedding process 



 
 During SAID calculation the destination field of the SAID is filled with pound sign filler characters (“#”) up to the same length of the SAID.  



 The digest is then calculated, encoded, and placed in the destination field.  
 



<p>The reverse occurs for verification of a SAID. </p>



 
 The SAID is replaced with filler ‘#’ characters up to the same length of the SAID. 



 The digest is calculated, encoded and compared with the SAID 
 



<p>How does the generation step work? This question kicks off a larger discussion about CESR-style encoding of cryptographic digests using pre-padding and type codes. First, let’s start with some code examples that cut right to the chase. You can come back to these examples after reading the post if they don’t make sense to you at first.</p>



 Code examples with multiple algorithms 



<p>Let’s start with some code examples showing how to create a correct SAID including the appropriate pre-padding characters. For additional understanding come back and review these examples after you have read the sections on 24 bit boundaries, pad characters, and pad bytes.</p>



<p>For now, say you want to use other cryptographic digest algorithms to create your SAIDs. How would you go about doing that?</p>



<p>It is as easy as changing your hashing function and then using the corresponding type code from the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#master-code-table-for-genusversion-aaacaa-keriacdc-protocol-stack-version-200">CESR Master Code Table</a> corresponding to your desired digest algorithm.</p>



<p>The following code examples in Python illustrate the process for each of the following algorithms, Blake2b-256, Blake3-256, and SHA2-256. The SHA3-256 algorithm is shown above in the example in the main body of the article.</p>



 Filler ‘#’ characters in digest ‘d’ field 



<p>The following examples all use the raw value that includes the filler ‘#’ pound sign characters for the digest field ‘d’ which will both be explained later. The “d” digest field is supposed to contain the same number of filler characters as the eventual SAID that will replace the filler characters.</p>



 Creating a Blake2b-256 SAID – Step By Step 



<p>For a Blake2b-256 SAID with Python you just change the hash function and specify a digest size.</p>


  import hashlib
from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode

raw_value = b'{"d":"############################################","first":"john","last":"doe"}'
digest          = hashlib.blake2b(raw_value, digest_size=32).digest()  # &lt;-- See the different algorithm blake2b
padded_digest   = b'\x00' + digest
encoded         = urlsafe_b64encode(padded_digest)
b64_str_list    = list(encoded.decode()) # convert bytes to string of chars for easy replacement of 'A'
b64_str_list[0] = 'F'                    # replace first 'A' character with 'F' type code
b64_str         = ''.join(b64_str_list)  # convert string of chars to string with .join()
assert b64_str      == 'FFfZ4GYhyBRBEP3oTgim3AAfJS0nPcqEGNOGAiAZgW4Q'
assert len(b64_str) == 44                # length should still be 44 characters, 264 base64 bits, a multiple of 24 bits
  


 Creating a Blake3-256 SAID – Step By Step 



<p>Blake3-256 is even easier, though it requires the <code>blake</code> library</p>


  import blake3
from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode

raw_value = b'{"d":"############################################","first":"john","last":"doe"}'
digest          = blake3.blake3(raw_value).digest()  # &lt;-- See the different algorithm blake3.blake3
padded_digest   = b'\x00' + digest
encoded         = urlsafe_b64encode(padded_digest)
b64_str_list    = list(encoded.decode()) # convert bytes to string of chars for easy replacement of 'A'
b64_str_list[0] = 'E'                    # replace first 'A' character with 'E' type code
b64_str         = ''.join(b64_str_list)  # convert string of chars to string with .join()
assert b64_str      == 'EKITsBR9udlRGaSGKq87k8bgDozGWElqEOFiXFjHJi8Y'
assert len(b64_str) = 44                 # length should still be 44 characters, 264 base64 bits, a multiple of 24 bits
  


 Creating a SHA2-256 SAID – Step By Step 



<p>And finally SHA2-256 is also easy, just changing the hash function used:</p>


  import hashlib
from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode

raw_value = b'{"d":"############################################","first":"john","last":"doe"}'
digest          = hashlib.sha256(raw_value).digest()  # &lt;-- See the different algorithm sha3_256
padded_digest   = b'\x00' + digest
encoded         = urlsafe_b64encode(padded_digest)
b64_str_list    = list(encoded.decode()) # convert bytes to string of chars for easy replacement of 'A'
b64_str_list[0] = 'I'                    # replace first 'A' character with 'I' type code
b64_str         = ''.join(b64_str_list)  # convert string of chars to string with .join()
assert b64_str     == 'IDuyELkLPw5raKP32c7XPA7JCp0OOg8kvfXUewhZG3fd'
assert len(b64_str) == 44                # length should still be 44 characters, 264 base64 bits, a multiple of 24 bits
  


<p>Now on to a visual introduction.</p>



 Visual Introduction to SAID 



<p>Here is a SAID using the SHA3-256 algorithm on the sample JSON object used in this post.</p>



 <code>HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6</code> 



<p>Adding this SAID to a document looks like taking the following JSON,</p>







<p>computing the SAID, encoding it, and placing it in the SAID field, or digest field, which is the “d” field in this example:</p>







<p>The ‘H’ character is highlighted here to draw attention to the fact that is a special character. This special character is the type code in the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#master-code-table-for-genusversion-aaacaa-keriacdc-protocol-stack-version-200">CESR Master Code Table</a>. This indicates the type of cryptographic algorithm being used, SHA3-256 in this case.</p>



 I see a problem… 



<p>Those new to calculating and encoding SAIDs often encounter a problem here. If you take the raw Base64 encoded value of the JSON value <code>{"d":"","first":"john","last":"doe"}</code> then you end up with the string value <code>eyJkIjoiIiwiZmlyc3QiOiJqb2huIiwibGFzdCI6ImRvZSJ9</code>, which is nowhere close to the value shown in the picture of <code>HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6</code>. Why are they different?</p>



<p>Doing a plain Base64 encoding of the JSON bytes misses an important step, the encoding step referred to above. The rest of the post dives deep into this encoding as it shows and explains how to construct a correct, CESR-encoded, SAID digest and explains the rationale behind why CESR encoding is designed the way it is.</p>



 Five parts of a SAID (SAID)? 



<p>As mentioned earlier, a SAID is a cryptographic digest. Specifically, it is a kind of digest usable as a content addressable identifier, and it is embedded in the content it identifies. SAIDs were invented by <a href="https://keri.one/131-2/">Dr. Samuel Smith</a> as a part of his work on key event receipt infrastructure (<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">KERI</a>), authentic chained data containers (<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/">ACDC</a>), and composable event streaming representation (<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a>). </p>



<p>To understand how SAIDs work you must learn the interplay of five different concepts including:</p>



 
 Bit boundaries – aligning on 24 bit boundaries using pre-padded bytes on the left/front of raw bytes  



 Hash values – hashing input bytes with hashing functions to produce output hash values (digests) 



 Encoding with the URL-safe variant of Base64 encoding,  



 Using type codes to indicate type of hashing function and size of digest, 



 The two-pass SAID calculation and embedding process.  
 



<p>This article specifically covers  SAIDs that are encoded in the CESR format. These CESR-style SAIDs</p>



 
 use pre-padding of pad bytes for bit padding to align on 24 bit boundaries,  



 are compatible with a variety of common hashing functions,  



 are encoded in the URL-safe variant of Base64 encoding (a.k.a. Base64URL),  



 substitute type codes from the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#master-code-table-for-genusversion-aaacaa-keriacdc-protocol-stack-version-200">CESR Master code table (section 12.4.2)</a> for ‘A’ front zero characters 



 and are calculated from and embedded in the data they identify. 
 



 How does it work? How are SAIDs calculated? 



<p>The easiest way to understand a self addressing identifier is to create one. Starting with the JSON from above we walk through each of the five major concepts required to create a CESR encoded SAID. </p>



 7 Steps to Calculate and Embed a SAID 



<p>Briefly, the process is listed here. A detailed explanation and example follows this set of steps.</p>



 
 Get an object to calculate a SAID for with a digest field that will hold the SAID. In this case we use the JSON object below and the “d” field will hold the SAID. 
 
 The field does not have to be empty though it can be. Prior to digest calculation it will be cleared and filled with the correct number of filler characters. 
 
 



 Calculate the quantity of Base64 characters the final encoded bytes will take up and fill the digest field with that many ‘#’ characters. This value may be looked up from a parse table like the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#master-code-table-for-genusversion-aaacaa-keriacdc-protocol-stack-version-200">CESR Master Code Table</a> based on the type of hashing function used.
 
 Replace the contents of the digest field, “d” in our case, with pound sign (“#”) characters up to the number of filler characters calculated in step 2.  



 The calculated size and pad values used for this step are reused in step 4. 
 
 



 Calculate a digest of the object with the filler ‘#’ characters added using the hash function selected.
 
 This will result in a quantity of digest bytes, specifically 32 bytes for the SHA3-256 algorithm. 
 
 



 Calculate the quantity of pad bytes that when added to the digest bytes will give you a value length that is multiple of 24 bits. This math is shown below. For us this is 1 pad character giving us 33 bytes. This value may be looked up from a parse table like the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#master-code-table-for-genusversion-aaacaa-keriacdc-protocol-stack-version-200">CESR Master Code Table</a>.
 
 Perform pre-padding by prepending the pad byte to the digest bytes to get padded raw bytes.  
 
 



 Encode the padded raw bytes with the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648#section-5">Base64 URL Safe</a> alphabet.
 
 Pre-padding causes some characters at the start of the digest to be encoded as “A” characters which represent zero in the Base64 URL Safe alphabet. 
 
 



 Substitute the type code for the correct number of “A” zero character(s)  in the Base64 encoded string according to the CESR encoding rules from the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#master-code-table-for-genusversion-aaacaa-keriacdc-protocol-stack-version-200">CESR Master Code Table</a>. Use the type code corresponding to the cryptographic hash algorithm used. In our case this is “H” because we are using the SHA3-256 algorithm.
 
 This is your SAID! 
 
 



 Place the Base64 encoded, type code substituted string (your SAID!) into the digest field in your object. This makes your object self-addressing. 
 



 3 Steps to Verify a SAID 



 
 Start with a SAID from an object you already have. 



 Calculate the SAID for the object using the process shown above 



 Compare the SAID you pulled out of the object with the SAID you calculated.
 
 If they match then the SAID verifies. Otherwise the SAID does not verify. 
 
 
 



<p>An illustration will make clear why and how this process is done. Let’s walk through an example with a small JSON object. The concept applies to any size JSON object and objects of any serialization format such as CBOR, MessagePack, arbitrary text, or otherwise.</p>



 Example walkthrough with JSON and SHA3-256 



 Create Step 1: Get an object with some data and a digest field 



<p>Starting with the JSON below we have a “d” field, or digest field, in which the SAID will eventually be placed. In our case it is empty though it could start with the SAID in the “d” field and the process would still work.</p>



 <code>JSON being SAIDified:
{
  "d": "", 
  "first": "john",
  "last": "doe"
}</code> 



 Create Step 2: Calculate the quantity of filler ‘#’ characters 



<p>The expected final size of the SAID must be known in advance in order to create a JSON object with a stable size. Calculating this quantity requires that you understand a major concept in CESR:</p>



 
 How to calculate pad sizes (quantity of pad bytes) and full sizes of values. 
 



<p>Understanding this calculation will get you most of the way towards understanding another major CESR concept called “fully qualified Base64 representation” of a cryptographic primitive. A digest is a kind of cryptographic primitive.</p>



<p>Knowing the size in advance, and having it be stable, is critical for CESR’s  type, length, value (TLV) encoding scheme. This stable size is achieved by filling the digest field with the same number of pound sign ‘#’ characters as the size of the SAID, which looks like this:</p>



 Correct number of filler characters added to digest field 



 <code>{
  "d": "############################################", 
  "first": "john",
  "last": "doe"
}</code> 



<p>This enables the JSON to have the same size during and after the SAID calculation process, giving a stable size. In order to know the number of filler characters then you must calculate how many Base64 characters will be in the final SAID. Calculating how many Base64 characters are needed involves summing raw bytes and pad bytes needed to align on what is called a 24 bit boundary.</p>



 Final output has same size since Base64 characters count equals filler length 



<p>Aligning on this 24 bit boundary allows the final result with the SAID to have the same length as the version with the filler characters, 44 characters in our case:</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6", 
  "first": "john",
  "last": "doe"
}</code> 



<p>Remember when the “encoding” step was mentioned from above?  That’s where this filler character and size calculation knowledge comes in. In this encoding step you learn about the CESR-style encoding using pre-padding, pre-conversion. Knowing how many filler characters to use requires understanding the concept of aligning on a 24 bit boundary. Aligning on a 24 bit boundary is where the pre-padding of CESR comes in. This calculation of pad bytes required to align on a 24 bit boundary is the primary difference between raw, or “naive”, Base64 encoding and CESR encoding. </p>



<p>First let’s delve into what a 24 bit boundary is, why it matters to Base64 encoded values, and then look at some diagrams that make Base64 post-padding and CESR pre-padding clear. In doing this we jump ahead a bit and show byte diagrams of the actual encoded digest since that will help introduce later steps.</p>



 24 bit boundary – from Base64 



<p>The 24 bit boundary comes from the Base64 encoding format standard, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648#section-4">RFC4648</a>, specifically <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648">section 4</a>. The reason a 24 bit boundary matters is because you can only use whole Base64 characters; there is no such thing as a fractional Base64 character. A Base64 character represents 6 bits of your raw bytes. A single byte is 8 bits. How do you reconcile the 6 bit Base64 character encoding to the 8 bits of your raw bytes? This is where a little math comes in, specifically the least common multiple.</p>



<p>Section 4 of the Base64 RFC 4648 describes the 24-bit groups that are the origin of the 24-bit boundary:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output strings of 4 encoded characters. Proceeding from left to right, a 24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8-bit input groups. These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit groups, each<br>of which is translated into a single character in the base 64 alphabet.</p>
RFC 4648 The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings – Section 4</blockquote>



<p>Using these 24-bit groups ensures the value coming out of a Base64 decoder is the same value you put in. Separating raw bits into these 24 bit groups is where the phrase “aligning on 24 bit boundaries” comes from. </p>



<p>Splitting the 8-bit groups up into 6-bit groups requires a little math because 8 does not split evenly into 6. The math equation to do this is the least common multiple (LCM). LCM is used to determine the lowest number that both 8 and 6 divide into evenly, which is 24, thus the need for 24-bit groups, or 24-bit boundaries. Any value that is encoded into Base64 characters must be padded to reach a multiple of 24 bits. These 24-bit groupings allows you to cleanly convert all of your 8-bit bytes in to 6-bit Base64 characters and back to bytes without missing any bits.</p>



<p>Yet, if we have a stream that does not align on a 24 bit boundary then how do we create that alignment? </p>



 
 Pad characters on the END of a string are the answer to this in Base64.  
 







<p>By adding the correct number of pad characters on the end of a Base64 stream then you always end up with a value aligned on a 24 bit boundary. The ‘=’ equals sign pad characters in a plain Base64 encoding indicate the quantity of pad bits that were used in the final Base64 character adjacent to the ‘=’ pad characters.</p>



 
 Pad bytes at the START of the raw bytes are the answer to this in CESR.  
 







<p>By prepending the correct number of pad bytes on the start of a set of raw digest bytes then you always end up with a value aligned on a 24 bit boundary. Since the pad bytes are all zero bits then the resulting encoded value will start with one or more ‘A’ characters since they correspond to all zero bits in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Base64_table_from_RFC_4648">Base64 alphabet</a>.</p>



 Pad characters Calculation 



<p>In a plain Base64 encoding when encoding an array of bytes into Base64 that does not align on a 24 bit boundary the correct number of Base64 pad characters ‘=’ must be included. Why? Because in order to avoid data corruption in the decoded value you must know the precise original value, which means knowing how many pad characters to strip off and how many pad bits to strip out of the Base64 character adjacent to the padding. The decoder of your Base64 character needs to know how many bits of the last character used were just padding and how many were a part of your raw value. </p>



<p>You must signal the end of your raw bytes somehow. If, instead, you ignore, drop, or omit pad characters then you will confuse a Base64 decoder into thinking that pad bits were a part of your raw bytes, which you want to avoid because that will give you a different output value than what your input value was, meaning you would experience data corruption.</p>



<p>Pad characters must be included with a plain or “naïve” Base64 encoded value so that a Base64 decoder can strip the correct number of pad bits from the output giving you your original input bytes when decoding from Base64 characters to raw bytes. This is the purpose that Base64 pad characters serve. The pad characters indicate how many pad byes were used to encode a value in Base64.</p>



<p>CESR uses pad bytes and characters in a similar way, yet on the front, and with pre-conversion padding, so the rules for identifying and stripping pad bits are slightly different.</p>



<p>Yet, let’s stick with Base64 padding for now and come back to CESR padding later. If you are starting to get confused or lost then skip ahead to the diagrams below and come back to this explanation.</p>



 ASIDE – Calculating the quantity of Base64 pad characters based on input byte quantity 



<p>For a SHA3-256 digest this count is 44 characters. See the math below for an explanation. This number may also be found in the CESR Master Code Table for the type of algorithm used. Since we measure every raw value in terms of bytes (8 bits) then there are three possible scenarios, detailed <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648#section-4">here in the Base64 RFC</a>, for the number of pad bytes required and thus pad characters.</p>



 
 A value ending with a single byte (8 bits) beyond a 24 bit boundary requires two bytes (16 bits) to meet a 24 bit boundary. This will have two ‘=’ pad characters.
 
 This means that your 8 raw bits + the 16 padding bits (two bytes) will equal 24 bits, aligning your raw value on a 24 bit boundary. 
 
 



 A value ending with two bytes (16 bits) beyond a 24 bit boundary requires one byte (8 bits) to align on a 24 bit boundary. This will have one ‘=’ pad character.
 
 Take the 16 bits +  one pad byte (8 bits) to get to 24 bits to align on the 24 bit boundary. 
 
 



 A value ending with three bytes is already aligned on a 24 bit boundary (3 * 8 = 24) 
 



<p>You can use the modulus operator ‘%’ to determine the number of ending bits you have. For 256 bits (32 bytes * 8 bits per byte) you end up with 16 bits, or two bytes, rule number two above. So we need the equivalent of one pad byte. </p>



 How Base64 handles pad bits 



<p>The way that Base64 handles the need for pad bytes is to split the last byte into two characters, add zero bits to the last Base64 character, and then add the correct number of pad ‘=’ equals sign characters to the final output to end up with groups of 4 Base64 characters, which aligns on a 24 bit boundary because 4 * 6 bits per Base64 character = 24 bits.</p>



 What this means for a SAID – Calculating Pre-pad Bytes for CESR 



<p>In CESR padding is handled a bit differently because it repurposes the pad characters for type codes in its TLV encoding scheme. This means that what would have been zero bits representing ‘A’ characters in the Base64 encoded CESR value gets replaced with the type code, also called derivation code, in the final CESR value. To accomplish this CESR does pre-padding prior to conversion to Base64 characters. What this means for SAIDs is that all digest bytes must be padded at the front of the digest bytes to reach a multiple of 24 bits. Compare this to Base64 padding which occurs at the end of the digest bytes. Both scenarios are pictured below, Base64 padding and CESR padding. </p>



<p>Since the SHA3-256 digest we start with is 32 bytes, or 256 bits (not a multiple of 24), then all we need to add is one byte to get to 264 bits, which is a multiple of 24, or 33 bytes.</p>



<p>Now once you know the quantity of bytes that align on a 24 bit boundary you can do a simple calculation to get to the number of pad characters for your digest. Since 6 bits of every byte are put into a Base64 character (6 bit groups) then you can divide your total number of bits (264) by 6 to get the number of Base64 characters of your final digest.</p>



<p>264 (bits) / 6 (bits per Base64 char) = 44 (Base64 chars)</p>



<p>This means the total length of the resulting SAID will be 44 Base64 characters. So, you need 44 filler ‘#’ pound sign characters in your digest field of your JSON object prior to calculating the SAID.</p>



 Fixed width output – why is it needed? 



<p>Consistent sizing of the resulting JSON object for stable size of the overall output is the primary reason for pad characters. In order to create the same size output both before and after the SAID is added into the JSON there must be an equivalently sized number of pound signs (44 in this case) placed into the same field where the SAID will go. This is used in CESR encoding because CESR data types are encoded with to a type, length, and value scheme (TLV scheme) that simplifies parsing. Size of the overall output is the length, or “L,” in TLV and it only works if you have a known width data.</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "############################################", 
  "first": "john",
  "last": "doe"
}</code> 



<p>Now that you know the rules for calculating the number of pad characters then we are ready to illustrate the calculation process with diagrams.</p>



 Diagram for plain “naïve” Base64 encoding of SHA3-256 digest 



<p>Base64 uses post-padding, post-conversion of pad characters, as shown in the diagram below. You start with the raw digest. All the boxes in this diagram represent the raw bytes of the digest. There is no padding yet because the value is raw and is not yet converted to Base64 characters.</p>







 Binary bits of 32 byte SHA3-256 digest of above JSON with ‘#’ filler 



<p>For those following along in code the raw bytes of the 32 byte SHA3-256 digest of the JSON above (with the ‘#’ filler characters) are represented in binary as follows:</p>



 <code>1111001001011011010101100010111010011111011001101111000110001101000010000000010010000011100010110000000000000001100111110110110000101001010000110100100101001000111110110110011100010001110100110010011010101000010001000100101011100100000011111110100011111010</code> 



<p>Take a look at the last two bytes are <code>11101000</code> and <code>11111010</code>. This factors in to the last two characters adjacent to the pad character as you see below.</p>



<p>Encode this 32 byte digest to Base64 URL Safe and you get get:</p>







<p>What happened here is that four bits (<code>1010</code>) of the last byte ( <code>11111010</code>) were encoded into the last character lowercase ‘o’ adjacent to the pad character. If you look at the value for lowercase o in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64 alphabet</a> you will see that lowercase ‘o’ has the bit pattern <code>101000</code>. Yet it only pulled four bits from the last byte of <code>11111010</code> so where did the last two bits (<code>00</code>) come from? They were added in by the Base64 encoder. These two pad bits are why the corresponding final value has a single equals sign ‘=’ pad character. That instructs the Base64 encoder to strip two bits from the last character during the decoding process:</p>







<p>IMPORTANT: Base64 does not add the padding to the raw bytes prior to conversion. Instead it adds the padding while converting the 6 bit groups of the raw bytes into Base64 characters. </p>



<p>Due to the fact that 32 bytes, 256 bits, does not evenly align on a 24 bit boundary, is not a multiple of 24, the Base64 encoder splits the last byte into two different Base64 characters since 8 bits does not evenly fit in one 6 bit group and must be spread across two 6-bit groups. Each of these 6 bit groups each get their own Base64 character. In this case, the last two bytes <code>11101000</code> and <code>11111010</code> get spread across the last two characters ‘P’ (<code>001111</code>) and ‘o’ (<code>101000</code>). </p>



<p>Because of how the math works when splitting the 8-bit byte groups into 6-bit Base64 character groups the ‘o’ character got four bits from the very end of the digest. Yet four bits is not enough for a Base64 character so the Base64 encoder adds two zero bits on the end, signified with white boxes containing zeroes. Before the pad character is added then we are at 43 Base64 characters (6 bit groups, 258 bits), which is not a multiple of 24 bits. When the pad character ‘=’ is added then we get to a 44 characters (264), which is a multiple of 24 bits, meaning the encoding completed successfully.</p>



 Base64 Encoded SHA3-256 Digest 



<p>With the fully padded value you end up with a valid, encoded, Base64 value that looks like the following bit diagram:</p>







<p>The C2 character at the end shares some bits with the raw bytes of the digest and also contains some padding zero bits. The last character, C1, is an equals sign ‘=’ pad character. The fact that there is one pad character indicates to the Base64 decoder that there are two zeroed pad bits to remove from the last character, ‘C2’, during decoding in order to get back to the original digest bytes.</p>



 ‘=’ is wasted space? 



<p>You could consider the pad characters ‘=’ as wasted space that could be useful if repurposed. All of the pad bits used for the equals sign could represent something. This is exactly what CESR does except it moves the padding to the front of the bytes so that it can have a uniform TLV encoding format. TLV encoding formats require the type character to be at the front of the value, so using post-padding like Base64 does would not work.</p>



<p>Along these same lines, SAIDs do not use Base64-style padding because it does not enable separability of individual concatenated values due to the fact that there is no easy way to cleanly and reliably separate individual values out of a Base64 encoded stream of bytes. The <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#introduction">CESR specification introduction</a> mentions this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This Composability property enables the round-trip conversion en-masse of concatenated Primitives between the text domain and binary domain while maintaining the separability of individual Primitives.</p>
Composable Event Streaming Representation ToIP specification – Dr. Sam Smith</blockquote>



<p>Now that you understand how the plain or “naïve” Base64 encoding works then we turn our attention to CESR style pre-padding. </p>



 CESR Byte Padding: Pre-padding, Pre-conversion 



<p>In CESR the padding of values occurs with the raw bytes prior to encoding to Base64 as shown below in the white box containing ‘B33.’</p>







<p>What this means is that the raw value, prior to conversion, already aligns on a 24 bit boundary. Due to this alignment pre-conversion then there will never be any Base64 pad characters ‘=’ in the output.</p>



 How many bytes to prepend? 



<p>How do you know how many bytes to prepend? With a similar calculation we did above to find the number of filler characters</p>



<p>Since the SHA3-256 digest we start with is 32 bytes, or 256 bits (not a multiple of 24), then all we need to add is one byte to get to 264 bits, which is a multiple of 24, or 33 bytes.</p>



<p>Again, once you know the quantity of bytes that align on a 24 bit boundary you can do a simple calculation to get to the number of pad characters for your digest. Since 6 bits of every byte are put into a Base64 character (6 bit groups) then you can divide your total number of bits (264) by 6 to get the number of Base64 characters of your final digest.</p>



<p>264 (bits) / 6 (bits per Base64 character) = 44 (Base64 Characters)</p>



<p>So 44 will be the quantity of filler characters to put into the JSON object in order to calculate a SAID.</p>



 What happens when prepending bytes for CESR style encodings? 



<p>When encoding a value that requires padding with CESR-style padding (up front), instead of ‘=’ at the end like Base64-style padding would produce you end up with ‘A’ characters on the front of your encoded value. You also end up with the one character adjacent to the ‘A’ character(s) including some pad bits and some raw bits, as shown below in the bit diagram. </p>



<p>The intermediate encoded value looks like the below value that is not yet a SAID. This is not yet a SAID because the ‘A’ character has not yet been replaced with a type code from the TLV scheme indicating this is a SHA3-256 digest.</p>







<p>This ‘A’ character represents all zero bits (<code>000000</code>) in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64 alphabet</a>.</p>



<p>In binary the full, pre-padded digest value (all 33 bytes) looks like the following. Notice the zero bits at the front.</p>



 <code>000000001111001001011011010101100010111010011111011001101111000110001101000010000000010010000011100010110000000000000001100111110110110000101001010000110100100101001000111110110110011100010001110100110010011010101000010001000100101011100100000011111110100011111010</code> 



<p>The first two bytes are <code>00000000</code> and <code>11110010</code> which get encoded into Base64 as shown below. Six of the zero pad bits get encoded as an ‘A’ character and two of the zero pad bits get included in the capital ‘P’ character which also has four bits from the next raw byte of data from the digest.</p>



 Bit diagram of Base64 encoded, CESR pre-padded raw value. 







<p>This diagram illustrates how CESR does pre-padding with pad bytes of zero bits prior to performing a Base64 encoding on the fully padded raw value. The next diagram of characters shows the space a fully padded, encoded, CESR-style value would look like.</p>







<p>As you can see, the padding is at the front of the encoded value rather than the back like Base64 does. And the character with shared pad and raw bits is adjacent to the pad character at the front of the Base64 encoded value.</p>



<p>To get to the final SAID then you replace the ‘A’ character with the appropriate type code, or derivation code, yet we are getting ahead of ourselves a bit too much. Let’s now get into the calculation of the digest.</p>



<p>This step showed you how to calculate the appropriate number of filler ‘#’ pound sign characters to put in to the digest field in your JSON object. The next step shows you how to calculate a digest of that JSON object.</p>



 Creation Step 3: Calculate a digest of the data 



<p>When calculating a digest then you take the data with the correct number of filler characters added to the digest field and you simply take a digest of it. So in our case we would take a digest of the following</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "############################################", 
  "first": "john",
  "last": "doe"
}</code> 



<p>In Python taking a digest of this data would be as simple as the following:</p>


  import hashlib

raw_value = b'{"d":"############################################","first":"john","last":"doe"}'
digest = hashlib.sha3_256(raw_value).digest()
#  hash function   ↑↑↑↑
  


<p>This is a simple step and is very similar for any other algorithm such as SHA2-256, Blake3-256 or otherwise. You use the desired type of hash function. </p>



<p>The only other thing to be aware of here is that if you create a digest that is sized differently than 32 bytes, such as a SHA3-512 digest (64 bytes) then you need to also change the number of pad bytes, which gets into the next step.</p>



 Creation Step 4: Calculate the quantity of pad bytes 



<p>The calculation for the quantity of pad bytes is very similar to the calculation for the quantity of filler ‘#’ characters needed in Step 2. In fact, it is a subset of that calculation. The goal with pad characters is to make sure that the final value aligns on a 24 bit boundary as mentioned above.</p>



<p>For example, since the SHA3-256 digest we start with is 32 bytes, or 256 bits (not a multiple of 24), then all we need to add is one byte to get to 264 bits, which is a multiple of 24, or 33 bytes.</p>



 Deeper into Modulus Math for Pad Bytes 



<p>To get a bit deeper into the math, one way to do this calculation with the modulus operator is to find out how many characters are necessary to completely fill a 3 byte group. Since 3-byte groups are multiples of 24 then you can use a modulus calculation to see how far away you are from filling a three byte group by doing a modulus 3 operation in two steps:</p>



<p>Step 1: take bytes mod 3</p>



<p>32 bytes mod 3 = 2 (bytes)</p>



<p>meaning there are two bytes already in the last group of three (24 bit boundary).</p>



<p>Step 2: subtract bytes in group from group size</p>



<p>So to see how many bytes you must add to get to the 24 bit boundary (3 byte group) you subtract the quantity of bytes you have from the group size:</p>



<p>3 (group size) – 2 (bytes in group) = 1 (pad bytes needed to fill group)</p>



<p>Due to how modulus arithmetic works you will only ever have three possible values from this equation:</p>



 
 3 – (bytes mod 3) = 0 (pad bytes) 



 3 – (bytes mod 3) = 1 (pad bytes) 



 3 – (bytes mod 3) = 2 (pad bytes) 
 



<p>You never have to worry about three pad bytes because that would be an even multiple of 24 which means your raw value would already align on a 24 bit boundary and thus not need any pad bytes.</p>



<p>So, to review, for us the calculation of <code>(3 - (32 mod 3)) = 1 pad byte</code> gives us a single pad byte to be prepended to our raw value, as shown below in the ‘B33’ box.</p>







<p>As mentioned before, CESR does pre-padding, pre-conversion which means that the pad byte we found we need is added to the front of the array of raw bytes for the SHA3-256 digest. The next step covers encoding this padded raw value.</p>



 Creation Step 5: Base64 URL Safe Encode the padded raw bytes 



<p>Now that the raw value from Step 4 is properly padded then you encode it with Base64 URL Safe encoding. CESR uses Base64 URL Safe encoding rather than plain Base64 encoding so that CESR values can safely be used in URLs and filenames. </p>


  import hashlib
from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode

raw_value = b'{"d": "############################################", "first": "john", "last": "doe"}'
digest = hashlib.sha3_256(raw_value).digest()
padded_digest = b'\x00' + digest
encoded = urlsafe_b64encode(padded_digest)
# encode to base64  ↑↑↑↑
assert encoded == b'APJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6'
assert len(encoded) == 44
  


<p>Now that you have the Base64 URL Safe encoded value then you are ready to finish off this SAID creation by replacing the ‘A’ pad character at the front of the encoded value with the appropriate value from the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#master-code-table-for-genusversion-aaacaa-keriacdc-protocol-stack-version-200">CESR Master Code Table</a>.</p>



 Creation Step 6: Substitute Type Code for the front ‘A’ character(s) 



<p>When CESR pre-padded the raw value to get to a 24 bit boundary the purpose of that was to be able to repurpose the wasted space of the pad character for a type code in CESR’s TLV encoding scheme. The ‘A’ character at the front of the value in this scheme is considered to be a pad character. This pad ‘A’ character will be replaced with the appropriate type code, or derivation code in CESR parlance, from the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#master-code-table-for-genusversion-aaacaa-keriacdc-protocol-stack-version-200">CESR Master Code Table</a>.</p>



<p>For a SHA3-256 digest that type code is ‘H’ as seen in the following subset of the CESR Master Code Table.</p>







<p>The substitution gives us a final value of <code>HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6</code> as seen in the following substitution diagram.</p>







<p>The substitution of the ‘A’ character with the ‘H’ character is the final part of what is called CESR encoding a raw digest value into a CESR-style self addressing identifier. This SAID is a front-padded, Base64 encoded, and type-code substituted, string of Base64 characters.</p>



<p>The final value can be created by the code as follows:</p>


  import hashlib
from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode

raw_value = b'{"d":"############################################","first":"john","last":"doe"}'
digest          = hashlib.sha3_256(raw_value).digest()
padded_digest   = b'\x00' + digest
encoded         = urlsafe_b64encode(padded_digest)
b64_str_list    = list(encoded.decode()) # convert bytes to string of chars for easy replacement of 'A'
b64_str_list[0] = 'H'                    # replace first 'A' character with 'H' type code
b64_str         = ''.join(b64_str_list)  # convert string of chars to string with .join()
assert b64_str      == 'HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6'
assert len(b64_str) == 44                # length should still be 44 characters, 264 base64 bits, a multiple of 24 bits
  


 Creation Step 7: Place the Front-Padded, Base64 encoded, Type-code Substituted string in the digest field 



<p>Now we can take this correctly padded, CESR encoded value and place it into the digest field in our JSON object, replacing the filler ‘#’ characters with the final, valid SAID:</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6", 
  "first": "john",
  "last": "doe"
}</code> 



<p>This takes us back to where we started off, with a valid SAID and a SAIDified JSON object.</p>



 What about verification? 



<p>What is nice about verification is that it is as simple as calculating the SAID again of a JSON object and comparing that to a SAID you are handed.</p>



 Verification Step 1: Start with a SAID from the object you already have 



<p>Say you are starting with the below object that has already had a SAID calculated and embedded in the digest field, the “d” field here.</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6", 
  "first": "john",
  "last": "doe"
}</code> 



<p>To get the SAID from this object you extract the value of the “d” field, giving you <code>HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6</code></p>



 Verification Step 2: Calculate the SAID of the object using the SAID creation steps 



<p>Verification is easy because all you need to do is take steps 1 through 6 above and re-calculate the SAID on the JSON object provided. Once you have recalculated the SAID, which will be <code>HPJbVi6fZvGNCASDiwABn2wpQ0lI-2cR0yaoRErkD-j6</code> again, you can perform the comparison in step 3.</p>



 Verification Step 3: Compare the SAID from the object to the calculated SAID 



<p>If the SAID the object started with matches the SAID you calculated from the object then you know the object has not been changed and that the SAID is valid. Otherwise either your SAID is invalid or the object has changed.</p>



 Review 



 Calculating a SAID 



<p>Now you understand how we SAIDify a JSON object by doing the following seven step process:</p>



 
 Start with a JSON object we want to add a SAID to that has a digest field. 



 Calculate the quantity of Base64 characters the final, pre-padded, encoded raw digest bytes (SAID) will take up and fill the digest field with that many ‘#’ characters. 



 Calculate a digest of the bytes of the JSON object after the ‘#’ filler characters are added. 



 Calculate the quantity of pad bytes needed to align on a 24 bit boundary and prepend that to the raw bytes for a digest. 



 Encode the padded raw bytes with the Base64URLSafe alphabet. 



 Substitute the appropriate type code in place of the ‘A’ character(s) at the front of the encoded string. This final value is your SAID 



 Place the final SAID value into the digest field of your JSON object. 
 



<p>Pre-padding and type code substitution prior to Base64 encoding is the essence of CESR-style self addressing identifiers. The steps above may seem overwhelming at first, though once you mentally anchor in that CESR pads at the start and that padding gives you ‘A’ characters you can reuse for type codes then you have mastered the fundamentals of what makes CESR style SAIDs work.</p>



 Verifying a SAID 



<p>Verification of a SAID is easy because you just calculate it again from the original JSON object, or other data object you are using. If the SAIDs match then it verifies; if they don’t then the data changed.</p>



 Extra Learning Alert – fully qualified Base64 primitive 



<p>And, as a nice side note, you happen to now know what the phrase “fully qualified base64 primitives” in KERIpy means. All that means is that your encoded value has been pre-padded, pre-conversion, and has had its type code added to the front, as we did here with substitution, with the exception that some CESR primitives</p>



 Give me a library please! I don’t want to manage these details 



<p>In case this article has convinced you that you do not ever again want to worry about the vagaries of aligning on 24 bit boundaries for Base64 or CESR values then you are in luck. There are multiple implementations of the SAID process that can meet your needs in a variety of different languages.</p>

 SAIDify 



<p>If you want to use a Typescript library that is about 530 lines of code you can go with my SAIDify library. The below example shows how to use the library with Typescript.</p>



<p>Start with an NPM install</p>



 <code>npm install saidify</code> 



<p>And then you can use the <code>saidify(data, label)</code> function to SAIDify any JavaScript object you have as long as you indicate which field is the digest field, the “label” field, which defaults to the “d” field.</p>


  import { saidify, verify } from 'saidify'

// create data to become self-addressing
const myData = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  d: '',
}
const label = 'd'
const [said, sad] = saidify(myData, label)
// said is self-addressing identifier
// sad is self-addressing data
console.log(said)
// ...Vitest test assertion
expect(said).toEqual('ELLbizIr2FJLHexNkiLZpsTWfhwUmZUicuhmoZ9049Hz')

// verify self addressing identifier
const computedSAID = 'ELLbizIr2FJLHexNkiLZpsTWfhwUmZUicuhmoZ9049Hz'
const doesVerify = verify(sad, computedSAID, label) // can verify with original myData or sad
// ...Vitest test assertion
expect(doesVerify).toEqual(true)
  


 Conclusion 



<p>The key takeaways from calculating SAIDs are:</p>



 
 Use pre-padded bytes to align on a 24 bit boundary prior to encoding as Base64 characters. 



 Substitute type codes in for the leading ‘A’ character(s) of a SAID. 



 It is easy to chose different algorithms for the SAID calculation process. Just make sure you use a code on the CESR Master Code Table if you want to be CESR compliant. 



 There are multiple implementations of the SAID algorithm you can use. 
 



<p>Now go make some SAIDs!</p>

<p>One of the problems I have encountered in trying to do Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) where a complete single document was not uploaded for queries on that document alone is that chunks created from documents for embedding often lose context. I have often considered what would be the outcome if one were to put some limited but useful context along with each chunk. Now I know. Introducing Anthropic's contextual retrieval concept.</p><p>One of my concerns with placing some additional context for each chunk is that you’d probably need to pass the entire document being chunked as context along with each individual chunk. That would be very expensive and slow. Now, with Anthropic’s Claude prompt caching, the cost and latency is reduced significantly and it seems actually doable for chunk contexting (is contexting a word?). An initial prompt including the full document could be done with that prompt cached for future prompt reference.</p><p>I plan to try this&nbsp;out.</p><p>Check out the Anthropic “<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval">Introducing Contextual Retrieval</a>” post for greater&nbsp;details.</p>

<p>
On a recent trip I saw this pair of Latin phrases tattooed on the back of a flight attendant’s arms:</p>
<p>
Left: Deo absente. Right: Deum culpa.</p>
<p>
I took Latin in middle school, and could guess what the combination might mean. It’s not a common construction, and a search seems to confirm my guess. Both Google and Bing take you to a couple of Reddit posts in r/Latin. </p>
<blockquote><p>
Would this be the correct translation?<br>
<br>
A song I like, Deus in absentia by Ghost, has that line in it intending to mean “In the absence of God”, so I was looking into alternate translations/syntax of the phrase intending to mean “In the absence of God; Blame/Fault God”. Would this make sense: “Deum in absente; Culpa Deus” or “Deus Culpa”?
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
Does the phrase “Deus In Absentia, Deus Culpa” make sense?<br>
<br>
I’m using this for a tattoo and want to be absolutely sure it works in the sense of ‘In the absence of God, blame God’. All help appreciated!
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Is that the same person I saw? If so, the responses in r/Latin seem to have guided them to the final text inked on their arms. And if so, the message is essentially what I had guessed. The intent of the message, though, is open to interpretation. I’m not quite sure how to take it. What do you think it means? Would it have been rude to ask? </p>

The agreement would let Microsoft purchase the entirety of the plant's roughly 835 megawatts of energy generation—enough to power approximately 800,000 homes—for a span of 20 years starting in 2028, pending regulatory approval."</p></blockquote><p>This seems to be the new front in datacenter technology: purchasing or building entire nuclear plants in order to cover the energy cost. It is significantly better than high-emissions power from sources like coal, but it also speaks to the increased demand that new technologies like AI represent.</p><p>As ArsTechnica points out:</p><blockquote><p>"Industry-wide, data centers demanded upward of 350 TWh of power in 2024, according to a Bloomberg analysis, up substantially from about 100 TWh in 2012. An IEA report expects those data center power needs to continue to rise in the near future, hitting the 620 to 1,050 TWh range by 2026."</p></blockquote><p>AI is a huge and growing part of that, although let's not pretend that the internet industry overall has low emissions. We often pretend we're greener than we are, simply because we can't directly see the output - but there's a lot of work to do, and a lot of carbon footprint to own up to.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/diversity/black-founded-startup-venture-funding-fearless/">Chris Metinko at Crunchbase News</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"Last year, venture funding to Black-founded U.S. startups cratered — totaling only $699 million and marking the first time since 2016 that the figure failed to even reach $1 billion, Crunchbase data shows."</p></blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote><p>"While last year did not see Black founders raise $1 billion in total, this year such founders and startups are on pace to raise less than even half-a-billion dollars. In fact, the combined total of funding to Black founders in the second half of last year and the first half this year is only $351 million."</p></blockquote><p>While some of this is a reflection of the ongoing tightening in VC overall, that certainly doesn't account for a pull-back of this magnitude.</p><p>VC is often a connections-based business: investors like to have warm introductions from people they trust. It helps to be part of the in-group, and given the demographics and backgrounds of most investors, Black founders may be excluded. Open calls for pitches help, but the single biggest thing venture teams could to do widen their net and make sure they don't miss out on talented Black founders is for their own teams to be more representative. This article doesn't directly mention whether there's been progress on that front - but the numbers suggest maybe not.</p>

   こんにちは、富士榮です。  MicrosoftからMVP（Most Valuable Professional）というアワードをいただき初めて今年で15年目、という話を前に書きましたが、最近この手のアワードやIT系の資格試験などではOpenBadge形式で資格証明がもらえることがあります。  これまで何度かイベントではOpenBadgeの中身について話をしてきましたが、要するにPNGやSVGファイルの中身（PNGならiTXt領域、SVGならopenbadge属性）へJSON-LDで記述されたクレデンシャルの情報を埋め込んでいます（OpenBadge 2.0、Hosted形式の場合）。  この埋め込み作業のことをBake（ベイク）と言い、こちらに技術仕様が公開されています。  https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p

<p></p> このとおり、IssuerはCredly社となっており、マイクロソフトが直接発行しているわけではないことがわかります。  また、OpenBadgeの特徴としてあくまで資格情報を表現するものとなっていることが挙げられます。何を言っているかというとバッジを提示する人とバッジが指し示す人が一致していることは表現していないということです。（私が他人のバッジを保持して提示することも可能。まぁ単なる画像ファイルですから当然ですね）  そのため、Verifyをする際にバッジを提示する主体とバッジが指し示す主体が一致していることを検証サイト側で行うことが必要となります。  <br>  具体的な方法としては、recipientのidentity要素に入っている値（バッジが指し示す主体）が提示してくる主体と同じことを確認することになりますので、提示する際に利用者にメールアドレス（type: emailの場合）を入力させ、    到達性確認を行うことで提示者が当該メールアドレスに対してアクセスが可能な状態であることを確認する  到達性確認ができたメールアドレスとバッジを検証URL（発行元。今回のケースだとCredly）へ投げ込む  検証URL側は自身が管理するsalt値を使って送られてきたメールアドレスの値をSHA256（もしくはMD5）でハッシュ化する  バッジの中にはいっているidentityの値と生成したハッシュ値が同一であることを確認する（提示者はバッジの中を見てもメールアドレスの値がハッシュ化されているため、誰のバッジかわからない。持ち主だけがバッジ発行時のRecipient情報として設定したメールアドレスを知っているので発行対象の主体とバッジの指し示す主体が一致しているであろうことを推測する）   この部分）                "recipient": {
                "type": "email",
                "identity": "sha256$071281e466032326ffe4c3238545d31970b2b61d75fae181a283ac0aace09264",
                "hashed": true
            },   <br>  <br>  非常に簡易的な仕組みですが、身分証明に使うわけではありませんしこのくらいのゆるさでもOKってことでしょう。  <br>  しかしVCにもVC2.0があったり、SD-JWTがあったりと複雑ですが、こういう形で教育業界でもOpenBadgeのバージョンやアーキテクチャ（Hosted/Signedなど）の混在による混乱もありそうですね。  <br>  引き続き見ていきたいと思います。  <br>   <br>

Two weeks ago, Lou Franco <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/paying-down-tech-debt">shared</a> hard-earned lessons on keeping tech debt at bay.

Industry pulse  OpenAI’s new model: o1 <p>Last week, OpenAI revealed its latest model called <a href="https://openai.com/o1/">OpenAI o1</a>. Until now, LLM models got bigger in how much data they were trained on, but o1 is a change of direction. It spends more time “thinking” before it responds: basically, it chains several LLM operations one after the other. As software engineer Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/12/openai-o1/">puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“One way to think about these new models is as a specialized extension of the chain of thought prompting pattern — the “think step by step” trick that we’ve been exploring as a a community for a couple of years now, first introduced in the paper Large <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916">Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners</a> in May 2022.”</p></blockquote><p>The new model is far more capable in its responses – even though these responses take more time to process – and brings a new dimension in how to use language models. Because the model spends more compute time on answers, it has become more expensive to use: o1 <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">costs</a> 100x as much as GPT-4o mini, and 3-6x as much as GPT-4.</p><p>This approach feels like the biggest recent development in LLMs this year. It’s worth <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/148811033/rumor-of-a-new-openai-release">withholding judgment</a> until we use it more, and learn more about its capabilities and tradeoffs.

 [Federal Trade Commission]   "A new Federal Trade Commission staff report that examines the data collection and use practices of major social media and video streaming services shows they engaged in vast surveillance of consumers in order to monetize their personal information while failing to adequately protect users online, especially children and teens."

Lina Khan is doing great work actually holding software monopolies to task.</p><p>My favorite recommendation is the first one:</p><blockquote><p>"Congress should pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation to limit surveillance, address baseline protections, and grant consumers data rights;"</p></blockquote><p>This should have happened years ago, and even now, getting it done will be a struggle.</p><p>This one, on the other hand, falls into the "and pigs should fly" category:</p><blockquote><p>"Companies should not collect sensitive information through privacy-invasive ad tracking technologies;"</p></blockquote><p>Yes, companies should not, but they will until comprehensive privacy legislation is enacted with meaningful penalties. This report is a step in the right direction; that legislation must come next.</p>

That's a big statement about the state of the web. While spam was always present, it was easier to identify and silo; AI has rendered spam unfilterable.</p><p>She no longer wants to be part of the industry at all:</p><blockquote><p>"“I don't want to work on anything that could be confused with generative AI, or that could benefit generative AI,” she wrote. “OpenAI and Google can collect their own damn data. I hope they have to pay a very high price for it, and I hope they're constantly cursing the mess that they made themselves.”"</p></blockquote><p>It's a relatable sentiment.</p>

Answering emails after hours was linked to worse productivity, employees badmouthing their employers and other negative behaviors."</p></blockquote><p>This is an important (if perhaps obvious) finding, but it's worth diving a little deeper and asking follow-on questions. Is it just the act of sending communications out of working hours? Or is it also an underlying organizational culture of disrespect for employees that allows such a thing to be normal?</p><p>The reason I ask is that one might be tempted to address the symptom - those out of hours emails - when there's likely something deeper to also take care of.</p><p>In the same vein, that's not to say that you shouldn't address the expectation of ubiquitous availability because the larger cultural work is still to be done. They clearly are bad in themselves, and do lead to exhaustion and burnout. But it seems to me that you have to do the bigger work, too.</p>

In many states, this care, known as a D&amp;C, is routine for both abortions and miscarriages. In Georgia, performing it had recently been made a felony, with few exceptions."</p></blockquote><p>As Kavitha Surana points out, abortion bans haven't actually led to a decrease in abortions. Instead, they've made them harder and significantly riskier. It's a worse situation all round. Deaths like these are senseless: a tragedy at the hands of a fundamentalist ideology with no basis in science.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hi, this is Gergely with a free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover topics related to Big Tech and startups through the lens of software engineers and engineering managers. To get weekly articles in your inbox, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>This publication has turned three years old, which feels like the right time to pause and reflect on the past 12 months for The Pragmatic Engineer.</p><p>At time of publication, 759,402 readers subscribe to this newsletter. This is 300,000 readers up on a year ago, when it was just under 461,000. This figure far exceeds the size of the audience I assumed would be interested in software engineering deep dives into some fascinating and challenging topics, when I launched this publication. Thank you for your trust!</p><p>I’d like to extend a very special thanks to all paying subscribers: the publication runs on your support, and it enables us to deliver well-researched deep dives. Many paying subscribers expense this newsletter from their company learning and development budget. If you have such a budget, <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/request-to-expense-the-pragmatic-engineer-newsletter/">here’s an email to send to your manager.</a> There’s also reduced prices for <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about#%C2%A7discounts">people in countries with lower average income</a> than the US and Western Europe, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about#%C2%A7discounts">student discounts</a>. If you enjoy the newsletter, you can also <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about#%C2%A7gift-subscriptions">gift a subscription to others</a>.</p><p>Speaking of deep dives: over the past year full subscribers received two articles almost every week: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/deepdives">a deepdive on Tuesdays</a>, and tech news in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">The Pulse on Thursdays</a>. The last 12 months of issues adds up to around 5-7 books’ worth of reading (about 550,000 words). Free subscribers also got well over a nonfiction book’s worth of reading in their inbox: the first parts of the Tuesday articles, and a full article monthly.</p><p>Today, we look back, and peer in to the future:</p>  <p>How The Pragmatic Engineer has evolved</p>  <p>Popular, interesting topics</p>  <p>What I learned about readers!</p>  <p>Notable events</p>  <p>Looking ahead, and The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast</p>  <p>Before we jump in: if you’re someone who enjoys podcasts, I have a treat for you. The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast is launching with the first episode next week. To get the first episode in your podcast player, subscribe on:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pragmaticengineer">YouTube</a> — you can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCHJm2itKsI">watch the podcast announcement here</a></p>  <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2Bho9xCbOQMWMJ7UKmqCzD">Spotify</a></p>  <p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pragmatic-engineer-podcast/id1769051199">Apple Podcasts</a></p>  <p>… or your favorite player!</p>   1. How The Pragmatic Engineer evolved in the last year <p>Software engineering is an ever-changing field where the best teams continuously experiment with new approaches, and change how they work. I’m also an engineer at heart, so it’s only natural to do the same with the newsletter.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what’s changed in recent months; some of which you might have noticed, and other things that happened behind the scenes.</p> Unshared details from interesting tech companies <p>Some companies attract media attention due to how well they execute, and what this publication tries to do is learn how exactly they achieve it. I aim to bring details straight from the source, talking exclusively with engineering teams at companies in the spotlight. The last 12 months has seen exclusive articles on:</p>  <p>OpenAI: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/scaling-chatgpt">How they scaled ChatGPT</a>, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-openai-how-does-chatgpt-ship">Inside OpenAI: how does ChatGPT ship so quickly?</a></p>  <p>Anthropic: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-anthropic-built-artifacts">How the company built Artifacts (and details on how it operates)</a></p>  <p>Stripe: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stripe">Inside Stripe’s engineering culture</a></p>  <p>Meta: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-the-threads-app">How the company built Threads with a small team in 6 months</a></p>  <p>Bluesky: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky">How a tiny team built a Twitter/X competitor</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky-engineering-culture">Inside Bluesky’s engineering culture</a></p>  <p>Oxide: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/oxide">A hardware/software startup on “hard mode”</a></p>  <p>In terms of deep dives, it’s been the most prolific year yet for this publication. Doing lengthy articles which lift the lid on how leading teams get things done, can be challenging. Understandably, some companies do not normally share the details you’ve been able to read in this newsletter. At the heart of delivering articles like those above, is trust. Engineering leaders and software engineers ultimately feel they have scope to be candid with me, and that means a lot. Their trust in myself and The Pragmatic Engineer team is a very rewarding part of writing this newsletter.</p> More articles mixing deep research with pragmatic observations <p>Since February, it’s not just me doing the extensive research that goes into each article: <a href="https://linktr.ee/hejelin">Elin Nilsson</a> is this publication’s first Tech Industry Researcher. Previously, Elin spent 7 years at Spotify, working in various mobile and platform engineering teams. Before, she interned at both Spotify as an Android developer and Google as a web/UX prototyper. She’s brought a whole lot of things onboard since she joined in February: like her infectious enthusiasm for nerding out about tech topics, diving deep into technologies and trends, and bringing order to the chaos of having too much information to process on any given topic.</p><p>Since she’s come onboard, there’s been more deeply researched pieces published than ever, and each one of them went into more depth. Some of the articles that started with Elin’s insightful research:</p>  <p>GenZ software engineers <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/genz">according to older colleagues</a>, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/genz-part-2">what GenZ devs really think</a></p>  <p>Bluesky: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky">How it was built</a>, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky-engineering-culture">Inside Bluesky’s engineering culture</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-coding-agents">How do AI software engineering agents really work?</a></p>  <p>AI tooling for software engineers: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">Reality check</a>, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-part-2">Reality check (part 2)</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-part-3">Rolling LLM tools out company-wide (Part 3)</a></p>  <p>Thanks to Elin, we can take on ambitious projects that were simply not possible when the Pragmatic Engineer launched because the research can take months, We’re on a roll with Elin, so expect these to keep coming! You can always <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-topic-suggestion/">suggest interesting topics for us to potentially look into</a>.&nbsp;</p> Goodbye “Scoop,” hello “Pulse” <p>During the first two years of this newsletter, there was usually an article every Thursday called “The Scoop,” which rounded up interesting things in the industry, and occasionally broke big tech stories. But as of a year ago, I am no longer doing this and the name change to “The Pulse” was part of this shift. I shared <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-56">details about the change</a>:</p><blockquote><p>‘The Pulse’ just better represents the mission of these articles, which is to help you keep an “ear to the ground” on what’s happening across Big Tech and at startups – sectors which regularly affect the whole tech industry.</p><p>I receive and validate plenty of interesting information from insiders at these companies, but my main focus is analyzing what’s going on in our industry; the implications of that and the opportunities for software engineers and tech businesses.</p><p>Names matter, and I feel “The Scoop” suggests a more gossipy, tabloid newspaper-style approach than what these articles actually deliver. Since The Scoop’s first issue I’ve focused on relevant industry changes and what they mean. I hope “The Pulse” makes the intent of this series clear: to provide an ear to the ground, and the latest analysis of the state of our industry.</p></blockquote><p>This change has been one I’m very happy with; it’s also partly why we’ve been able to publish more company deep dives straight from tech companies themselves.</p><p>When writing “The Scoop”, tech companies and devs whom I met were never quite certain if I had my “journalist” hat on (and would leak what they shared as news), or my “analytical” software engineer’s hat.&nbsp;</p><p>This made people reluctant to share information that could potentially identify their company, or affect their career. This was taxing for me personally and I decided I don’t want to be in the “gossip” business, but in the software engineering one. For that reason, the change from The Scoop was made.</p><p>But while writing it, I learned a lot about journalism and met a lot of reporters. It’s a fascinating world, but one I don’t feel is for me. Also, the time I save on no longer verifying information for&nbsp; news articles, means there’s more time to dive deep into relevant, interesting software engineering topics.</p> Industry Pulse <p>In the spirit of experimentation, I tried out a new section inside the Thursday “The Pulse” article. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-61">Industry Pulse</a> is a roundup of tech events relevant for devs and EMs, with commentary.</p><p>It has delivered early insights on topics like <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-75">The impact of Section 174 on the software industry</a>, predicting <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-64">pressure on commercial open source to make more money</a>, the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-104">unfortunate “startup purge event,”</a> analyzing <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-103">why Amazon sunset several of its products in one fell swoop</a>, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">much more</a>.</p><p>Readers feedback was very positive from the start. Also, I enjoy writing it and look forward to it every day: so it has stayed!</p> 2. Popular, interesting topics <p>In case you’re looking for articles to read or re-read, here’s a selection of some standout ones from the past 12 months, in my opinion.</p> Popular topics <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp-software-engineers">The end of 0% interest rates, and what this means for software engineers</a> was the single most-read article of the past year. This article was in a highly-detailed 4-part series about what feels like the biggest industry change in years: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">the end of low interest rates</a>.</p><p>It is rare for an economic change to have the kind of impact on an industry that higher interest rates are having. We’re finding out that tech startups and interest rates are more connected than many of us would like to think.</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity">Measuring developer productivity? A response to McKinsey</a>. Consultancy giant McKinsey is known for many things, but software engineering expertise is not one of them. Yet the globally known consultancy started selling advisory services about this: including the claim that they had developed a way to measure devs’ productivity.</p><p>Dev productivity is a notoriously tricky thing to accurately measure, so I teamed up with industry veteran  for a grounded take on why measuring productivity is difficult, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-part-2">sharing our suggestions</a> on how to go about this kind of measurement.</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-openai-how-does-chatgpt-ship">Inside OpenAI: How does ChatGPT Ship So Quickly?</a> Up to early 2024, OpenAI was dominating headlines by releasing new products and features with an incredible pace. The company was out-executing the likes of Google, Meta and every other AI startup. But how did they do it?</p><p>I sat down with Evan Morikawa, who headed up the Applied engineering team (the team also building ChatGPT). We learned how OpenAI operates ChatGPT like a “startup inside a startup,” engineering has an unusually tight integration with Research, has a high talent density in their San Francisco offices, and has a lot of smaller day-to-day habits that add up. While I advise to never blindly copy engineering practices: it’s helpful to understand what makes a startup like OpenAI execute so quickly.</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/surprise-uptick-in-software-engineering">Surprise uptick in software engineering recruitment</a>. Recruitment activity tends to be quiet in the summer months. This is why I was surprised to hear from several developers that they are seeing a spike in LinkedIn reachouts in June and July – mostly from startups.</p><p>Talking with dozens of developers – and some hiring managers – we uncovered that startups seem to have increased their hiring pace for a variety of reasons. What was common is how they were all searching for experienced engineers, and were becoming more “bold” in their reachouts: pinging senior+ engineers working at Big Tech and well-funded startups, who are profiles that usually are more reluctant to move.</p> Other interesting topics <p>Here are articles that I especially enjoyed for one reason or the other. If you’ve not yet read them, they could be worth your time:</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-past-and-future-of-backend-practices">The past and future of modern backend practices</a>. From the birth of the internet, through SOA and virtualization, to microservices, modular monoliths and beyond.</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-big-tech-does-qa">How Big Tech does Qualty Assurance (QA).</a> Most Big Tech companies have no dedicated SDET, QA, or tester roles. How do they produce quality software? A look into how Microsoft, Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Uber and Netflix do it.</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs">Stacked diffs (and why you should know about them)</a>. Meta and Google have been using stacking for closer to a decade: a coding workflow that is very efficient for small PRs. So what is stacking, and how come it’s not more widespread in the industry?</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/security-engineering">What is Secruity Engineering?</a> A deep dive into the ever-changing field of security engineering; a domain that can feel intimidating to some software engineers.</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">Applied AI Software Engineering: RAG.</a> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a common building block of AI software engineering. A deep dive into what it is, its limitations, and some alternative use cases.</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thriving-as-a-founding-engineer">Thriving as a Founding Engineer: Lessons from the Trenches.</a> Being a founding engineer at an early-stage startup is a vastly different, broader role than many people think.</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-74">Adobe can’t buy Figma: the impact on the industry</a>. Months after we <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture">covered Figma’s engineering culture</a>, regulators blocked Adobe’s acquisition of Figma. This event was likely what prompted Big Tech to stop acquiring companies, and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/148461279/another-ai-talent-heist">to do “talent raids”</a> instead with AI companies they seek to purchase.</p>  <p>There’s more, of course!

What I learned about readers — about you! <p>This year was the first time I asked details about who you are: in the form of a survey.&nbsp;</p> Disciplines <p>I write the newsletter for software engineers and engineering managers, and was curious to know if most readers are, indeed, in this field. Turns out this is broadly the case:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8650824e-a354-4888-b278-d04248e69e46_1600x1149.png">    </a>Readers, based on profession. Based on 2,395 responses <p>The majority of readers are in the software engineering field – ranging from entry-level to senior/lead/staff and above roles – and a good portion is in engineering leadership/management (ranging from engineering managers to VP and C-level engineering leadership positions.)</p><p>I’m pleased to hear so many folks in product management following along – extrapolating 5% to the whole reader base would translate to closer to 37,500 such readers! I hope that topics on engineers’ mind like <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/paying-down-tech-debt">paying down tech debt</a> or <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-practices">adopting engineering practices</a> are helpful to understand even at the product level.</p><p>The “other” bucket still accounts for a lot of people – closer to 75,000 folks, looking at the number of readers! Commonly mentioned titles included data scientist/analyst, security engineer, and recruitment. More sparse mentions included marketing, sales – and retired folks!</p> Types of companies <p>The publication covers Big Tech, startups and scaleups. Naturally, I was interested to see where readers work:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f9f9681-4cb1-44c5-bf3b-90f04fcfa3d3_1368x1148.png">    </a> <p>About 65% of readers indeed work at these types of companies. At the same time, there’s a healthy representation of people working at:</p>  <p>More traditional, but tech-heavy companies</p>  <p>Consultancies and developer agencies</p>  <p>More traditional, non-tech heavy companies</p>  <p>Bootstrapped companies (4.2%)</p>  <p>Academia and research labs (1.8%)</p>  <p>Public sector (1.5%)</p>  <p>Nonprofits (1.1%)</p>  <p>Other (~3%): self employed, founding a startup and in-between jobs were the most common mentions</p>   Interests <p>I asked people for feedback on the publication, and gathered these observations:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Variation of topics makes the newsletter enjoyable. Many of you shared that you like it when topics are switched up. At the same time, the few times I did a multi-part series on a topic: I’ve received complaints from some of you how you’re ready to learn about other areas.</p>  <p>The “practical research” pieces are a definite hit. Lots of professionals shared how they appreciate getting what feels like a closer to real-time feedback on what is happening in the market, and the industry.</p>  <p>Disruptive technologies and companies: a common request. Many of you are asking to cover more about disruptions as we see them happen. Timely pieces like the ones on stacked diffs, modern developer productivity measurements, or companies like OpenAI are consistently popular, validating this ask.</p>   4. Notable events <p>A few other things this happened in year three, that are worth a mention:</p> The Software Engineer’s Guidebook released <p>I started to write <a href="https://www.engguidebook.com/">The Software Engineer’s Guidebook</a> before starting the newsletter. In what is amusing irony: writing the newsletter delayed finishing the book – there’s only so much writing one can do, after all! Still, After four years of work, the book was finally released in print in November 2023, as an e-book in February 2024. The book became a #1 best seller across tech books on Amazon on launch. In the first 10 months, the book has seen more than 30,000 sales. Thank you to everyone who picked up a copy!</p><p>By the end of this year, I am aiming to release an audiobook version. Translations to 8 different languages are in progress (German, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Hungarian, Mongolian). The translations should be out between this fall and the spring of 2025 in respective countries.</p><p>I self published the book – as tech book publishers either passed on the title, or requested too many changes I did not agree with – and the self publishing process has been full of learnings. I’ll share more about this process, as self publishing, audiobook producing, and selling foreign rights has been full of learnings.</p> Leap Day <p>This year, February had 29 days. This small change caused a series of hiccups within software systems: from airlines to payment terminals. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/142175358/happy-leap-day">We shared a roundup of these</a>. The next leap day will happen in 2028 – hopefully we’ll see more robust software running these critical systems by then.</p> The largest software-inflicted outage <p>In July of this year, we collectively witnessed the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-biggest-ever-global-outage-lessons">largest-ever software inflicted global outage</a> where a routine Crowdstrike configuration update took airlines, banks and retailers offline across the globe.</p><p>We can now conclude that Crowdstrike <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146919509/do-canarying-staged-rollouts">did not do canarying or a staged rollout</a> of this change, because they likely assumed that this change carries no risk. It’s always cheaper to learn from others’ mistakes: and this incident is a reminder that you should avoid doing <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">“YOLO releases”</a> when operating a critical line of business – even if that release is assumed to be safe to roll out.</p> 5. Looking ahead <p>Some of the best-received articles come from guest writers: software engineers with deep experience in a topic. They then share their stories, learnings, mental models in a way that is helpful for more of us. Guest posts are always paid, and I closely work with guest authors to create a polished and enjoyable final piece. I’m always on the lookout for new guest writers:</p><p><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-guest-article/">Express interest in writing a guest post</a></p><p>One last thing… The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast. In the first two years of The Pragmatic Engineer, I ran several interviews with engineering leaders. A few examples:</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platforms-with-ganesh-srinivasan">Platform teams</a><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platforms-with-ganesh-srinivasan"> </a><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platforms-with-ganesh-srinivasan">and the platform team mindset</a> with Ganesh Srinivasan</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platform-teams-with-adam-rogal">Platform teams and developer productivity</a> with Adam Rogal, Director of Developer Platform at DoorDash</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/steve-yegge">The full circle on developer productivity</a> with <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/steve-yegge">Steve Yegge</a>, formerly Head of Engineering at Sourcegraph&nbsp;</p>  <p>The last 12 months, there have been no similar interviews – even though they are interesting and useful. At the same time, I kept talking with interesting people in the software industry, and frequently wished I could share these conversations wider. This is how the idea of the podcast was born.</p><p>The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast is an addition to the newsletter. Every second week, on Wednesday, a new episode will be out.&nbsp;</p><p>This show covers software engineering and Big Tech and startups, from the inside. I do deepdives with experienced engineers and tech professionals who share their hard-earned lessons, interesting stories and advice they have on building software.&nbsp;</p><p>After each episode, you’ll walk away with pragmatic approaches you can use to build stuff – whether you are a software engineer, or a manager of engineers. Expect a similarly polished experience as what the newsletter already delivers. Please subscribe using your favorite podcast player, or sign up the podcast’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pragmaticengineer">YouTube channel</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2Bho9xCbOQMWMJ7UKmqCzD">on Spotify</a> or <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pragmatic-engineer-podcast/id1769051199">on Apple Podcasts</a>. The episodes will also be shared in the newsletter, under the “Podcast” category.</p><p>I hope you’ll enjoy this addition!</p>   <p>For the next year, expect more deeply researched and practical deepdives both for technologies and interesting tech companies. If you’d like to suggest a topic or a company to research, you can do it here:</p><p><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-topic-suggestion/">Suggest a topic</a></p><p>Thank you – and see you in the next issue!</p>

<p>Welcome to the inaugural “Ask a [cybersecurity] futurist column. This month’s question comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-borg-22a3b35/">Anna&nbsp;Borg</a>.</p><blockquote>She asks:</blockquote><blockquote>How can we change the “rules in the game” and make it less interesting to use the internet for attacks on organisations and societies including democracy. We will never “win the game” if we are forced to play defence play 24/7, 365 days per year. How do we change the incentives for attackers?</blockquote><p>I won’t sugar coat it, this is a complex and interconnected problem. Our increased cyber attacks are a symptom of a much larger problem. (Which means the solutions will not just address the cybersecurity problem at the core of this question, but bigger problems that society deals&nbsp;with.)</p> The Complexity of Cybersecurity Threats <p>For defense teams, the current state of cybersecurity feels like an endless battle, with organizations and societies constantly reacting to the latest threats. For hackers, it’s a landscape with abundant vulnerabilities if one is willing to put in the work to find (or create) the magic key — like a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7240477136598286336/">Advanced Persistent Teenager</a>.</p><p>Cybersecurity is a long imbalanced game of whack-a-mole. Defenders have to guard everything, while attackers have the luxury of focusing. So how can you move out of a reactive mode to stay one step ahead of the next attack? And further, how can we make it even pointless for attackers to target us in the first&nbsp;place?</p> Understanding Hacker Motivation <p>To change the rules, we need to understand why cyber attacks are happening. What drives someone to become a black hat hacker? Or to start a black hat collective? Or join an elite nation state hacking team? I’ve spoken with security professionals, hackers and analyzed research data, and the motivations come down to: money, espionage, and the thrill of the&nbsp;con.</p>Viktor and Giselle from Better Call&nbsp;Saul<p>In a survey I conducted last year with identity-security experts, financial gain and espionage were the top motivations, followed by a desire for notoriety or the thrill of hacking. Most hackers today aren’t lone wolves; they’re part of organized collectives that pool their skills and resources to hit bigger, complex targets. They might even employ the Silicon Valley approved “AAS/as a service” business&nbsp;model.</p><p>There’s another factor that’s often overlooked: socioeconomic conditions. During my research for the paper Shifting Paradigms: Using Strategic Foresight to Plan for Security Evolution, I was genuinely surprised to hear about the overproduction of well-educated young people unable to find good jobs after their security education. There are very few well paid entry level security jobs — even in the US and developed nations.</p> Changing the Incentives <p>So how do we change the incentives to make cyber-attacks less appealing and less profitable for would-be attackers?</p><p>I’m going to skip over the obvious answer of creating/using better security technology. Everyone is racing to implement better tech solutions, but this is just a band aid — admittedly a really big band aid. I’m going to talk about non-tech solutions.</p> Economic Solutions <p>If it’s true that we are overproducing highly educated security people, could we solve some security problems by having full employment for all educated security&nbsp;experts?</p><p>One scenario in Shifting Paradigms envisioned this&nbsp;idea.</p><blockquote>5.10 Scenario 9: Money, Cash,&nbsp;Hoes</blockquote><blockquote>In this scenario, whose name is inspired by the Jay Z song, security defensive work has become so attractive and well-paid that black-hat work is no longer attractive, and people with security-relevant technical skills are almost universally employed in defensive jobs. Governments can still hire offensive hackers, but criminal syndicates have a very hard time competing with white-hat employers.</blockquote><blockquote>Changes from Today: Employers pay great salaries, offer significant flexibility and benefits, and recruit extremely aggressively, especially in poor countries with good technical talent and in ungoverned spaces. There are many good entry level security&nbsp;jobs.</blockquote><p>Could one of the most effective ways to reduce cybercrime to increase legitimate employment opportunities for those with technical skills? If well-paying jobs in cybersecurity or other tech fields were more readily available, especially in economically disadvantaged regions, would the incentive to engage in illegal activities diminish?</p><p>I think this scenario is illustrated in Wired’s recent article about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/priscila-queen-of-the-rideshare-mafia/">Priscila Barbosa, Queen of the Rideshare Mafia</a>, which describes the elaborate identity theft and fraud Priscila engaged in. Barbosa took IT classes back in her native Brazil and was a successful entrepreneur until the recession caused business to disappear. She came to find her fortune in the US — which she did. But because she overstayed her visa, she could not work legitimate jobs. I’d like to imagine, that if there was a legitimate way to work in the US, she would have never participated in criminal activities. And maybe, if there had been good tech jobs in Brazil, she might not have even needed to seek her fortune in the&nbsp;US.</p><p>In my view, Barbosa is a victim of economic lack of opportunity.</p> Disrupting [Criminal] Business&nbsp;Models <p>What are the business models that make cybercrime profitable? I remember Kim Cameron, Identity Architect, saying (not sure if this is his quote or he was quoting someone), that “the most profitable business model on the internet is crime. Back in the 90s and again&nbsp;now.”</p><p>Even entrepreneurial criminals have embraced the successful “as a Service” software development model. But to me, this echoes back to the economic themes. If there were legitimate economic paths half as successful, would there be less interest in criminal activity?</p> Nation-State Attacks <p>Nation-state hackers are a whole different beast. Their motivations are tied to geopolitical loyalty and belief. To reduce these types of attacks, we need to focus on improving global cooperation and reducing international tensions. This might sound idealistic, but fostering peace and global coexistence could significantly decrease the incentive for nations to engage in cyber&nbsp;warfare.</p> Reducing the&nbsp;Thrill <p>Then there’s the issue of hacking for fun, cultural subversion, or “the thrill of the con.” This is harder to combat, but one approach is to create more avenues for ethical hacking while embracing the dark side of hackers. Bug bounty programs, for example, allow hackers to flex their skills in a legal, constructive way. These programs are subversive in their own right but channel that energy into something positive.</p> Finding Solutions <p>Is the solution simply a transparent and interdependent global economy with legitimate well paid jobs so we can all live our best lives without stepping on someone to do&nbsp;so?</p><p>I don’t know about you, but that feels like a big and impossible solution — perhaps a bit too utopian. So, I want to leave Anna with some reasonable actions she or her company might&nbsp;take.</p>  Entry level security roles: Increase well paid jobs &amp; support development programs to transition people into well paid jobs. As part of this, eliminate the rockstar mentality, and hire someone who is good enough for the job and then treat them&nbsp;well.  Embrace the Lulz factor: Embrace the shadow of cybersecurity by engaging and encouraging the exact hacker mindset but to improve security — and again, offer an economic incentive. Bug bounties are both subversive and&nbsp;helpful.  <p>Both of these ideas could have a corporate initiative with a budget, KPI and program manager. They could be funded out of HR or professional development, IT or risk management line items. Companies could partner with universities, hacker collectives and government agencies, maybe sponsoring a hackathon or participating in a local cyber wargame activity.</p> Got Questions <p>If you could see the future of cybersecurity, what would you ask?

Today, if you’re presenting your physical ID (for example to confirm your age or your address) you have to share everything — your name, address, your physical description and more. However, with a digital ID, you can share only the required data. Additionally, you must authenticate the device with a fingerprint, PIN or passcode in order for any of your ID information to be shared with the requester. </blockquote><blockquote><p>選択的開示とユーザー制御：デジタル ID では、依拠当事者（情報を要求する当事者、たとえばレンタカー会社や商業者）は、個人の ID の関連部分のみを要求することができる。現在、物理的なIDを提示する場合（たとえば年齢や住所を確認する場合）、氏名、住所、身体的特徴など、すべてを共有しなければならない。しかし、デジタルIDでは、必要なデータのみを共有することができる。さらに、あなたのID情報を要求者と共有するためには、指紋、PIN、パスコードでデバイスを認証する必要があります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>選択的情報開示のUXがどうなるのか気になりますが、個人的な意見としてはリライングパーティが全体ではなく最低限の要求ができるようになるので、ウォレットとしてはそのリクエストに対応できるようにするよ、という話だけでは全然足りない気がしています。（実装する立場としては理解できますが）</p><p>あくまでユーザの意思によって開示する情報を選択できるという体験が重要だと思うので、リライングパーティがどんな属性を要求してきているかに関わらず、自身で開示する属性を選べる状態にはなっていないといけないと思います。（結果的にリライングパーティの要求を満たさなかったとしても）</p><p>また、オフラインでの利用についても考慮をしていってもらえるといいなぁ、、と思います。たとえば、画面を見せる際に検証者の目線では「これは正式な書類である」ということが視認できる状態が重要なので、表面は正式な証明書であることが視認できるだけ、タップして裏面を見せるとユーザがあらかじめ設定した開示したい最低限の情報だけが記載されている、という状態が作れるといいのではないかと思います。</p><p><br></p><p>いずれにしても3rdパーティウォレットを含むエコシステムが正常に出来上がるような規制などは政府が中心に整備してもらえるといいですね。ユーザーの声を正しく吸い上げるためにもAppleとGoogleだけに任せるのではなく、エコシステム全体として進化できていくことが重要な気がします。</p>

<p>Recently, I have been working on programming small modules for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using Open AI. Also recently, I did a Coursera class on advanced RAG and have taken in several videos and posts on it. I have used samples from those sources and tested using various LLMs to generate simple Python to perform RAG with Open AI. In general&nbsp;, I have been disappointed with the outcomes until I tried Azure Open AI with Azure AI semantic&nbsp;search.</p> Disappointment <p>My general disappointments have come from the self-coded RAG attempts on a single PDF. The basic approach has&nbsp;been:</p>  take a single PDF (not a small PDF — about 43,000 token when uploaded to Open AI API in whole and extract the text using&nbsp;PyPDF  chunk the text using at best recursive text and/or sentence transformer; sometimes just naive simple character count&nbsp;split  embed the chunks trying Chroma or text-embedding-3-small  query the collection using Chroma or FAISS and in one instance also with a simple augmented prompt  call the LLM with the initial prompt and context from the embeddings query  the prompt was for a list of 10 principles in the document that were all outlined in a single paragraph  <p>It’s nothing sophisticated by any stretch but they corresponded with the examples I had available.</p><p>The results — abysmal. I’m not really surprised. I’m not sure how such an approach could do very well with simple chunking, embeddings, and basically running off keyword proximity. But since these were supposed examples of the use of RAG I expected better results. There were only two times I received good results. One of those times I’ll outline below; the other was when I didn’t parse or embed and just passed the entire document as context. Of course, the latter worked well but that was not the exercise I was&nbsp;after.</p> Success <p>My successful attempt came when I didn’t create the code directly but used Microsoft Azure Open AI playground. I have no doubt that coding it up would have worked just as well since it relies on the Azure AI infrastructure and the code would be little more than passing a prompt to the Azure LLM instance and getting the results. Here is what it consisted of:</p>  setup of an Azure Open AI instance using gpt-4o-mini model and, I think, the text-embedding-3-small embedding model  setup an Azure AI Search instance with semantic search and indexing pointed to a blob storage container with a single PDF in&nbsp;it  <p>I think that was it. I then went to the Azure Open AI Studio playground grounded the model with the search instance, provided my simple prompt, and got back the desired results. Was it the semantic search that made it work well? I suspect it helped a lot. I need to try it without the semantic search and see what happens. Sorry, I forgot to try that scenario.</p> Recap <p>All in all, I was very disappointed with the RAG results, as I coded it, especially as they were based on examples or AI generated single document RAG code. But, I was very pleased with the Azure test and I think the semantic search made all the difference.</p>

<p>In the late ’70s, I worked for a while at the <a href="https://www.psychicalresearchfoundation.com/">Psychical Research Foundation</a>, which occupied a couple of houses on Duke University property and did scientific research into the possibility of life after death. My time there was a lever that has lifted my life on Earth ever since, including many deep and enduring friendships.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._Roll">Bill Roll</a> ran the place then, and many fascinating characters passed through the PRF orbit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eda_LeShan">Eda</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eda_LeShan">Lawrence Lashan</a>, for example. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Smith_McDonnell">Mac McDonnell</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fetzer">John Fetzer</a>. One of the most memorable was Iris, a brilliant woman from Savannah with a strong personality, dyed red hair, and lots of talents. Her surname was pronounced “Mock,” but spelled with an “a” or two. (I think it was Maack.) She also mentioned occasionally that her brother was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Harrelson">Ken “Hawk” Harrelson</a>, the baseball player I remember best from his peak years with the Boston Red Sox. For many years since then, however, he has been the play-by-play announcer for the Chicago White Sox. Now 83, Hawk is still calling games for what will <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/white-sox-win-back-to-back-games-for-first-time-in-nearly-3-months-beat-athletics-4-3/ar-AA1qCUcq">almost certainly</a> be the losing-ist team in major league history.</p>
<p>So this morning, after I read “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5760647/2024/09/13/hawk-harrelson-white-sox-wont-watch/">Hawk Harrelson spent 3 decades calling the White Sox. Now he can’t stand to watch”</a> in the NY Times (sorry, paywall), I looked up “Hawk Harrelson” plus “sister” and “Iris” and landed on <a href="https://soxmachine.com/2018/05/hawk-harrelsons-new-autobiography-a-review/">this 2018 page</a>, which has this passage from Hawk’s autobiography:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 “My sister was a heavy smoker who had died of lung cancer when she was only 40. I was so proud of what Iris had done with her life after such a tough start, having to get married at the age of 14. She wrote a few books and became a gourmet cook. She also learned to speak fluent German, Russian, and Spanish. She lectured at Duke University and at the University of Toronto. She became an accomplished pianist. She also dabbled in acting and landed a few holes on stage in New York. And she was an interior designer, having turned my penthouse pad into a beautiful home. 
 
 
 
 
 
 “But we had a falling out several years before she died when I turned down her request to borrow $250,000. She had wanted to open a nightclub in downtown Savannah and I didn’t have that much cash at the time. Plus, I didn’t think her business idea was a good one. When I refused her request, she walked out the door and I never saw her again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Apparently, she never quit smoking.” 
 
</blockquote>
 While I’m not surprised to learn that Iris is gone (she was older than me, and I’m seventy-seven), it’s a shock to hear that she died so young, so long ago, and so full of talent and promise. 
 
 I’m also not surprised that there is almost zero information about her on the Web, given that it was born after she died, and is <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/02/world-wide-whiteboard/">a whiteboard</a> as well. So maybe this post (titled with her birth name) will at least help make her more remarkable than I’ve made her so far.

<p>This post shows how to use Elasticsearch in .NET Aspire. Elasticsearch is setup to use HTTPS with the dotnet developer certificates and and simple client can be implemented to query the data.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/keycloak-backchannel">https://github.com/damienbod/keycloak-backchannel</a></p>



 Setup 



<p>Two services are setup to run in .NET Aspire. The first service is the official Elasticsearch docker container and deployed using dotnet developer certificates. The second service is an ASP.NET Core application using the Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch Nuget package. The App.Host project is used to set this up and to link the services together.</p>







<p></p>



 Elasticsearch development server 



<p>The Elasticsearch container is configured in the program class of the App.Host project. The container is run using HTTPS and takes the Aspire parameters for configuration of the default account.</p>


  var elasticsearch = builder.AddElasticsearch("elasticsearch", 
                password: passwordElastic)
    .WithDataVolume()
    .RunElasticWithHttpsDevCertificate(port: 9200);
  


<p></p>



<p>The developer certificates needs to be created and copied to the specific folder inside the Elasticsearch docker container. This is implemented using a shared folder and the Elasticsearch xpack.security.http.ssl properties are set to match. The following three properties are used:</p>



 
 xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled 



 xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate 



 xpack.security.http.ssl.key

<p>When the App.Host project is started, the Elasticsearch containers boot up and the server can be tested using the “_cat” HTTP Get requests or the default base URL will give a server information about Elasticsearch.</p>



<p><a href="https://localhost:9200/_cat">https://localhost:9200/_cat</a></p>



<p></p>



 Elasticsearch client 



<p>The Elasticsearch client was implemented using the Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch Nuget package. The client project in .NET Aspire needs to reference the Elasticsearch server using the WithReference method.</p>


  builder.AddProject&lt;Projects.ElasticsearchAuditTrail&gt;(
             "elasticsearchaudittrail")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(elasticsearch);
  


<p></p>



<p>Elasticsearch can be queried used a simple query search.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt; QueryAuditLogs(string filter = "*", 
        AuditTrailPaging auditTrailPaging = null)
{
    var from = 0;
    var size = 10;
    EnsureElasticClient(_indexName, _options.Value);
    await EnsureAlias();

    if (auditTrailPaging != null)
    {
        from = auditTrailPaging.Skip;
        size = auditTrailPaging.Size;
        if (size &gt; 1000)
        {
            // max limit 1000 items
            size = 1000;
        }
    }
    var searchRequest = new SearchRequest&lt;T&gt;(Indices.Parse(_alias))
    {
        Size = size,
        From = from,
        Query = new SimpleQueryStringQuery
        {
            Query = filter
        },
        Sort = BuildSort()
    };

    var searchResponse = await _elasticsearchClient
                  .SearchAsync&lt;T&gt;(searchRequest);

    return searchResponse.Documents;
}
  


<p></p>



<p>See the source code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/keycloak-backchannel/blob/main/AuditTrail/AuditTrailProvider.cs">https://github.com/damienbod/keycloak-backchannel/blob/main/AuditTrail/AuditTrailProvider.cs</a></p>



 Notes 



<p>With this setup, it is easy to develop using Elasticsearch as a container and no service needs to be implemented on the developer host PC. Setting up HTTPS is a little bit complicated and it would be nice to see this supported better. The development environment should be as close as possible to the deployed versions. HTTPS should be used in development.</p>

  こんにちは、富士榮です。    Gogole Walletへの米国パスポートの搭載が先日発表されましたね。  崎村さんがGoogleのアナウンスについてポストされているのでこちらを見ると良いと思います。  https://www.sakimura.org/2024/09/6359/     簡単にいうと、米国のパスポートをGoogle Walletへ格納することができるいう話で、現在はまだ紙のパスポートと併用、かつTSAチェックでしか使えないが、将来的にはもっと使える場所の拡大をしていこう、としているという話です。     日本でも早く使えるようになるといいですねぇ。  まだ、日本では決済以外だとイベントのチケットや航空券やポイントカードなどが搭載できるくらいですし。     日本で追加できるのは    支払いカード  ポイントカード  ギフトカード  写真   の４カテゴリ。

   こんにちは、富士榮です。     Decentralized Identity Foundationは割と定期的にハッカソンをやっています。  今年もプレ登録が開始されているので参加してみてはいかがでしょうか？  https://blog.identity.foundation/pre-registration-now-open-for-difs-2024-hackathon-2/         なお、今年のテーマは  Education, Reusable Identity, and Travel.  ということなので、割と想像しやすいですし実装のアイデアも湧いてきやすいかもしれませんね。     昨年は日本の学生さんが受賞してInternet Identity Workshopへ参加されるなど活躍していましたので、今年も続くといいですね。

 こんにちは、富士榮です。  <br>  Decentralized Identity Foundationは割と定期的にハッカソンをやっています。  今年もプレ登録が開始されているので参加してみてはいかがでしょうか？  <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/pre-registration-now-open-for-difs-2024-hackathon-2/">https://blog.identity.foundation/pre-registration-now-open-for-difs-2024-hackathon-2/</a>    <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjtzUwpWyu3P_a424X9xYYlMgkJN3_hq1DGAImB-rftV4lfrvq0p-uxIO9YZzPZek8HByngDnXQ-PNnmgFNoUtWmzSK7ATjQtiOqHtaqg3M2LvpT8wFlEpPW61v1AhJ2_C8XtcsKSgp3qUFDuWXjN9GYsITeiFw7VChkismXLcFZRib1XLLzOT8fdAHDwVq"></a>  <br>  なお、今年のテーマは  Education, Reusable Identity, and Travel.  ということなので、割と想像しやすいですし実装のアイデアも湧いてきやすいかもしれませんね。  <br>  昨年は日本の学生さんが受賞してInternet Identity Workshopへ参加されるなど活躍していましたので、今年も続くといいですね。  <br>  <br>

“A picture showing the knight of Self Sovereign Identity losing his way, going into the valley of doom where certain death&nbsp;awaits.”<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) offers a robust and scale-able solution to the challenges of digital identity that is secure while also respecting privacy, freedom, and human rights. However, a mix of political and industry pressures, along with a push for quick adoption, risks turning SSI into just another marketing buzzword.</p><p>Nowhere is this trend more visible than in the mobile Drivers License (mDL) and the ongoing conversations around the second version of European Unions “electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services” (eIDAS).</p> Old Interests, New Technology <p>The first version of eIDAS was an adoption failure. While it was not providing privacy by design, technologically it was sufficiently correct to function. It did so by giving a central role to Trust Service Providers (TSPs) and Certificate Authorities (CAs).</p><blockquote>These intermediaries sought to exploit their government issued monopoly and consequently choked off adoption for the first version of&nbsp;eIDAS.</blockquote><p>In doing so, they repeated the same mistake made on the wider web, where excessive pricing led to stagnation in the adoption of encrypted communications. In 2014, only 10 short years ago, the vast majority of all connections was not using any kind of transport layer security&nbsp;(TLS).</p>HTTPS adoption became mainstream only between 2015 and 2019 — via Matthew Greene, article linked&nbsp;below<blockquote>It was the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2019/09/24/looking-back-at-the-snowden-revelations/">Snowden Revelations that changed everything</a>. But not in the way the intermediaries had&nbsp;hoped.</blockquote><p>While I am sure many were rubbing their hands, and expecting the pipe they were sitting on to finally start flowing, everyone in the industry knew that predatory pricing was to blame for the low adoption. So in November 2014, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt">Let’s Encrypt</a> was founded in order to provide for free what Certificate Authorities are selling at premium&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Today, Let’s Encrypt provides over 55% of all certificates used on the web. Which provides for two conclusions:</p><blockquote>Let’s Encrypt has become the single point of failure for security on the internet. And the addressable market for TSPs has shrunk dramatically, and keeps shrinking.</blockquote><p>Simultaneously, the costs for TSPs are growing. Not only in terms of technology cost. But also in terms of compliance cost. Because there is a whole industry of consultants and auditors that service TSPs, extracting six figure payments each year for initial certification and re-certification. Growing cost and shrinking markets are not a great prospect for any industry.</p><p>So when the new version of eIDAS came along, promising to switch to Self Sovereign Identity for <a href="https://medium.com/@ggreve/allowing-people-to-sign-for-themselves-fixing-qualified-signatures-bbb63f105555">privacy by design, security, and elimination of intermediaries</a>, the TSPs deployed their lobbyists to Brussels to stop this threat to their remaining business.</p><p>The result was a bureaucratic monster, for which some people at <a href="https://medium.com/@ggreve/dice-2024-retrospective-b20372f13a65">DICE 2024 in Zurich</a> voiced doubt whether it could even be implemented in practice.</p><blockquote>Intermediaries are once again involved in every step. And all the technological choices are based on legacy Web2.0 technology shaped by the TSPs, without privacy by design, and with well known and regularly exploited security&nbsp;issues.</blockquote><p>So TSP lobbying successfully defended their government mandated monopoly over the digital domain, and the fundamental issue that stopped adoption of the first version of eIDAS remains unresolved. Only the future will show whether this second attempt of the TSPs at monetizing all digital interactions will fare any&nbsp;better.</p><p>But that isn’t even the biggest&nbsp;problem.</p> The Web is a bad idea for personal&nbsp;identity <blockquote>The web is a fundamentally unsound technology choice for personal identity, for a variety of reasons, starting with security.</blockquote><p>The early web wasn’t really designed for privacy or security. Its original design was inspired by the need for institutional information sharing. Invented in 1989, security was added in 1995 when Netscape came up with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which led the way for today’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0,_2.0,_and_3.0">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>. This allowed encryption of communication, but all security was dependent on key management.</p><p>Because it was the only practical way at the time, intermediaries became the root of all trust for virtually all users. On top of those issues, secure communication requires two parties who may know nothing about one another to negotiate a secure key to use for encryption with one another. That negotiation must happen over the same channel that is being used for encrypted communication.</p><blockquote>Which is a bit like yelling the combination of the key pad to your house through the open window over to your neighbour so he can come in and water the plants. If there are no eavesdroppers at that time: Great. If there are, they now also have the key. You’ll find out whether you were safe in a few weeks when you get back from vacation.</blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a> was invented to solve that particular problem. But it is only secure if used correctly and keys are being rotated and refreshed often. Re-use of static keys or weak parameters can weaken security considerably.</p><p>On top of that, cryptography is an ever evolving field, and the need for web servers to support older browsers means that sometimes, outdated or known vulnerable settings are still being allowed. Managing all that is complex. It requires organisational level security&nbsp;teams.</p><blockquote>And much like charging your modern Electric Vehicle using a coal powered steam engine to drive a generator, trying to fast track adoption for Self Sovereign Identity by using Web based Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods effectively negates all the conceptual and architectural progress that has been made with&nbsp;SSI.</blockquote><p>All the underlying security issues our industry has struggled with for the past 30+ years, all the conceptual weaknesses of the Web, all the privacy issues and compromises also apply to SSI when using did:web and its descendants.</p><p>In practical terms this translates into most people once again finding themselves forced to entrust their personal identity to intermediaries in the form of custodial wallets and platforms. Just as they are doing today with Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft.</p><blockquote>Most people will rent usage of their own identities, but they will have no ownership or agency. And those intermediaries will once again have full visibility and control over everything people are doing&nbsp;online.</blockquote><p>That is a steep price to pay. Is it worth it at least in terms of security?</p><p>Even these large organisations get it wrong often enough for data leaks and other issues to occur frequently. When using the Web for personal identity, these compromises will have consequences beyond anything we have seen so far. What happens when the compromise has enabled the attacker to provide legally valid signatures in your name to sign contracts, or consent to sharing your personal pictures with the wrong&nbsp;parties?</p><p>And that’s only the start of the valley of&nbsp;doom.</p><p>The Web is based on top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System (DNS)</a>. Which is a system in which you rent usage of certain human readable domains on a yearly basis. Without it, the Web falls&nbsp;apart.</p><p>So let’s assume enlightened users rent their own domains to become independent from the intermediaries. Now they can move between them in case one of them has issues, goes out of business, or gets acquired by a billionaire with a questionable political agenda. Just move your domain and you’re good,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Not so&nbsp;fast.</p><blockquote>Not only is it possible you may lose your domain, either due to changes in DNS policy, legal aspects, such as trademarks, or because you’ve missed a yearly&nbsp;payment.</blockquote><p>If a personal identity can be lost that easily, was it ever really&nbsp;yours?</p><p>But there is an even bigger&nbsp;issue.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> standard was designed to provide for unique, non-correlatable identifiers for each individual interaction. Which sounds great in theory. But how non-correlatable are did:tdw:johnsmith.eu:223499182 and did:tdw:johnsmith.eu:673403151?</p><p>Would you be able to tell they might both belong to the same person, whose name might be John&nbsp;Smith?</p><blockquote>Because the domain is always an intrinsic part of each Web based DID method, none of them allow for personal ownership without complete loss of pseudonymity, and non-correlatability.</blockquote><p>So whatever pseudonymity and privacy can be achieved leads back full circle to large intermediaries and custodial wallets — just like the federated identity infrastructure of&nbsp;today.</p>“Anakin Skywalker at a crossroads. Go down the Web based SSI method path, and become Darth Vader, or choose a world of privacy, freedom and security?” TL;DR: Don’t do it,&nbsp;Anakin! <blockquote>Web technologies are a fundamentally poor choice for personal identity.</blockquote><p>They can work in domains where privacy and non-correlatability are not required, for instance organisational identity. But for personal identity, they compromise almost everything that Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) was intended and designed&nbsp;for.</p><p>You cannot retrofit privacy and security onto an architecture that wasn’t built for them. Just look at Email. It has the same problem. Decades of adding layers of complexity and auxiliary systems have kept moving the problem somewhere else in the stack, to another component. Lots of snake oil has been sold. Some people got very rich this way. But the fundamental issues remain unsolved.</p><p>We should not repeat that same mistake for Self Sovereign Identity.</p><p>No system that is intended for personal identity should ever use did:web, did:tdw, or any of the other web based DID specifications. The concepts of SSI can solve all the issues above. They can provide people with real agency and control over their own identity. But not when using the&nbsp;Web.</p><p>The solution is&nbsp;simple.</p>Stop using Web based DID methods for personal identity!<blockquote>Humans are not organizations. Stop using Web based DID methods for personal identity. did:web and its descendants are very useful for some organizational use cases, and for prototyping new ideas. They have NO place when it comes to personal identity, or use cases that require strong privacy or security.</blockquote><p>There are (at least) three superior alternatives that come to mind, all of which can also provide a secondary channel for key negotiation.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>米国時間2024年9月12日（日本時間9月13日）、グーグルが米国パスポートのグーグルウォレットへの搭載を<a href="https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-wallet-update-september-2024/">発表</a>しました。</p>



<p>近年、日常生活のあらゆる面でデジタル化が進んでいますが、その中でも特に注目を集めているのがデジタルID<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/09/6359/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6359" title="Digital Identity Document. 身分証明書 (Identity Document) をデジタル化したもの">1</a>です。Googleは昨年から一部の州発行のデジタルIDをGoogle Walletに保存できる機能の展開を開始しましたが、さらなる進化を遂げようとしています。</p>



<p>まもなく、Google Walletに新しいタイプのデジタルIDを導入するベータテストが始まります。この新機能により、より多くの人々が、より多くの場所でデジタルIDを作成し保存できるようになります。注目すべきは、今回から米国パスポートを使用してデジタルIDを作成できるようになることです。</p>



<p>このデジタルIDパスは、一部のTSA（運輸保安局）チェックポイントで使用可能となり、国内旅行時の空港での時間と手間を省くことができます。</p>



<p>デジタルIDパスの作成プロセスは非常に簡単です：</p>



 
 Google Walletアプリで「米国パスポートでIDパスを作成」というプロンプトを選択 



 パスポートの裏面にあるセキュリティチップをスキャンする指示に従う 



 本人確認のためにセルフィービデオを撮影 



 数分以内にIDパスの準備が整ったという通知を受け取る

 Google Wallte へのパスポート登録の様子　（出所）<a href="https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-wallet-update-september-2024/">Google</a>



<p>現在、このIDパスは一部のTSAチェックポイントでのみ受け付けられていますが、Googleはパートナー企業と協力して、将来的にはアカウント復旧、本人確認、さらにはレンタカーの利用など、より多くの場面でデジタルIDを使用できるよう取り組んでいます。</p>



<p>ただし、この技術はまだ初期段階にあるため、Google WalletのデジタルIDは現時点では物理的なIDの代替とはなりません。旅行時には引き続き物理的なIDの携帯が必要です。</p>



<p>セキュリティ面では、Google Walletは「プライベート・バイ・デザイン」原則によって<a href="https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-wallet-digital-id-privacy-security/">個人情報を保護するように設計</a>されたAndroidの高度なセキュリティを使用してデジタルIDを安全に保管します。IDパスは暗号化されて保存され、利用には指紋認証やPIN、パスコードでの認証が必要となります。また、本人確認時には共有される情報を事前に確認できるため、ユーザーが情報を管理できます。</p>



<p>さらに、カリフォルニア州のAndroidユーザーは既に州発行のID<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/09/6359/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-6359" title="Identity Document, 身分証明書">2</a>や運転免許証をGoogle Walletアプリに保存できるようになっており、今後数か月以内にアイオワ州、ニューメキシコ州、オハイオ州でも同様のサービスが展開される予定です。</p>



<p>コロラド州では、MyColoradoアプリ内に新しいリーダーを導入し、州内の企業がデジタルIDを安全かつ簡単に受け入れられるようにする取り組みも始まっています。</p>



<p>このように、GoogleはデジタルIDの利便性と適用範囲を拡大し続けており、私たちの日常生活をよりスマートで効率的なものに変えようとしています。デジタルIDの未来に、今後も注目が集まりそうです。</p>

<p>運転免許証とマイナンバーカードの一体化が、まもなく現実のものとなります。 この画期的な変更は、私たちの日常生活に大きな影響を与える可能性を秘めています。 </p>



<p>警察庁が9月12日に発表した新しい方針によると、2025年3月から「マイナ免許証」が導入される予定です。 これは、現在の運転免許証の機能をマイナンバーカードに統合するという画期的な取り組みです。 </p>



 

 



 マイナ免許証制度の概要 



<p>マイナンバーカードは、 2016年に導入された個人番号制度の一環として発行されている身分証明書です。 このカードには、すでに様々な個人情報が ICチップに記録されていますが、 新たに運転免許証の情報も追加されることになります。 </p>



<p>具体的には、免許保有者の写真、免許の有効期間、取得している免許の種類、 そして眼鏡着用などの条件といった情報がマイナンバーカードのICチップに記録されます。 これにより、1枚のカードで身分証明と運転資格の証明が可能になります。 </p>



<p>マイナンバーカードと運転免許証を一体化手続きは、運転免許センターや免許更新を扱う警察署で受け付ける方向で調整が進められています。これは、運転免許証の暗証番号を覚えている人は、スマホでできるようにして欲しいところではあります。</p>



<p>また、今の法律では免許取消や停止処分の対象者について、所在が分からず処分ができていない場合に警察官が対象者を見つけた場合、免許証を預かる制度があります。2025年3月24日以降はこの制度がなくなり、「出頭命令書」を出す制度に変わります。</p>



 マイナ免許証のメリット 



<p>この一体化には多くのメリットがあります。 特に注目すべきは、住所変更手続きの簡素化です。 現在、引っ越しの際には自治体と警察の両方に別々に届け出る必要がありますが、 マイナ免許証では自治体での手続きだけで完結します。 </p>



<p>さらに、免許更新時の利便性も向上します。 優良運転者と一般運転者は、マイナポータルという個人向けサイトで講習動画を視聴するだけで、 更新時の講習を受けたとみなされます。 これにより、更新手続きにかかる時間と手間が大幅に削減されます。 ただし、すべての手続きがオンラインで完結するわけではありません。 写真撮影や視力検査などは、従来通り免許センターなどで実施されます。 これは、安全運転に必要な基本的な身体能力を確認する重要な過程だからです。 </p>



<p>マイナ免許証の導入は任意であり、既存の運転免許証も併用して使用することができます。 しかし、マイナ免許証のみを保有する場合、 新規取得時や更新時の手数料が比較的安くなるという経済的なメリットもあります。 </p>



免許取得免許更新現行の免許証2350円2850円マイナ免許証1550円2100円現行＋マイナ2450円2950円2025年3月24日以降の手数料



 懸念点の解消 



<p>この変更は、デジタル化が進む現代社会における行政サービスの効率化の一環と言えるでしょう。 すでに「マイナ保険証」として健康保険証の機能を統合する取り組みも進められており、 2024年7月末時点でマイナンバーカード保有者の80％が登録を完了しています。 </p>



 誤まった紐付けについて 



<p>しかし、このようなデジタル化の急速な進展には懸念の声も上がっています。 特に、個人情報の管理や情報セキュリティに関する不安は根強く存在します。 政府は、これらの不安に対して丁寧な説明と十分な対策を講じる必要があるでしょう。例えば、以前、マイナンバーカードと健康保険証の連携でミスが発生しました。マイナ免許証ではこのことの繰り返しを防ぐための対策が施されていることを訴えかけていく必要があるでしょう。現在検討されているのは、申請時に本人がマイナンバーカードと運転免許証の両方を持参し、係員が申請者の目の前で両方の顔写真が一致することを確認するということです。これでちゃんと脅威に対策できているのかは要検討ですが。</p>



 落とした・無くした時の再発行に時間がかかる点 



<p>また、マイナ免許証に一本化した場合、これを落としたりした場合の再発行にかかる時間の問題も心配の一つです。車の運転には免許証の携帯が必要で、これに対応するために現行の免許証は落としたりした時に即日再発行が可能ですが、マイナンバーカードは１ヶ月半ほどかかることもあります。この間運転できなくなったら困ります。</p>



<p>これは、実は、現行の運転免許証を再発行してもらうことで回避できます。結局２枚に戻ってしまいますが。</p>



 今後の予定 



<p>この新しいシステム（マイナ免許証）の運用開始に向けて、警察庁は道路交通法の改正を2025年3月24日に施行する予定です。さらに、2024年9月13日から30日間、この新しい運用方法について一般の人々から意見を募集します。</p>



<p>マイナ免許証の導入は、日本社会のデジタル化における重要なマイルストーンとなります。 この変革が私たちの生活にどのような影響を与えるのか、今後の展開に注目が集まります。</p>

<p>Ungarn hat den EU-Innenministern diese Woche einen <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/st12406.en_clean.pdf">neuen Vorschlag zur Einführung der Chatkontrolle</a> vorgelegt, der von POLITICO geleakt wurde. Der Einsatz „künstlicher Intelligenz“ zur Suche nach verdächtigen Bildern und Chats soll Messenger- und Chatanbietern danach freigestellt bleiben. Zur Suche nach bekanntem illegalem Material bleibt es aber bei dem weltweit einzigartigen Vorhaben, die massenhafte, verdachtslose und nach BKA-Angaben höchst fehleranfällige Kontrolle aller privaten Chats für sämtliche Diensteanbieter verpflichtend zu machen, selbst wenn dazu die bisher sichere Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung von Messengerdiensten ausgehebelt werden muss. Die <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/195500/imfname_11406149.pdf">EU-Regierungen sollen sich bis zum 23. September zu dem Vorstoß positionieren</a>, die EU-Innenminister sollen ihn am 10. Oktober beschließen. Die Messengeranbieter Signal und Threema haben bereits angekündigt, solche Überwachungsfunktionen keinesfalls in ihre Apps einzubauen und ihre Dienste in der EU gegebenenfalls komplett einzustellen.</p>



<p>“Statt Kindern durch sicherere Apps zu helfen sich im Netz vor Erpressung und Ausbeutung zu schützen, werden Missbrauchsopfer durch einen realitätsfremden und vor Gericht zum Scheitern verurteilten Gesetzentwurf im Regen stehen gelassen,” kritisiert Dr. Patrick Breyer, ehemaliger Europaabgeordneter der Piratenpartei und Mitverhandler der kritischen Position des Europäischen Parlaments. “Unsere Polizei mit großteils irrelevanten Hinweisen auf längst bekanntes Material zu überfluten, stoppt keinen Missbrauch, sondern erschwert seine Aufdeckung zusätzlich. Falls diese Chatkontrolle kommt, werden wir Bürger gängige sichere Messenger nicht mehr nutzen können – das bedeutet wir verlieren den Kontakt zu unseren Freunden und Kollegen in der ganzen Welt. Wollen wir wirklich, dass die EU weltweit führend beim Abhören unserer Smartphones und der flächendeckenden Überwachung der Chats von Millionen gesetzestreuer Bürger wird?”</p>



<p>Breyer <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/hilf-jetzt-mit-die-chatkontrolle-zu-stoppen/">ruft dazu auf, Druck auf Bundesinnenministerin Faeser und Bundesjustizminister Buschmann zu machen</a>: “Nur dagegen zu sein und dann überstimmt zu werden, reicht nicht zur Verteidigung unseres digitalen Briefgeheimnisses und sicherer Verschlüsselung. Die Bundesregierung muss jetzt dringend Verbündete suchen, um eine Sperrminorität und eine <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/chatkontrolle-vertagt-megaerfolg-bei-verteidigung-des-digitalen-briefgeheimnisses/">grundlegende Überarbeitung</a> zu erreichen. Die Sicherheit unserer Kommunikation steht auf dem Spiel!”</p>

<p>Thirteenth in the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">News Commons</a> series.<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/53835099302/in/album-72177720318481770"></a></p>
<p>I grabbed the spottedhawk.org domain after <a href="http://searls.com/whitman.html">hearing</a> Garrison Keilor read this passage from Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself over Leo Kottke improvising on guitar:</p>
<p>The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me.<br>
He complains of my gab and my loitering.</p>
<p>I too am not a bit tamed. I too am untranslatable.<br>
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p>
<p>Most of what I do is in deficient obedience to Whitman’s spotted hawk. Including this blog.</p>
<p>Early in this millennium, when it was as easy to blog as it later was to tweet, I blogged constantly. The stretch from 1999 to 2007 was blogging’s golden age, though we didn’t know it at the time. (My blog from that time is archived at <a href="http://weblog.searls.com/">weblog.searls.com</a>.) My blog then was a daily journal, and in a literal way that made me even more of the journalist I had always been.</p>
<p>On that career side, I was also employed for all that time by <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/">Linux Journal</a>. My name was on its masthead for twenty-four years, from 1996 to 2019. When LJ was sold at the end of that stretch, I left as editor-in-chief. After that, I was the host of <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly">FLOSS Weekly</a> on the <a href="https://twit.tv/">TWiT network</a>. Both were paid gigs, and when the FLOSS Weekly gig ended last December, so did my long career in journalism.</p>
<p>And maybe that happened just in time, because journalism has since then acquired a taint. In <a href="https://cornerstone.ghost.io/essentials-september-7-8-2024/">this past weekend’s</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://cornerstone.ghost.io/">Cornerstone of Democracy</a> newsletter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gillmor">Dan Gillmor</a> sources <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Marshall">Josh Marshall</a> of <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/">Talking Points Memo</a> on the topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>I guess I would say that as journalists our core mission is fundamental honesty with readers. That means always telling readers the truth, an accurate story as nearly as we are able to uncover it and understand it, as well as being transparent with the values, commitments and core beliefs we bring to the work we do. We believe in always being fair to everyone and everything we write about. Fairness is really only another permutation of accuracy. Balance is a construct applied after the fact that is often as not at odds with accuracy. A belief in democratic republicanism or civic democracy has always been at the core of what we do. It’s central to what stories we choose to focus on, it’s a value structure that permeates our organizational approach to what we do. I can’t speak for everyone at TPM. But as founder and still a guiding light, I think our understanding of what journalism is or should be is inextricably connected with democratic republicanism/civic democracy. I don’t think I would say we’re activists for democracy. But to me being on the side of civic democracy is inextricably connected to what we do and who we are. We’re on the side of civic democracy as much as we’re on the side of journalism.</p>
<p>I don’t want to label other journalists. But to the extent many other journalists don’t operate in this way, or understand their job this way, it’s because they work for publications whose business models simply aren’t compatible with this approach to journalism. What we now commonly call “both-sidesism” is rooted in the business structure of most contemporary journalism, specifically the need to have purchase across of wide ideological spectrum of the population.This is especially so in large corporate journalism because the need for scale and advertiser buy-in really requires that access to all parts or most parts of the political spectrum. In a hyperpolarized political culture when one side veers off the democratic rail that inevitably pulls a lot of that kind of journalism with it. I see that as fundamentally a structural reality. This goes back many decades, long before the current moment. It was more workable in a different political climate. But in this one that’s how it works. Journalists think they’re following core journalistic principles. But it’s driven really by business models.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s why now I just call myself a writer. Or a photographer.† Unless it’s to write a book (which typically pays little or nothing), to be a paid journalist today requires frequent or constant production of “content.” But I’d rather yawp, like I am now, here, or over at <a href="https://projectvrm.org">ProjectVRM</a>, <a href="https://trunkli.org/">TrunkLine</a> (a blog on infrastructure), or <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> (which will in the next year become more important than everything else I’m doing).</p>
<p>All three of those involve work, but don’t pay. Same goes for serving as <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/about">Chief Intention Officer</a> of <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/">Kwaai.ai</a>, a commuity of 600+ volunteers working on <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">personal AI</a>. (Check it out. Good stuff going on there.)</p>
<p>But before I give up on the journalist label, let’s ask <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity.ai</a>* to answer What is the purpose of journalism?&nbsp;Here’s the answer I just got:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on the search results, the primary purpose of journalism can be summarized as follows:</p>
 
 To provide citizens with accurate and reliable information they need to function in a free society.&nbsp;This is considered the central purpose of journalism. 
 To inform the public about current events, issues, and developments happening in their communities and around the world. 
 To serve as an independent monitor of power and act as a watchdog over those in positions of authority. 
 To provide a forum for public criticism, debate, and compromise on important issues. 
 To convey context and help citizens understand the significance of events. 
 To set the tone for public discourse and help define community goals and values. 
 To empower citizens to make informed decisions about their lives and society. 
 To facilitate democratic processes by educating voters and inspiring civic engagement. 
 To support commerce by creating awareness about products and services. 
 To drive cultural transformation by connecting people to communities and ideas beyond their immediate surroundings. 
 
<p>Journalism is considered essential because it helps citizens navigate their lives, make important decisions, and participate effectively in democratic societies. It serves as a crucial source of verified information in an increasingly complex world, helping to separate fact from fiction and provide context to current events.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is that what journalists are doing today? Was it ever? Really? All of it?</p>
<p>I don’t know. Mostly journalists write stories. If you’ve read <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2019/07/23/where-journalism-fails/">Where Journalism Fails,</a> or <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2023/10/12/stories-vs-facts-2/">Stories vs. Facts</a>, you know I think the story-telling imperative has its own problems.</p>
<p>Back in the early ’90s, when I was doing PR for a hot Silicon Valley startup, I asked a top reporter at one of the tech magazines why he didn’t want to see my client’s brilliant and charismatic marketing director. The reporter said, “He abuses the principle of instrumentality.” When I pressed the reporter to expand on that, he explained that everyone involved knows that reporters are used as instruments by whoever spins them. The “principle of instrumentality” is about knowing, and trying to ignore, the simple fact that journalism is instrumented in many ways. While Josh Marshall talks above about the instrumenting of journalism by business models, in this reporter’s case, it was by the persuasive charisma of a strong personality who wanted positive coverage.</p>
<p>I realized then that I wasn’t being hired at the same magazine (or at any publication before Linux Journal, and I pitched many) because I didn’t want to be an instrument. More specifically, they all wanted me to write sports stories about competing companies. “Apple vs. Microsoft,” for example. “Motorola vs. Intel.” I wanted to write about interesting stuff without favor to anybody or anything other than what seemed right, important, fun, or just interesting. Sports coverage of tech didn’t do it for me. Nor was any of the other usual stuff. Linux was a cause, however, so I worked to make my Linux Journal writing as non-evangelical as possible, though I did get credited with helping put both Linux and open source on the map.</p>
<p>Was I a journalist while working as an editor there? I suppose so, given that my work hit at least some of the ten items above. At least I thought of myself that way.</p>
<p>A difference today is that we are all both digital and physical beings. Here in the digital world (where I am now), anybody can publish anything, on many different platforms, including their own if they’re geeky enough to make that work. According to the <a href="https://podcastindex.org/">Podcast Index</a>, there are 4,262,711 podcasts right now. Instagram has <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/">over two billion users</a>. <a href="https://persuasion-nation.com/blogging-statistics/">Says here</a> there are over three billion blog posts published every year, and over six hundred million active bloggers. (I suppose I am three of them.) The same piece says “Over 90% of blog posts receive zero traffic.” Many of those blogs are faked-up, of course, but it’s still clear that the world of online publishing is a <a href="https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/what-are-red-blue-oceans/">red ocean</a>, while <a href="https://journa.host/@dsearls">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@docsearls">Threads</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dsearls.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://nostr.org/">Nostr,</a> and the like are more like small rivers or bays than one blue ocean. (Links in that last sentence go to my tiny presence in each. I’m also still on <a href="https://x.com/dsearls">Xitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/docsearls/">Linkedin</a>, for what those are worth.)</p>
<p>So now I’m thinking about what principles, old and new, work in the digital media environment and not so much in the old analog one.</p>
<p>Here’s one: We’re past the era of “What’s on.”** Unless it’s a live sport or some other kind of scheduled must-see or must-hear event, you can catch it later, on your own time.</p>
<p>Here’s another:&nbsp;We don’t have to fill time and space with a sum of “content.” We don’t. Yes, it helps to have a schedule and be predictable. But it’s not necessary, especially if you’re being paid little or nothing.</p>
<p>Here’s another: The challenge now is building and maintaining an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">archive of facts</a>, and not just of stories. I’ve written about this elsewhere in this series. Go look it up.</p>
<p>Another:&nbsp; Try to grab as many of those facts as you can before and after they turn into stories or don’t. This is what <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2023/11/09/datepress/">calendars</a> are for. Even if nothing comes out of a meeting or an event that appears on a calendar, it’s good to know that something happened. And to archive that as well.</p>
<p>I also believe both of those principles are easiest to apply in local contexts, simply because there is a relatively finite sum of facts to work with locally, and facts still matter there. (<a href="https://x.com/scottadamssays/status/1503005597343526915">Scott Adams tells us they don’t</a> in the wider world. And he has a case.)</p>
<p>This is one reason I’m embedded in Bloomington, Indiana. We’re <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">working on all that stuff</a> here.</p>
 
<p>† My photos <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/">here</a> on Flickr have about twenty millon views so far. The last peak was five thousand on Sunday. The top attraction that day was <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/5614448667/">this shot of Chicago</a> I got on a cross-country flight between Phoenix and Boston in 2011. That one photo has logged 26,159 views so far.

To bring this back to the theme of this post, while I do a lot of photography, I don’t think of myself as a photographer. I take pictures. And I write. And I talk some. All are for the same purpose: to be useful and to make stuff happen. Good stuff, hopefully.</p>
<p>By the way, the bird at the top is a juvenile red-tailed hawk. There is no one species called a spotted hawk, so this one will have to do. I shot this bird a couple of months ago, perched on a 480-volt line in the alley behind our house in Bloomington, Indiana. I was looking to hear a barbaric yawp, but he, or she, failed me on that one.</p>
<p>*I first asked ChatGPT 4o and got a cliché’d answer with no sources. Perplexity gave me a longer answer, just as cliché’d, but with eight sources. For fun, go ask both and see what you get. Try Claude and Gemini too. No two will be the same. Some will be better, some worse.</p>
<p>**I’ve written about this, but haven’t published it yet. Stay tuned.</p>

  こんにちは、富士榮です。    昨日（US東海岸の時間で9/9）はSIDI HubのワシントンD.C.会合に参加してきました。  2024年のゴールである11月のリオデジャネイロに向けたワールドツアー（？）の3回目の会合です。そして、来月10月の東京会合に向けた諸々調整事項もあり参加必須ということで参加してきました。     そんなこんなでメインアジェンダとは別でサイドミーティングがてんこ盛りで充実した1日だったわけですが、軽く振り返ります。     アジェンダはこんな感じでした。     例によっていろんな人と話をしないといけないDinnerという名前でほぼ何も食べられない立ち話はありますが、それを含め充実した1日です。詰め込み過ぎなくらいです。     基本スタイルは各セッションオーナーが燃料投下として小ネタを話し、そこからフルでディスカッションという流れなので容赦ないです。     全

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  昨日（US東海岸の時間で9/9）はSIDI HubのワシントンD.C.会合に参加してきました。  2024年のゴールである11月のリオデジャネイロに向けたワールドツアー（？）の3回目の会合です。そして、来月10月の東京会合に向けた諸々調整事項もあり参加必須ということで参加してきました。  <br>  そんなこんなでメインアジェンダとは別でサイドミーティングがてんこ盛りで充実した1日だったわけですが、軽く振り返ります。  <br>  アジェンダはこんな感じでした。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEivKtKcff_H_flTw52-vPpgLLWBHh6ak_aro9U8-tk8XevqiYY2ib2QVHSFxbAHctknd4L4iky0jX1L2CDxCPDLB6NxMTQ7vqkjw5feyrg3QysUhyIrVM98kmvm1EVVxyW6iZOFQfPsXae4Vm6tFuHfzoIzmVsY1gVar5N-tR1KZ4z-HB7AUhCB__ISbRXw"></a> <br>例によっていろんな人と話をしないといけないDinnerという名前でほぼ何も食べられない立ち話はありますが、それを含め充実した1日です。詰め込み過ぎなくらいです。  <br>  基本スタイルは各セッションオーナーが燃料投下として小ネタを話し、そこからフルでディスカッションという流れなので容赦ないです。  <br>  全体のアジェンダの流れとしては、これまでのケープタウン、ベルリンで絞り込んだ４つのユースケースである、銀行口座の開設、難民、教育、国境を超えた取引きについて課題の抽出からシナリオの特定、必要となる要件の洗い出しを行う、という流れです。  <br>  シナリオの特定を行う上では当該分野のドメイン・エキスパートを招待して簡単に状況を話してもらい、それに対してみんなでディスカッション、という形なので実はエキスパート同士で話をするのに比べてそれぞれの議論は浅い傾向がありますが、これを各地域で行うことで地域特性が浮き彫りになるのでこれはこれで意味がある進め方だと思います。  <br>  たとえば、教育クレデンシャルの話が出ましたが、民間資格を含むマイクロクレデンシャルの利活用（主に経済活動にどう役に立てるのか？）に少しフォーカスが偏っていた気がしますが、その辺りがアメリカならではだな〜という感じで受け止めをするのが正解な気がしました。  <br>  ということで中身を軽く。  <br>  Welcome keynote - Carole House/NSC, Ryan Gailuzzo/NIST  NSCやNISTの人がキーノートをやってしまうあたりが東海岸ならではで非常に貴重な機会でした。  金融におけるKYCやサイバーアタック対策などにおいてデジタル・アイデンティティの重要性が語られたり、NISTの注目分野としてmDocやVerifiable Credentialsが挙げられ、その周辺技術であるOpenID for Verifiable Credentialsなどを含めNISTでは注目していることが強調されました。モバイル運転免許証のオンライン利活用や金融機関等での利用などに向けた分析を進めているようです。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhG04i-RKC--4tnGj3U7P5BiTSS0WdSPhWuoC3a9diSsjed8x7Eu_h5xwEoWHtbwdDyq-2XwNFghSskG6_urtvNVd5UyB9tD2y4GMvwQgjlRcqZX1OF-Oa7EKN1zED9gcRZWR8-ekA2-AQ7wzd6STqbJxiJoVeVlE1vUEHg_ktXLv7McLGAHh_I16Fk6bp8"></a> <br><br>  Intro to Use Case Methodology - Elizabeth, Gail  チュートリアルですね。  改めてSIDI Hubが目指す姿として、デジタルアイデンティティが「メールやSMSやパスポートと同じく簡単にクロスボーダーで使えるもの」となるべきである、という思想が示され、そのために、必要となるコンポーネントの青写真を描き、ローカルでの採用〜コンフォーマンスをとっていく、そのために相互運用性のあるデジタルクレデンシャルが大切である、という話がされました。  <br>  また、これまで昨年のパリから始まりケープタウン、ベルリンを経た現在地として、<br>   4つのユースケースに絞り込んだ。DCと東京ではディープダイブすることが大事  グローバルにおけるデジタルIDの相互運用性の課題については認識できたが、Domestic focusが残っている  グローバルサウスから参加する個人に対する資金提供の課題。これができないとトラストフレームワークの分析などが進まない  国やMultilateral engagementやfundとが限られている。フォーマルエンティティがいないと2025年以降の持続性に課題がある     と言った課題を含む現状が語られました。  <br>  それらを踏まえて今回のワシントンD.C.のゴールとして以下の4点が設定されました。     チャンピオンとなりうる4つのユースケース（銀行口座の開設、難民、教育、国境を超えた取引き）を深く掘り下げる  2つのユースケース（銀行口座の開設、難民）の技術的要件を深掘りする  デジタルIDに関するガバナンス、トラストフレームワーク分析に関するフィードバックを得る  不足しているユースケースに関する地域特性を踏まえたフィードバックを得る    <br>    <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgbf21GbTgGrACguPeep_14FwjVFADSmpsivxzA9kwxxYW4ddNzd-7btnbOJ_Q_yfUPsJz29rK3sOPZEM7nr10dJS7ZesUPCwlvMkfbZjNgS15UtcTbiOpFnhwnaBeXWxVAtHuErCQISzqyeUDK6Uq_ky81UWJvS4k63U8rAjzpDN-JdkI4PKsnXS8akv2z"></a> <br><br>  Use Case Deep Dives〜Minimum Requirements  ここからはRoom1/2に分かれて銀行口座の開設と難民の2つのテーマについて議論が行われました。私は難民側を聞いたのでここでは難民の話を書きます。  いずれオフィシャルにレポートが出てくると思いますので口座開設の方はレポートを楽しみにしておきましょう。  <br>  ディスカッション中心なので聞き取れていないところもありますが、気になったポイントを数点だけメモで書いておきます。    Age Verificationの観点でも難民の身元確認ができることは非常に重要。理由はAge Verificationが必要なサービス（インターネットの閲覧もその一つ）を難民に提供することすらできないため  UNHCRがやっている難民登録のプロセスについて。エチオピアでID4Africaと一緒にやっているが、特徴として複数の国と国境が面しているので把握が大変  UNHCRの難民ID登録システムであるPRIMESへの登録時のIdentity Verificationは非常に大変で時間がかかる。例えば家族が別々の経路を通じて入国してくることもあるので、関係性を証明する必要があったりする  基本的には生体情報との紐付けを行う形をとる。まずは識別可能な状態を作り、そこに複数の属性を紐づけていくことでアイデンティティを形成していく、という積み上げ型によるアイデンティティ確立が必要となる   <br>   確かにエチオピアの地図を見ると、南北スーダン、ソマリア、エリトリア、ジブチ、ケニアと国境があり、ソマリアを超えるとすぐにイエメン、という中々なロケーションです。スーダンの状況やソマリア・ソマリランドの状況を考えると少なくとも東西からの難民の流入はかなり大変な状況になっていそうです。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi1KKPxXMblaxKH0uwJ4BGMyIqyyfh4asY71K65kyIvktdu55-ZBUZxW7yD1Aes-cKw820pmVUhgaLuFP9s9dlT9kiNS2WLFSGdqHmIrq2dWOsbAojcSio50BkJvYAOJF7Q9CGZFDJoTCfp6r8OhCbUPFQ9xhsW_pBNGMpe_rPSurxfHlKw32iXpkmrEWBU"></a> <br>なお、UNHCRの難民ID管理システムであるPRIMESについてはこちらのページで詳しく解説されています。  <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/what-we-do/protect-human-rights/protection/registration-and-identity-management">https://www.unhcr.org/what-we-do/protect-human-rights/protection/registration-and-identity-management</a>  <br>  <br>  ちなみに、その後のディスカッション等で話を聞いたんですが、UNHCRのデジタルクレデンシャルを使って準国民IDのように扱える国も出てきているようです。ナイジェリアやフランスなどが該当し、難民IDを使って社会保障が受けられたり、というところまで適用が進んでいるそうです。同じくオランダでもAlien Document（在留カード）の発行の要件として使える、的な話もありました。  <br>  気になったので同じセッションに出ていたTSAの人にNISTのIALだとUNHCRの発行するアイデンティティはどこに該当するの？と聞いてみました。結果「うーん、２だろうなぁ・・・」って回答。意外ではありましたが、Self-AssertedではなくUNHCRが発行しているということを鑑みると確かに２（NIST SP800-63-3ベース）だろうな、、、と妙に納得。よくよく聞いてみると、米国でもネイティブアメリカンの身元確認にTribe IDを使うことがあり、Equityの観点からIAL2に位置付けているので基本的な考え方は一緒だ、と。さらに納得。（いいのか？）  このあたりはトラストフレームワーク・マッピングのアクティビティにもUNHCRのID保証に関する枠組みも入れてマッピングするように提言しておきました。  <br>  また、Minimum RequirementsのセッションではVerifyするための公開鍵の置き場所の話にもなり、分散型を使うべきなのか？みたいな話もありました。  個人的にはUNHCRがUNDPのインフラを使ってVDRを作ればいいんじゃない？って思いましたが。もしくは国連分担金に応じて各国にノードを分散配置するとか。アメリカに20％以上のサーバが置かれてしまうからダメか・・・  参考）国連分担金の割合  　<a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/fp/unp_a/page22_001258.html">https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/fp/unp_a/page22_001258.html</a>  <br>  <br>  Educational Certificates Use Case  教育クレデンシャルの話です。  実は今回ドメインエキスパートがいなかった関係で割とあっさり表層的な話で終わってしまいました。  USマーケットをみるとOpenBadgeなどで実装されている民間発行を含むマイクロクレデンシャルにどうしてもフォーカスしてしまうんだな、という雑感です。アカデミアの外の実社会での利用イメージが想像しやすいですしね。  <br>  こんな感じで個人にとってどういうユースケースがあって、脅威と利点を分析する（というか会場の声を聞く）という感じで進んでいきました。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgAVUZRFBrJBJg5vHeymztPGCdjg0oe-HlSRAo6A57zViadsjg8bxNmEmg5dJLjhYiBc0Yf5RiHYupAqbLjpruqTT8gSybm5StWLLtkb51PXBEEYP5R4ko1YJD9dHqXhTVA93VPRagRo5K8-qj7oUXH837l7JvW85tfe7exdWB5b1LB4L5HNwrWckV1tB0H"></a> <br><br>  日本で開催するときはもう少し深掘りができるようにドメインエキスパートを招待しないとダメだよね、ってGailと話をしたりしました。  <br>  <br>  Guest Session: TSA's mDL Research Agreement - Jason/TSA  TSAのJasonからTSAがやっているmDLの利活用についての話です。結構面白かったです。  アメリカ国内便に乗る際、身分証明書の提示が求められるのですが、私たちのような国外からのVisitorはパスポートを見せるところを国内在住の人は運転免許証を見せるわけです。  これをモバイル運転免許証でデジタル化しよう、という話で、すでに社会実装が始まっている話です。  <br>  ジョージア州の運転免許証をiPhone/AndroidのWalletに格納するところのデモ動画なども紹介されました。  こちらからみることができます。  <a href="https://dds.georgia.gov/ga-digital-drivers-license-and-id">https://dds.georgia.gov/ga-digital-drivers-license-and-id</a>  <br>  発行はこんな感じ。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjdPqmpuzi6V4EY_jPm1P8U1fA29xUTvMuHMwRP47_p0XioDSkGKBPyW48aJHNdv3YA63v5zEXclEGISoliFUeBji9HtzoD1i-GuIkyNGIuNUB3yf2sFfxMyGUUbZ6H7CQnLZZjUfWcErnTPIITeSXFeiVYsGZUpDuY_falBD8eK2uopva0BaRH6VfS_ol9"></a> <br>提示もこんな感じですね。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh-DTI2Ua6Sy4NGx9QKnvhYkTqjqVtlDkZ_rnHfj-5N_PchmRSM_ASZ5XizgI5Px1JNoQYolBEWz8vNEQfNv8iPJN_Qr_w4uPf-oG4KE5PUxJeNXY_kAFY4GHyLVoWnOpA7bAPlIXwNFXcO4KQEQ1I5rS8OpsAJSlVNoQdeX_zt-DvoM6LozaWjNNOM38YS"></a> <br><br>  Trust Framework Analysis - Elizabeth, Mark  OIXのNickが中心となり各国のトラストフレームワークのマッピングをやっている活動です。日本からもOpenIDファウンデーション・ジャパンの有志に参加してもらっています。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgzIrXLGUd3U1ip7Zm4DZVgX-kDgQgSHvd5v4EIGE6Bk0-png7Y1l27VMM1QdfIiWOE_SalhS6pP4tDnB1_sgYRvkdNbKCdgRzyaTosfEbHMfMp6AHtgU9jzGaUxbfxrLqLq9ZeUKJQD0yM2m7IsJ60ZEUErJlAWhKEmV7GeBGALSRf1yL7jINSjhzsL-ZL"></a>  <br>  Walletを含むIdentityとクレデンシャルに関するトラストフレームワークのあり方についても検討が行われています。 <br>後半、若干ショッキングな発表がありましたので、このワークストリームの行末が心配になりましたが、SIDI Hubとして何とか進めていけるといいな、と思います。  <br>   Governance of Digital Identity Systems - Scott, Shigeya, Gail   ワシントン大学のスコット先生、慶應の鈴木先生がGailの無茶振りを受けてのセッションです。  <br>  まだまだ検討が進みきっていない話で、ガバナンスのスコープをどこにするのか、その場合のステークホルダーは誰になるのか？を探していくフェーズです。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhtItFUtUFGVUbZuUCV5RHMkBcYi4ZXosRxK7DONPQHdXfPu1ssM_xQ3OCO096YBNzmsK9Jj4jlx73VHqNO4YTl7yhwe7wNTb2f2OvclvML194PfaGbIXK4G1wjLUgY1cxs8YH63LZLTTifMGiAVXQUHYTIqTcpHel97ngKbsQZL9uB2x32cIuXufhMTaq9"></a> <br><br>  そして、最後に今後のロードマップについて説明があり、簡単なサーベイで会合はしめられました。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiAJHkn790KAYmbcVFizKbeySMCuupG9kS-0HdTYYann4cEsuIQmOj-vPsMPquH8TX8auxg6X_vkJiVyqCYqxF1D7dYMN9MwHvdkweuCXyUWz4_HGTP9Ww4iO0KGK2wteBNfTS4rbrxCriei8TWQlAd50TTcNmmA1Xkt2dMjAz6sqyPZjS1s2eO_-CRo5i0"></a> <br><br>  <br>  まずは、10月の東京に向けた準備ですね。頑張ります。  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

It covers how these tools are being used ‘day-to-day’ in tech workplaces, and what engineers think about them. Today, we cover:</p>  <p>AI usage guidelines. A quarter of respondents follow company-wide usage guidelines. Interestingly, a minority of companies have banned GenAI tools over security and copyright worries.</p>  <p>Internal LLMs at Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Pinterest, Stripe. Large, fast-moving companies not only embrace GenAI tools, but build their own internal versions for their engineers.

AI usage guidelines across companies <p>We asked survey participants “how is AI tooling used for development at your company?” The responses reveal different approaches:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13a4e148-7f73-4969-957e-f763337ed57a_1600x1078.png">    </a>Common ways LLM tooling is used at tech companies <p>The most referenced approaches:</p>  <p>No formal guidelines. Around 25% of respondents (53 out of 216) say their company has no recommendations about AI tooling. People use it as they see fit.</p>  <p>Some guidelines. 25% (50 respondents) say their workplaces have rules and guidelines for AI tooling.</p>  <p>AI tools banned. Circa 12.5% (25 responses) say their businesses ban usage of AI tools, mostly due to concerns about code security, and potential copyright infringement. We previously covered how several open source projects have <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/144695317/open-source-projects-ban-ai-generated-code-commits">banned AI-generated code commits</a> for this reason.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Working on guidelines. 7% of respondents (15 people) share that their company is trialing AI tooling, or is in the process of adopting guidelines.</p>  <p>Strongly encourage AI tool usage. 6% of respondents (12 people) work at places which encourage using these tools wherever possible.</p>  <p>Common features of guidelines across workplaces, based on survey responses:</p>  <p>Specifying which tools and LLM models may be used</p>  <p>No inputting of sensitive information into AI tools like ChatGTP</p>  <p>No entering of internal (closed-sourced) code into AI chat tools</p>  <p>It’s pretty clear some guidelines are responses to fears that LLMs may retain the data employees input and use it for training. This is also a reason why a handful of respondents shared that their companies go through the added complexity of running LLMs on their own infrastructure. It’s a reminder that LLM solutions which don’t store company data have a strong selling point for tech companies.</p> 2. Internal LLMs at Meta, Netflix, Pinterest, Stripe <p>Only a fraction of respondents say their companies strongly encourage the use of LLM tools, but some of these are cutting-edge market leaders in tech. Let’s take a look at how a well-built internal LLM can help a business.</p> Meta <p>The social media giant has been investing heavily in ML and AI since before ChatGPT was released. Back in 2022, we covered how <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/69257439/meta-preparing-for-ai-ml-war-time">Meta was already preparing for AI/ML ‘wartime’</a> by investing heavily both in AI hardware, and hiring large numbers of AI and ML engineers. This investment has not slowed down since, and it’s little surprise that Meta seems to have built one of the leading in-house AI tools.</p><p>Meta’s internal tool is called Metamate. Director of Engineering Esther Crawford <a href="https://www.threads.net/@esthercrawford/post/C-xzztmv-YD?xmt">describes it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s an AI for employees that’s trained on an enormous corpus of internal company docs. I use it all the time for efficiency gains.</p><p>Any sizable company operating without an internal AI tool is already behind the curve.”</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.threads.net/@esthercrawford/post/C-x3PVhvJa5?xmt">Esther explains</a> what Metamate does:</p><blockquote><p>“It has a ton of capabilities from summarizing to coding. Simple use cases:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Summarizing docs&nbsp;</p>  <p>Recapping work&nbsp;</p>  <p>Finding info across wikis&nbsp;</p>  <p>Exploring metrics and visualizing data</p>  <p>PSC feedback editor</p>  <p>Ask about <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs">diffs</a>, SEVs, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/55330545/notable-internal-systems-and-tools">Deltoids</a>, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/55330545/notable-internal-systems-and-tools">Tasks</a></p>  <p>Do the math for things like calculating capacity&nbsp;</p>  <p>Getting project status updates from <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/55330545/notable-internal-systems-and-tools">GSD</a></p>  <p>Create queries, and so much more.”</p>  </blockquote><p>Here’s a practical example on how useful Meta’s tool is, from <a href="https://www.threads.net/@shanabritte/post/C-x4_z4xrUo?xmt">Shana Britt E</a>, director of strategic initiatives:</p><blockquote><p>“Recent use case: Performance reviews. Writing self-review, cleaning up peer reviews. For self-review, it can capture your diffs landed, status updates about your work from documents you published, etc. and puts it in a nice summary that you can then review and edit.”</p></blockquote> Microsoft <p>The company offers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/copilot-for-microsoft-365">Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365</a> for enterprises, and is dogfooding this system inside the company. I talked with software engineers who confirmed that the internal Microsoft Copilot is integrated with internal documents, and can thus provide more relevant context. It is also used in places like pull request reviews – although for this use case, I heard it’s more of a hit-and-miss in the quality of feedback.</p> Stripe <p>The fintech company has a similar system to Metamate. Miles Matthias, product manager, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@miles_matthias/post/C-x3SVmRMnm?xmt">shares</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“We have something similar [to Metamate] at Stripe and I spend a bunch of my time talking to it. I can imagine a world where I’m basically having a voice conversation with it all day every day as ‘work’ - especially when agents boom.”</p></blockquote> Netflix <p>The company has a place to access Netflix-provided versions of LLMs. A senior software engineer told us:</p><blockquote><p>“There are AI guidelines, and corporate-provided versions of GPT, Claude and other models in a unified interface. People can share prompts that they find useful to colleagues.&nbsp;</p><p>My org is also exploring AI for our specific use cases, but thus far have not found any AI tools to be where we need. There is an opportunity to automate some manual business processes and we thought GenAI could help, but it seems traditional engineered solutions are still much better than GenAI."</p></blockquote> Pinterest <p>The company builds internal LLM tools. One clever utility is called Text-to-SQL: a feature where internal users can use plain text to ask for a type of query, and <a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-we-built-text-to-sql-at-pinterest-30bad30dabff">the tool generates the right SQL</a> to be used with the company’s internal data store called Querybook. The engineering team improved the first version with RAG, to help identify the right table names to use (we previously did <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">a deepdive on applied RAG</a>). The results are promising. As the company shares:</p><blockquote><p>“We find a 35% improvement in task completion speed for writing SQL queries using AI assistance.”</p></blockquote> Vendors offering similar capabilities <p>There are plenty of vendors offering a “Metamate-like” experience out of the box. <a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a> seems to be the leader in this area. Other options include <a href="https://www.villagelabs.co/">Village Labs</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/copilot-for-microsoft-365">Microsoft Copilot for M365</a>, <a href="https://www.coveo.com/en">Coveo</a> and <a href="https://www.akooda.co/">Akooda</a>. This category is relatively new and there are plenty of up-and-coming startups. Search for terms like “AI company knowledge management tools” to find them.</p><p>The productivity perception of these systems rarely matches reality. Despite being a leader in the AI field, Meta is just figuring out how these tools can help it operate more efficiently. Metamate sounds impressive – and it’s ahead of what most companies have – but it doesn’t work optimally just yet, as we hear. I got this detail from talking with current engineers working at Meta.</p><p>The reason companies like Meta are investing so much into this area was articulated by CEO Mark Zuckerberg two months ago, on the company’s earnings call. He talked about how AI investments will take years to pay off, and Meta wants to be early. He said:</p><blockquote><p>“You can also get a pretty good sense of when things are going to work years in advance. And I think that the people who bet on those early indicators tend to do pretty well, which is why I wanted to share in my comments the early indicator that we had on Meta AI, which is [...] early.”</p></blockquote> 3. Reservations and concerns <p>When starting to use AI tooling, companies and developers often need to overcome reservations, or find workarounds. Let’s start by summarizing these reservations.</p> Reasons for not using AI tooling <p>Reasons for disallowing – or heavily limiting – AI tools include security and privacy worries; especially about internal, confidential information, and proprietary code being leaked. A few respondents also mention customer data.</p><p>Several larger companies have worked around these concerns by using in-house, self-hosted, LLMs, and their security and compliance teams add filtering to the inputs and outputs of these tools. This approach is clever:</p>  <p>Security and compliance teams can tweak filters to catch confidential or customer information that shouldn’t be shared</p>  <p>If confidential information is fed into a self-hosted model, this data does not leave the company to an external vendor</p>  <p>The obvious downside is that it’s not trivial to build and maintain. However, given that leading tech companies already have internal models and are heavy users, it’s likely other businesses will follow by either building in house, or using a vendor offering hosted LLMs with capability for internal security teams to tweak filters.</p> Developers’ reservations <p>But it’s not just companies dragging their feet; developers are also hesitant about LLMs in the survey:</p><p>Commonly cited ethical and environmental concerns:</p>  <p>“The model used to power most AIs represents a large theft of labor from the commons, all to deliver increasingly terrible results.” – Senior software engineer, 19 YOE</p>  <p>“I have ethical concerns about code theft, and environmental concerns about energy consumption.” – Project lead, 9 YOE</p>  <p>“I feel their massive energy use goes against my personal code of ethics” – Software engineer, 8 YOE</p>  <p>“I am uncomfortable with its resource and energy usage, biases and AI hype, as ways to concentrate even more money and power at big tech companies and their culty leaders, which feels too adjacent to the Blockchain hype and grifts from a few years back for comfort.” – Software engineer, 40 YOE</p>  <p>These criticisms are valid. Large language models are known to be trained on copyrighted code, as well as on copyleft-licensed code, where the license is not complied with. And the surge in energy usage is also real, as covered in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146439138/is-genai-creating-more-carbon-pollution-by-cloud-providers">Is GenAI creating more carbon pollution by cloud providers?</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“It appears that the latest technological wave of GenAI may be getting in the way of corporate climate goals. Large language models (LLM) are very hardware and energy-intensive, and Azure, Google Cloud and AWS have all rapidly expanded their data center capacity and power usage, in order to meet demand. With energy usage surging, so are carbon emissions; which is the opposite direction from what they need to be going in, if these companies are to hit Net Zero in 2030 or any time after.</p></blockquote>  <p>Google: carbon emissions up 48% in 2023, compared to 2019</p>  <p>Microsoft: carbon emissions up 30% in 2023, compared to 2020.”</p>  <p>There are clear benefits to GenAI, but also technological downsides. The ethical concerns seem to have no easy answers, while the history of computing has been about making computers more energy efficient, so we should expect the same here. At the same time, it’s concerning that GenAI is used to justify creating data centers which consume massive amounts of energy, or <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/next-gen-data-centers/welcome-to-the-era-of-the-nuclear-powered-data-center">considering nuclear-powered data centers</a> to keep up with computing demand.</p><p>Not enough utility, yet: We previously summarized negative sentiments in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/147666855/unimpressed">“Unimpressed” critiques in Part 2 of this survey</a>. Common complaints about AI from engineers include:</p>  <p>Useful for simple stuff only, poor performance in more complex tasks</p>  <p>Little use outside of repetitive changes and boilerplate generation</p>  <p>Unreliable due to generating buggy code</p>  <p>Seen as a “fancy autocomplete”</p>  <p>More a hindrance than a help</p>  <p>Tedious to work with&nbsp;</p>  <p>Here are two more comments from engineers who stopped using AI tools:</p>  <p>“Seems useful for certain tasks, particularly writing related. For specific coding I could see it being used to generate more boilerplate, but personally my team tends to invest more in common libraries that reduce boilerplate anyway (while ensuring best practices are followed)” – Senior software engineer, 5 YOE</p>  <p>“ChatGPT is a novel tool with some potential to speed up boilerplate work and learning/investigation. It is not a high value for expert software engineers yet, but I’m optimistic that it will improve in a few years.” – Principal software engineer 20 YOE</p>  <p>These reservations are valid, but survey responses show that using LLM tools for 6+ months <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/147666855/how-time-changes-developers-views">changes the views of many developers</a>: mostly to a more positive, or more grounded, viewpoint. If you have an underwhelming first impression of these tools, it might be worth trying them daily for a bit before making up your mind.</p> Why do devs start using LLMs? <p>We asked tech professionals why they started using these tools. The most common responses listed by frequency:</p>  <p>Company pushes LLM usage. Several large businesses set targets for departments of numbers of developers using LLM tools. Companies buying GitHub Copilot licenses also pushed workers to onboard. We’ve heard about company mandates, LLM training, and management expecting devs to use these tools for productivity.</p>  <p>To be more efficient / lazy to google it. Developers may adopt these tools to become more efficient, or because they can’t be bothered doing a web search. All found the tools help them get unblocked faster.</p>  <p>Peer pressure. Friends and peers in tech, and cofounders at startups, recommended them</p>  <p>Hype. Non-stop news about AI played a role in influencing software engineers to check out how the new technology works.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Pressure to keep up. Not wanting to fall behind in the industry, while seeing others use AI tools.</p>  <p>Curiosity. Discovering how the tech can help with their work, or how much better (or worse) it works compared to their existing workflow (especially versus Googling when solving problems, or using Stack Overflow)</p>  <p>An interesting detail for us is that company mandates and pushes are the single most-cited reasons for starting to use AI tools. It seems these do work – at least for that initial “push” to give the tools a go.</p> 4. Advice for devs to get started with AI tools

 改正の背景と目的 



<p>この法改正の主な目的は、</p>



 
 行政のデジタル化基盤整備の促進 



 本人確認情報としての利用 



 各種規制の潜脱行為の防止 
 



<p>の３点です。</p>



<p>現在の戸籍では氏名の読み方が不明確な場合があり、行政手続きや本人確認の場面で不都合が生じていました。</p>



 新制度の概要 



<p>2025年5月26日以降、戸籍にカタカナでフリガナが記載されるようになります。主な変更点は以下の通りです：</p>



 
 新生児の場合、出生届に記載されたフリガナが戸籍に反映されます。 



 すでに戸籍に氏名が記載されている人も、フリガナの届け出が必要になります。 



 フリガナには一定の基準が設けられます。 
 



 届け出の方法と期限 



 
 制度開始から1年以内に「振り仮名の届出」をする必要があります。 



 戸籍の筆頭者は氏名、それ以外の人は名前のフリガナを届け出られます。 



 届け出は書面またはマイナポータル（予定）を通じて行うことができます。 
 



 注意点 



 
 届け出がない場合、市区町村長により職権でフリガナが記載される可能性があります。現在使っている読み方と異なる読み方が登録されてしまう可能性があります。 



 フリガナは一般に認められる読み方でなければなりません。つまり、キラキラネームはNGです。逆に、一般の読み方以外の読み方を現在利用しておられる方は、パスポートや預金通帳など証拠を提示することによってそれを登録することができるようになります。 



 経過措置として、一度のみ家庭裁判所の許可なしでフリガナの変更が可能です。 
 



 自治体の対応 



<p>施行に向けて、自治体は以下の準備を進めています：</p>



 
 正確かつ迅速な通知発送：本籍地の市町村長が戸籍に氏名の振り仮名を記載する前提として、戸籍に記載される予定の氏名の振り仮名等を認識する機会を確保することとしています。具体的には、住民票において市町村が事務処理の用に供するため便宜上保有する情報等を参考に、本籍地の市町村長から皆様に、氏名の振り仮名に関する情報を通知することとしています。この通知は、改正法の施行日（令和７年５月26日）から遅滞なく送付することとしています。 



 オンラインとアナログの併用:氏名の振り仮名の届出については、当該届出をする者の本籍地又は所在地の市町村に行うこととなりますが、窓口への出頭及び郵送による方法が可能です。また、マイナポータルを利用する方法についても現在検討中です。 
 



<p>この制度変更により、戸籍におけるフリガナの取り扱いが明確になり、行政手続きの効率化や本人確認の精度向上が期待されています。市民の皆様は、制度開始後1年以内にフリガナの届け出を行うことを忘れずに、新しい制度に対応していく必要があります。</p>

Due to the nature of who attends EIC, far more technical experts attended the Berlin Summit, whereas the Paris and Cape Town Summits included heavier representation from Governments. For this reason, the agenda emphasized naming barriers to interoperability, refining the approach for technical requirements gathering, and the interplay between Trust Frameworks and protocols. It also included a discussion on Champion Use Cases - particularly for the European context - and building a shared research  agenda. The feedback from these sessions will shape workstream activities and the structure of Summits to follow.    欧州アイデンティティ・クラウド会議（EIC）の前日である2024年6月3日、SIDIハブ・ベルリンに約50名の参加者が集まった。パリとケープタウン・サミットでは政府関係者が多く参加したのに対し、EICでは技術専門家が多く参加した。  このため、アジェンダでは、相互運用性の障壁を挙げること、技術要件収集のアプローチを洗練させること、トラストフレームワークとプロトコルの相互作用が強調された。また、チャンピオンのユースケース（特に欧州の状況）についての議論や、  の共有研究アジェンダの構築も行われた。これらのセッションからのフィードバックは、ワークストリームの活動と、その後のサミットの構成を形作ることになる。  </blockquote><p>→レポートに書いている通り、European Identity &amp; Cloud Conference（EIC）の前日に開催されたため、ケープタウンに比べると少し技術寄りだったかもしれません。また、アフリカに比べるとEUという一つの経済圏がすでに構築されていることがユースケースを考える上での特徴点となるのかもしれません。</p><p><br></p> 主な成果 <blockquote><p>This section synthesizes that information into the high-level themes that the co-organizers took away from the event. Part 2 of this report consolidates the Rapporteur’s notes and many of the slides from the event itself.</p> 本セクションでは、これらの情報を統合し、共同主催者がこのイベントから持ち帰ったハイレベルなテーマを紹介する。本報告書の第2部では、報告者のメモとイベントでのスライドをまとめた。 </blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote> アーキテクチャのタイプ&nbsp; </blockquote><blockquote><p>While there are vast numbers of configurations, profiles, and proprietary APIs related to the transmission of identity data, there are a limited number of architectural archetypes that need to be able to interoperate globally. In particular, those that are based on API connections between Identity Providers (IdPs) and Relying Parties (RP’s) and those that are mediated by an agent (“wallet”) that holds credentials issued to an end-user. Interventions to ensure interoperability of these solutions include options at the source (the IdP or the wallet) or at the destination (the Relying Party or Verifier). SIDI Hub participants remain in active discussion about whether there is a need for broad guidance about which interventions may be more appropriate or if the group should support both “fix-at-source” and “fix-at-destination” models.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ID データの伝送に関連する構成、プロファイル、および独自の API は膨大な数に上るが、グローバルに相互運用でき る必要があるアーキテクチャの原型は限られている。特に、ID プロバイダ（IdP）と依拠当事者（RP）間の API 接続に基づくもの、およびエンドユー ザに発行されたクレデンシャルを保持するエージェント（「ウォレット」）に仲介されるものである。これらのソリューションの相互運用性を確保するための介入には、ソース（IdP またはウォレット）またはデスティネーション（依拠当事者または検証者）におけるオプションが含まれる。SIDI ハブの参加者は、どの介入がより適切であるかについての広範なガイダンスが必要であるか、またはグループが「送信元での固定」と「宛先での固定」の両方のモデルをサポートすべきかについて、活発な議論を続けている。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>→従来のIdPとRPのモデルに加えてウォレットが間に入るモデルを考える場合の相互運用性等に関する深掘りが必要になる、という話です。抽象度を上げていくと単純に送信者と受信者になりますが、それぞれの特性がアーキテクチャによって異なるため相互運用のためのプロトコルや信頼性を確保するためのトラストフレームワークの互換性なども考慮する必要があります。</p><blockquote><p>Verifierがマーケットを作る</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A significant theme of feedback at both SIDI Hub and the EIC event that followed was that Verifiers (in this paragraph, the term is used interchangeably with Relying Party) represent the more challenging side of the marketplace - and that adding complexity or risk to Verifier implementations may make it harder to do business. This would lead to:</p><p>1. Slow adoption and use</p><p>2. Barriers to entry in multiple verticals</p><p>3. Exacerbated inclusion issues for smaller players.</p><p>Any solution needs to address these risks. On the other hand, SIDI Hub participants are also keenly aware that once an ecosystem is functioning, verifiers stand to benefit more than the issuers, who often bear the cost of implementation. The group was eager to explore opportunities to address this imbalance.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>SIDI ハブとそれに続く EIC イベントでのフィードバックの重要なテーマは、検証者（この段落で は、この用語を依拠当事者と同じ意味で使用する）が市場のより困難な側面を代表しており、検証者の実装に複雑性やリスクを加えると、ビジネスが困難になる可能性があるということであった。その結果、以下のことが起こる：</p><p>1. 導入と利用の遅れ</p><p>2. 複数の業種における参入障壁</p><p>3. 小規模プレーヤーのインクルージョンの問題の悪化。</p><p>どのような解決策も、これらのリスクに対処する必要がある。他方、SIDI ハブの参加者は、エコシステムがいったん機能すれば、多くの場合、導入コストを負担す る発行者よりも検証者の方がより多くの利益を得る立場にあることも強く認識している。グループは、この不均衡に対処する機会を探ることに熱心であった。</p></blockquote><p>→この話もいつも議論になるところですね。ビジネスモデルをどうするか、という話です。現状ではやはりVerifierが一番便益を得ることができそうだ、ということなので基盤やサービスを開発するときは十分に年頭におく必要がありそうです。</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>ユースケースの根拠となる要件（あるいは「抽象化の危険性）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;In exploring the set of 9 communication patterns between architectural archetypes, the Minimum Technical Requirements workstream concluded there was a limit to how much could reasonably be accomplished without the solid definition of a use case. As participants have pointed out, examples of successful cross-border interoperability efforts have been rooted in a specific problem space: passports for border crossings and air travel, credit card payments, a unified SAML profile for global access to educational institutions, etc. For this reason, the SIDI Hub Community continues its global listening and will work to define a set of 3-4 “Champion Use Cases” (and dive deeper into their respective requirements) throughout the next several Summits.</p>  アーキテクチャ原型間の9つの通信パターンを検討する中で、最小技術要件ワークストリームは、ユースケースの確固とした定義なしに合理的に達成できることには限界があると結論づけた。参加者が指摘したように、国境を越えた相互運用性の取り組みが成功した例は、特定の問題空間に根ざしたものであった。たとえば、国境通過や航空旅行のためのパスポート、クレジットカード決済、教育機関へのグローバルアクセスのための統一SAMLプロファイルなどである。このような理由から、SIDIハブコミュニティはグローバルな聞き取り調査を継続し、今後数回のサミットを通じて、3～4件の「チャンピオンユースケース」の定義（およびそれぞれの要件への深掘り）に取り組む予定である。   <br> </blockquote><p>→難しいところです。抽象化をしないと汎用的で互換性のあるシステムを構築することは難しくなりますが、ユースケース分析を進めれば進めるほど、「ユースケース依存」の話が大きくkなってくる、ということです。この辺りはアーキテクトの役割になるかと思います。</p><blockquote><p>ブローカーとプロキシ</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Given the expectation that these archetypes continue to exist because states make sovereign choices, it is prudent to assume that interoperability may depend upon brokers and proxies. While this undermines any attempt at a global, fully decentralized, and peer-to-peer architecture - and it necessitates careful consideration for privacy (i.e., masked data) and governance - it does not necessitate a centralized database or “phone home” architecture.</p><p>The terms “Broker” and “Proxy” should not be used interchangeably. Instead, the former may imply a specific market opportunity and commercial interest with pros and cons. Meanwhile, “Proxy” is intended to be a pass-through technical component and implies nothing about a business model.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>国家が主権的な選択をするからこそ、こうした原型が存在し続けるという期待を考えれば、相互運用性はブローカーやプロキシに依存する可能性があると考えるのが賢明だ。このことは、グローバルで、完全に分散化された、ピアツーピアのアーキテクチャの試みを損なうものであり、プライバシー（すなわち、マスクされたデータ）とガバナンスに対する慎重な配慮を必要とするものであるが、集中化されたデータベースや「フォンホーム」アーキテクチャを必要とするものではない。</p><p>ブローカー 「と 」プロキシという用語は、同じ意味で使うべきではなく、前者は特定の市場機会を意味し、長所と短所のある商業的利益を意味する。一方、「プロキシ」はパススルーの技術コンポーネントを意図しており、ビジネスモデルについては何も示唆しない。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;→システム構成を考えるとブローカーやプロキシを配置するモデルが安易で現実的な解になるのは想像に硬くないのですが、どうしても依存度が上がってしまう（場合によってはSPOFとなってしまう）ことはリスクとして捉えておかないといけないと思います。また、ブローカーとプロキシの違いはビジネス的な価値の創出が行われるかどうか、というところで区切りをつけた、ということもこれからのアーキテクチャの詳細化に向けて重要な合意事項だったと思います。</p><p><br></p><p>他にもトラストフレームワークや政府の関与のあり方などもまとめられていますが、この辺りは次回にでも。まずは技術にフォーカスした部分だけを先行してお届けしました。</p>

I made a post about this article only to LinkedIn so I was surprised at only one linkedin.com referral. I thought I had clicked on it more times than that.&nbsp;:-) It kind of makes me sad. Wow, Google. Not sure what I did to show up in some search results but I wish I did that more often. 146 in email, IM and direct. YCombinator… really. I’m honored. Gemini.google.com — interesting.

Sorry getliner.com. Identosphere.net — mildly surprised. I get picked up in the blog aggregator as I have in the past posted more reliably on digital identity and verifiable credentials.</p>

<p>This post shows how to implement an OpenID Connect back-channel logout using Keycloak, ASP.NET Core and .NET Aspire. The Keycloak and the Redis cache are run as containers using .NET Aspire. Two ASP.NET Core UI applications are used to demonstrate the server logout.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/keycloak-backchannel">https://github.com/damienbod/keycloak-backchannel</a></p>



 Setup 



<p>The applications are run and tested using .NET Aspire. The UI applications are setup using the OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE and OAuth PAR. Two docker containers are used, one for the Redis cache and one for the Keycloak server. </p>







<p></p>



 .NET Aspire Setup 



<p>The AppHost project in .NET Aspire is used to configure the different services. The Keycloak container is run using HTTPS with develop certificates. The ASP.NET Core applications are run using development certificates as well. For the Keycloak server to access the docker host, it must register the same developer certificates from the host, or disable the certificate trust manger inside the container. This works good, but should only be setup like this in development. The different project must reference each other as required. To use Redis and Keycloak, the Aspire Nuget packages for these containers need to be installed.</p>


  var keycloak = builder.AddKeycloakContainer("keycloak",
            userName: userName, password: password, port: 8080)
    .WithArgs("--features=preview")
    // for more details regarding disable-trust-manager see https://www.keycloak.org/server/outgoinghttp#_client_configuration_command
    // IMPORTANT: use this command ONLY in local development environment!
    .WithArgs("--spi-connections-http-client-default-disable-trust-manager=true")
    .WithDataVolume()
    .RunWithHttpsDevCertificate(port: 8081);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache", 6379)
    .WithDataVolume();

var mvcpar = builder.AddProject&lt;Projects.MvcPar&gt;("mvcpar")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(keycloak)
    .WithReference(cache);

var mvcbackchanneltwo = builder.AddProject&lt;Projects.MvcBackChannelTwo&gt;("mvcbackchanneltwo")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(keycloak)
    .WithReference(cache);
  


<p></p>



 Keycloak OpenID Connect client configuration 



<p>The Keycloak client should have the backchannel logout activated. The container uses the localhost applications from the docker host and so the host.docker.internal domain is used. The logout endpoint is implemented in the ASP.NET Core application.</p>







<p></p>



 ASP.NET Core Logout 



<p>Each ASP.NET Core application that supports the back-channel logout must have a server implementation and provide a web hook for the identity provider (Keycloak) logout event. If multiple instances are running, one can send a logout event to Keycloak. This ends the session on the identity provider and sends a logout post request to all server backends hosting the UI application. The logout event is handled and persisted to a distributed cache. For all other instances which request data from the server for the same user and session, the session is ended and the user must authentication again.</p>



 
 Logout request 



 Webhook for logout event from Keycloak server for all instances 



 Persist event to cache if missing and logout 



 Logout UI on next HTTP request for user sessions 
 



<p></p>


  services.AddTransient&lt;CookieEventHandler&gt;();
services.AddSingleton&lt;LogoutSessionManager&gt;();
services.AddHttpClient();

services.Configure&lt;AuthConfiguration&gt;(configuration.GetSection("AuthConfiguration"));

var authConfiguration = configuration.GetSection("AuthConfiguration");

builder.AddRedisDistributedCache("cache");

services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(options =&gt;
{
    options.ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(60);
    options.Cookie.Name = "MvcPar";

    options.EventsType = typeof(CookieEventHandler);
})
.AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.Authority = authConfiguration["StsServerIdentityUrl"];
    options.ClientSecret = authConfiguration["ClientSecret"];
    options.ClientId = authConfiguration["Audience"];
    options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;

    options.Scope.Clear();
    options.Scope.Add("openid");
    options.Scope.Add("profile");
    options.Scope.Add("email");
    options.Scope.Add("offline_access");

    options.ClaimActions.Remove("amr");
    options.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey("website", "website");

    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.SaveTokens = true;

    options.PushedAuthorizationBehavior = PushedAuthorizationBehavior.Require;

    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = JwtClaimTypes.Name,
        RoleClaimType = JwtClaimTypes.Role,
    };
});
  


<p>Note: The sample code in the repository was created using the IdentityServer4 Samples.</p>



 Redis cache 



<p>Redis Insight can be used to view the Redis cache data. Each time the application handles a new user and session logout event, it persists the event to the cache. If any further application instances are authenticated using this session and user, the application will sign-out as well on the next server event. The expiry time of the cache should be long enough so that an offline session cannot be opened after it expires.</p>







<p></p>



 Limitations 



<p>The back-channel logout only works on a per browser session because Keycloak creates new sessions for each browser. When the logout is received it is filtered and handled using the Keycloak session. If Keycloak can use a single session for all browsers of each user, then the logout can work for all active UI apps of the same user.</p>

<p>I recently <a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/my-failed-so-far-ai-rag-code-experimentation-9bc78ca36a7b">posted</a> on my experience with using a few Python examples of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with an LLM (OpenAI API). They were underwhelming, though they did provide a lot of insight for me. This post is about my next experiment: let’s get AI tools to generate examples for me. The results were mixed but not for reasons you might think. Here’s what I found using ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot and&nbsp;Cursor.</p><p>Note: you can find the generated code in my <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LLM_Generated_RAG">LLM_Generated_RAG</a> Github repo. I will likely add to this repo as I try new prompts, LLMs, and approaches.</p> ChatGPT 4o <p>Let’s start with the most well-known, ChatGPT. I used a simple prompt to see what it would do. I didn’t provide prompts for different parts of the code. It should not be very extensive code so I didn’t feel the need to divide it into separate prompts. If you want to see my very elementary prompt pull up the <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LLM_Generated_RAG/blob/main/chatgpt_read_from_pdf.py">ChatGPT related file</a> in the&nbsp;repo.</p><p>The first thing I noticed is that it was using PyPDF2 which was deprecated in Decemeber of 2022. Not surprising as, almost certainly, a lot of what the model was trained on used PyPDF2. It actually created well-structured code with functions for the different discrete operations. What I realized later, due to the output of the Cursor tool, is that it created a more granular set of code than it had to. This is exactly what I was looking for but didn’t specify in the prompt. What do I mean? It did the following:</p>  read the PDF and extracted the&nbsp;text  split the document into&nbsp;chunks  created embeddings for the chunks using the OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002  created an embedding for the&nbsp;query  searched the chunks using&nbsp;faiss  generated a response using the query and the chunk(s) as&nbsp;context  <p>This is what I wanted. Turns out there was a very different way to interpret the&nbsp;prompt.</p><p>The downside. The code didn’t run out the box. Also, I believe it only used one chunk for the context to send along with the query. I have to investigate the code more closely to be sure on that single chunk thing. The embedding search chunk function I need to investigate more to understand it. I didn’t try to make the code run for now as that was not part of the experiment. I expect I will try to modify it soon to function. I’ll report back the&nbsp;results.</p><p>This granular set of actions was very different than what I got from&nbsp;Cursor.</p> Cursor <p>The Cursor prompt was not exactly the same as what I used for ChatGPT, which was bad of me to do. I got a little lazier, but the crux was the same. You can see that prompt&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LLM_Generated_RAG/blob/main/cursor_read_from_pdf.py">here</a>.</p><p>The results were very different. It did not provide the granular steps that ChatGPT did. It met the requirement more succinctly.</p>  extract the text from the PDF, also using&nbsp;PyPDF2  pass the entire text to ChatGPT as context along with the&nbsp;prompt  <p>When I first posted this I said it rain out of the gate, but that was wrong. It suffered from the same issue all three code generations did. It tried to use an old call of openai chat completion. With that fixed I believe it would, hypothetically, return the expected results. It would work similarly to how one does it in the ChatGPT interface. Not what I wanted, but I hadn’t specified to break it down so that I was creating embeddings etc. Fair&nbsp;game.</p><p>The downside, the context was too large (43,000+ tokens) for the tokens per minute limit of my OpenAPI account level and gpt-4o model (see attached note for an explanation). So I didn’t get to see the output, but have no doubt it would have produced similar results as if I had done it through the ChatGPT user interface.</p> Microsoft Copilot <p>What can I say? I don’t know what I would have gotten here because Copilot blocked the output. This is apparently because “GitHub Copilot checks code completion suggestions with their surrounding code of about 150 characters against public code on GitHub. If there is a match, or a near match, the suggestion is not shown to&nbsp;you.”</p><p>There is a flag you can set in your Github settings to turn this on or off. I checked and my flag and it is set to “Allowed” but you see the&nbsp;results.</p><p>I’ll continue to try to troubleshoot this issue and see if I can get something out of Copilot and update this post if I&nbsp;do.</p> In recap <p>In recap. One provided the detail I wanted even though I hadn’t specified it, a happy coincidence, but it did not run out of the gate. The second took a very different approach and would have provided the desired results in LLM response if my OpenAPI account level had supported a large enough tokens per minute for 43,000+ tokens in the context. But it wasn’t the code I was hoping for. Copliot just didn’t work for me for reasons I don’t yet understand. More experimentation to&nbsp;come.</p>

<p>If a set of accounts live in isolation forever, what happens to those accounts only matters within that isolated system. But when we make a bubble in our federated network, we aren’t just making a stand-alone system that can go live in a fully disconnected state. Over time, we expect things to re-connect, and when that happens, data needs to be harmonized across the boundaries.</p>So many bubbles, so many connections Data Synchronization <p>When multiple independent systems live together in the world and share data, inevitably that data is going to get out of sync. In a purely heirarchical system, we’re mostly concerned with building a consensus around the correct state of the shared data. We see this approach in distributed ledger systems, where nodes eventually come to a common view of what the shared state of the world ought to&nbsp;be.</p><p>But we don’t have that in a bubble-based architecture, because we don’t expect everyone to have the same view. Instead, we expect many different independent views to contribute to each other in a distributed fashion. This effectively means that for each bubble, it can send updates in and out to other systems. In most cases, there is a directionality to the data flow: one side is going to be treated as more authoritative than the other for a given context. What a bubble does when it’s on either end of that gap changes how we view the synchronization.</p> Account Updates From&nbsp;Above <p>When changes are pushed to us from an authoritative source, the simplest thing is to overwrite everything. After all, if it’s authoritative, why wouldn’t we just take that statement as truth? But the reality is that we’ve likely augmented our record of that user with additional details, overrides, and other localized changes that we don’t want to&nbsp;lose.</p>Local data (blue) shadows updates from the source (orange), in some&nbsp;cases<p>In these cases, we can shadow the data. In other words, we keep a copy of the source’s data separate from our own local view. When we get an update from that source, we can update our copy of the source’s data with wild abandon. We can then decide, by local policy, whether we want to adjust our overrides based on the update. Importantly, this decision is separate from accepting and processing the updated data from the source. This setup allows us to keep local information in the bubble at the same time that we sync from elsewhere.</p> Account Updates From&nbsp;Below <p>An authoritative bubble is sometimes going to want to pull updated information from the bubbles that live downstream. These are systems that we’ve sent accounts out to, and those systems might have something to tell us about our users. Maybe there’s an additional accreditation that’s been earned, or something to represent additional access details outside of our bubble, or even just an update to one of the core fields we sent&nbsp;down.</p><p>In any case, the downstream bubble is sending us additional data about a user, and we now have the chance to do something about it. If nothing else, we can store it and note it. If we want to, we can update the user’s record that we hold locally, and even go so far as to propagate that downward again to other&nbsp;bubbles.</p> Changing Trust <p>It’s not just user data that we can pass around, though that’s the most common piece we’d expect to see. The bubbles can also pass about other bubbles to each other, and incorporate what they learn into their own&nbsp;systems.</p><p>For many situations that fit the bubble architecture patterns, we expect to meet new peers in the field and make new decisions based on local context and requirements. These newly-discovered bubbles can then be propagated through the network, along with potentially interesting information about what the presenting bubble trusts it&nbsp;for.</p> Audit Logs <p>Now that we can identify users and the systems they come from, we can start to do one of the most interesting and perhaps complex jobs of a reconnected bubble: audit logs. When a bubble gets provisioned, that provisioning authority is likely to want to know what happens in that bubble during the disconnected spells. The bubble can package up the relevant audit log history and pass it along to the authorities that need&nbsp;it.</p><p>But auditing can go further than that: for any user that enters our bubble from somewhere else, we probably want to report back to the system that sent them to us. Since we know where we originally learned of them, and we know how to identify that system as a whole, we can filter and target the information we’re sending over. And we can do this while processing the updates they’re sending us about the&nbsp;account.</p> Conclusion <p>The bubble pattern sits between the always-connected and always-separate models, but the moment of reconnection gives us a profound opportunity to process user and trust data in ways that we may have never considered.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Microsoft Recall to be unremovable, another “AI talent raid” by Amazon, Ticketmaster struggles to handle common load challenges – sometimes, rise and fall of OpenSea, and more.</p>  <p>More trad tech companies to move off public cloud? In a recent report, 83% of chief information officers say they want to move more workload to private clouds. Cloud computing has matured and is becoming more expensive, while private cloud technology is increasingly accessible.</p>  <p>CockroachDB: open source product goes proprietary.

Many users need to open their wallets and buy annual licenses, or fork and maintain an older version of CockroachDB.</p>  <p>Software glitch almost floods Amsterdam. Dams near the Dutch capital that were supposed to be closed, mysteriously opened at night during a violent storm. Disaster was averted by a curious employee – and the workaround to avoid similar incidents includes 24-hour human monitoring of dams and water levels.</p>   1. Industry pulse  Microsoft Recall to be unremovable <p>Microsoft’s struggle with its controversial Recall feature continues. Recall is a “photographic memory” feature planned for Windows 11 which takes constant screenshots of a device, and makes it searchable. Its launch in June was a disaster, as Microsoft <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-95">skipped basic security and privacy approaches</a> – making these screenshots easily accessible for bad actors. A week after, Microsoft <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/145607050/recall-recalled">“recalled” Recall</a>, confirming that it will not ship it with these glaring holes.</p><p>Now, the Redmond-headquartered tech giant is doubling down on Recall: it will be shipping on Windows 11, and the feature will <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/turns-out-you-wont-be-able-to-uninstall-windows-11s-recall-feature-after-all">have no option to be uninstalled</a>. Users won’t be able to disable it.</p><p>The problem with making Recall core to Windows with no way to remove it or turn it off at the OS level, is that it could become a dealbreaker for enterprise clients which will not want an invasive, potentially insecure feature to run on machines by default. It’s also strange to see Microsoft so set on shipping this feature that is clearly designed to make some use of the hardware GPUs, even though the utility is still questionable. The company will surely keep getting bad press, and privacy-focused techies will have one more reason to stay clear of Windows.</p> Another “AI talent heist”

And who knows, maybe if people see what’s possible when information silos converge, the common tools that can ease convergence will seem more attractive.” — <a href="https://thenewstack.io/an-llm-turbocharged-community-calendar-reboot/">An LLM-Turbocharged Community Calendar Reboot</a></p>

<p>I have been wanting to experiment with creating some code performing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for an LLM. So far I am 0 for 2. In both examples I tried, that were professed to work, it fell far short. I blame embedding and retrieval. I also blame myself… who else is there to blame. I know RAG works in some form because I can go onto ChatGPT upload a PDF and prompt about it with expected and quality results; but, when trying to replicate similar outcomes from code and the OpenAI API I get disappointing results. Here’s the&nbsp;story.</p><p>Experiment one was part of a Udemy course on RAG and mastering some better approaches than naive RAG. Specifically RAG with query expansion. It was a very short course but had a couple of cohesive Python examples that built out over the course material. It included the document to use for the augmentation. Additionally, unlike experiment two, it largely didn’t rely on a ton of abstraction of the underlying basic concepts. After reading and parsing the text from the PDF I used RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter and<br> SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter from Langchain to create my chunks. Added my chunks to Chroma db in memory using their default embedder. Took my query and performed the retrieval of 5 chunks from the Chroma db. No reranking performed. The returned chunks were at best partial results and at worst just not as good as expected. What I hadn’t noticed about the code from the instruction when I went through the class is that it never passed the chunks back as context to the LLM the second time along with the query to get an answer. Kind of an important part to be missing. I can tell from the returned chunks it would not have produced a satisfactory answer had the closing action before performed. I tried with differing chunk sizes and overlaps and never received better results. I tried with my own document and faired no better. I chalked it up to a disappointing and poor example. Perhaps this is why it didn’t go the final step to pass it all back to the LLM for a response.</p><p>I moved on to a second experiment that used a bit more abstraction by relying on Langchain significantly more. It was also doing naive RAG, not augmenting the prompt from the LLM initially in any way. This time it did have the pass to the LLM in the end to get the LLM response. Looking at the chunks it retrieved I could tell I wasn’t going to get a satisfactory response. I had asked it for a list of 10 principles that were specifically outlined in the document in a single paragraph. The best in all my attempts was that I got 2, maybe 3 of the list. Again I played around with chunk size and overlap and generally only got worse results. The results in the demonstration had not seemed much better when I evaluated it more&nbsp;closely.</p><p>All in all I need a third+ experiment. I am trying to get a response even remotely similar to what I get from the ChatGPT. Obviously, my examples are not high enough&nbsp;quality.</p><p>Do you have such an&nbsp;example?</p><p>Time to ask ChatGPT, Claude, Github Copliot, or Cursor — sounds like a job for Cursor — to create a python program for me and see how it functions.</p>

<blockquote> Q: “I’d like to make a better case for paying down tech debt on my team. What are some proven approaches for this?” </blockquote><p>The tension in finding the right balance between shipping features and paying down accumulated tech debt is as old as software engineering. There’s no one answer on how best to reduce tech debt, and opinion is divided about whether zero tech debt is even a good thing to aim for. But approaches for doing it exist which work well for most teams.</p><p>To tackle this eternal topic, I turned to industry veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/loufranco/">Lou Franco</a>, who’s been in the software business for over 30 years as an engineer, EM, and executive. He’s also worked at four startups and the companies that later acquired them; most recently Atlassian as a Principal Engineer on the Trello iOS app.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s currently an operating partner at private equity firm SilverTree Equity, and technical co-founder at a new startup. Lou says he isn’t delighted about the volume of tech debt accumulated during his career, but is satisfied with how much of it he’s managed to pay down.&nbsp;</p><p>In this guest post, Lou shares insights about how to approach tech debt. Later this year, he’s publishing <a href="https://loufranco.com/tech-debt-book">a book on the subject</a>. For updates on this upcoming release, <a href="https://loufranco.com/tech-debt-book">subscribe here</a>.</p><p>In this article, we cover:</p>  <p>Pay down tech debt to go faster, now. It’s common for less experienced engineering leaders to assume that focusing on features and ignoring tech debt is how to move faster. Lou used to agree, but not any more.</p>  <p>Use tech debt to boost productivity. Three examples of when tackling tech debt empowered engineering teams to move faster, right away.</p>  <p>Link tech debt and value delivery. When tech debt is tackled sensibly, it delivers business value. At Trello and Atalasoft, this was how Lou got engineers and management to appreciate the task.</p>  <p>Make tech debt’s effects visible. Dashboards are an effective way to visualize the impact of tech debt. A few examples.</p>  <p>Factor in time saved when thinking about productivity. Reducing tech debt typically improves coding, reviewing, and deployment for everyone.</p>  <p>Use tech debt payments to get into the flow. In a counter-intuitive observation: by making small, non-functional improvements, you gain more confidence in a new codebase, and can start to move faster.</p>  <p>Big rewrites need heavyweight support. Without the backing of management, a large-scale rewrite is likely to fail.</p>  <p>With that, it’s over to Lou:</p>    1. Pay down tech debt to go faster immediately <p>What is tech debt?</p><p>I define tech debt as any problem in the codebase that affects programmers by making it harder to make necessary changes. As a programmer, I wanted to fix such issues because they slowed me down. But as a manager, I had to ensure the team delivered value to stakeholders. I’ve gone back and forth between these roles during my career, and made mistakes in both directions – but I also learned a lot about getting the balance right.</p> Reducing tech debt pays off immediately in faster builds <p>In 2010, I was head of development at Atalasoft, a company in the .NET developer tools space. I was obsessed with shipping, and spent all my time worrying about delivering the features in our roadmap. Over time, we improved at this, which showed up in our revenue growth and eventually led to an acquisition.&nbsp;</p><p>We were in a competitive market with more opportunities than we could handle. We had fewer than ten developers, but we were bootstrapped, so had to stay profitable and couldn’t just hire ahead of revenue.</p><p>The stakes got even higher after we were acquired. We had two years to deliver on an ambitious roadmap, for which there was an earnout bonus contingent upon delivery. If we didn’t deliver, we’d likely be classified as a failed acquisition. Our new owners had just had one such failure, which led to downsizing and an office closure.</p><p>My mindset was that any time spent on technical debt meant we’d fail to deliver on the roadmap. We couldn’t risk the deadline by wasting time cleaning up old messes, and had to choose between tech debt and roadmap delivery. In hindsight, I see this was wrong. I learned that the mindset of ignoring tech debt hurt my team.</p><p>Following an exit interview in which a departing engineer mentioned tech debt had contributed to their decision to leave, I started asking people during 1:1s how they felt about it. Their responses showed their frustration with me.&nbsp;</p><p>By then, I had been a developer for over fifteen years, and had worked in codebases with a lot of debt, so I knew what it was like. But by now, I was a manager who sometimes contributed code, but had forgotten what it was like to be thwarted by the codebase every day. To my team, I was part of the problem. They had been trying to tell me this, but I didn’t get it. Their departing colleague with nothing to lose in their exit interview finally got through to me and helped me understand the depth of the issue, and that it was slowing everyone down.</p><p>I learned an important lesson: the cost of tech debt is borne daily by your team, and you risk damaging motivation and raising attrition by ignoring it. Even if you have every reason to move forward without addressing tech debt, being an empathic manager requires you at least do something. Doing nothing – like I did – is not a good option.</p><p>So we started making changes. The biggest problems were with our build system and installer because they affected every developer and every product. It was a tangled bag of legacy code that needed constant maintenance, but it wasn’t very big, and I approved a plan to rewrite it with modern tools. It was a small experiment but paid off right away in quicker CI builds and an easier-to-modify codebase. Most importantly, I saw it didn’t derail our roadmap, so we took on other small initiatives.</p><p>This taught me another lesson about addressing technical debt. I had thought of it as something that might pay off in the long run. Might. This belief made it hard to justify doing it when I had to deliver on short-term goals. But instead, something else happened:</p><p>We paid off tech debt and increased productivity instantly! We had a build with faster feedback loops, less cognitive load, and which didn’t make developers frustrated when they had to add to it, which happened regularly. Updates were made with less code and without breaking things. It was an example of tech debt reduction paying off in increased developer productivity, right away.</p> Learning the cost of too much rewriting at Trello <p>I got my next lesson at Trello where I worked on the iOS app. The codebase was three years old when I joined in 2014. It had understandable tech debt because they needed to move fast, after going from 0 to 6 million sign ups. The devs working on it were founding engineers, working as described by The Pragmatic Engineer in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thriving-as-a-founding-engineer">Thriving as a Founding Engineer</a>, and seeking product-market fit. Our biggest tech debt issue were some frameworks that made it fast to build a simple app, but held us back as the app got more complex.</p><p>Our own choices were influenced by the speed of Apple’s updates to iOS. The iOS 7 update completely changed the iOS design language and its network APIs. Later, iOS 8 introduced presentation controllers that gave developers much control over the animation when new views are shown. Unfortunately, the iOS 8 change broke our navigation code and caused crashes. These added up and started to make our code seem antiquated.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21fc82f0-527d-4dfa-84ea-dd68a15a1b85_1208x1052.png">    </a>Left: how most iOS 6 apps looked like. Right: the iOS 7 version. iOS 7 introduced a ‘flatter’ look, and required lots of code changes to implement this new UI. Screenshot is from my app called Habits <p>Our code got even more complex when Apple decided to feature Trello on physical iPhones at Apple Stores. To be in stores, we needed a build that worked without an account or a network, so a mock backend was embedded in it for demo purposes. We didn’t want to maintain a separate codebase, so had a lot of random bits of demo-mode logic that stayed for years.&nbsp;</p><p>At Trello, I was coding every day and all this was in my face. Luckily, we were a small team of three developers, so my direct manager was also coding every day and was empathetic to the problems.</p><p>We did rewrites as we went, but sometimes went too far. To deal with the presentation controller problem of iOS 8, we developed a new paradigm for screen navigation inside the app, and rewrote all navigation to use it. This approach was the exact opposite of what I did at Atalasoft, where I’d ignored all tech debt.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the approach of rewriting early turned out to be overkill. In hindsight, we could have just corrected the places that had crashed, and then lived with the code we had. Instead, we spent a few months designing and implementing a new, non-standard way of writing navigation code, but forgot a vital lesson that one of our founders, Joel Spolsky, identified in 2000 in <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Things You Should Never Do</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“We’re programmers. Programmers are, in their hearts, architects, and the first thing they want to do when they get to a site is to bulldoze the place flat and build something grand. We’re not excited by incremental renovation: tinkering, improving, planting flower beds.</p><p>There’s a subtle reason that programmers always want to throw away the code and start over. The reason is that they think the old code is a mess. And here is the interesting observation: they are probably wrong. The reason that they think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental law of programming:</p><p>It’s harder to read code than to write it.”</p></blockquote><p>On the Trello engineering team, we were all very familiar with this article and quoted it to each other often, but it still sometimes bit us. The urge to rewrite a system instead of fixing it is strong, and we couldn’t resist! We should have addressed the few complex navigation cases that crashed our code without the full rewrite.</p><p>Size tech debt payment to be proportional to value. This is the biggest lesson I learned on this project.</p><p>I’ve seen both extremes of dealing with tech debt:</p>  <p>As a manager, I was overly resistant to devoting time to dealing with technical debt</p>  <p>As an engineer, I was exposed to its problems every day and didn’t resist the urge to pay it off enough&nbsp;</p>  <p>These two extremes form the fundamental tension of dealing with tech debt. As usual, there needs to be a balance, but finding it is not so easy.&nbsp;</p><p>The heuristic I use to pay tech debt these days is this: by reducing a specific tech debt, can I increase developer productivity and deliver business value right now?</p><p>If I can’t, then I don’t pay it down.&nbsp;</p><p>When the debt is so big that it couldn’t possibly deliver value now, or the value is invisible so nobody sees it, I do something else. Let me break down my heuristic…</p> 2. Use tech debt to increase productivity <p>I try to pay down a little bit of tech debt regularly by making small cleanup commits as I go. I started doing this more intentionally after reading Kent Beck’s book, Extreme Programming Explained, in 1999, which introduced me to automated unit tests and continuous integration. Then, when I read Martin Fowler’s Refactoring, I started to see how to improve a codebase over time with very small, behavior-preserving changes checked by unit tests. In both books, and in others like Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers, and Kent Beck’s recent, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/dead-code-getting-untangled-and-coupling">Tidy First?</a>, the authors stress that technical debt is inevitable, and that the main way to curtail it is to be constantly fixing it with small improvements enabled by unit tests and mechanical refactoring. I agree.</p><p>Unit tests, refactoring, and continuous integration are ubiquitous in the kinds of software I write, which are B2B SaaS productivity applications. Even making small improvements on an ongoing basis is common among my coworkers. It doesn’t take long, and there are usually quick wins to be had, like making the code more readable, or using a unit test to show how the code is supposed to work. Even in frontend code, Trello iOS adopted Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) so we could test view-logic. We got the immediate productivity benefit of being able to run view code repeatedly without needing to manipulate a running app through several screens to check that our changes worked.</p><p>The issue is when the debt is large, which is where I struggled. My problem at Atalasoft was not with small improvements; it was with the bigger ones where I’d have to trade off current benefits like delivering features for the roadmap, for uncertain future benefits.</p><p>But I realized something.</p><p>You can get productivity benefits immediately, even with larger initiatives. If you do it right, you will deliver feature work faster and with higher quality. In fact, I view tech debt proposals that don’t deliver instant developer productivity gains as suspect.&nbsp;</p><p>Rewriting the build and installer at Atalasoft brought an immediate productivity boost. We had a backlog of problems and new additions, but the rewrite took one developer around a month, and when it was done many of the problems just went away because the new system was based on a framework wherein many problems could not occur, meaning we could close a bunch of reported bugs. The new system was unit testable, so we didn’t need to build and install the entire system during development to test our new changes while we were writing it. We also got more benefits later, but the instant benefits justified it.</p><p>At Trello, adding unit tests to a codebase helped me finish a project faster. When I joined in 2014, we were just about to start our internationalization (i18n) project, which I took on for the iOS app. One part was to write support for i18n-safe string interpolation (inserting variables or expressions into a string,) and pluralization (adjusting words to plural forms based on the number they refer to, to make the phrases grammatically correct) – which was only partially supported in iOS at the time. It’s standard string manipulation at its core, but in 2014 our iOS app didn’t have unit tests.</p><p>Without unit tests, if I had wanted to run the code, I’d need to run the app and then tap-tap-tap until I got to a specific string. I would have to do this for each kind of string I generated. But with unit-tests, I could just list all the examples with their expected results, and run tests in less than a second. So, I proposed to the team to add unit tests to our build and CI.</p><p>No one was against unit tests, but it hadn’t been a priority. Most of the code was UI or network code, for which unit tests are harder to write. But the code I was writing was highly testable, and in fact, it’s harder to write without tests. So, I added the unit test project to our workspace and wrote the string code. With the unit test project there, the other developers added tests to their work. I was there for six more years, and saw the benefits of the tests over time, especially in complex code like our sync engine. But that’s not why I did it: I added the unit tests to go faster immediately.</p><p>Also at Trello, creating an abstraction layer for the design system made us more productive. Eventually, we created a design system with a reduced set of fonts, colors, and other design attributes and specific rules for using them. Before, it was common to see hardcoded values in view controllers throughout the app, as each screen implemented the designer’s specification for that screen, which wasn’t always consistent. We could have just updated those lines to the new approved values, but it was the perfect time to make an abstraction for the design system itself. Doing this made it faster to write code that matched a design, and when a default in the design system changed, it would be reflected everywhere.</p><p>These three examples also adhere to another heuristic I use for finding the right balance with tech debt: coupling it with delivery of value.</p> 3. Couple tech debt fixes with value delivery

<p>Schon <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/194992/imfname_11404502.pdf">morgen früh</a> sollen die EU-Regierungen den umstrittenen Gesetzentwurf zur Chatkontrolle, der im Juni nach massiven Protesten von der Tagesordnung genommen wurde, jetzt doch unterstützen. Erreichen will die neue ungarische Ratspräsidentschaft dies nach einer <a href="https://www.contexte.com/actualite/medias/abus-sexuels-sur-mineurs-la-presidence-hongroise-tente-deja-dobtenir-un-accord-entre-etats_200187.html?go-back-to-briefitem=200187">Meldung</a> des Nachrichtendienstes Contexte mit einer <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CSAM-policy-debate-September-2024-via-politico.pdf">von Politico geleakten Detailänderung</a>, nämlich dem Verzicht auf die besonders fehleranfällige Suche nach unbekanntem Material im Zuge der verpflichtenden Chatkontrolle (freiwillig soll sie möglich bleiben). Geplant bleibt aber ansonsten die automatisierte Durchsuchung und gegebenenfalls Ausleitung privater Chats, darunter auch Ende-zu-Ende-verschlüsselte Chats, die zuvor klassifizierte verdächtige Fotos oder Videos enthalten sollen. Lehnt ein Nutzer diese „Upload-Moderation“ seiner Chats ab, könnte er keinerlei Bilder, Videos oder URLs mehr <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/csam_cleaned.pdf">senden oder empfangen</a>. Signal und Threema haben angekündigt, dass sie ihre Dienste in der EU einstellen würden, wenn sie gezwungen würden, die vorgeschlagene automatisierte Massenüberwachung (sogenanntes „Client-Side Scanning“) umzusetzen.</p>



<p>Der ehemalige Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei, Patrick Breyer, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/csam_cleaned.pdf">ruft die Bürger jetzt dazu auf sich an die EU-Regierungen zu wenden</a>: „Im Juni gab es unter massivem öffentlichen Druck noch eine hauchdünne Sperrminorität zur Rettung des Digitalen Briefgeheimnisses, aber kaum bemerkte Blitzaktionen, zwischenzeitliche Regierungswechsel und Minimalzugeständnisse können das schnell ändern. Falls die Chatkontrolle kommt, werden wir gängige sichere Messenger ganz einfach nicht mehr nutzen können – das bedeutet wir verlieren den Kontakt zu unseren Freunden und Kollegen in der ganzen Welt“, warnt Breyer. „Wollen wir wirklich, dass Europa weltweit führend beim Abhören unserer Smartphones und der flächendeckenden Überwachung der Chats von Millionen gesetzestreuer Bürger wird? Das Europäische Parlament ist überzeugt, dass diese orwellsche Chatkontrolle das dringliche Anliegen eines besseren Kinder- und Opferschutzes verrät, weil sie unweigerlich vor Gericht scheitern wird. Es fordert deshalb einen wirklich wirksamen Kinderschutz durch sicherere Apps, proaktive Säuberung des Internets und eine Pflicht zur Löschung illegaler Inhalte – nichts davon ist in dem dem neuesten Orban-Vorstoß vorgesehen, zu dem sich die Regierungen morgen positionieren sollen. Jetzt liegt es an uns ihn zu stoppen!“</p>



<p>Die Chatkontrolle auf vermeintlich „bekannte“ illegale Inhalte beschränken zu wollen, bezeichnet Breyer als Augenwischerei: „Egal mit welchem Ziel – auch die Post darf nicht einfach jeden Brief verdachtslos öffnen und durchschnüffeln. Gerade die von US-Konzernen schon heute freiwillig praktizierte Durchleuchtung nach vermeintlich bekannten Inhalten führt zur Ausleitung tausender völlig legaler privater Chats, zur Überlastung der Strafverfolger und zur massenhaften Kriminalisierung Minderjähriger. Massenüberwachung ohne jeden Anlass zerstört das digitale Briefgeheimnis und sichere Verschlüsselung, auf die wir alle und auch unsere Kinder dringend angewiesen sind.“</p>

<p>This post shows how to implement an ASP.NET Core application which uses OpenID Connect and OAuth PAR for authentication. The client application uses <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak</a> as the identity provider. The Keycloak application is hosted in a docker container. The applications are run locally using .NET Aspire. This makes it really easy to develop using containers.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/keycloak-backchannel">https://github.com/damienbod/keycloak-backchannel</a></p>



 Setup 



<p>The standard Aspire Microsoft template was used to setup the .NET Aspire AppHost, ServiceDefaults projects. The Keycloak container service was added to the AppHost project using the Keycloak.AuthServices.Aspire.Hosting Nuget package. An ASP.NET Core Razor Page project was added as the UI client, but any project can be used like Blazor or an MVC application.</p>







<p></p>



 Keycloak Setup 



<p>The Keycloak Container is completely setup in the AppHost project. The Keycloak.AuthServices.Aspire.Hosting Nuget package is used to add the integration to .NET Aspire. For this to work, <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker Desktop</a> needs to be installed in the development environment. I want to use the Keycloak preview features and initialized this using the WithArgs method. If using the Microsoft Keycloak package, the setup is almost identical.</p>


  var userName = builder.AddParameter("userName");
var password = builder.AddParameter("password", secret: true);

var keycloak = builder.AddKeycloakContainer("keycloak", 
            userName: userName, password: password, port: 8080)
    .WithArgs("--features=preview")
    .WithDataVolume()
    .RunWithHttpsDevCertificate(port: 8081);
  


<p></p>



<p>I want to develop using HTTPS and so the Keycloak container needs to run in HTTPS as well. This was not so simple to setup, but <a href="https://github.com/DamianEdwards">Damien Edwards</a> provided a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/blob/b741f5e78a86539bc9ab12cd7f4a5afea7aa54c4/samples/Keycloak/Keycloak.AppHost/HostingExtensions.cs">solution</a> which works great.</p>



<p>The RunWithHttpsDevCertificate extension method was added using his code and adapted so that the port is fixed for the HTTPS Keycloak server. This implementation requires the System.IO.Hashing Nuget package.</p>

<p>Note: The AppHost project must reference all the services used in the solution.</p>



 Keycloak client configuration 



<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/keycloak-backchannel/blob/main/KeycloakClients/razorpagepar.json">razorpagepar.json</a> file in the git repository. This is a Keycloak export of the whole client. This can be imported and updated.</p>



<p>The client is configured to use PAR.</p>







<p></p>



 ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect client using OAuth PAR 



<p>The client application uses the standard OpenID Connect client and requires OAuth PAR for authentication. This is a new feature in .NET 9. The repo has a Razor Page OpenID Connect example as well as an MVC client sample. This would be the same for a Blazor application.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.Authority = authConfiguration["StsServerIdentityUrl"];
    options.ClientSecret = authConfiguration["ClientSecret"];
    options.ClientId = authConfiguration["Audience"];
    options.ResponseType = "code";

    options.Scope.Clear();
    options.Scope.Add("openid");
    options.Scope.Add("profile");
    options.Scope.Add("email");
    options.Scope.Add("offline_access");

    options.ClaimActions.Remove("amr");
    options.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey("website", "website");

    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.SaveTokens = true;

    options.PushedAuthorizationBehavior = PushedAuthorizationBehavior.Require;

    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = JwtClaimTypes.Name,
        RoleClaimType = JwtClaimTypes.Role,
    };
});
  


<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>.NET Aspire looks great and is easy to use in development. I am only learning this and must learn the details now. I have some issues using the containers and HTTPS and I don’t understand how the configuration works. I also don’t understand how this would work in production. Lots to learn.</p>

<p>I write this post on the first anniversary of the death of my dear father Jerry Lee Hawver who grew up in an unstable, alcoholic household and through hard work and great people skills became a star athlete and executive with Proctor and Gamble. He and my mother raised my brother and me in the corporate suburbia of the New South of the 1970s and 80s, steadily climbing the ladder of the American dream. For my formative years that was my culture. The dynamic in our home was that I was the child who sought approval. My brother pushed the boundaries. Over time he and I have come together to meet in the center. We are both Hawver stock, and we “get ‘er done.”</p>
<p>In those early years of the feral-child 1970s, us kids had the run of the neighborhood yards and wood lots. I’ve spoken of hanging out by the creek lined with quartz-laden rip-rap looking for crawdads and swinging from giant vines and making “forts.” My best friend’s name was Andrea Hopkins. She and her brother Brandon lived in a house that was kitty-cross from our backyard. Her father had a British accent and they had a few antiques, which I thought made them rather a glamorous family. We would often spend the afternoon exploring, riding our Big Wheels around, playing freeze tag, and putting on plays in the garage. Sometimes Andi and I would get crafty and make little coil pots out of the red Kentucky clay and fill them with potions made of petals from her mom’s flower beds along her driveway. Of course, there were marigolds in the mix. In some ways my new “cottage” rancher is like a return to this liminal space of childhood imaginative possibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize now that early success is not necessarily a blessing. I did well in school after a disastrous second-grade year with a body-building teacher, Mrs. Weigand, in an open classroom school I had to take three buses to get to (desegregation). I have a strange memory of being shown a graphic movie of the horrors of smallpox in a tiny room with carpeted levels. That made no sense to me, but I later found out that the Flexners (of the Carnegie / Rockefeller Flexner Report) were from Louisville, so maybe we were part of some public health behavioral experiment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recovered the following year at the much more traditional Wilder Elementary School where we had a fabulous librarian who would take small groups of kids around the shelves and do short book pitches and place books into the hands of kids she knew would love them. It’s funny that there were quite a few paranormal kids’ books in the 70s – John Bellairs and Zilpha Keatley Snyder. The one book that really stayed with me was Margaret Anderson’s “To Nowhere And Back,” a time-travel adventure where a girl passes through an English hedge into another century to make friends with a poor servant girl on the other side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was never in the popular crowd, but I always had a circle of friends. Without realizing it, my identity became wrapped up in my idea of performance, of being a “good” person based on what society said good was. My life unfolded with relative ease, meeting my husband in college, raising a small family, doing my part to make my neighborhood and city a better place, so I thought. But things started to change when my child was in middle school as I began to realize society was being broken on purpose, and the social systems I’d built my identity around began to give way one by one. Eisenhower’s chosen head for ARPA was the President of Procter and Gamble Neil McElroy? Oh, and they ran contracts building nuclear missiles in the panhandle of Texas (Pantex)? You don’t say? Well that sure put Mr. Whipple and Mrs. Olson in a new light in a new light for me. If one’s identity is wrapped up in societal expectations and those start falling away, how does the center hold?</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a “good person” within the expectations of a profoundly flawed system? Here my parents had worked so hard to walk us up the mountain of success, who was I to pull off on a wayside and kick rocks? I was the good girl, wasn’t I? When my marriage fell apart and my child became estranged from me, the silver lining was the opportunity to begin to shed the “good girl” archetype. Not that I had become a “bad girl,” it’s just that I recognized such labels were insufficient and did not do justice to the richly evolving tapestry of my life. Our lives have dramatic arcs. I know it sounds trite, but if there are no bumps in the road, you can’t truly appreciate the parts when the ride is smooth and clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year we were trying to sort out the memorial service for my father. At the time I had been applying to all sorts of jobs with the idea that I would stay in Philadelphia and try to hold onto our family home that was almost paid off. In my perceived role of the “good mother,” I thought at some point my young adult child might return from the west coast and need a place to land. Life laughed at me and had the literal soles fall off my shoes on the walk to one interview at Wharton.</p>
<p>During the two-day drive from Philadelphia to North Carolina to be with my father in hospice I cried a lot. I thought about his strength, both physical and strength of character. He was a big man, and I was small, but we fit together, a chip off the old block. I was listening to a <a href="https://mythicmedicine.love/podcast/perdita-finn">podcast</a> this week on our relationship to death and ancestors and Perdita Finn said that sometimes when people go, it is because they can help the ones they love more from the other side. I truly believe my father has been with me every step of the way since that morning when I held his swollen big hands and I read to him from L’Engle’s “An Acceptable Time” and bathed his forehead in kisses, my cheeks wet, and he crossed over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a hurtful email exchange with my child and husband about the memorial service, it was clear that I was being removed from their lives with strong intention and there was nothing I could do about it. I am a planner. Hawvers like to be in control. We try to fix things. All of those things were off the table. It was up to me to build a new story outside of all the stories that had defined my life since I met my husband during our study abroad program in Venice in 1989. I’d never been alone, and now I was going to figure out how to be me, for me, not the good daughter, the model student, the diligent mother and wife. I told my husband I was going to leave Philadelphia and get a cozy cottage where I could garden and a kayak. I spoke it outloud, a reasonable wish, with conviction and with a few days to spare I got it all squared away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s taken me a year to come around to this way of thinking, because there was a lot of pain to acknowledge and process. But now I realize I was being given space to unfold in a new way. I had a choice. I could hold onto the baggage I was carrying and imagine myself as a failure across many categories. The thing is, I actually like myself and I don’t feel shameful about the course I’ve taken. Regrets? Yes, of course I have some. Have I made missteps? Certainly. But not out of malice, out of lack of information, insight, and wisdom. I deeply miss the people I have lost, but I can learn to be, to become, outside of them, outside their stories and expectations, and that’s ok, too. Perhaps some day they will have grown in their own stories enough and there will be enough space to hold all of who we have become in some new kind of family. Or maybe that won’t happen in this version of the story. I have to learn to accept what comes with an open heart.</p>
<p>Before he left this Earth, my father navigated Alzheimer’s for about six years with numerous falls, escapades, ditched cars, eating light bulbs, jumping back yard fences, and taking apart cable boxes at his nursing home. As I wade into a broader understanding of consciousness, I open up space in my heart for what was really happening with my dad and his glitching interface with what we understand as reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of my research this past year I found a very interesting memoir written by Elmer Green of the former Menninger Clinic in Topeka, KS where my dad grew up. It’s called “The Ozawkie Book of the Dead: Alzhiemers Isn’t What We Think It Is” (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ozawkie-Book-of-the-Dead-Elmer-Green.pdf">PDF</a>) and it is the story of how he cared for his wife Alyce, his research partner in biofeedback, during her journey through that illness. It involves the nature of the soul and interpenetrating realms and the process of learning and unlearning how to be in this space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I’m going to read it again, because as terribly traumatic as it was to see my strong, capable father engage with the world in ways that were so extreme and problematic and inscrutable, having a year’s perspective and new awareness of proto-consciousness and the unified field and emergent complexity, I can sit with the hard parts of the process and realize that maybe what my father’s struggles were doing was giving me a window to look through for the answers I seek.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was under the weather for about a week. It started with a vicious migraine and then some shooting nerve pain and gradually resolved into a typical cold. Let me tell you, it’s not fun to be feverish in Arkansas in August. Most of the month the daytime highs have lingered in the upper 90s. By the end of the week I was regrouping, less foggy headed, and I decided to take a hike to Balanced Rock and make a heart to honor Jerry Hawver’s life. The trail is on the other side of town. It’s only a three-mile walk, and the idea of balance seemed appropriate. A friend had sent a delightful care package with a hummingbird card and dried herbs from her garden in Arizona. I clipped the hummingbird and took out a selection of peppers to place in my wicker basket along with a heart trimmed from the collar of one of his shirts. It still smells of his aftershave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I drove past the bath houses downtown then parked my Subaru on the gravel pull out along Cedar Glades Road, quickly crossed the blind curve, and started the climb. The online reviews said that the first half mile took some effort. It was steep, sure, but the challenge was walking on loose scree. For years I never gave much thought to being particularly careful while I was out and about, because there were always at least two of us. Now, it’s just me. So I have to be watchful about taking a misstep and turning an ankle. I took things slowly and on my way up I picked up a chunk of Novaculite that seemed to have been worked into a hand sized cutting tool or scraper. Idly I ran my fingers over it as I pressed on through the dry, dusty woods.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where it leveled out, I paused for a moment and a wild red and black bug caught my eye. When I looked it up later, it turned out to be a velvet ant, a parasitic wasp species where the females are wingless. A minute later, I saw her partner flying down the trail. Fortunately I had the good sense to keep my distance, as I later found out their sting is many times worse than a hornet’s and they are commonly called “cow killers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>An interesting synchronicity is that in one of my early blog posts I warned about hybrid “personalized” learning being like a cicada killer. A cicada killer is a large wasp that frequented the garden where I worked. Its reproductive cycle involved capturing their chosen prey on the wing, paralyzing it, dragging it into an underground burrow, and then laying eggs on the body where the larvae would eat their way out. It was rather grotesque imagery, but it served to make a point. Well, turnabout is fair play, and evidently these velvet ants parasitize the pupae of cicada killers. Hmm.</p>
<p>Despite the dryness you could still find a few ferns, and where the side trail to Balanced Rock branched off there were some wild plums dropping onto the path. I gathered a few things en route to supplement what I’d been gifted and brought from home. Not long after I arrived at the outcropping – more loose scree, more careful steps. I managed to get far enough down the slope to fully appreciate the balance embodied by these two impressive boulders.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course right as I got there, a couple arrived panting, and so we gave each other space. I pulled over to a little overlook in the shade and pulled out my basket of offerings. The arrangement of items in this particular heart is both loose and disordered while being vibrant and tactile. There are cracked nuts full of labyrinths, fractal turkey tail fungus, the first fall leaf offerings, and peppery spice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that would suit my dad just fine. By the end everything was coming apart, which is a difficult thing for Hawvers. Have I said before that Hawvers like to be in control and have a plan? Well, we do. And the last years of Jerry’s life were anything but that. At the time there was a heaviness about it, this uncontrollable fraying and sense of loss that would not be diverted, but a year later, perhaps I can reimagine it as a cocoon tearing apart the restricting expectations my dad must have felt to be a provider and a fixer and the rock for all of those years. To transition to a new form meant things were going to fall apart. How else is renewal possible?&nbsp; In the looseness of MIA control systems there is the unrealized potential of a new blueprint and within the chaos, a kernel of what’s next.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I sat on that bit of bluff, and thanked my dad for all the things he provided for us. I can feel him giving me a big bear hug and me offering in return a big back scratch. I told him that I missed him deeply and thought of him every day. I also said that I knew he had been walking beside me, but that I was going to be ok, that if he felt held back in any way by me, he could go. I can just picture him high-fiving people all over heaven. I prayed that the creator would help me have the clarity to see the signs and find my purpose as I unfold into this new life. Then I packed up and headed back down the trail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The walk back was uneventful with one exception. Near the far end I paused before an unusual artifact, a rusted out wash basin hanging from a knot in a tree at eye level, almost where a shaving mirror would be. It had been galvanized, but the rust had gotten to it and the entire bottom was eroded away. I lifted it off the knot to examine it more closely. It wasn’t large, a bit wider than a typical dinner plate and about four inches deep with a narrow rim punctured in one spot where you could hang it from a nail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it wasn’t a totally bizarre addition to the landscape. You might find something like that tossed in a ravine out behind an old farmhouse. But there was no other debris around, no trash. I found it right along a trail on land that had been a national park for almost a century. It wasn’t tucked away in the brush; it was right in front of my face. It wasn’t a plastic bottle or even a face mask carelessly tossed trail side. No, this was a message for me, this wash basin, that if it weren’t for the rusted out bottom, would be right at home as part of a Cracker Barrel wall display.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ok, so I had asked for the wisdom to notice the signs, but then what was I to make of this out-of-place, out-of-time basin? One story you might tell is one of obsolescence. When my life first fell apart during the lockdowns, that was the story I initially jumped into.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who am I now that I am no longer my child’s mother, my husband’s wife, my mother’s accomplished daughter? I was a basin whose design was to hold things for others. Basins don’t function alone, they contain things. For decades my identity had contained many things, big and small. From carpool schedules and family vacation plans, to dinner menus and school registration procedures, civic campaigns, etc. etc. My existence was to be a helpful presence. Then somehow I picked up some rust. Perhaps at that school report card meeting in the summer of 2013. Rust wore away at the old functionality of the basin. Interestingly rust interferes with magnetism in metal. So as the basin’s rust surface area increased, it became less polarized. I imagine that might represent a shift towards non-dualism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was I meant to believe I was a failed basin? No, of course not. Because I believe in a benevolent creator that is loving and wants what is best for us. So the story I am choosing to tell myself about the basin is one that Alison Hawver might have imagined in third grade in Mrs. Nevius’s cardboard geodesic dome reading nook sitting on a carpet square. I am going to imagine that like the ugly duckling becoming a graceful swan, I have been a capable and trustworthy basin for many years, but slowly grew into a magical portal of imaginative potential, which given the state of the world right now, is a pretty awesome skill to have on offer. The twenty-first century needs some wiggle room for new possibilities to emerge, some fluidity to flex the boundaries of spacetime.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve traded in the closed, hygienic system of wash basin culture for the jagged, unexpected potential of a back-to-nature, quantum vacuum, anti-mirror portal into proto-consciousness where we can dip in for messages from worlds with a better view than ours. A portal like the cottage hedge in the book “To Nowhere and Back” or the star watching rock from L’Engle’s Time Quintet that I read from at my father’s death bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, I’ve written all day, and the heat has finally broken with a gentle rain and a cool breeze here on the crystalline flank of Spa City. I hope you haven’t found this too self-indulgent or maudlin. There are lots of big feelings to navigate these days for all of us, and sometimes it’s useful to remember back to the times when all we had to do was make petal potions with our backyard buddies. If you quantum foam some interesting artifacts into your life, I’d love to hear about them and the story goes with that. Thanks for hanging out with me on this Labor Day weekend 2024. A toast to Jerry Hawver. I wouldn’t be who I am without him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear readers,</p>
<p>For those who are still following along, you’ve probably noticed it’s been quiet on the blog this summer. I did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzuHqD1l9XY">a short update on my channel</a> a few weeks ago letting folks know I found a cozy home, a 1970s two-bedroom brick rancher on about a quarter acre on the outskirts of Hot Springs, AR. It is a sturdy little house with a sunny yard and quiet neighbors, mostly retirees who are kind about looking out for you without intruding and generously extend weekly invitations (in season) to share enormous slabs of delicious ice cold water melon. It’s nothing fancy, but it after a month I can say it suits me perfectly and I am grateful for the blessings of having a safe place to embark on this next phase of life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My snail mail address is 123 Marigold Circle Hot Springs, AR 71913. I’ve already received a few letters and care packages, which are much appreciated. I’m loving the slower pace of things in my chosen exile. Maybe I can have a go setting up some old school pen pal correspondences if you care to drop me a line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marigold Circle is a loop at the end of Hobson Road that is tucked into the base of one of the ridges underlaid by that famous quartz crystal that comprise Hot Springs National Park, the oldest federally protected land in the country (1830s compliments of Andrew Jackson). This development of about thirty homes, locally known as “Little Chicago” is situated where West Mountain begins to transition into Music Mountain. For years Hot Springs was known as a mobsters’ hang out, some with Chicago ties. Oh, and the circle is a square (not a cul-de-sac), and I’m in the middle of the doughnut (aka the quantum vacuum, wink, wink).</p>
<p>I’m loving the breathing room provided by the small open lawn around my house that gives me space to take in the blue Arkansas skies, often punctuated by dramatic towering clouds. There is considerably less geoengineering here than in Philadelphia. It does happen, but much less. The forest that embraces our little development is a mix of pine and hardwoods, so I should have nice vistas at all times of the year. It’s not an off-the-grid, bug-out place; but it is quiet, there are good people here, and lots of places to hike and get out on the water. I bought an inflatable stand up paddle board that can convert into a basic kayak, which will be easier for me to transport. Now that I’ve got my life vest, I’m going to head out AFTER the Labor Day boating hoopla and soak up a bit of the calm of the shoreline of Lake Ouachita and the 1.8 million acres of national forest surrounding it. Water is the theme of the year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My yard doesn’t have trees, but my neighbors do – a sweetgum and sycamore on the south, a maple to the north. It’s been a very hot month with daytime temps rarely getting out of the upper nineties and almost no rain. The poor gum tree, in particular, seems quite stressed. Having lived in a row house for the past thirty years, I didn’t own a rake, just a broom for the front walk, so I grabbed a solid wooden-handled Craftsman at Lowe’s this week. Even though I got a blower with my lawn mower purchase, I do hate the sound of them. For me Hot Springs is a great chance to slow down and get back to the basics. I slowly filled half a contractor bag with leaves yesterday and look forward to getting a better composting situation set up soon.</p>
<p>There’s a towering “axis mundi” oak across the street. It has been trimmed back by the power company, so it appears almost split in half, its&nbsp; impressive fractal branching pattern is on full display, which is right in line with my recent musings on complexity and fractals. This particular specimen is over sixty-feet high. Given the severe weather you can get here, I recently took out a measuring tape to see how much distance there was between its base and my eaves. Hopefully, if it ever falls, only the top ten feet will hit my house, enough to mess things up, but not totally destroy the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The one poor choice I’ve made so far (that I know of) is that I initially bought a terribly cheap, uncomfortable twin mattress. I don’t have sleep issues or chronic pain and don’t consider myself a mattress snob. Our old queen mattress that we had for over twenty years&nbsp; held up like a champ. It was just a basic Serta or something, but of course they don’t make them like they used to. I ended up buying a replacement with natural materials that should be arriving next week. I’ll put the old one in a mattress bag in the basement for tornado season. It’s the perfect use for a sad excuse of a sleeping surface, perhaps one day padded protection from falling timbers. If that badly-pruned oak ends up taking a nosedive through my living room, it could end up being the hero of my story.</p>
<p>My house is on a slightly fall-away lot, which is why I have a basement. Happily, it is still level enough to garden once I get a&nbsp; fence and raised beds set up to deter the many deer and bunnies. All the houses are modest one-stories, and so my little back sun porch has the feeling of a tree house. The neighbors feed the birds (and the deer). Most days I feel I’m simply a visitor in their avian kingdom. Marigold Circle is an ideal woodland edge habitat. There is a raucous group of jays, daredevil mocking birds and thrashers, lots of flickers, turtle doves, cardinals, house finches, and Carolina wrens. Some evenings or early mornings I get lucky to catch a glimpse of a hummingbird probing the magenta trumpets of the Four O’Clocks in my front dooryard. There are lots of dragonflies and butterflies and wasps, too. The wasps pollinate the big turkey fig out back that has been offering me a handful of sweet fruits every morning since I moved in.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I mentioned in my video that I’m weighing the extent to which it makes sense for me to continue to share my research moving forward. I’ve pretty much unplugged. I’m not on social media outside of the interactions I have on my channel and blog. I don’t have a television or radio. I have a portable “suitcase” record player and am gradually collecting bluegrass and folk on vinyl. I don’t check the news online. What information filters in comes to me through my small circle of friends. I’m less interested in blogging as a contact / “gotcha” sport, as tempting as that is with all the things we’ve been talking about now rolling out including Crypto Bobby, Trump’s new sidekick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might think that is irresponsible of me to check out, but I have come to the realization that I am not going to change the world through social activism or civic engagement. Trying to convince people to pay attention to the story I have attempted to surface doesn’t work. The learning curve is too steep and the feed does not operate in my favor. That said, maybe there is another way to tweak the seemingly chaotic but perhaps not entirely complex labyrinth of what we understand to be reality. Maybe it is my task for now to try and put my intuition and intellect into puzzling out some cheat codes and rather than throwing a wrench in the gears to stop the progress of so many problematic programs, learn to play living systems instrumentally with heart by adjusting initial conditions and tuning constraints. It may be a fool’s errand, but for now I turn inward – not giving up, but handing over control to the field of imaginative possibility as I try and train my eyes to see the clues and piece them together. Being quiet and reading and sewing for the time being is enough. I have put in my time trying to be loud. In the end it was unsatisfying, and even destructive to my wellbeing.</p>
<p>The idea of responding to breaking developments isn’t satisfying. Neither is critiquing personalities or asserting the superiority of my lens. Mostly, I want to continue to follow the intellectual meanderings that feed my soul. Neal Stephenson’s novel, “Anathem” revolves around a society of monastic thinkers who remove themselves from the world, so they can focus on weightier contemplations. I can see the logic in that. Stepping outside the noise has brought me a measure of peace and calm. Walking around barefoot, something I couldn’t do in Philadelphia, has felt great and is very grounding, too!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The physics of digital information is different. I think it comes so fast and furious and disconnected from our actual lived experience that it overwhelms our sense-making instincts both individually and collectively and ends up leaving us anxious and adrift. I feel like I know enough for the moment about the basics of web3, the mechanics of social impact policy and digital governance, and the Internet of Bio-Nanothings. Now I want to better understand the realm that we are in. Not in an esoteric, occult way that appeals to many; more like a Claude Shannon, information theory way. I think energy flow and information is the key to traversing the choice architecture of inner space. The more I discover, the less certain I am about anything. I do think there is merit in putting my thoughts down in writing with a date and time attached, even though I’m less and less invested in the concept of linear time. That said, the postings here will probably continue to be sparse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The topics I currently find to be most compelling are quantum biology, proto-consciousness, complex non-linear dynamical systems, morphic fields, parallel processing, distributed collective intelligence, the observer effect, narrative structures, spatial computing, responsive environments, digital artifacts and deep learning. I am dipping into a lot of information flows along with friends and I’m not exactly sure what to say about my thought process yet. In addition to Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle and Chris Fields’ Active Inference work, I am also very interested in the ideas of the late Jungian psychiatrist, dream analyst, and quantum consciousness theorist Gordon Globus. I am wrapping up his 2009 work “The Postmodern Mind” now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have a lot of ideas about non-traditional “computing” interfaces and humans-in-the-loop that have less to do with nanotechnology than with Qi, psi and plasma and etheric realms. As the head of standards for IEEE once said – it’s really all metaphysics!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minimizing surprise and making solid predictions is an evolutionary imperative, according to Karl Friston’s free energy principle. We hold a model of how the world works in our heads, so that we can use it to make good choices navigating uncertainty. Many of those choices are fluid and socially normed. Some people are more comfortable changing their model than others. Some people deal with surprise by looking away. Then there are the odd balls like me who keep hoovering up information and trying to find patterns in it so that we can conjecture about stories that could make the whole messy pile hold together for a time at least, because there are always more surprises awaiting us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It seems in my case, I became too much of a surprise for my beloved family, and the perceived cost of changing their models to accommodate my admittedly fringe world view was too high. I can’t say they were wrong. I will simply say I didn’t realize with each small step, new nugget of information, and adjustment that I was being removed from their world model. I simply did not appreciate how profound the cost would ultimately be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still working to make sense of what happened to me in a way that is non-judgemental and centers compassion for all involved. I do believe understanding the power of the heart field is vital to navigating the turbulence of the world – not just in a sweet, saccharine sort of way but in a quantum processing sort of way that connects us straight to the divine nature of the cosmos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another blog post I plan to work on tomorrow in honor of the year anniversary of my father’s passing. I’ve been under the weather for about a week, but it seemed to be resolving so a few days ago I took a short out and back hike to Balanced Rock on the other side of downtown. On the return leg I encountered an unusual artifact, which felt like it had some symbolic significance. My next writing will be a reflection on that.</p>
<p>I’ll close with an entertaining and informative talk my friend Sean posted this week about artifacts inspired by a discussion I’d posted with Lynn on Open Education Resources. Sean’s talk features a read aloud from a Mrs. Frizzle and the Magic School Bus book sponsored by the Department of Energy. It’s a good format, be sure to check it out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Alison McDowell</p>
<p>123 Marigold Circle</p>
<p>Hot Springs, AR 71913</p>
<p>PS: I just learned that marigolds go by the Latin name Tagetes erecta, which comes from Tages the Etruscan deity of divination. West is the direction of the underworld in Greek mythology, though I continue to imagine these other realms as being more about signals and information, which means it’s interesting that the ridge above me is West Mountain and Music Mountain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just did a massive spring cleaning of one of my servers, trying to clean up what has become quite the mess of clutter. For every website on the server, I either:</p>
 
   Documented what it is, who is using it, and what version of language and framework it uses 
   Archived it as static HTML flat files 
   Moved the source code from GitHub to a private git server 
   Deleted the files 
 
<p>It feels good to get rid of old code, and to turn previously dynamic sites (with all of the risk they come with) into plain HTML.</p>
<p>This is also making me seriously reconsider the value of spinning up any new projects. Several of these are now 10 years old, still churning along fine, but difficult to do any maintenance on because of versions and dependencies. For example:</p>
 
   <a href="https://indieauth.com">indieauth.com</a> - this has been on the chopping block for years, but I haven't managed to build a replacement yet, and is still used by a lot of people 
   <a href="https://webmention.io">webmention.io</a> - this is a pretty popular service, and I don't want to shut it down, but there's a lot of problems with how it's currently built and no easy way to make changes 
   <a href="https://switchboard.p3k.io">switchboard.p3k.io</a> - this is a public WebSub (PubSubHubbub) hub, like Superfeedr, and has weirdly gained a lot of popularity in the podcast feed space in the last few years 
 
<p>One that I'm particularly happy with, despite it being an ugly pile of PHP, is <a href="https://oauth.net">oauth.net</a>. I inherited this site in 2012, and it hasn't needed any framework upgrades since it's just using PHP templates. My ham radio website <a href="https://w7apk.com/">w7apk.com</a>&nbsp;is similarly a small amount of templated PHP, and it is low stress to maintain, and actually fun to quickly jot some notes down when I want. I like not having to go through the whole ceremony of setting up a dev environment, installing dependencies, upgrading things to the latest version, checking for backwards incompatible changes, git commit, deploy, etc. I can just sftp some changes up to the server and they're live.</p>
<p>Some questions for myself for the future, before starting a new project:</p>
 
   Could this actually just be a tag page on my website, like <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/tag/100daysofmusic">#100DaysOfMusic</a> or <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/tag/biketheeclipse">#BikeTheEclipse</a>? 
   If it really needs to be a new project, then: 
   Can I create it in PHP without using any frameworks or libraries? Plain PHP ages far better than pulling in any dependencies which inevitably stop working with a version 2-3 EOL cycles back, so every library brought in means signing up for annual maintenance of the whole project. Frameworks can save time in the short term, but have a huge cost in the long term. 
   Is it possible to avoid using a database? Databases aren't inherently bad, but using one does make the project slightly more fragile, since it requires plans for migrations and backups, and&nbsp; 
   If a database is required, is it possible to create it in a way that does not result in ever-growing storage needs? 
   Is this going to store data or be a service that other people are going to use? If so, plan on a registration form so that I have a way to contact people eventually when I need to change it or shut it down. 
   If I've got this far with the questions, am I really ready to commit to supporting this code base for the next 10 years? 
 
<p>One project I've been committed to maintaining and doing regular (ok fine, "semi-regular") updates for is <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/Meetable">Meetable</a>, the open source events website that I run on a few domains:</p>
 
   <a href="https://events.indieweb.org">events.indieweb.org</a> 
   <a href="https://events.oauth.net">events.oauth.net</a> 
   <a href="https://events.scim.cloud">events.scim.cloud</a> 
 
<p>I started this project in October 2019, excited for all the IndieWebCamps we were going to run in 2020. Somehow that is already 5 years ago now. Well that didn't exactly pan out, but I did quickly pivot it to add a bunch of features that are helpful for virtual events, so it worked out ok in the end. We've continued to use it for posting IndieWeb events, and I also run an instance for two IETF working groups. I'd love to see more instances pop up, I've only encountered one or two other ones in the wild. I even spent a significant amount of time on the onboarding flow so that it's relatively easy to install and configure. I even added passkeys for the admin login so you don't need any external dependencies on auth providers. It's a cool project if I may say so myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is not a particularly well thought out blog post, I just wanted to get my thoughts down after spending all day combing through the filesystem of my web server and uncovering a lot of ancient history.</p>

<p>Programming note: instead of our usual <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">The Pulse</a> on Thursday, today we peek inside a book that I wrote the foreword for. Our regular schedule — and The Pulse — returns next week.</p><p>Addy Osmani is a software engineer and engineering leader. He’s worked at Google for 12 years, and is currently the Head of Chrome Developer Experience. Addy regularly shares insights on software engineering and engineering leadership, and is the <a href="https://addyosmani.com/">author of several software engineering books</a>. He also writes the newsletter  .</p><p>When I was visiting the Bay Area, we met up with Addy, who gave a tour of the Chrome offices:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ef25867-478c-4a9b-ba71-72c5118546b2_1200x1600.png">    </a>With Addy, in the Google Chrome team’s lobby, in Mountain View <p>As we talked, he shared how he’s been working on a book about engineering leadership – collecting a decade of lessons learned in motivating and leading engineering teams. The lessons span Addy’s earlier days – when he was a software engineer, and was mentoring fellow devs – through working as a tech lead manager (a specialist role present in larger tech companies like Google) – all the way to leading larger engineering teams. I was intrigued, and asked for an early look. In the end, not only did I read the book ahead of release, but I found it such a neat mix of “theory” and “practice” that I volunteered to write the foreword.</p><p>The book is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/">now out</a>, and I asked Addy if he’d be open to sharing two relevant parts with all newsletter readers. Addy said yes, and so in this issue we take a look inside the book, covering:</p>  <p>Context on the book. Why write this book, how long it took, and Addy’s favorite part of it.</p>  <p>What Makes a Software Engineering Team Effective? No company invested more research in this area than Google. A brief summary of Project Aristotle and Project Oxygen, and a collection of other useful team dynamics research.</p>  <p>Leadership roles: tech lead, engineering manager, and tech lead manager. A look at how these three roles overlap, and also differ. The tech lead manager (TLM) is unique to Google, and a few similar companies, and is the most unusual of the three.</p>  <p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/">Get the full book</a></p><p>My usual disclaimer: as with all my recommendations, I was not paid to recommend this book, and none of the links are affiliate ones. See <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">my ethics statement</a> for more details.</p> 1. Context on the book <p>How did the idea for writing this book come around? This is what Addy told me:</p><blockquote><p>“The idea for the book started percolating a few years back. I'd been in the trenches of engineering leadership at Google, and I was seeing patterns – ICs, leaders and managers all cared about being effective, but there wasn't a well defined resource on this topic. I would email folks guidance whenever they would ask, but there was a real disconnect between the academic world of management and the gritty reality of leading high-performing engineering teams.&nbsp;</p><p>People were hungry for practical guidance, not just theoretical frameworks. That's when I realized there was a need for a book that could bridge that gap.&nbsp;</p><p>So I started working on my notes that would eventually turn into this book.”</p></blockquote><p>Writing a book takes a long time, and I was curious how much effort this one took. It was 1.5 years to write – plus the many years of experience to have something worthwhile to pen down. From Addy:</p><blockquote><p>“Writing the book was a longer haul than I expected. Writing a book is a bit like building a complex software system - it requires careful planning, execution, and constant iteration.&nbsp;</p><p>While the actual writing took about a year and a half, the foundation was years in the making. It was essential to blend my personal experiences with rigorous research. I wanted to ensure the book wasn't just a collection of anecdotes but a practical guide backed by data and insights. I think as a team (O'Reilly, our editors and tech reviewers as well) we were able to land on something in the end that we all felt proud of.”</p></blockquote><p>The book has seven chapters, and I was curious as to what Addy’s favorite part is, if there’s any. Addy said:</p><blockquote><p>“The 3 E's framework (enable, empower, expand) is undoubtedly the cornerstone of the book. It's something I've been refining over years of leading teams. I'm particularly proud of how it provides a practical approach to building high-performing engineering organizations.</p><p>What excites me most is how the model can be adapted to different team sizes and company cultures. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but a flexible framework that can guide leaders at various stages of their career. I'm eager to see how others apply it and share their experiences.”</p></blockquote><p>With this added context, let’s dive into two chapters of the book.</p><p>The below sections are from Leading Effective Engineering Teams, by Addy Osmani. Copyright © 2024 Addy Osmani. Published by O'Reilly Media, Inc. Used with permission.</p> 2. What Makes a Software Engineering Team Effective? <p>The below is from the beginning of Chapter 1 in the book.</p><p>Some teams seem to operate like well-oiled machines, churning out successes. Communication flows seamlessly, they meet deadlines with a smile, and they tackle challenges head-on. Conversely, other teams struggle to reach every milestone. Communication is chaotic, and meeting deadlines is a challenge. What makes the successful teams effective? It’s usually a mix of things: clear plans, honest talk, a healthy dose of trust, and a shared belief in what they’re doing. Some teams already have the rhythm and the steps down pat, while others are still figuring things out. But the good news is that everyone can learn the steps. Even the most stumbling crew can find its rhythm with a little practice.</p><p>This rhythm manifests itself in software engineering teams as their ability to produce useful products or product features by writing code, testing it, and releasing it to the world. Teams that do this regularly are said to be effective. So, to build great software, we must first build effective engineering teams.</p><p>Throughout my 25+ years of experience leading engineering teams at Google and other tech companies, I’ve seen firsthand how team dynamics can make or break a project. Building effective teams is not just about assembling the right technical skills; it’s about fostering a culture of collaboration, trust, and shared purpose. In this chapter, I’ll share some of the key lessons I’ve learned about what makes engineering teams successful, drawing on both research and my own experience in the trenches.</p><p>What makes an engineering team effective hinges on the key thing that distinguishes teams from groups. On the one hand, a group is a collection of individuals who coordinate their efforts. On the other hand, a team is a group that is bound by shared responsibilities and goals. Their members work together and share mutual accountability to solve problems and achieve common goals. When teams plan their work, review progress, or make decisions, they consider the skills and availability of all the members and not just those of one individual. This shared goal is what drives an effective team.</p><p>I have had the opportunity to observe or be a part of such teams at Google. These teams are passionate about achieving their goals. They find brainstorming sessions fun rather than stressful. Team members may write and test code on their respective machines, but they are collectively tuned in to a unified vision of what the code should achieve. There have been times when they had to resolve some difficult issues, but a culture of collaboration, innovation, and mutual respect helped to see them through such times.</p><p>Leaders are an important part of this picture. As a software engineering leader who wishes to make your team effective, you serve as an anchor that connects individual team members to the shared responsibilities and goals of the team. You provide the vision, direction, guidance, and environmental framework necessary to form this connection.</p><p>Although it’s possible to have a team without a leader, the team will go much further with the support of a good leader—and that’s where you come in!</p><p>Building an effective software engineering team takes work. Many factors can influence the success of a software engineering team, such as team composition, communication, leadership, and work processes. This chapter will explore what traits make teams effective and how to build them into your team. These traits will be things you can look for when hiring, but they’re also traits you can nurture in your existing team.</p> Research on What Makes Teams Effective <p>First, let’s examine what makes teams effective. To do so, let us look at some of the extensive research that has already been done on this topic.</p> Project Aristotle <p>Google conducted one of the best-known studies on effective software engineering teams, known as Project Aristotle. The project aimed to identify the factors that make some teams more successful than others. The study was based on the premise that the composition of a team was not the most critical factor in determining success but rather how team members interacted with each other.</p>   <p>Note: Before Project Aristotle, there was Project Oxygen, which looked into what traits make for a good manager. Some of the insights in this chapter were informed by the results of Project Oxygen, which I’ll talk about in detail in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/ch04.html#effective_management_behaviors_research_from_goog">Chapter 4</a>.</p>   <p>To determine what makes teams effective, the researchers first had to define what effectiveness means and how to measure it. They noticed that different roles had different perspectives on effectiveness. In general, whereas executives were interested in results such as sales numbers or product launches, team members thought that team culture was the key to team effectiveness. The team leaders indicated that ownership, vision, and goals were the most important measures.</p><p>Eventually, the researchers decided to study certain qualitative and quantitative factors that might impact team effectiveness, such as the following:</p>  <p>Team dynamics. Demographics, conflict resolution, goal setting, psychological safety</p>  <p>Personality traits. Extraversion, conscientiousness</p>  <p>Skill sets. Programming skills, client management</p>  <p>Researchers conducted interviews and reviewed existing survey data for 180 Google teams. They used this data to run 35 different statistical models and understand which of the many inputs collected impacted team effectiveness.</p><p>Project Aristotle identified five key dynamics that contribute to the success of software engineering teams (see Figure 1-1). These are listed next in the order of their importance:</p><p>Psychological safety</p><p>This was the most important factor identified by the researchers. It refers to the extent to which team members feel comfortable expressing their opinions and ideas without fear of retribution or criticism. Teams that have high levels of psychological safety tend to be more innovative and take more risks, which can lead to better outcomes. The researchers found that when teams feel safe, they:</p>  <p>Are less likely to leave the company</p>  <p>Are more likely to utilize the diverse ideas discussed by the team</p>  <p>Bring in more revenue and beat their sales targets</p>  <p>Tend to be rated highly on effectiveness by their leadership</p>  <p>Dependability</p><p>This refers to the extent to which team members can rely on each other to complete their work and meet deadlines. Teams in which individuals trust each other to be dependable are more likely to be efficient and effective in their work.</p><p>Structure and clarity</p><p>These are conditions under which team members clearly understand the project’s goals and their own individual roles and responsibilities. Team members who clearly understand what is expected of them tend to be more productive and focused.</p><p>Meaning</p><p>This refers to the extent to which team members feel that their work is meaningful and has a purpose. Teams with a strong sense of purpose tend to be more motivated and engaged.</p><p>Impact</p><p>This refers to how team members believe their work is making a difference and impacting the organization or society. Teams with a strong sense of impact are more committed to their work and the project’s success.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ddee60a-0941-43ef-be70-cdc48217d70b_1253x738.png">    </a>Figure 1-1. Google’s Project Aristotle: The five dynamics of effective teams <p>While Project Aristotle’s research was conducted within Google, the identified factors influencing team effectiveness could hold some relevance for teams in other contexts. By focusing on these five factors, software engineering teams can create an environment conducive to collaboration, innovation, and success. As I’ll discuss in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/ch04.html#effective_management_behaviors_research_from_goog">Chapter 4</a>, a good manager can foster these dynamics in their teams.</p><p>The researchers also discovered that variables such as team composition (size and colocation) or individual attributes (extroverted nature, seniority, tenure, etc.) did not contribute significantly to team effectiveness at Google. While these variables did not significantly impact team effectiveness measurements at Google, that doesn’t mean they’re unimportant, as indicated in the following section.</p> Other Research <p>While Project Aristotle is perhaps the best-known study on effective software engineering teams, many other studies have explored factors such as team composition, communication, leadership, and work processes. Here are a few key findings from some of these studies:</p><p>Smaller teams are better.</p><p>Although Project Aristotle did not recognize team size as relevant to team effectiveness, other <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/05/why-teams-dont-work#:~:text=research%20showing%20that%20as%20a%20team%20gets%20bigger%2C">studies</a> have shown that smaller teams work better. As a team gets bigger, the number of links that need to be managed among members increases exponentially. Managing these multiple communication channels can be complicated. Many researchers have identified smaller teams containing less than 10 members as more likely to achieve success than larger teams.</p><p>Diversity can be beneficial.</p><p>It is sometimes suggested that team <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/HRMID-04-2021-0088/full/html#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20can%20also%20be%20negative%20impacts%20of%20diversity%20in%20terms%20of%20reduced%20social%20cohesion%2C%20poor%20communication%20and%20increased%20conflict.">diversity may lead to communication and coordination problems</a>. For example, a diverse team would usually consist of people from different family backgrounds. Those with young children are more likely to seek flexible work hours, leading to coordination challenges. However, others have found that diverse teams can be more innovative and effective. A study by <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/scottepage/wp-content/uploads/sites/344/2015/11/pnas.pdf">Lu Hong and Scott Page of the University of Michigan</a> found that groups of randomly selected (likely diverse) high-ability problem solvers can outperform groups comprising the best problem solvers. However, it’s important to note that diversity alone is not enough. Teams must also create an inclusive and respectful environment for all team members. For example, a team that is supportive of team members who need flexible work arrangements will be able to coordinate better than a team that is intolerant of members with such needs.</p><p>Clear communication is vital.</p><p>Effective communication is essential for effective teamwork. <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams#:~:text=communication%20indeed%20plays%20a%20critical%20role%20in%20building%20successful%20teams.">Studies</a> have found that teams that communicate frequently and openly are more successful than those that do not. The idea of psychological safety is a shared belief among team members that they can freely express their thoughts, ideas, concerns, or even mistakes without fear of negative consequences or judgment. Its importance is backed up by the research from Project Aristotle. Clear communication also provides the glue to connect team members and establish structure and clarity within the team.</p><p>Leadership matters.</p><p>The leadership of a software engineering team can have a significant impact on its success. Google’s Project Oxygen showed that although teams could function without a leader, there is still a need for managers. It identified the essential traits that make for good managers and effective teams. I will talk about these traits in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/ch04.html#effective_management_behaviors_research_from_goog">Chapter 4</a>, but for now, it’s necessary to understand that there is a strong correlation between effective leadership and positive team outcomes.</p><p>Agility enables adaptability.</p><p>Agility is the ability to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. In software engineering, this means being able to pivot when requirements change or when unexpected issues arise. Agile teams are quick to adapt and can work swiftly and efficiently while maintaining high quality. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/people%20and%20organizational%20performance/our%20insights/the%20impact%20of%20agility%20how%20to%20shape%20your%20organization%20to%20compete/svgz-agilitysurvey-ex1.svgz?cq=50&amp;amp;cpy=Center">study by McKinsey &amp; Company</a> found that organizations that underwent successful agile transformations reported a significant improvement in efficiency, speed, customer satisfaction, innovation, and employee engagement, all of which are essential to effectiveness.</p><p>Colocation powers innovation.</p><p>The debate over whether colocation or remote work is better for software team effectiveness is ongoing, with both approaches having their own advantages and disadvantages. Multiple studies conducted at <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/11/our-work-from-anywhere-future">Harvard</a>, <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/does-working-home-work-evidence-chinese-experiment">Stanford</a>, and others discuss the benefits of remote or hybrid work in terms of employee satisfaction and retention. However, other <a href="https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/keith.chen/papers/Final_NBER22.pdf">studies</a> have shown that face-to-face interactions at the workplace, both planned and serendipitous, trigger the flow of knowledge, sharing of values, and <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-does-remote-work-affect-innovation">exchange of ideas</a>, which contribute to innovation.</p><p>While there may be trivial differences in the findings, we can build a theoretical picture of an ideal effective team based on the research findings discussed in this section. See Figure 1-2. By enabling psychological safety, clarity of structure and communication, dependability, meaningful work, and agility, software engineering teams can create an environment conducive to collaboration, innovation, and success.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff13f1fe3-0459-472c-b783-da5f50ba5727_1100x309.png">    </a> <p>You can now build on this understanding of dynamics and factors that influence the effectiveness of teams. The next things to consider are how the working environment can affect teams and how motivation can prime your team for success. As you go through the next sections, notice how the factors that affect teams pop up in various contexts.</p> 3. Leadership Roles: TL, EM, TLM <p>The below is an excerpt from the middle of Chapter 7: Becoming an effective leader</p><p>Organizational structures in software engineering organizations differ widely depending on their culture and priorities. After a person has served as an engineer or senior engineer for a few years and gained the necessary expertise, there are typically two tracks open to them: technical or managerial. Each offers distinct leadership opportunities and requires individuals who can coach and guide their teams through challenges.</p><p>In this section, you will look at some typical roles across the industry and what they usually entail in terms of effective leadership. Note that these aren’t the only leadership roles in an organization.</p><p>Leadership roles in a team depend not only on the overall organizational structure but also on the size and complexity of the project. Larger teams could have one or many technical leads leading the development of different parts of a project. Additionally, such teams would have architects synchronize the efforts led by the technical leads and managers to plan and organize resources. You could also have a product manager who articulates what success looks like for a product and guides the team to make it a reality. Conversely, in small teams, these roles may be combined to have a manager with the technical expertise to lead the team.</p><p>Figure 7-2 shows how some of the different types of leadership roles may coexist in a software engineering team.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147b6a97-8a1a-43f3-9b19-b4c196707d1c_902x1528.png">    </a>Figure 7-2. Relationships between various leadership roles in a software engineering team <p>Let’s take a closer look at some of these leadership roles.</p> Technical Lead <p>A technical lead is a hands-on role where you provide technical guidance and direction to the engineering team. The designation itself may vary across organizations. It may be a formal title in some workplaces, while it exists more informally in others. In some organizations, the position may be identified as a “software architect,” while in others, it may be referred to by titles like “principal engineer” or “lead software engineer.”</p><p>Irrespective of the name, tech leads play a crucial role in architectural decisions, code reviews, and mentoring junior team members. Technical leads often bridge the gap between the development team and management, ensuring alignment between technical strategies and business goals. Some of the responsibilities of a technical lead include the following:</p><p>Guide technical design and architecture</p><p>Tech leads play a vital role in shaping the technical direction of the project by providing guidance on design and architecture. A tech lead must leverage their expertise to ensure that the chosen technical solutions align with the project’s goals and adhere to industry best practices.</p><p>Set coding standards and best practices</p><p>Tech leads should take the initiative to establish coding standards and best practices within the development team. The tech lead role involves defining and enforcing these guidelines to contribute to overall code quality, maintainability, and consistency.</p><p>Lead troubleshooting of complex bugs and issues</p><p>Someone in the tech lead role leads the investigation and resolution of intricate technical issues and bugs. Their deep understanding of the codebase empowers them to troubleshoot effectively, ensuring the stability and reliability of the software.</p><p>Make key technical decisions with engineering trade-offs</p><p>Tech leads are responsible for making critical technical decisions, carefully weighing engineering trade-offs to align with project objectives. They consider factors such as performance, scalability, and maintainability to ensure the overall success of the software.</p><p>Do hands-on coding alongside the team</p><p>Despite their leadership role, tech leads often find themselves actively engaging in hands-on coding alongside their team members. This approach helps them mentor other engineers while staying connected with the codebase.</p><p>Serve as a mentor for development skills</p><p>Tech leads also act as overall mentors, guiding team members to enhance their development skills. They lead by example to foster a culture of continuous learning and professional development within the team.</p><p>Ensure deliverables meet the quality bar</p><p>Tech leads are accountable for the quality of deliverables, ensuring that the software meets established standards and requirements. They conduct thorough reviews and quality assessments to guarantee that the end product aligns with the defined quality bar.</p><p>Depending on the size of the project, the scope of these responsibilities will vary—from overseeing a single development team to having cross-team responsibilities.</p> Engineering Manager <p>An engineering manager typically oversees a team of software engineers, ensuring the successful delivery of projects. They are responsible for project planning, resource allocation, team productivity, performance, and career development, including that of the tech lead. This role often involves a mix of managerial tasks, such as performance evaluations and career development, along with technical oversight. In some companies, engineering managers may also be referred to as “development managers” or “technical managers.” To recap, an engineering manager’s key responsibilities include the following:</p><p>People management</p><p>Engineering managers should gear up to develop their skills in hiring, talent development, coaching, and mentoring. Engineering managers actively engage in the recruitment process, nurture their team members’ potential, provide guidance, and foster a culture of continuous learning within their team.</p><p>Manage processes</p><p>Engineering managers orchestrate critical processes such as sprint planning, retrospectives, and regular one-on-ones. They should ensure these processes are not just executed but tailored to their team’s needs, promoting collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement. They need to check that processes are not sidestepped.</p><p>Align team with organizational priorities</p><p>Engineering managers must ensure that their team is aligned with the broader organizational priorities. This involves effectively communicating context, goals, and expectations to team members while also shielding them from unnecessary distractions. By serving as a bridge between the team and the larger organization, the engineering manager helps team members focus on their work and deliver value.</p><p>Unblock resources</p><p>Engineering managers must actively work on unblocking resources needed for execution. They liaise with other departments, manage dependencies, and ensure that their team has the necessary tools, resources, and support to deliver on their commitments.</p><p>Technical oversight</p><p>While the engineering manager may not have any hands-on coding time, they should maintain their technical acumen. They engage in architecture discussions, ensuring technical decisions align with best practices and organizational goals. This technical oversight helps them guide their team to find sound technical solutions.</p><p>Stakeholder interaction</p><p>Engineering managers should engage with stakeholders, including having direct interactions with customers. They must understand project requirements, ensure proper communication channels, and act as a conduit between their team and external stakeholders. Engineering managers ensure that the team receives clear requirements from stakeholders.</p><p>Strategic work prioritization</p><p>Engineering managers must strategically prioritize work aligned with their team and company’s vision. This involves balancing project commitments with essential operational work, addressing technical debt, performing and maintenance in line with the organization’s strategy.</p><p>As you take on an engineering manager role, remember that you must broaden your responsibilities to include comprehensive people management, process leadership, and strategic alignment with organizational goals in addition to technical oversight. Unblocking your programmers is also an essential but slightly underrated aspect of managerial responsibilities.</p><p>Joel Spolsky, the cofounder of Stack Overflow and creator of Trello, once said, “Your first priority as the manager of a software team is building the development abstraction layer.”1 He further explains that if a developer is directly exposed to infrastructure issues like access to the project repo on GitHub or overriding a firewall for necessary project work, then the abstraction has failed.</p> Tech Lead Manager (TLM) <p>Tech lead managers (TLMs) are rare in many organizations. In Google, small or nascent teams usually have a TLM who can oversee a group of engineers, guiding them in project execution and ensuring the team’s productivity. This role involves a mix of technical leadership, project management, and people management. You will need a solid technical background to take up this role and should be able to contribute to technical discussions easily. You should be involved in technical design and communicate relevant design decisions to other teams and stakeholders.</p><p>TLMs are responsible for setting priorities, resolving technical challenges, and fostering a collaborative team culture. This role offers the opportunity to do both technical execution and people leadership. But it also comes with the challenge of balancing the two areas while not shortchanging either one. To help with this, TLMs will usually have a smaller number of direct reports as compared to engineering managers. TLM responsibilities include the following:</p><p>Blending people management with hands-on technical leadership</p><p>TLMs must balance their responsibilities as people manager and technical leader. This involves not only overseeing the professional development of the team but also actively participating in the technical aspects of projects, setting an example for team members.</p><p>Coach and develop engineers on coding skills</p><p>From a people management perspective, part of the TLM’s responsibility is nurturing their team, coaching, providing constructive feedback, and guiding engineers to enhance their technical proficiency. TLMs must also ensure individual contributors are challenged in their work and are on track to reach their personal career goals.</p><p>Establish technical standards and architecture</p><p>TLMs are responsible for setting technical standards and architecture. This entails defining and maintaining coding practices, architectural principles, design, and code reviews.</p><p>Help unblock developers when they are stuck</p><p>TLMs play a crucial role in unblocking developers when they encounter challenges. This involves providing technical guidance, removing impediments, and keeping upper management appraised of the project’s progress and resource needs.</p><p>Focus on higher-priority technical work</p><p>Sometimes, TLMs may need to concentrate on higher-priority technical initiatives. This could even involve hands-on coding or debugging. TLMs may have to delegate specific people management tasks to balance the other demands of their role. This strategic delegation ensures that both aspects of their role receive adequate attention.</p><p>Advocate for the team while coordinating cross-functionally</p><p>As the advocate for their team, TLMs engage in cross-functional coordination. This includes representing their team’s interests, ensuring effective communication across departments, and fostering collaboration to achieve collective goals.</p><p>Make technical decisions weighing various constraints</p><p>TLMs are decision makers in technical matters, which involves considering multiple constraints. This includes assessing factors such as project timelines, resource availability, and technical debt to make informed decisions that align with both short-term goals and long-term sustainability.</p><p>Provide mentorship and guidance</p><p>TLMs play a crucial role in mentoring and guiding team members to enhance their technical skills and professional development. By dedicating time to mentorship, TLMs foster a culture of continuous learning and growth within the team.</p><p>As you can tell from the preceding list, having really strong technical aptitude is critical in a TLM role. A TLM often asks intelligent questions and pushes the team to find answers. TLMs communicate a lot with various people, some of whom are purely technical and others of whom are business oriented. TLMs will thus have to switch their communication style constantly. A sign of success as a TLM is effectively balancing all the responsibilities while finding some extra time to write some code occasionally.</p><p>While there may be other roles or other names used to refer to these roles among software organizations, I have tried to discuss the key responsibilities of a team leader or manager in an engineering team in this section. However, responsibilities don’t dictate your ability to perform them. How do you know you have what it takes to lead your teams effectively? Find out by assessing yourself on key leadership traits in the next section.</p> Parting thoughts <p>In the preface of the book, Addy outlined who he wrote this book for:</p><blockquote><p>“This book is for engineers wanting to move into leadership roles or engineering leaders who want evidence-based guidance to improve their effectiveness and that of their teams. It is a comprehensive guide to the strategies, frameworks, and best practices that I have found to be most effective in unlocking the full potential of engineering teams and driving transformative results. By sharing real-world examples, practical insights, and actionable advice, I aim to empower you with the tools and knowledge you need to become an exceptional engineering leader in your own right.</p><p>At the heart of this book lies a deep exploration of the key traits and behaviors that distinguish highly effective engineers and engineering leaders from their peers. These are the individuals who consistently deliver outstanding results, inspire their teams to reach new heights, and make a lasting impact on the projects and initiatives they lead. By understanding and embodying these characteristics, you, too, can set yourself apart and make a meaningful difference in your role.”</p></blockquote><p>It’s a great time to transition into engineering leadership roles: as there are more and more in-depth resources where engineering leaders like Addy share their hard-earned experience, and way of thinking. Additionally, this book offers a peek at how effective managers at Google operate, and philosophies that are likely to be more common at Google – like the importance of physiological safety, balancing complex interpersonal dynamics, and empowering team members to take ownership of their work.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed this deepdive into a more theoretical overview of what we know about effective engineering teams, and a look at how companies like Google think about the TL, EM and TLM roles.</p><p>To read on, <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/leading-effective-engineering/9781098148232/">you can get the book (or e-book.)</a></p><p>And for more reading do check out some of Addy’s other books – including the free e-book titles <a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/software-engineering-soft-parts/">Software Engineering: The Soft Parts</a>, and <a href="https://dx.addy.ie/">The Developer Experience Book</a>.

<p>NIST SP800-63-4の第2次公開草案（2pd）が1週間前に公開されました。本日（日本時間29日午前１時〜３時）に行われたワークショップは、計画された一連のワークショップの最初のものであり、最初の公開草案以降の最も重要な変更点のいくつかを概説しています。</p>



 Introduction and Housekeeping 



 
 ワークショップはNIST特別出版物800-63 改訂4第2次公開草案に関するワークショップは、セッションの録画、スライドの入手可能性、質問のためのQ&amp;A機能の使用など、事務連絡から始まりました。[00:00] 



 本日の議題は以下の通りです： 
 







 NIST特別出版物800-63-4の概要 



 
 このワークショップでは、デジタルアイデンティティガイドラインの第2次公開草案に焦点を当て、主要な変更点、パブリックコメント期間、コメントの提出方法について取り上げました。[02:00] 



 このガイドラインは、連邦政府全体のデジタルアイデンティティ管理に関する基本的な要件を定めており、基本巻とA巻、B巻、C巻の4巻で構成されています。[05:00] 
 



 変更の主要な動機 



 
 主な動機には、政府サービスへの公平なアクセスの改善、新たな脅威や技術への対応、過去の実装から得られた実世界の教訓の取り込みが含まれます。[07:00] 
 







 第1次公開草案における主要な変更点 



 
 変更点には、リスク管理の刷新、生体認証要件の更新、新しい本人確認プロセス、そしてプライバシー、使いやすさ、公平性に関する考慮事項が含まれていました。[09:00] 
 







 タイムラインとパブリックコメント期間 



 
 改訂プロセスのタイムラインが確認され、2022年12月の第1次公開草案の発行と2023年8月の第2次公開草案の発行が強調されました。第2次草案のパブリックコメント期間は45日間です。[12:00] 
 



 Base Volumeの主要な変更 







 
 コニー・ラサール氏は、ユーザー管理型ウォレットモデルの導入（第２章）、アイデンティティリスク管理プロセスにおけるサービス「定義」ステップの追加（第３章）、継続的な評価と改善のためのメトリクスの導入、例外事項が起きたときのリドレスメカニズムについて説明しました。[16:00]  



 特筆すべき点として、IdP（アイデンティティプロバイダー）の変形である利用者管理型ウォレットが導入され、「発行者」がCSP（資格情報サービスプロバイダー）として捉えられるようになりました。 
 







 
 更新されたデジタルアイデンティティのリスク管理プロセスには、オンラインサービスの定義、初期影響評価の実施、そして継続的なリスク評価に基づいたコントロールの調整が含まれています。[20:00] 
 







 
 継続的な評価と改善が強調されており、推奨されるパフォーマンス指標と、問題を公平に扱うための是正措置が提示されています。[25:00] 
 



 



 Volume A (Identity Proofing and Enrollment)の主要変更点 







 
 デイビッド・タマサク氏は、本人確認の役割と種類の更新、IAL 1（Identity Assurance Level 1）のリバランス、新しいアイデンティティ検証の経路、不正管理要件、および証拠の検証要件の更新について強調しました。[30:00] 
 







 
 本人確認の役割には、本人確認エージェント、信頼できる推薦者、プロセスアシスタント、申請者の参考人が含まれるようになりました。[32:00] 



  IAL 1のバランス調整は、申請者と資格情報サービスプロバイダーにとっての摩擦の低減と選択肢の増加に焦点を当てています。[35:00] 
 







 
 AAL 2における新しいアイデンティティ検証の経路には、生体認証を用いないオプションやデジタル証拠の検証が含まれています。[38:00] 
 







 
 新しい不正管理セクションには、資格情報サービスプロバイダーと依拠当事者に対する要件、必須の不正チェック、および不正の疑いがあるケースに関するコミュニケーションチャネルが含まれています。たとえば、死亡日の確認は必須になっています。[42:00] 
 







 
 更新された証拠検証要件には、文書認証システムのパフォーマンス指標や本人確認エージェントのトレーニングが含まれています。[45:00] 
 







 



 Volume B: Major Changes (Authenticators and Authentication) 







 
 アンディ・リーガンチッド氏は、段階的な改良、同期可能な認証器に関する新たな要件、および利用者管理のデジタルアカウントに関するガイドラインの明確化について説明しました。[50:00]  



 改訂されたアカウント回復セクションでは、アカウント回復プロセスの実装に関してより明確な経路とより高い柔軟性が提供されています。[55:00]  



 パスキーのような同期可能な認証器が現在対応されており、同期ファブリック（sync fabric）に関する追加要件が設けられています。[52:00] 
 







 
 デジタルウォレットを認証器として使用することが明確化され、保存された回復コードや信頼できる回復用連絡先など、新しいアカウント回復方法が導入されました。[57:00] 
 











 



 Volume C (Federation and Assertions)の主要な変更点 



 
 ライアン・ガルーゾ氏は、863 Cの更新された構造、Federation Assurance Level 3（連携保証レベル3）の修正、およびプロトコルベースの例の導入について説明しました。[01:00:00] 
 







 
 新しい構造には、核となる共通の連携要件と、汎用IDPフェデレーションおよびユーザー管理型ウォレットフェデレーションのための別個のセクションが含まれています。[01:02:00]  



 ウォレットモデルにおいて、ウォレットはIdPとしてモデルすることによって取り扱うことができるのでそのようにした（←コメントが受け入れられて嬉しい。） 



 伝統的なIDPとウォレットとの差として、マルチユーザーかシングルユーザーかで分けている。（←ここはちょっとどうかなと思う。時間の考えも入れたほうが良いのではないか。） 



 ３つめの変更点は、Bound Authenticators の導入。連携保証レベル3には、現在、鍵保持者（Holder of Key）のアサーションとバインドされた認証器が含まれています。[01:05:00] 
 







 
 プロトコルベースの例も追加した。OpenID ConnectやSAMLなどの連携プロトコルを実装するための高レベルな説明を提供しています。（←バックチャンネルを使わなくてもFAL2実現できるというコメントがQ&amp;Aにあった。実際、response type = id_token ではできるはず。iGove WG でFAL2プロファイルとか作るとよいのかもしれない。）[01:08:00] 
 







 



 パブリックコメント期間と次のステップ 



 
 パブリックコメント期間は10月7日に締め切られます。コメントはメールまたはExcelスプレッドシートを使用して提出できます。最終決定までの時間は、受け取ったコメントの量によって変わります。[01:15:00] 



 チームは一般からのフィードバックの重要性を強調し、レビュープロセスへの参加を奨励しました。[01:20:00] 



 特に以下の分野についてフィードバックを求めています： 
 







 
 これが最後のパブリックコンサルテーションとなり、新年に出版が予定されています。<br> 
 







 
 You can engage through the following channels: 
 







 Q&amp;Aセッション 



 
 文書の誤受入率、生体認証のパフォーマンス、パスキーの使用など、様々な質問に対応しました。[01:25:00] 



 チームは特定の要件について説明を行い、参加者からのさらなるコメントやフィードバックを奨励しました。[01:30:00] 
 



 閉会の辞 



 
 ワークショップは、コメントの提出と今後のワークショップへの参加を促す呼びかけで締めくくられました。チームは参加者の時間とフィードバックに感謝の意を表しました。[01:35:00]

Doesn't sound safe or convenient to me.</p><p>From <a href="https://x.com/paulgconlon/status/1828737190303875081">X</a><br>Referenced 2024-08-28T08:10:31-0400</p></blockquote><p>How Paul said this struck me because I've been thinking a lot about access control lately. I believe that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">we build identity systems to manage relationships</a>, but, as Paul points out, the ultimately utility of identity systems in many cases is access control.</p><p>This isn't, by itself, a bad thing. I'm glad that Google controls access to my GMail account so that only I can use it. But it doesn't stop there. If I use my Google account to log into other things, then Google ultimately controls my access to everything I've used it for. This is federation's original sin1.</p><p>Paul's comment points out the primary problem with how we build identity systems today: when access control is centralized, it inherently shifts power towards those who manage the system. This dynamic can lead to a situation where individuals must conform to the expectations or demands of those in control, just to maintain their access to essential services or resources. While we often accept this trade-off for convenience—like using Google to manage multiple logins—the broader implications are troubling.</p><p>The more we rely on federated identity systems, with their tendency to centralization, the more we risk ceding control over our digital lives, reducing our autonomy and increasing our dependence on entities whose goals may not align with our own. This is why the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2024/06/what_is_decentralized_identity.shtml">principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI) are so compelling</a>. SSI proposes a model where individuals maintain control over their own identity, reducing the risks associated with centralized access control and enhancing personal freedom in the digital realm.</p><p>Critics of SSI will claim that giving people control over their identity means we have to accept their self assertions. Nothing could be further from the truth. When someone wants me to prove I'm over 18, I use a driver's license. The state is asserting my age, not me. But I'm in control of who I show that to and where. Sovereignty is <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">about borders</a> and imposes a system of relationships.</p><p>Now, China could use SSI to build the social credit system. One credential, controlled by the state, that is used to access everything. SSI makes individual control structurally possible, but can’t guarantee it. Technology alone can't solve this problem. As a society, we have to want a digital world, modeled on the physical one, where individuals are the locus of control and use information and assertions from a variety of credentials to build and and interact in peer-to-peer relationships. Until we value freedom and independence in the digital world, we will yield up control of our digital lives to others who will act in their own interests, not ours.</p>    Notes   <p>For similar reasons, I think federated social media systems are a bad idea too, but that's another blog post.</p>  <p>Photo Credit: Papers Please from DALL-E (public domain).

<p>At <a href="https://devrev.ai/">DevRev</a>, we are building an API-first dev-centric platform that gives you one unified view of your customer and product by connecting your data, teams, and users to our AgentOS platform and app experiences. This blog post shares some insights on how we built routing at the edge in our multi-regional deployment.</p><p>The DevRev platform was initially deployed only in the US-East region. All data related to organizations (or tenants) and their customers (workspaces) was stored in the US-East region. This raised two concerns, primarily regarding data residency and latency, which forced us to launch our 1st region outside the US, in Mumbai (ap-south-1), in March 2024, and now we are in the process of expanding our presence into multiple other&nbsp;regions.</p><p>The DevRev platform is built with 250+ microservices running on Kubernetes. The entire multi-regional deployment was a massive collaborative effort between the infrastructure team and various engineering teams. We had to make many design decisions, brainstorm them, try them out, and then revisit and refine them. We’ll probably have multiple blog posts that delve deeper into such design decisions, and in this blog post, we narrow down the scope only for&nbsp;routing.</p><p>In general, building multi-regional routing involves designing a system that can efficiently route traffic across multiple geographic regions to optimize performance, reliability, and compliance with data residency requirements. For example, if performance is the primary concern, regardless of the user’s location, the requests from that user should be routed to the region with the lowest network latency relative to their location. However, this approach would require making business data available in multiple regions, which helps reduce latency but is not the primary goal of our multi-regional deployment. We are using Fastly as our CDN, and our approach to reducing latency is to cache the relevant business data at the corresponding Fastly PoPs closer to the&nbsp;user.</p><p>The primary goal of DevRev multi-regional deployment is data residency. Irrespective of the location of the user, the requests from that user should be routed to the home region. The home region is the region that hosts the organization that the user belongs to. A given organization is pinned to one region, which is a decision the user makes at the time they create&nbsp;it.</p><p>Before we delve deeper into the routing design, let’s take a quick look at the DevRev high-level architecture. As shown in the following diagram, all the requests initiated from DevRev API clients are intercepted at the edge, by the corresponding Fastly PoP. All the API requests are first validated by a Compute service deployed in Fastly, at the edge. This will reject any unauthenticated requests at the edge itself, so the backend DevRev services only need to worry about the authenticated traffic.</p><p>The second level of enforcement is at the DevRev API Gateway. All the traffic to the DevRev platform flows through the API Gateway, and it centrally enforces authentication with JWT verification. The third level of enforcement happens at the service itself. We have implemented the Service Mesh pattern with Istio; and each Envoy proxy, which sits with the service itself, in the same Kubernetes pod, verifies the JWT that comes with inbound&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>Multi-regional routing logic is built into the Compute service running on Fastly. This is the same service that does request validation (along with JWT verification) at the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>APIs can be invoked either by authenticated users or through anonymous requests. For instance, when you access the DevRev web app, certain static resources are loaded before the user is authenticated. Similarly, some generic feature flags, which are not user-specific and remain unchanged across sessions, are also fetched without requiring authentication. Another example is the API endpoint https://api.devrev.ai/dev-orgs.public-info.get?slug=your_slug. This endpoint allows the web app to retrieve organization metadata, which is essential for initiating the login&nbsp;flow.</p><p>Apart from the authenticated and anonymous requests, there is also another type of request that does not carry a JWT, but some sort of a hint to indicate the region it needs to be routed to. For example, the web socket upgrade call carries an ID in the query string that indicates the region it belongs to. In the same way, the dev-orgs.create API carries a region hint in an HTTP header. Apart from the query string and the HTTP request headers, we also found some APIs that carry the region hint in the request&nbsp;body.</p><p>In summary, the routing at the edge has to deal with three types of requests: the requests that carry a trusted JWT, the requests that carry a region hint in the query string, the request header or the body, and the requests that carry neither a region hint nor a&nbsp;JWT.</p><p>The following diagram shows what we built at a high level. At the edge (the Compute service) for the above three types of requests, we find the region and then dispatch the request to the corresponding backend. This happens at the Fastly PoP closer to the user, and the Fastly Compute service is aware of all the backends (or the regions) available to dispatch requests.</p><p>The Compute service running in Fastly is an edge gateway that intercepts all the requests. This is a module written in Rust, which compiles into a WebAssembly and then runs as a Compute service in&nbsp;Fastly.</p><p>In the Compute service code, we have a router that handles a given domain. For example, the api.devrev.ai domain has its own router, and the app.devrev.ai domain has its own. Each router defines what needs to be validated in the request path, and a given router is attached to one backend. For example, the router behind the api.devreva.ai domain is attached to the AWS global accelerator for us-east-1 and sets the hostname to api.devrev.ai.</p><p>However, this router architecture was not sufficient to support multi-regional routing at the edge. Now, we need to find the backend attached to a router in the runtime based on the request context. In other words, we need to resolve the backend based on the request context. To support this model, we introduced a new construct called, resolver. A resolver is registered against a path, and it knows how to find the corresponding region based on the request context. If there is no resolver, then the default resolver is used, which finds the corresponding region based on a claim in the JWT. The default resolver can only be used for authenticated requests. All the unauthenticated requests (if allowed), are routed to the default&nbsp;region.</p><p>Congratulations on making it this far! You might have noticed something is still missing. In the previous section, we discussed how authenticated requests, which include a JWT, are routed to the backend based on a claim within the token. But who is responsible for adding this claim to the JWT? Let’s unravel that&nbsp;mystery!</p><p>As shown in the first diagram, the DevRev web app uses a trusted identity provider, Auth0. Auth0 does not store any user credentials; it simply acts as an identity bus. When a user creates an organization in DevRev, we internally use the Auth0 API to create the corresponding Auth0 organization and update the metadata with the unique organization ID generated by DevRev. This unique organization ID includes the corresponding regional identifier.</p><p>When a user logs into their DevRev organization via Auth0 (after being federated through their own identity provider or a social identity provider), an action within Auth0 reads the corresponding organization ID and adds it to the token it generates. The Compute service at the edge then reads this claim, determines the corresponding region, and dispatches the request accordingly.</p><p>By implementing multi-regional routing at the edge, we make routing decisions as close to the user as possible, directly in the request path, and in a transparent manner. Neither the client nor the user needs to be aware of the different regions. Additionally, each region operates independently, with no need for awareness of other regions, making it seamless to spin up a new region without impacting the existing&nbsp;ones.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/how-we-built-multi-regional-routing-at-the-edge-devrev-42059ddb9225">How we built multi-regional routing at the edge @ DevRev</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Gergely with a subscriber-only issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>In the past two months, Anthropic has started to gain momentum among software engineers. The company <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">released its latest language model</a> – Claude 3.5 Sonnet – on 20 June, which works noticeably better than other large language models (LLM) for coding-related work – and gives better results than ChatGPT models, which is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146756242/claudes-new-model-wows-developers">wowing many developers</a>. We touched on this observation <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146756242/claudes-new-model-wows-developers">in The Pulse #101</a>: it’s the first time a company other than OpenAI potentially leads in LLM capability.</p><p>Anthropic also released a new feature, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">Artifacts</a>, alongside Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It allows the creation of things like websites (single page React or HTML), code snippets, documents, diagrams, and more, with a prompt. It’s helpful for a variety of tasks, and also fun. For example, I gave Claude this prompt:</p><blockquote><p>“Create a web application that allows me to tweak the color of The Pragmatic Engineer Logo. This logo is three rectangular bars that increase in height, and are in the color red.”</p></blockquote><p>The result was what I asked for: a mini-web application with an interactive color picker:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e46d80-a040-47d5-a13a-da7224f8f1be_1600x991.png">    </a>The output of the prompt. I could have a blue logo, if I wish! <a href="https://claude.site/artifacts/822ae2a1-2f1a-4ab9-a51a-c1cda52ebbdd">Play with it here</a>, or see <a href="https://claude.site/artifacts/1ff09904-40f1-4600-8af8-1f75ccec96f3">a remixed version</a>. Remixing means continuing with the Artifact, evolving it with further input <p>Other interesting examples include creating:</p>  <p><a href="https://x.com/NickADobos/status/1803814442582311077">A game</a> (e.g. “Pong”) with a prompt</p>  <p><a href="https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1805261958134055409">A multi-monitor layout designer</a> with a few minutes of giving instructions</p>  <p><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1810791731438465094https://x.com/emollick/status/1810791731438465094">A venture capital liquidation preference simulator</a> with instructions provided</p>  <p><a href="https://x.com/callum_codes/status/1828512362552304062">An image picker and color extractor</a></p>  <p>While the feature is small, it feels like it could a leap in using LLMs for collaborative work — as every Artifact can be shared, used by others, and “remixed”. Curious to learn how this product was built, I contacted the Anthropic team. Today, we look at the reality of building this feature, and we also get a sense of how Antrophic’s engineering team operates. We cover:</p>  <p>From the drawing board to shipping Artifacts. A scrappy prototype demonstrated on “WIP Wednesdays” kicked off what became Artifacts.</p>  <p>Tech stack. Streamlit, Node.js, React, Next, Tailwind, and Claude.</p>  <p>Using Claude to build Artifacts faster. The team not only dogfooded Claude, but used their LLM to build software faster, including Artifacts.</p>  <p>Timeline and team. A tiny team built and shipped this feature in just 3 months.</p>  <p>AI products and security. Security is part of everything Anthropic does. An explainer on how model security works, and the product security approach for Artifacts.</p>  <p>When is an idea a winner? Not even the engineers building this feature expected it to be as successful as it is.</p>  <p>GenAI paradigm shift? Artifacts is not a massive feature in itself, but it could pave the way for GenAI becoming a much more collaborative tool.</p>  <p>At the time of publishing, Artifacts is enabled by default for all Claude users on web and mobile. So you can <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/artifacts">try out</a> this feature, if you prefer.</p><p>This is an in-depth look into how a complex engineering project was built. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/t/real-world-engineering-challenges">Read other, similar, real-world engineering challenge deepdives</a>.</p> 1. From drawing board to shipping Artifacts <p>Let’s jump into how Artifacts was built. For this, I talked with five current Anthropic employees involved in its creation:</p>  <p>Research scientist, Alex Tamkin, who built and demoed the first prototype</p>  <p>Product designer, Michael Wang, who joined iteration efforts early</p>  <p>Product engineer, Florian Scholz, who helped productionize Artifacts</p>  <p>Security engineer, Ziyad Edher, who helped evaluate security for Artifacts</p>  <p>Brand, Sam McAllister, who created several launch materials for Artifacts</p>   Scratching the itch to move faster&nbsp; <p>In March 2024, research scientist Alex Tamkin was testing the website generation capabilities of Anthropic’s newest model, using these steps:</p>  <p>Prompt model to generate HTML code for a website</p>  <p>Copy generated code into an editor</p>  <p>Save file as an HTML</p>  <p>Open a web browser to view HTML file</p>  <p>The overhead wasn’t too bad from doing this once or twice. But Alex did it dozens of times, he recalled:</p><blockquote><p>“This whole round-trip process was taking a lot of time. I kept thinking:</p><p>‘What if I could just see it right away?’</p><p>You know that feeling when you're cooking and you want to taste the sauce straight away, not wait for it to simmer? That's what I was after. I just wanted it to render on the screen immediately.”</p></blockquote><p>So Alex put together a janky side-by-side interface, with Claude on the right and the realtime output on the left. He then showed this rough-around-the-edges demo to his team at a regular catchup session called “WIP Wednesday”:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabe82844-cbb4-41e6-a14d-a8185ee60447_1600x967.png">    </a>Alex’s demo for WIP Wednesdays <p>The demo was a turning point, he says:</p><blockquote><p>“I think this demo was when a lot of us realized: ‘oh wow, there's something here.’&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing it immediately on the screen, something sort of... clicks. You know how sometimes you don't realize you need something until you see it? That's what happened.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn't just about making the process faster. It was about changing how we interact with Claude, making it more tangible, more immediate, more collaborative.”</p></blockquote> First prototype <p>One demo participant was product designer Michael Wang, who then helped make the rough demo into a more production-ready experience. He says:</p><blockquote><p>“I just kept replaying this demo from Alex over and over again in my head. So I started building a prototype, mainly to see how much we could actually pull off with some basic prompt engineering and instructions for Claude. Turns out, quite a bit. I had a proof of concept working much faster than I expected. And it just got my mind racing. Eventually, I felt like I had a pretty solid idea, and I posted it to Slack.”</p></blockquote><p>Posting to internal Slack was a great idea, as it got the attention of many colleagues, including Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, who offered encouragement. After this, things moved quickly, says Michael:</p><blockquote><p>“In about a week and a half, we had it ready for internal dogfooding. The entire company could start using it. It was a bit surreal seeing something go from an idea to a tool that everyone was experimenting with in such a short time. But that's often how it goes when you're working with Claude – sometimes things just click, and you find yourself building something you didn't even know was possible a week ago.”</p></blockquote> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9338fc7-3068-4307-a1c2-d4593290defc_800x532.png">    </a>Michael demoing a polished version of the feature that became Artifacts <p>As a more polished version took shape, Michael shared the demo internally, gathering even more feedback and encouragement from colleagues:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81064303-f4ed-48ed-89a8-56bdb3f5c42c_1600x916.png">    </a>Michael sharing an update on Artifacts/Iteration Mode on the internal Anthropic Slack  New engineer helps ship Artifacts <p>Engineers at Anthropic have a lot of autonomy, and are expected to take advantage of it. Product engineer Florian Scholz was just getting started at the company, when he saw the demo and decided to help ship the new feature. He recalls:</p><blockquote><p>“Alex's first demo of Artifacts happened in my second week at Anthropic. I was still onboarding in the San Francisco office and adjusting to a very new environment, so I put it on the back burner at the time. Later, when Michael showed a working prototype, I jumped right in.&nbsp;</p><p>We all had a common realization that this feature was a step change. My immediate focus was on getting our infrastructure to a place where it was secure. We were concerned about preventing any issues that might arise from untrusted code generated by Claude. It was a pretty great introduction to the kind of fun challenges we face on product engineering at Anthropic.”</p></blockquote> Demoing Artifacts with an 8-bit game <p>With the product ready to ship in beta, there was one last thing to do: create launch materials to showcase Artifacts, and how people can use it. This is where Sam McAllister came in, who leads Brand communications for Claude. After seeing the first prototype of Artifacts, he realized this feature was a truly differentiating UI layer. He’d been using Artifacts as it was built, and put together a demo to showcase the feature: generating an 8-bit game featuring a crab called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHqk0ZGb6qo">“Claw’d:”</a></p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2cd2d91-c46b-4551-8190-7d29310dec64_1268x932.png">    </a>Screenshot of the “Claw’d” 2D, 8-bit style arcade game, generated by Artifacts. See how it was built in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHqk0ZGb6qo">this 1-minute video</a> <p>Anthropic recently shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUdNaAAc4FY">a video on how they built Artifacts</a>, which features interviews with research scientist Alex Tamkin and product designer Michael Wang.</p> 2. Tech stack  Prototyping phase <p>First version: When Alex built the early version of Artifacts – one that he showed to a few of his colleagues internally – he used <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>. This is a tool to turn Python data scripts into shareable web apps, quickly – to build a prototype for the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Using a dedicated prototyping framework to build a “visual proof of concept” turned out to be a helpful approach. It enabled quick feedback, and served as a reminder that the prototype was not (yet) production ready. Of course, not all prototypes become production features, and frameworks that allow research scientists to showcase their ideas are useful, as this case shows.</p><p>Second version: Node.js. After getting good feedback, Alex was ready to share the feature with the whole company to try out. For this stage, he decided to migrate the backend from Streamlit. He wanted to use a technology that would work better with more broader usage. Alex explains the reasoning:</p><blockquote><p>“I migrated the app to a Node.js setup and implemented a side-by-side layout for rendering, which I felt improved user experience.</p><p>We hold ‘WIP Wednesdays’ meetings at Anthropic, where we share our works in progress with the wider team. Sharing work at a WIP Wednesday like this was a really nice forcing function. I worked late the night before in the office, super focused and just jamming on the prompt and the overall interaction pattern. I paired with Michael too, and he helped me debug what ended up being a simple CORS issue that I was having trouble with. At this point, Claude 3 Opus couldn't actually fix the issue on its own.”</p></blockquote> Frontend <p>The technology used to build Artifact is a common-enough frontend stack used by many web teams:</p>  <p><a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>: frontend framework used to build the interface</p>  <p><a href="http://next.js">Next.js</a>: a React framework with performance and developer efficiency improvements that many React teams use</p>  <p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>: a utility-first CSS framework to design delightful user interfaces&nbsp;</p>  <p>Using sandboxing primitives was a notable difference from how most web apps are built. Artifacts needs to isolate untrusted code in the sandbox; the team calls this approach a “secure playground.” As product engineer Florian Scholz puts it:</p><blockquote><p>“This sandboxing approach gives us a clearly defined environment so we can deploy confidently. It's not a static sandbox, we're constantly pushing and expanding on its capabilities. Having this secure playground was instrumental in enabling us to ship so quickly.”</p></blockquote><p>But how exactly did Anthropic build its sandbox; does it use browser sandboxing primitives like <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/sandbox/README.md">the Chrome V8 sandbox</a>? Security engineer Ziyad Edher reveals details:</p><blockquote><p>“We're not using any actual "sandbox" primitive per se.&nbsp;</p><p>We use iFrame sandboxes with full-site process isolation. This approach has gotten robust over the years. This protects users' main Claude.ai browsing session from malicious artifacts. We also use strict Content Security Policies (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSPs</a>) to enforce limited and controlled network access.&nbsp;</p><p>These approaches protect user data from being exfiltrated through malicious artifacts. We're continuously working on hardening these environments as the browser ecosystem changes.”</p></blockquote> Backend <p>Evolution has reduced the need for a more traditional backend, at least for something like Artifacts. Michael says:</p><blockquote><p>“Our models have gotten so capable that a lot of what you'd normally build as backend logic, you can now just ask for! You give Claude the instructions, lay out the parameters, and get back exactly the structured data you need, formatted just the way you want.</p><p>A lot of people looking at Artifacts probably assume there's this incredibly complex backend system running the show.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is, a huge chunk of Artifacts is ‘just’ presentational UI. The heavy lifting is happening in the model itself. It's not that traditional backend work disappears entirely, but the balance shifts. I think we're just scratching the surface of what this approach can do. As these models continue to evolve, who knows?”</p></blockquote> 3. Using AI to build Artifacts faster <p>The team behind Artifacts leaned on Claude heavily to build Artifacts. Here’s how research scientist Alex Tamkin used Claude 3 Opus:</p><blockquote><p>“Claude 3 Opus was, at the time, our most intelligent model. The process was straightforward: I'd describe the UI I wanted for Claude, and it would generate the code. I'd copy this code over and render it. I’d then take a look at what I liked or didn't like, spot any bugs, and just keep repeating that process.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a really quick way to iterate on ideas!</p><p>When you can see something immediately on the screen, there's this moment where things just ‘click’. That's what I was aiming for with this approach – trying to get to those "a-ha!" moments faster.”</p></blockquote> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7e616f6-c2e6-4b4b-8c92-2c98a8a860a4_800x473.png">    </a>Screenshot of the multi-window iteration process to create a simple HTML5 web app with Claude 3 Opus, before Artifacts was ready <p>Florian Scholz, product engineer on the Artifact team, used Claude extensively, too. He says:</p><blockquote><p>“Claude proved particularly useful as I went digging into the depths of obscure browser APIs and capabilities. I was using it to figure out how to implement specific interaction patterns, like configuring content security policy options, iFrame interactions, and DOM selection APIs. I used it for lots of areas where documentation can be thin or pretty complicated.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the launch of Sonnet and Artifacts, I've been using them to jam on experimental versions of new features and get them up and running. Claude usually gives me a good starting point and I can then pair with Claude and iterate from there. I find these tools helpful to avoid the “blank page” problem.”</p></blockquote><p>Within Anthropic, Sonnet 3.5 was seen as a “game-changer,” and pushed the Artifacts team to be more ambitious. Product designer Michael Wang, shares:</p><blockquote><p>“I'm almost always using Claude in my development process. Claude has become such an integral part of my workflow that I'm honestly not sure what I'd do if I couldn't use it anymore. I use it to scaffold out my code, have ongoing conversations about implementation details, and transform code as needed.</p><p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet wasn't ready to test during the initial prototyping phases of Artifacts. So at the time, I was primarily using Claude 3 Opus.&nbsp;</p><p>When we got an early peek at 3.5 Sonnet, it was a game-changer. Internally, folks were demoing entire Three.js or WebGL apps created by Sonnet in one shot. That's when I knew we could be a lot more ambitious with what we were building. Sonnet had a huge impact on our feature set in the month leading up to the launch. It really pushed us to expand what we thought was even possible with Artifacts.”</p></blockquote> 4. Timeline and team <p>Artifacts is one of the most talked-about releases from Anthropic this year, in software engineering circles, anyway! I asked product design engineer Michael Wang about the team size and timeline, from an idea all the way to production. This is how it played out:</p><blockquote><p>“After Alex’s demo, I started working on the prototype on the main claude.ai repository on March 21 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>There was one person working on it full time, another part-time contributing on a regular basis.

<p></p>
<p>On the right is the high school yearbook picture of Allan John Ontko, one of my best friends during the three years we were classmates at what I half-jokingly call a Lutheran academic correctional institution—because that’s what it was for me. For most of the boys there, however, it was a seminary. Allan, then known to all as A.J. was one of the seminarians. He was also completely obsessed with pipe organ music and production.</p>
<p>When that picture was taken, in May 1965, A.J. was seventeen, a senior about to graduate, and building a pipe organ in his parents’ basement. The main parts of the organ were so large that a cinder-block wall needed to be removed so the thing could be extracted. It was also hand-built and tested, with thousands of drilled holes, thick webworks of wiring, and solder joints. All the pipes, stops, keyboards, and foot pedals were scavenged or bought used.&nbsp; I went with him on some of his trips around New Jersey and New York to obtain pipe organ parts. His determination to complete the project was absolute. Just as amazing was that he did this work on weekends, since ours was a boarding school in Westchester, New York, and his home was more than an hour’s drive away in New Jersey. His parents’ patience and moral support seemed infinite.</p>
<p>A.J. sold the organ to some church. That was the first step on his main path in life. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ontko+pipe+organ">Look up Ontko pipe organ</a> and you’ll find plenty of links to his work on the Web. One of his companies, Ontko &amp; Young, has<a href="https://pipeorgandatabase.org/instruments?builder=Ontko%20&amp;%20Young%20Co."> fifteen listed organs in the Pipe Organ Database</a>. His website, ontkopipeorgans.com, is partially preserved in the Internet Archive. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100201140837/http://www.ontkopipeorgans.com/index2.html">Here’s one snapshot</a>.</p>
<p>After high school, Allan (no longer A.J.) went to <a href="https://www.rider.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-arts-sciences/westminster-choir-college">Westminster Choir College</a>. In that time he continued building pipe organs, advancing his skills as an organist, and singing as well, I suppose. We both sang bass, though he could hold a tune while I could not. He had many amusing reports of his choir’s collaborations with the New York Philharmonic and did a brilliant impression of Leonard Bernstein’s conducting style. Allan could be very funny. I recall a list of fake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_stop">organ stops</a> that he and another organist friend (whom I am sure is reading this) created for a fake pipe organ design worthy of National Lampoon or The Onion. (Some stops were named after teachers. One I recall is the Roschkeflöte, named after <a href="https://www.strawserfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Rev-Walter-H-Roschke?obId=18916226">Rev. Walter Roschke</a>, who taught church history. Pastor Roschke’s nickname was Peach, because his blonde crew cut looked like fine fuzz.)</p>
<p>After that, Allan and I were only in occasional contact.&nbsp; I know he married twice. I met his first wife at a party at their apartment when he still lived in New Jersey. That was soon after college. Later he divorced, moved to Charleston, South Carolina, and remarried. Most of what I know about his time in Charleston was that the organ-building continued, along with work composing and playing music.</p>
<p>A surprise came in 2011, when I got a friend request on Facebook from Olivia Margaret Ontko. At first, I assumed that this must be a relative of Allan’s, since he came from a large Slovak family in New Jersey, and I attended some family gatherings there. When I went to Olivia’s Facebook page, I thought for a moment that looks kind of like Allan but… holy shit: that is Allen. He was a woman now.</p>
<p>I accepted the request, and marveled at how well Olivia had gathered a large collection of supportive friends, and that she had become an active advocate for trans rights and acceptance of gender choices. For the next few years, we would occasionally comment on each others’ posts, and talk now and then on the phone. Olivia also created a LinkedIn account which is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-margaret-ontko-5236891a/">still there</a>.</p>
<p>Our longest conversations were in June 2015, while I was driving to the 50th reunion of our high school class, and reporting on it afterward. Olivia was still in Charleston then.&nbsp; She said she couldn’t afford to come and didn’t have much appetite for it anyway. Nor did the rest of the Class of ’65, except for me. I was the only one to show up at the reunion, outnumbered six-to-one by photos of dead classmates taped to one wall of the room. Fortunately, the room was not empty of people, because it was also the 50th reunion of the graduating class that had attended the junior college sharing the same campus, and which had absorbed our high school dorm and its classrooms the year after I left. Eighteen Concordia College alumni attended, including some guys who were seniors when I was a sophomore in the high school.*</p>
<p>Back to Olivia.</p>
<p>In a high, thin voice, she recounted for me how tortured she felt through all those decades as a female in a male body. She regretted not having been born at a time, like the present, when a child who knows their body is wrongly gendered can get the medical interventions required to grow up in the right one. She said she knew from a young age that she was a lesbian, because she was sexually attracted to girls as a kid, and then women as an adult. She also lamented that the term “transsexual” was not in wide circulation back in our high school years, when it mostly referred to <a href="https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2014/05/hopkins-hospital-a-history-of-sex-reassignment-76004/">pioneering work Johns Hopkins</a> was doing at the time. So Allan repressed his urge to change sex until finally deciding to become Olivia. This was a deep and moving conversation because A.J. and I were so close in our high school years, yet I had no idea what he or she was going through. Finally, she told me she had written an autobiography and would send it to me, hoping I might find a publisher. I told her I would do my best. This was a promise she repeated each time we talked after that.</p>
<p>Two years later, I got a surprising friend request from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011112138846">Allan Ontko</a> on Facebook. The page for Olivia was gone. I accepted, and got this in response to an email:</p>
<blockquote><p>I gave up on Olivia… the surgery involved in making the full change would have posed some serious risks and would have been totally out of my budgetary means (not to mention the cost of an entirely new wardrobe)… HA!</p>
<p>As we used to say in SC: Call me anything except late for supper…</p>
<p>Allan</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long after that, he wrote this:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is inconcievable that I will turn 70 this September – but for the nonce I would rather be alive and kicking. I have had a few medical problems – I am developing cataracts and double vision but they aren’t bad enough to require immediate treatment; I had total joint replacement of my right shoulder about 1 1/2 years ago; my Parkinsons is very much under control since about 2 1/2 years ago I was fitted with two brain implants (DBS).</p>
<p>And, I have moved since last May to Spangle WA; a little town of about 238 people which is 18 miles South of Spokane.</p></blockquote>
<p>His address was a post office box. His phone was a cell.</p>
<p>My last contact with Allan was in a series of audio calls over Facebook totaling about an hour on the evening of December 17, 2020. Advancing Parkinson’s had made Allan’s speech very hard to understand, and the call kept dropping because his connection was so bad. I did gather that he was in a facility, but I didn’t catch the name. Attempts to reach him after that were for naught.</p>
<p>A few days ago I heard from a mutual friend that some digging on the Internet brought news that Allan had died in 2022 of Covid. My own digging led me to <a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/spokesman/name/death-notices-obituary?id=32950883">a list of death notices</a> in the Spokane Spokesman-Review, with this entry among them:</p>
<blockquote><p>ONTKO, Olivia (Age 74) Passed away February 9, 2022</p></blockquote>
<p>The same friend also told me that Allan had become a Seventh-Day Adventist. As it happens, Spangle is the home of the <a href="http://www.ucachurch.org/">Upper Columbia Seventh-Day Adventist Church</a>, and the <a href="https://ucaa.org/">Upper Columbia Academy</a>, which is across the street. So I am reaching out to both.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hillman#The_Soul's_Code">The Soul’s Code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hillman">James Hillman</a> says each of us is born with as much of a destiny, calling, mission, or fate, as an acorn has within it an oak tree. He also says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Reading life backward enables you to see how early obsessions are the sketchy preformation of behaviors now. Sometimes the peaks of early years are never surpassed. Reading backward means that growth is less the key biographical term than form, and that development only makes sense when it reveals a facet of the original image. Of course a human life advances from day to day, and regresses, and we do see different faculties develop and watch them wither. Still, the innate image of your fate holds all in the copresence of today, yesterday, and tomorrow. Your person is not a process or a development. You are that essential image that develops, if it does. As Picasso said, “I don’t develop; I am.”</p>
<p>For this is the nature of an image, any image. It’s all there at once. When you look at a face before you, at a scene out your window or a painting on the wall, you see a whole gestalt. All the parts present themselves simultaneously. One bit does not cause another bit or precede it in time. It doesn’t matter whether the painter put the reddish blotches in last or first, the gray streaks as afterthoughts or as originating structure or whether they are leftover lines from a prior image on that piece of canvas: What you see is exactly what you get, all at once. And the face, too; its complexion and features form a single expression, a singular image, given all at once. So, too, the image in the acorn. You are born with a character; it is given; a gift, as the old stories say, from the guardians upon your birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Allen/Olivia peaked when he/she was a successful organ builder. I also gather, reading between the lines of conversation and correspondence, that things went badly toward the end of that career. There were physical and mental issues: Parkinson’s and depression were just two. Perhaps finally, there was his/her singular and determined nature. You can see it in that high school photo. We—A.J.’s friends—could also see it in a photo one of us took of him when we were all playing around with shooting pictures and darkroom work. The photo was flattering. It nailed the A.J. we knew. He looked great. But he hated it, tore it up, and threw it away.</p>
<p>Did he do that because the photo wasn’t of his female self? For context, all I know is what Olivia told me half a century later: that being a teenage boy didn’t work for him. What worked was knowing that building pipe organs while also writing and performing music was in his/her soul’s code.</p>
<p>Allen/Olivia was an extremely unique, talented, and deep person, who deserves to be recognized and remembered for what he and she brought to the world.</p>
<p>That’s why I still want that autobiography—if it exists. I hope someone reading this might help find it. It’s a long shot, but if you have the bulls-eye, please let me know.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are traces of Allan online, in the form of his compositions, plus some performances. Here is what I’ve found so far:</p>

<p>NIST SP800-63-4 2pd を読まなければいけないところですが、なぜかそれから逃げて、<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KkgqL4U32I">「ABAC対ReBAC：認可ポリシーの対決」</a>というタイトルのYouTube動画を見終わったところです。せっかくなので、動画のNottaによる要約を以下に書いておきます。</p>



 YouTube動画の要約 



<p>この動画では、GabrielとAlexとDavidが、属性ベースのアクセス制御（ABAC）と関係ベースのアクセス制御（ReBAC）、別名ポリシーアズグラフについて議論しています。彼らは、きめ細かな認可に対するこれら2つのアプローチの主な違い、それぞれの利点、および潜在的なユースケースを探っています。議論では、優れた開発者体験の提供、ソフトウェア開発ライフサイクルへの認可の統合、そして顧客の需要に基づいてSaaSやCOTSベンダーがこれらのアプローチを採用する可能性についても触れています。さらに、Alphaのようなポリシー言語の将来や標準化の取り組みの可能性についても議論しています。</p>



 主要ポイント 



 導入と背景 



<p>ビデオはGabrielがAlexとDavidをABACとReBACの専門家として紹介することから始まります。彼らは、きめ細かな認可の概念と、リソース属性、コンテキスト、関係性などの追加の次元を考慮することで、従来の役割ベースのアクセス制御（RBAC）とどのように異なるかについて議論します。面白い試みとして、それぞれの「推し」のアプローチとは逆のアプローチの利点をアピールするところから始まります。</p>



 00:07:06 ReBAC（ポリシーアズグラフ）の利点 



<p>まず、ABAC推しのDavidが、ReBACを擁護して、認可にグラフベースのアプローチを使用することの利点を強調しています。これには、既存のツールやフレームワークの利用可能性、オープンエンドなクエリ（検索や逆クエリ評価）の実行能力、そしてポリシーの視覚的表現（理解の助けとなる）が含まれます。Alexは、グラフが分析に適しており、既存のグラフアルゴリズムを活用できると付け加えています。</p>



 00:11:50 ABAC（ポリシーアズコード）の利点 



<p>次に、ReBAC推しのAlexが、ポリシーアズコードとしても知られるABACの利点について議論します。彼は、コーディングに慣れた開発者にとって学習曲線が低い可能性があり、成熟したXACML標準に基づいていることを示唆しています。Davidは、ABACポリシーが平易な英語の要件を密接に反映できるため、理解と維持が容易になると付け加えています。</p>



 00:17:20 複雑性の管理と採用 



<p>議論は、きめ細かな認可の複雑性の管理と、SaaSやCOTSベンダーによる潜在的な採用に転じます。Gabrielは、ユーザーとリソースを粗粒度の役割やグループに分割し、その上にきめ細かなポリシーを適用することを提案しています。Davidは、OpenID財団のAuthZenワーキンググループに言及し、これが認可APIを標準化し、ベンダーによる採用を促進する可能性があると述べています。</p>



 00:51:00 開発者体験と統合 



<p>パネリストは、優れた開発者体験の提供とソフトウェア開発ライフサイクルへのシームレスな統合の重要性を強調しています。彼らは、体験を改善するための新しいポリシー言語やツールの可能性、およびノーコードソリューションへの傾向について議論しています。Davidは、Alphaポリシー言語を発展させ、潜在的に標準化する継続的な取り組みについて言及しています。</p>



 00:55:46 認可とアプリケーションロジックの区別 



<p>聴衆からの質問に答えて、Davidは認可ポリシーとアプリケーションロジックを区別するためのガイダンスを提供しています。彼は、認可ポリシーは副作用のないものであり、報告要件に焦点を当てるべきであるのに対し、アプリケーションロジックは厳密な報告ニーズなしにビジネスルールを扱うことができると示唆しています。</p>



 感想 



<p>OpenID財団におけるAuthZEN WGの活動は、現在注目を浴び始めている活動の一つです。この対談に登場する３人はこれに関わっている人々です。このように異なるアプローチを取るPDP (Policy Decision Point, ポリシー決定点) とでも、その決定については、PEP (Policy Enforcement Point, ポリシー強制点） とのにその決定を通知できるようになるべきですし、AuthZENではそのような規格を開発しています。ご興味のある方はぜひご参加を。</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. An unacceptable Microsoft Authenticator bug has been unaddressed for years; Hardware startup Nothing explains why it is going back to 5-days-a-week working from office; Ban on US noncompetes reversed; AI startup acquired for 2,000x its annual revenue; and more.</p>  <p>A ‘startup purge event’ has, unfortunately, arrived. A year ago, we deduced why we can expect startups to go bankrupt, en masse, starting in 2024. This event seems to be happening, with startup shutdowns rising quickly.</p>  <p>Sonos’ app rewrite was a YOLO release. Sonos wants to bring back its old app because the new one is so buggy: however, it cannot. A series of self-inflicted missteps are now hurting sales at the company, and could have been the reason for recent cuts.</p>  <p>Similarities between AI companies and telcos. AI startups have more in common with capital-heavy businesses like telecommunications companies than they do with software startups. We can expect to see some businesses with lots of capital going under thanks to intense competition, and more complex pricing structures to emerge.</p>  <p>What's it like to test compilers? QA engineer Alex Zakharenko tests compilers, full-time. He shares interesting details on what this is like: from how automated tests are handy in this area as well, to examples of what his day-to-day testing tasks look like.</p>   1. Industry pulse  Unacceptable Microsoft Authenticator bug gone unaddressed <p>The most commonly used two-factor authentication apps are Authy, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Duo Mobile, and LastPass Authenticator. These apps need to work reliably – or else users will be locked out of their accounts. It turns out that Microsoft’s Authenticator has a major flaw that has gone unaddressed for years, which overwrites existing accounts when adding a new account via a QR code. CSO Online <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3480918/design-flaw-has-microsoft-authenticator-overwriting-mfa-accounts-locking-users-out.html">shares</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“The core of the problem? Microsoft Authenticator will overwrite an account with the same username. Given the prominent use of email addresses for usernames, most users’ apps share the same username. Google Authenticator and just about every other authenticator app add the name of the issuer — such as a bank or a car company — to avoid this issue. Microsoft only uses the username.”</p></blockquote><p>It’s mind-boggling to hear that Microsoft has not addressed a longstanding and known issue that creates a major headache for its users. Such a glaring bug is a reason I would avoid using Microsoft Authenticator until this issue is fixed.</p><p>This fiasco is yet another example showcasing how Microsoft <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/145377185/microsoft-security-fiasco-with-recall">keeps under-investing in security</a> – and security tooling.</p> Hardware startup explains why it is going back to 5-days-a-week working from office

<p>Zum Auftakt der Branchenmesse Gamescom weist die Piratenpartei die <a href="https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/fans-k%C3%A4mpfen-f%C3%BCr-erhalt-abgeschalteter-075045787.html?guccounter=1">Kritik</a> des Herstellerverbands Video Games Europe an der <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">EU-Bürgerinitiative zum Schutz von Videospielen vor Fernabschaltung durch den Hersteller</a> zurück. Der Industrieverband bezeichnet den geforderten Weiterbetrieb vom Hersteller aufgegebener Spiele durch die Community als “unrealistisch” wegen der Kosten für Unternehmen und weil private Serverbetreiber Datenschutz und Sicherheit nicht gewährleisten könnten.</p>



<p>Dr. Patrick Breyer, ehemaliger Europaabgeordneter der Piratenpartei, hält dagegen: </p>



  
<blockquote></blockquote>



  
<blockquote>
<p>Hersteller und EU-Kommission müssen lernen, dass Videospiele keine Konserven sind, die man einfach aus dem Regal nehmen und durch ein anderes Produkt ersetzen kann. Sie sind Teil unseres gemeinsamen digitalen Erbes und verbinden Menschen über Jahre und manchmal sogar Jahrzehnte hinweg. Deswegen ist ein Weiterbetrieb durch die Community nur folgerichtig.</p>



<p>Es gibt längst Spiele, die erfolgreich ehrenamtlich betrieben oder weiterbetrieben werden. Der Datenschutz gilt auch für private ehrenamtliche Betreiber. Gamer, die in eine Übertragung ihrer Daten einwilligen und über die neuen Rahmenbedingungen aufgeklärt werden, sollten nicht wegen möglicher Abstriche bevormundet und ganz ihres Lieblingsgames beraubt werden, sondern eine Wahl bekommen. Die aktuelle Situation, in der Hersteller sich gegenüber voll zahlenden Gamern die willkürliche kurzfristige Abschaltung von einem Tag auf den anderen vorbehalten, ist untragbar.</p>



<p>Die Bürgerinitiative richtet sich zwar speziell gegen das willkürliche Abschalten von Computerspielen durch die Hersteller, aber diese Praxis betrifft längst nicht mehr nur Spiele. Auch andere Software und digitale Geräte <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/stopkillingtrains-eu-abgeordneter-fordert-regeln-gegen-das-willkuerliche-lahmlegen-von-geraeten-durch-hersteller-aus-der-ferne/">bis hin zu Zügen</a> werden fernabgeschaltet. Wir Piraten wollen diesen Rechtsmissbrauch stoppen und gesetzlich den Weiterbetrieb sowie die Weiterentwicklung verwaister Software durch die Community ermöglichen. Dies ist auch im Interesse der Nachhaltigkeit.</p>
</blockquote>
  
  



<p>Die Piratenpartei <a href="https://www.piratenpartei.de">setzt sich mit Nachdruck</a> für die europäische Bürgerinitiative „Stop Killing Videogames“ ein und ruft zur <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">Unterzeichnung</a> auf. Die Initiative zielt darauf ab, sicherzustellen, dass Videospiele nicht unspielbar werden, wenn die Unterstützung der Publisher endet. Sie hat kurz nach dem Start bereits etwa 300.000 von 1 Mio. erforderlichen Unterschriften erreicht.</p>



<p>„Initiativen wie ‚Stop Killing Videogames‘ sind essenziell, um die Rechte der Spielenden zu schützen und die Vielfalt der Gaming-Kultur zu bewahren. Wir Piraten fordern, dass vermeintlich nicht lukrative Spiele nicht deaktiviert, sondern der Öffentlichkeit als Open Source zur Verfügung gestellt werden und beispielsweise private Server ermöglicht werden“, erklärt Lukas Küffner, Bundesvorsitzender der Piratenpartei Deutschland.</p>



<p>Auf Anfrage Breyers hatte die EU-Kommission <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/stopkillinggames-eu-kommission-nimmt-erstmals-stellung-zum-computerspiele-sterben/">bestätigt</a>, dass es bisher keinen Schutz vor willkürlicher Abschaltung durch Hersteller gibt.</p>

 概要 



<p>近年、デジタル社会の急速な進展に伴い、オンラインでの本人確認や認証の重要性が高まっています。この度、米国国立標準技術研究所（NIST）が、デジタルアイデンティティに関するガイドライン<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-second-public-draft-digital-identity-guidelines-final-review">「SP 800-63-4」の更新案(2nd Public Draft)を発表</a>しました。この更新は、セキュリティの強化と、誰もが公平にデジタルサービスにアクセスできる環境の整備を目指しています。</p>



<p>今回の更新の特筆すべき点は、最新のデジタル技術への対応です。例えば、「同期可能な認証器」（パスキー）や「ユーザー管理型ウォレット」といった新しい概念が導入されています。パスキーは従来のパスワードよりも高度なセキュリティを提供し、ユーザー管理型ウォレットは各種デジタル証明書を安全に保管することができます。</p>



<p>一方で、NISTは従来の本人確認方法も重視しています。スマートフォンを持たない人や、デジタル証明書を持たない人々も、必要なサービスにアクセスできるよう配慮がなされています。例えば、対面での本人確認や、通常の身分証明書を持たない人のための例外処理などが詳細に規定されています。さらに、「申請者照会」という概念も導入され、身分証明書を持たない人でも、信頼できる第三者の保証があれば本人確認が可能になります。</p>



<p>生体認証に関しても、ガイドラインは重要な指針を示しています。生体認証の精度と個人情報保護の重要性を強調しつつ、特に公共サービスにおいては代替手段の提供を推奨しています。また、生体認証システムにエラーが発生した場合に備えて、手動での対応プロセスの整備も求めています。</p>



<p>このガイドライン更新案は、民間企業や advocacy グループなど、様々なステークホルダーからのフィードバックを反映しています。NISTは、不正利用防止策と公平なサービスアクセスのバランスを取ることに注力しており、今後のデジタル社会の発展に大きな影響を与えると考えられます。</p>



<p>デジタルアイデンティティの管理は、今後ますます重要になってくるでしょう。NISTのこの取り組みは、セキュリティと利便性、そして公平性を両立させる先進的な試みとして、世界中から注目されています。私たちも、この動向に注目しつつ、自身のデジタルアイデンティティ管理について考えを深めていく必要があるでしょう。</p>



<p>本文書は、10月7日までコメントを募集しています。詳細は、<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-second-public-draft-digital-identity-guidelines-final-review">こちらのページ</a>からアクセス可能です。</p>



 【付録】元リリースよりのピックアップポイント 



<p>NISTのデジタルアイデンティティガイドライン更新の概要</p>



 
 NISTは、セキュリティとアクセシビリティを向上させるため、デジタルアイデンティティに関するガイダンス草案を更新しました。 



 この更新は、民間企業や advocacy グループを含む様々な関係者からのフィードバックを反映しています。 



 このガイドラインは、不正対策とデジタルサービスへの公平なアクセスのバランスを取ることを目指しています。 
 



<p>更新されたガイドラインの主な特徴</p>



 
 この草案には、同期可能な認証子やユーザー管理型ウォレットなど、最新のデジタル経路に関するガイダンスが含まれています。 



 同期可能な認証子（パスキー）は、従来のパスワードと比較してセキュリティが向上しています。これについては附属書Bに記載しています。 



 ユーザー管理型ウォレットは、身分証明書を含む様々なデジタル証明書を保存できます。これについては附属書Cに記載しています。 
 



<p>アクセシビリティと従来の本人確認方法</p>



 
 このガイドラインは、スマートフォンやデジタル証明書を持たない個人でもサービスにアクセスできることを保証しています。 



 拡張されたガイダンスには、対面での本人確認や、従来の身分証明書を持たない人のための例外処理が含まれています。 



 「申請者照会 (“applicant reference”)」の概念により、身分証明書を持たない人のために信頼できる個人が保証することが可能になります。 
 



<p>生体認証とプライバシーへの配慮</p>



 
 更新されたガイダンスでは、本人確認のための生体認証の使用を維持しつつ、精度とプライバシーを強調しています。 



 特に公共サービスシステムにおいて、生体認証方法の代替手段が推奨されています。 



 NISTは、生体認証システムに潜在的なエラーに対処するための手動プロセスを含めることを目指しています。

<blockquote> Q: I’ve joined a new company and a few months in, it’s clear my team would be better off if we adopted some best practices which are currently missing. But how can I introduce these without treading on too many toes? </blockquote><p>If you’ve changed companies, you’ve probably found yourself in a position of observing gaps that your new team has, and how using one or two ‘best practices’ would benefit everyone. These could be to do with matters like planning or development, testing approaches, rollout strategies and more. In this issue, we cover this area in depth:</p>  <p>“Best practices” vs “practices”. Making the case that “best” is less important for these practices.</p>  <p>Common software engineering practices. For planning, development, testing and maintenance.</p>  <p>Two questions before adopting an engineering practice. What is the problem to be solved, what would the effect be?</p>  <p>Adopting a practice at team level. Most common approaches.</p>  <p>Risk of copy/pasting practices. There’s good reason to be skeptical about practices just because they worked well at other places.</p>  <p>Rejecting and dropping practices. Just because you introduced a practice doesn’t mean it should be permanently adopted.</p>  <p>Encouraging engineers to consider practices, as a manager. Empowering software engineers to bring practices that help the team work better.</p>  <p>We previously touched on related topics in these articles:</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rfcs-and-design-docs">Engineering planning</a> – an overview of RFCs, Design Documents and ADRs</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/consolidating-technologies">Consolidating technologies</a> – a roundup of approaches</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a> – and overview of how to ship code to prod in reliable way</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/migrations">Migrations done well</a> – a deepdive into this unusually challenging topic</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/incident-review-best-practices?">Incident review and postmortem best practices</a> – including a peek into the practices of the future</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/healthy-oncall-practices">Healthy oncall practicess</a> – a roundup of these, with upsides and downsides</p>   1. Best practices vs “practices” <p>As a software engineer, you’ve undoubtedly heard the term “best practice.” It’s an approach or process that’s understood to help build software that’s superior in terms of speed of execution, shipping with higher quality, or building more maintainable code.</p><p>However, workplaces are different enough that what’s considered as “best practice” at one place, might fail at another.</p><p>Take a conventional best practice of doing code reviews before merging a pull request to the codebase. Code reviews have lots of upsides: catching errors, spreading knowledge, and getting feedback sooner from peers. But the biggest downside is it delays the development process by pausing it for the code review. And some tooling needs to be put in place for a review. Still, at most places the downsides aren’t big compared to the upsides.</p><p>But sometimes code reviews don’t make sense, for example in a one-person project when a code review is impractical. Likewise, when building a throwaway prototype there’s no point in a review. And there are teams with experienced software engineers for which a different approach works much better: post-commit reviews, where code reviews are done after the code is merged. This is because teams which work well together tend to get more value from not breaking the workflow of other engineers, and the number of issues which code reviews detect is low enough to justify not adding a delay to merging code.</p><p>If “best practice” code reviews are not necessarily always the optimal approach, then what about other “best practices” which are also contextual? Instead of “best practices”, I call them ‘software engineering practices.’ There are tried-and-tested software engineering practices that help with one or more dimensions of the software engineering process.</p> 2. Common software engineering practices  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb5191e5-d475-4588-8d98-ef4f2d9a2114_1600x1162.png">    </a>Several of the practices we will touch on <p>Below is a selection of practices, some suggested by <a href="https://x.com/simonw/">Simon Willison</a>, co-creator of Django. He wrote the excellent post <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/1/software-engineering-practices">Software engineering practices</a> in a response to <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1576161504260657152">a Twitter conversation I started</a>.</p> Planning   <p>Written planning process. Before starting to code non-trivial projects, a plan is written and circulated for feedback. This plan might be called a Request for Comment (RFC,) an Engineering Requirements Document (EDD,) a Design Doc, or Architectural Decision Record (ADR.) We covered more on these in the issue <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rfcs-and-design-docs">Engineering planning with RFCs, Design Documents and ADRs</a></p>  <p>Standardized approach to architectural diagrams. Agreeing on the tooling or approach for creating architectural diagrams, including which symbols and approaches are not understood by some members of the group, or new joiners.</p>   Development   <p>Automated setting up of a new development environment. When starting at a new company or moving to a new project, it often takes painfully long to get set up in the development environment. Installing all the tools, setting the environment variables, and doing things like initializing a local database, all take time. Cloud-based developments like GitPod turn this process into a simple click. We covered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/85170351/gitpods-product-roadmap">GitPod’s product roadmap here</a>. Simon Will <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/1/software-engineering-practices/#tested-dev-environments">writes</a>: “I’ve seen developers lose hours a week to issues with the development environment. Eliminating that across a large team is the equivalent of hiring several new full-time engineers!”</p>  <p>Prototyping. Iterating quickly by building throwaway prototypes to validate ideas and get quick feedback from customers.</p>  <p>Code reviews. Before committing code, other engineers review and sign it off.</p>  <p>Automated code formatting. Engineers often like to format their code in different ways, and a difference in how many spaces to use for indentation, or using tabs instead, can turn into an argument and reduce the readability of the code. You can use automated code formatting solutions at the IDE-level, or solve the issue with linting.</p>  <p>Linting. This is the automated checking of code for stylistic and other errors which can be checked with rules. Putting linting in place before creating a pull request can help ensure the code is formatted the same way. You can also add more advanced rules such as codifying some architecture rules, for example specifying that a View class should not directly reference a Model class.</p>  <p>Static code analysis. Run more advanced code checks before committing, such as searching for security vulnerabilities or detecting features to be deprecated.</p>  <p>Templates for new projects or components. Provide ready-to-clone repository setups with the expected folder structure, and a README in place. Do the same for commonly-used components.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Code generation for common components. When following an opinionated architecture during development, speed up code writing with tooling which generates the boilerplate code to wire things up. For example, this is an approach we took at Uber in <a href="https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki#rib-tooling">using a code generator</a> to output modules for our RIBs native mobile architecture.</p>  <p>Automated preview environments. Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/1/software-engineering-practices/#tested-dev-environments">writes</a>: “Reviewing a pull request is a lot easier if you can actually try out the changes. The best way to do this is with automated preview environments, directly linked to from the pull request itself. Vercel, Netlify, Render and Heroku all have features that can do this.”</p>  <p>Post-commit code reviews. Code reviews are done only after the commits are made. This approach typically increases iteration speed, while still having some code reviews in place. As a tradeoff, more regressions might reach production. This practice usually works best with very small or highly experienced teams.</p>  <p>Cross-platform development approaches. When building a product for several platforms – say, the web, iOS, Android and desktop – an alternative is to use a framework which allows for sharing most of the code across all platforms. This could be an off-the-shelf framework, although there’s always the temptation to create something that perfectly fits your use case.</p>  <p>Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD). Automatically running tests on all code changes (CI) and running the full test suite and deploying changes when committing code (CD).</p>  <p>Project management approaches. Using approaches like Kanban, Scrum and other frameworks like SaFE (Scaled Agile Framework,) LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum,) or your own approach. We covered more on this in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/project-management-in-tech">How Big Tech runs tech projects</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineers-leading-projects">Software engineers leading projects</a>.</p>   Testing   <p>Automated testing. Writing unit, integration, end to end, performance, load, or other types of tests. This approach usually increases quality and maintainability and often results in less time overall to ship software, thanks to regressions being flagged quickly.</p>  <p>Test-driven development. A subset of automated testing where tests are written before the actual code is.</p>  <p>Testing environments. Shipping code to intermediary environments for more testing, Instead of shipping straight to production. The upside is increased confidence that the code is correct. The downsides are it takes longer to ship things to production and there’s extra work maintaining the testing environments.</p>  <p>Testing in production, and doing it safely. Instead of using testing environments, shipping to production and using safe methods for tests, you could utilize processes like tenancies, feature flags or staged rollouts.</p>  <p>Testing with production data. It can be useful to be able to test with production data, without affecting production. Some companies build more sophisticated systems that can “fork” production traffic to a developer machine, and the developer can execute.</p>  <p>Load testing. Simulating high load for backend systems, to prepare for situations where production loads spikes and to test which systems might get overloaded or break.</p>  <p>Performance benchmarking and testing. For applications where performance is important, benchmark things like resource usage, i.e., CPU load, responsiveness and latency. This is important for products of which high performance is expected. An additional practice is automating performance testing and performance benchmarking to catch performance regressions right at the code changes which introduce them.</p>  <p>Generating test data. It can be useful to have ways of bulk-generating test data that mirrors production usage. Simon Willison has written more about this in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/1/software-engineering-practices/#create-test-data">Mechanisms for creating test data</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>We cover more on testing in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-big-tech-does-qa">How Big Tech does QA</a> and in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/qa-across-tech">QA approaches across the tech industry</a>.</p>   Shipping   <p>Feature flags and experimentation. Control the rollout of a change by hiding it behind a feature flag in the code. This feature flag can then be enabled for a subset of users, and those users execute the new version of the code. This approach can also be used to run A/B tests to ensure that the feature performs in-line with expectations (or that it does not cause measurable regressions in.)</p>  <p>Staged rollouts, also referred to as ‘progressive delivery.’ Instead of releasing new features to customers all at once, release them in stages and gather feedback. Another flavor of this is ‘blue-green deploys’ that <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/139724871/rollouts">Stripe also uses</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/139724871/rollouts">we covered in detail</a>.</p>  <p>Monitoring and alerting. Tracking a system’s health signals and alerting oncall engineers if something unusual happens.</p>  <p>Logging. Recording information on the system to help with debugging later.</p>  <p>We covered more about these topics in the deepdive <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a>.</p>   Maintenance   <p>Debugging production. Having ways to inspect the system as it runs, or to play back production use-cases, and also methods for inspecting variables and code paths to discover what the issue could be.</p>  <p>Documentation. Deciding what to document and how, tooling, whether documentation will be kept up to date and how to do this.</p>  <p>Runbook templates. For teams which are oncall, runbooks that can help the oncall engineer resolve a specific type of alert, are very helpful. Having runbook examples and templates available helps to keep these runbooks consistent and easy to navigate.</p>  <p>A migration runbook. Migrations are a different beast and hard to do well, which is especially true of data migrations. We cover this in depth in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/migrations">Migrations Done Well</a> – including a migration checklist – and also in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/real-world-engineering-challenges">Real-World Engineering Challenges: Migrations</a>. Simon Willison wrote an excellent post about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/1/software-engineering-practices/#rock-solid-migrations">Rock-solid database migrations</a>.</p>   3. Two questions before adopting an engineering practice <p>When starting at a new workplace, it’s tempting to introduce practices that worked well in your previous role. There can be a similar urge after reading about a practice which worked somewhere else, which you think would greatly benefit your new team.</p><p>However, before deciding to make a case for adopting a practice, I suggest taking a step back and asking two questions:</p> Question #1: What is the problem to be solved? <p>A simple question, but one I’ve observed engineers often neglect before starting to put a new practice in place. Be clear what the current issues are.</p><p>For engineering practices, problems worth solving can include:</p>  <p>Developers spend too much time doing X. Can we speed this up? X could mean waiting on scripts or code reviews, setting up development environments, writing tests, or more.</p>  <p>The quality of our output isn’t good and needs improving. There might be too many bugs, too many outage incidents.</p>  <p>The speed of execution is slow. Getting simple things done could take longer than necessary due to continuous processes, tools, or workarounds.</p>  <p>Developers context switch too much. Context switching for the wrong reasons.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It’s hard to do X. It could be hard and time-consuming to debug a part of the system, to resolve certain types of outages, or to get people on the same page. It’s ideal if you can verbalize the consequences of things being hard to do.</p>  <p>Once you’ve verbalized the problem, what is its impact? If it was solved or made less of an issue, what would improve? Things that teams – and companies – tend to care about include:</p>  <p>Revenue generation</p>  <p>Business goals</p>  <p>Regressions</p>  <p>Reliability</p>  <p>Outages</p>  <p>Iteration speed</p>  <p>And how pressing is the issue? For example, if it’s hard to debug one of the services, but that service is barely touched and only needs debugging once every few months, then perhaps it’s not urgent to solve it.</p> Question #2: If adopted, what would be the effect of a practice?&nbsp; <p>When there’s a problem to solve, wait before moving ahead with the engineering practice that helps with it. That’s because every new practice introduced will have an impact on how people and teams work.</p><p>For example, say your team has no code reviews in place and also there are quality issues, like too many bugs being shipped. By putting mandatory, pre-merge code reviews in place, those quality issues could be reduced. However, now there will be new issues, such as people having to wait on code reviews, figuring out what to do when no reviewers are available, or what to do when there’s a lot of debate about a code review which stalls the process.</p><p>There are a few common ways to find out what may happen if a practice is put in place:</p>  <p>Do a “pre-mortem.” Make hypotheses about how things can change. You know your team, your company, and the people. Imagine you put this practice in place: what issues could it cause? For example, you might know there’s a team member who’s outspoken about a practice you want to bring in, which could be a source of conflict if not done right. If your team has less experienced engineers and you are proposing a practice which will make the development workflow more complex – like suggesting a certain architecture pattern to follow – then they’ll need more hand-holding and may struggle to follow the approach without support.</p>  <p>Consult case studies of the new practice being introduced elsewhere. There are plenty of teams and companies which are open to sharing their experiences with practices and how they worked. Check out engineering blogs, conference talks and recordings to gather details on how things went at other companies. However, be aware that engineers often focus more on success stories and less on what went wrong when acting as company representatives.</p>  <p>Talk with people who already use this practice. The problem with case studies is they tend to give an overly rosy picture of a practice. To get the full picture, it helps to talk to engineers who have used the practice, ideally in a similar environment to yours. If you can find colleagues who adopted the practice, also talk with them. If you can’t access people internally, don’t be afraid to reach out externally to engineers who have written about using this practice. For example, when I was at Skyscanner, a few engineers reached out to Spotify to learn more about how engineering teams organized there. A few Skyscanner engineers even traveled to Stockholm to meet and discuss it with Spotify engineers, who were very helpful. And it all started with just a cold email to an engineer!</p> 4.

<p>In mid 2024, GenAI tools powered by large language models (LLMs) are widely used by software engineering professionals, and there’s no shortage of hype about how capable these tools will eventually become. But what about today? We asked the software engineers who use them.</p><p>Our survey on this topic was filled out <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146678491/overview">by 216 tech professionals</a>; and we then analyzed this input to offer a balanced, pragmatic, and detailed view of where LLM-powered development tooling stands, right now.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">In Part 1 of this mini series</a> we covered:</p>  <p>Survey overview</p>  <p>Popular software engineering AI tools</p>  <p>AI-assisted software engineering workflows</p>  <p>The good</p>  <p>The bad</p>  <p>What’s changed since last year?</p>  <p>In this article, we cover:</p>  <p>What are AI tools similar to? AI is akin to autocomplete, or pairing with a junior developer, or a tutor/coach, say survey responses.</p>  <p>State of AI tooling in 2024: opinions. There’s a roughly equal split between positive, neutral, and negative views on how useful AI tooling is for software development.</p>  <p>Critiques of AI tools. Many respondents are unimpressed by productivity gains, concerns exist about copied-pasted output, and other criticisms.</p>  <p>Changing views about AI tooling over time. After using the tools for 6 months or longer, most developers are either more positive, or slightly less enthusiastic than before. A minority feel more negatively.</p>  <p>Which tasks can AI already replace? Simple, constrained problems, and “junior” work and testing are tasks the tools can handle today. Plenty of engineers believe AI tools won’t fully replace any software engineering role or responsibility.</p>  <p>Time saved – and what it’s used for. Some respondents save almost no time, while others say AI tools create 20% more time for other things.</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-part-3">In Part 3</a> we wrap up this mini-series with:</p>  <p>AI usage guidelines</p>  <p>Internal LLMs at Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Pinterest, Stripe</p>  <p>Reservations and concerns</p>  <p>Advice for devs to get started with AI tools</p>  <p>Advice for engineering leaders to roll out AI tooling, org-wide</p>  <p>Measuring the impact of GenAI tools</p>  <p>AI strategies at tech companies</p>   1. What are AI tools similar to? <p>In the survey, we asked professionals for their views on GenAI tooling, and several described it in metaphorical terms. Here’s a selection of answers to the question: “AI tooling is like __:”</p>  <p>… autocomplete. “As an addition to enhance developer productivity, it will become somewhat "invisible" and something we take for granted, like code auto-completion or grammar hints.” – CTO, 18 years of experience (YOE)</p>  <p>… pairing with a junior programmer. “Copilot is like pair programming with a junior programmer. I use it to do the rote work of filling in the details of my larger design.” – principal engineer, 45 YOE</p>  <p>… an eager intern. “It’s like having a really eager, fast intern as an assistant, who’s really good at looking stuff up, but has no wisdom or awareness. I used to think it would improve to quickly become a real assistant, but the usefulness of the tools haven’t meaningfully improved in the past year, so our current LLM approach feels like it might be petering out until we get a new generation.” – director, 15 YOE</p>  <p>… a tutor or coach. “It’s great as a tutor or coach, answering very specific questions quickly and painlessly. It gets you started or unblocked really well.” – distinguished engineer, 25 YOE</p>  <p>… an assistant. “For me it's more of an assistant which can help me in day-to-day tasks.” – architect, 9 YOE</p>  <p>… pre-Google search. “It is like when we didn't know which search engine was best and we had to multihome and try multiple different sites (Inktomi, Hotbot, Altavista, etc.) in the pre-Google days.” – data scientist, 20 YOE</p>   2. State of AI tooling in 2024: opinions <p>We asked readers for your views on the current state of AI tooling, and the replies span the spectrum from positive to negative. Interestingly, the split is roughly equal between readers on this question:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff875dcf-3e28-4834-8eb5-1bde6ea7c5f5_848x748.png">    </a>Current state of AI tooling, based on 216 survey responses <p>Let’s dive into each group, starting with the upbeat.</p> Moderately positive views <p>The most commonly-mentioned benefits of AI tools:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcea7898f-ac62-45e9-a806-6ede1898ca85_1600x1140.png">    </a>Split within the ‘moderately positive’ feedback group <p>“Useful.” Lots of respondents say AI tooling is useful, but not particularly groundbreaking in its current form. A few quotes:</p><blockquote><p>“Copilot is generally useful and can save a lot of time. Code completion systems have been around for years and this seems a natural evolution, if not a big step up. As an "old timer," I'm always a bit skeptical, but so far it's been a fairly good augmentation for my team.“ – Director of Engineering, 30 YOE</p><p>“It saves me half the time on a task, for about 10% of my tasks. I hope it improves significantly, and I am not worried about my job for the next 5 years." – software engineer, 17 YOE</p><p>“It works well, as the name implies, as a copilot. I feel it's sometimes quicker to ask a question than trying to hunt down an answer on Google, especially since copilot has some context from the workspace. It's also useful as an initial PR, even if I don't agree with or implement all its suggestions. For code generation, I found it more useful for writing unit tests than actual business logic.” – software engineer, 4 YOE</p><p>“It's a decent autocomplete. It’s good at answering simple questions when I'm working with a new language, and has basically replaced Stackoverflow for me. My expectations are that it will only get a little more powerful, and still only be useful for learning or simple completion, but the big value add will come from training on our specific codebase to enable things like generating the entire boilerplate for a test.” – software engineer, 13 YOE</p><p>“It’s super, super useful day to day, to speed up routine tasks and help with the empty whiteboard problem“ – principal engineer, 15 YOE</p><p>“It's pretty good. I give it 6 out of 10” – software engineer, 2 YOE</p></blockquote><p>A software engineer with 7 years of experience gives their top uses for GitHub Copilot:</p>  <p>“Explain this to me” feature (most useful)</p>  <p>Chatbot integrating with company-internal documentation (useful)</p>  <p>Code generation (helpful if you know what to look for)</p>  <p>Autocomplete (on a par with older autosuggest tools, perhaps a bit more capable)</p>  <p>“A solid choice for prototyping and getting started.” Several respondents distrust the outputs of AI, but see its usefulness as a kickstarter:</p>  <p>Building a prototype for testing things</p>  <p>Putting together proof-of-concepts</p>  <p>Generating boilerplate code or scaffolding for a project</p>  <p>Getting started on a new project</p>  <p>Understanding a new codebase</p>  <p>A sounding board for questions</p>  <p>Several experienced engineers mention large time savings from using AI tools for prototyping, and building first proof of concepts which need not be production-ready, secure, or even correct. Quick and dirty, done fast; that’s the goal! AI tooling is helping greatly with this, says the survey.</p><p>“Good for learning and research.” Many people note these strengths:</p>  <p>Good at searching for relevant coding-related information</p>  <p>Helpful for explaining coding concepts, syntax, and use cases</p>  <p>Good for learning about technical and non-technical domains. A senior engineer uses it to learn about functional programming concepts and accounting, and says they learn faster than with textbooks</p>  <p>Helpful for looking up information on technologies and open source frameworks/libraries which the tool was trained on, or can access</p>  <p>“A great interactive rubber ducking / pair-programmer tool” Talking with the tool to get unstuck is mentioned by many devs. “Rubber ducking” is a problem-solving method of describing a problem to a real or metaphorical rubber duck; the idea is that vocalizing and explaining it out loud helps lead to a solution.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking to an AI tool is different because it responds, unlike the duck. It can raise overlooked pointers and ideas. A staff engineer with 15 YOE calls it an “interactive pair programmer.” The same engineer also shares that it’s less helpful with anything more than simple pieces of code.</p><p>“I can see it evolving further.” Several respondents say there’s plenty of room for improvement. More integration touchpoints is an area which a CTO with 20 YOE hopes to see more progress in:</p><blockquote><p>“Currently it can be a good pairing buddy for common languages/frameworks that don't change too often. In future, would be great to see some more integrations - i.e. suggestions for code improvements from IDE, ability to dive into projects and provide feedback on alternative approach from design perspective, tests auto-generation based on specs and existing codebase"</p></blockquote><p>“Still learning how to use it.” It takes time and experimentation to figure things out. Software engineer Simon Willison (25+ YOE, the creator of the Django framework) has <a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1811033718582366446">publicly said</a> it took him quite a while to learn how to use GitHub Copilot productively. Meanwhile, a backend developer with 6 YOE shares that they are doing the same:</p><blockquote><p>“I am not intimidated by AI technologies. On the contrary, I am trying to incorporate such tools into my work as much as possible. I feel I should invest more time in learning how to use AI tools. The generation of tests could potentially be improved. Current tools such as Copilot and CodiumAI have limitations for load context and do not often utilize existing fixtures by Pytest. I still write complex business logic manually, and often make corrections by hand because the AI cannot do it, or I’m too lazy to debug the prompt."&nbsp;</p></blockquote> Very positive views  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F597ea11d-50b2-4a4b-865d-2f4e029742f1_1600x1127.png">    </a>Split within the ‘very positive’ feedback group <p>“Translating” between programming languages works great. Several developers share that a useful use case is giving the AI tool code in one language to be translated into another. Thanks to the architecture of LLMs, they translate well between programming languages, and also human languages. An engineering manager (25 YOE) says:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s great for taking an idea prototyped in one language (bash), and translating it into another language (python). I can run both programs and assume that they return the same output.”</p></blockquote><p>“It’s great!” Plenty of responses are strongly positive. Here are some from the survey about Copilot and ChatGPT:</p>  <p>Works very well on languages less used by developers</p>  <p>An “invaluable autocomplete+++,” as shared by a senior software engineer, 10 YOE</p>  <p>“Understands the codebase and quickly catches up to its style” - software architect, 25 YOE</p>  <p>Helps figure out issues with toolchain and development environments - senior engineer, 20 YOE</p>  <p>Wonderful for generating unit tests for classes - staff engineer, 20 YOE</p>  <p>A chat AI assistant is the first recourse when stuck on a problem - senior software engineer, 7 YOE</p>  <p>“Game changer.” A sizable number of responses are bullish about the productivity gains of the tech today. The quotes below come from professionals with at least 10 YOE, and plenty of hands-on experience:</p><blockquote><p>“GitHub Copilot has been a game changer for day-to-day productivity in our company. GPT-4 is also widely used for documentation, meeting notes, and requirements gathering. I assume it will only get better, and become more effective at reducing toil and helping teams produce better software, particularly with the non-core-coding tasks (documentation, unit tests, sample code and starter kits, templates, etc).” – staff engineer, 30 YOE</p><p>“It’s an enormous productivity boost, even with existing tools. I expect it to improve over time, though not necessarily by orders of magnitude.” – principal engineer, 25 YOE</p><p>“It’s essential for any modern engineer to have AI tooling in their stack. Otherwise, it’s a massive productivity hit.” – engineering team lead, 12 YOE</p><p>“Game changer. Makes writing test cases really easy. Shifts most of the coding I do to thinking/planning from writing. I love using it to write security policies, too!” — Director of security engineering, 12 YOE</p></blockquote> 3. Critiques of AI tools  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff707c504-f038-4dfc-a1df-1d9159b4551e_1600x1160.png">    </a>Split among ‘moderately critical’ respondents  “Unimpressed” <p>The single most-cited criticism is that AI tools are not living up to their promise. Complaints from active users included:</p>  <p>Stagnation. The top gripe. LLM technology hasn’t changed in more than a year, since the release of ChatGPT 4.0, and it’s not getting better. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">Approaches like RAG</a> can only bring so much improvement, according to a software architect of 15 years, and one with 20 YOE.</p>  <p>GitHub Copilot is the “only” tool that works. Several people say Copilot is the only tool they’re not entirely dissatisfied with, after testing several. However, these developers add that Copilot gets suggestions wrong as often as it’s right, and that unless you’re in a rush, it’s better to write code without automated suggestions.</p>  <p>Useful for simple stuff, poor at more complex tasks. It’s good at speeding up simple-enough refactoring, tedious use cases and “routine” tasks like config file changes, and working with regular expressions. But it doesn’t help much when working across a complex codebase, especially one that follows less common coding or architecture patterns.</p>  <p>Limited use cases. Outside of repetitive changes and boilerplate generation it’s not useful because it introduces hard-to-spot bugs.</p>  <p>Too much effort. Outside of code suggestions, it’s a lot of effort to get something complex that works as expected.</p>  <p>Unreliable. You need to stay on your toes because just when you start to trust it, it generates non-working, buggy code.</p>  <p>A “fancy autocomplete.” This is the view of an engineering team whose members have used the tool for around 6 months. Hallucinations are why it’s not trusted more.</p>  <p>More hindrance than help. A staff engineer with 10 YOE is correcting AI output more than benefiting from it. They expect things to improve, but see little value in the tooling as it stands.</p>  <p>Tedious. It’s more work to bulk-generate tests, and tools can stumble when faced with untypical software architecture. A software developer (9 YOE) expects things to improve when the tool can “digest” complete projects.</p>  <p>“Even the boilerplate is not what I need.” A senior software engineer with 5 YOE voices disappointment that instructed boilerplate code ended up doing the opposite of what was intended. For context, this engineer is just getting started on AI tools; perhaps working on prompts will improve outputs.</p>   Concerns about engineers copy-pasting AI output&nbsp; <p>Half a dozen engineers with more than 10 years of experience voiced the concern that less experienced colleagues copy-paste code output from AI tools, without knowing what it will actually do. Seasoned developers list these gripes about:</p>  <p>Forgetting that AI-generated code is unverified. “Engineers copy-pasting code is nothing new, it’s existed since the StackOverflow days. However, StackOverflow has a human touch and verification; AI has neither.” (principal engineer, 11 YOE).</p>  <p>Trusted as a source of truth, but isn’t one. “It works well if you have enough knowledge to understand the output and to challenge it. It’s very dangerous for junior devs as they tend to use it as a source of truth, which it is not, at least not today.” (software engineer, 6 YOE)</p>  <p>Doesn’t truly help newer devs: “These tools are directionally helpful for seniors who can identify errors, but detrimental to juniors who won't know the difference.” (AI practice lead, 17 YOE)</p>  <p>Degrades people’s problem-solving skills. “I worry the younger generation will become dependent on LLMs, and that their own critical thinking and problem-solving skills will diminish.” (DevOps engineer, 8 YOE) I’d add that older generations tend to underestimate how the next generation adapts. <a href="http://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/genz-part-2">Our recent GenZ survey in this publication showed</a> the new generation of talent is very capable; so we might need to worry less!</p>   Fair Criticism related to the architecture of LLMs <p>The below criticism is about the inevitable nature of LLMs, thanks to their architecture. LLMs are trained on a large corpus of textual training data, and then generate the next most likely token based on an output. Thanks to this architecture, they will perform worse when encountering scenarios that were not part of their training data, and are prone to hallucination. We previously covered <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/">How LLMs like ChatGPT works – as shared by the ChatGPT team</a>.</p><p>“Doesn’t work well on custom tech stacks and novel architectures.” Experienced engineers say that current tools can’t get context on an entire code repository, or on all projects within a company. This lack of context gets in the way of helpful output for projects with custom code structures and coding approaches.</p><p>Here’s the problem according to a staff engineer (30 YOE):</p><blockquote><p>“The killer features for us would be a broader understanding of our ecosystem of APIs and libraries, to recommend common standard approaches within our company when writing new code or building new products.”</p></blockquote><p>This criticism makes sense given how LLMs are trained; most training data is open-sourced code. At the same time, technology used at larger companies is often home-grown, and so these tools need additional context to work optimally. This context could be provided via <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">RAG</a> (we covered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">more on RAG</a>.) We also previously covered <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/">how LLMs work and are trained</a>.</p><p>“Doesn’t use context beyond file-level.” A valid criticism is that current LLM tools focus on the file level, not the project level. Several developers voice hope that AI tooling shall be reimagined to work at project-level, and that AI assistants will get additional context to the single open file.</p><p>A software developer using these AI tools for more than two years says:</p><blockquote><p>“There is not yet a good tool with the speed, quality and developer experience of GH copilot, which is also aware of the full project context (types, interfaces, overall patterns, file structure,) and that we can ask questions to without leaving the IDE. I’ve tried GH Copilot X, which is an attempt at this, but it's definitely not there yet and has been a net negative.</p><p>I would pay for a tool that solves this problem smoothly. At the same time, I wouldn't conform with anything less than GH Copilot in terms of speed and quality of its autocomplete.”</p></blockquote><p>And a principal engineer with 30 years of experience puts it like this:</p><blockquote><p>“Copilot is good at very small, self contained tasks, but those are relatively rare. It’s bad at anything that needs broad context across the codebase.”</p></blockquote><p>“Need to learn how to use it.” Several developers share that they had to invest a lot of time and effort in getting the tool to be useful. Some observations:</p>  <p>You need to guide it, akin to helping an inexperienced engineer (staff engineer, 8 YOE)</p>  <p>It needs a lot of handholding and domain expertise to make it useful (software engineer, 9 YOE)</p>  <p>It can be hard to ask the “right” question, and sometimes it’s easier to just skip it (software engineer, 13 YOE)</p>  <p>You need to have specific expectations, e.g. when generating tests, or how to have it work with data (senior software engineer, 25 YOE)</p>  <p>Hit and miss. “Sometimes it's like it's reading my mind, sometimes it's just so totally wrong it outweighs any benefits.” (SRE, 15 YOE)</p>  <p>A staff engineer with 25 years YOE gives an excellent summary:</p><blockquote><p>“It's extremely useful if you understand its limitations. I get the best results when I use it to fill in the blanks.&nbsp;</p><p>Asking it to write a whole class, or an entire test file is dangerous because it'll give you something that looks right. However, when you dig in, there’s all kinds of things that just won't work. [But] it's gotten noticeably better since the early days.&nbsp;</p><p>I trust it enough now that if I lay out the code – set up the class name, important method name, and parameters – then I can just kinda tab through the details while double checking each chunk it gives me. Having good accompanying tests is also important.”</p></blockquote><p>“Hallucination still a problem.” Several engineers raise this ongoing issue. Here’s a solutions architect with 15 YOE’s take:</p><blockquote><p>“Sometimes it hallucinates methods that don’t exist. I’ve used trials of several services, and haven’t seen long-term improvement in any one."</p></blockquote><p>“Doesn’t work well for brainstorming.” A systems engineer finds AI tools are a poor choice for brainstorming because they can generate lots of ideas, but its detailed descriptions legitimize bad ideas! Also, the tool cannot tell what’s useful for a business.</p><p>“Lowered my expectations as a less experienced developer.” A few devs share that over time AI tools seem to have gotten less reliable, or to not work as hoped. Interestingly, this observation comes from developers with less than 3 years of experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps this could be a case of the tech being at a point where it’s hard to judge when the output is not what’s needed. Or is it that more experienced developers come to every new tool with low expectations because they know that reality hardly ever lives up to hype?</p> Very critical

<p>I decided to do a bit of practice in prompt construction and with a spreadsheet of example software release data. I was curious how well ChatGPT would perform using an Excel spreadsheet of data points. I had seen examples of folks querying across a spreadsheet but you never knew how contrived the experience might be. I decided to see for myself with a limited dataset how it performed. From this simple dataset it exceeded my expectations, which were low, but it would have exceeded them had they been much&nbsp;higher.</p><p>The Excel spreadsheet was just a very small set of example data I had set up to create pivot charts and reporting for software release metrics. It contained only 9 rows of about 30 data points each. Four of the columns titled “is release delivered”, “is hotfix”, “is planned release”, “was rolled back” represented with values of 1 or 0 existed with other data points such as deployment duration, hotfix lead time and, as mentioned, a few dozen more&nbsp;fields.</p><p>I started with the prompt: “The attached spreadsheet contains release management and deployment data points. It contains metrics such as if a release was successful, if there were rollbacks, the number of hotfixes etc. Using the data how many rollbacks were there? If you don’t know just say you don’t know.” It came back with 1 roll back, which was correct. Next up was to ask it for percentage of planned releases as opposed to hotfixes and rollbacks. Again correct. I asked it for something I can’t get out of a pivot chart but which is easily calculated given a rang of data. “what is the median deployment duration?” Correct, mostly. It said the duration was in days. There are no unit of measure on the data itself but one tab of the spreadsheet contained a data dictionary that said the deployment duration was in hours. It didn’t pick up on that. I asked for a chart of min., max, avg., median values for hotfix lead times. Nailed it. I asked for a modification of the chart to show the values above the bar of each data element. All&nbsp;good.</p><p>Time to give it something a bit more difficult — “compared to any industry averages are the hotfix to planned release ratio good?” I thought a bit and came back with the below and more, but for the core of the response it&nbsp;was:</p><blockquote>Industry Standards: The acceptable ratio of hotfixes to planned releases can vary significantly depending on the industry, the complexity of the software, and the release cadence. In some industries, a lower ratio is ideal as it indicates better initial quality and stability. In fast-paced industries with frequent releases (e.g., agile environments), a higher ratio might be more common.<br>Benchmarking Data: Industry benchmarks often suggest that a well-functioning release process should have more planned releases than hotfixes. For instance, in mature organizations, the ratio of hotfixes to planned releases might be around 1:5 to 1:10, depending on the complexity and maturity of the development and testing processes.<br>Your Ratio: A ratio of 0.6 indicates that there are fewer planned releases compared to the number of hotfixes, which may be higher than industry averages, particularly in environments where stability and quality are prioritized.</blockquote><p>Where it came up with the benchmarking data ratios I have no idea. I suspect it is just as likely a hallucination as based on something. I’ll likely never know. I tried to do some searches for such data and came up empty but it doesn’t mean it’s not out there somewhere implied, derivable, or otherwise. Regardless, it came up with the right idea of how the relationships should&nbsp;be.</p><p>Simple data, simple questions but good results. All in all I was&nbsp;pleased.</p>

<p>This post shows how to implement a Swagger UI using a .NET 9 produced OpenAPI file. The Swagger UI is deployed to a secure or development environment and is not deployed to a public production target. Sometimes, it is required to deploy the Swagger UI to a development deployment target and not the test or the production deployments. The security headers need to be weakened to allow the Swagger UI to work.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/WebApiOpenApi">https://github.com/damienbod/WebApiOpenApi</a></p>



 Setup 



<p>The post uses the OpenAPI Json created by a .NET 9 ASP.NET Core application. See this blog:</p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2024/08/06/implementing-an-asp-net-core-api-with-net-9-and-openapi/">Implementing an ASP.NET Core API with .NET 9 and OpenAPI</a></p>



<p>Two further packages were added to this project, one for the generation of the Swagger UI and the second package to generate the required security headers for an API using JWT Bearer tokens.</p>



 
 Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI 



 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders 
 



<p>The ASP.NET Core API application has already generated the OpenAPI definitions in a Json file. The Json can be used to create the UI. If the application is deployed to production, the Json file is not created and the security headers are deployed with the most restrictions. If the application is deployed for development, the Json is deployed and the security headers are weakened to allow this to work.</p>


  // Open up security restrictions to allow this to work
// Not recommended in production
//var deploySwaggerUI = app.Environment.IsDevelopment();
var deploySwaggerUI = app.Configuration.GetValue&lt;bool&gt;("DeploySwaggerUI");

app.UseSecurityHeaders(
    SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(deploySwaggerUI));

// ... other middleware

app.MapOpenApi("/openapi/v1/openapi.json");

if (deploySwaggerUI)
{
    app.UseSwaggerUI(options =&gt;
    {
        options.SwaggerEndpoint("/openapi/v1/openapi.json", "v1");
    });
}

<p></p>



<p>When the UI is deployed to in development mode, the Swagger UI is displayed and the user can enter a valid access token and use the APIs.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>At present, the Swagger UI does not support script best practices and allowing this to work means deploying an unsecure web application with weak security. Any UI web application should use a strong CSP definition, for example like CSP nonces. An API has no UI and so should be locked down. </p>

<p>At this year’s, <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/">DWebCamp</a>, my friend and
<a href="https://fediforum.org/">collaborator</a>
<a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya aka IdentityWoman</a> and I ran a session titled:</p>

<p>We did something that, at least for me, was new. We started with:</p>
 
 Assume it has happened. We have won. Like on page 1 of a sci-fi story, you wake up in the
morning one day and the world you want is has suddenly arrived. 
 At least 4 billion people interact with each other socially on an open, decentralized
social network. All of the proprietary platforms have much smaller user numbers or have
disappeared entirely; they have stopped mattering. 
 Out of scope: how we get there, or which specific products/standards/technologies are
being used. 
 
<p>We asked the question: “Describe what you see”. People who came to our session had a few
minutes to meditate on that question, and then wrote down their thoughts, one at a time,
on some stickies. They then announced what they wrote and put it on a big sheet of paper.
Below is the electronic version of this paper (minus some items which I could not manage
to decipher when transcribing):</p>
 
 
Community focused and developed by the community
 
 
Hate free zone
 
 
Accessible resources (open  source) for development by anyone
 
 
Message flows automatically (I don’t have to decide who are the recipients)
 
 
biofi.earth for decentralized technology
 
 
Not harmfully powered
 
 
Access to all medical data. Do I want all measurements? Which doctor may see what? How do I manage that?
 
 
Serependipity / surprise me
 
 
Anti-filter bubble
 
 
Multi-modal “of one universe”
 
 
Everything is forkable (in the open-source sense)
 
 
Everything is fully transparent
 
 
Attention management / needs to manage
 
 
Personal and collective sense-making bubble
 
 
Stigmergy / people marking
 
 
How to make the network safe?
 
 
Non-screen-centric
 
 
“Netflix”-like subscription for all: distributed to builders / operators
 
 
New funding models for open source
 
 
Cooperative Attention Economy
 
 
Fed by opt-in-able data sets
 
 
Ability to opt-in/opt-out
 
 
Personal digital exoskeleton / voice-centric
 
 
Not one systems. Highly fragmented (needs are specific)
 
 
A shared collaborative universe, not just “apps”
 
 
Social “digital twin” objects
 
 
Who you are is what you consume: food and information
 
 
Photo gallery
 
 
If it isn’t worth looking at for at least 10 seconds, it isn’t worth any time at all
 
 
Tap to dive in, call, play, study / zoom out to explore and connect
 
 
Non-repetitive
 
 
Profile:
Skills
Expanse
Reviews
Map
Faves
Music
 
 
Corporate news is dead, replaced by emergent editorial boards
 
 
Threats community mapping / fear
 
 
<p>What surprised me most is that there were so many comments that wanted to have a single
“social universe” into which various apps and screens and voice are “windows”", rather than
a single app. That’s very close to the original vision for the world-wide-web, and one
that we’ve largely lost with all the apps we are using every day. But perhaps we can
get it back?</p>
<p>Addition 2024-08-17: two more, which I don’t know how to transcribe.</p>

  Today I released pgxn_meta v0.1.0, a Rust crate and executable for validating
PGXN Meta v1 and v2 META.json files.

<p>Following the recent spate of work drafting <a href="https://rfcs.pgxn.org" title="PGXN RFCs — PGXN Book">RFCs</a> for a <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/2" title="RFC: Binary Distribution Format">binary distribution
format</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/3" title="RFC: Meta Spec v2">Meta Spec v2</a>, and bearing in mind the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/05/pgxn-language-poll-result/" title="PGXN Language Poll Result">vote</a> to
implementing <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGXN_v2">PGXN v2</a> apps in Rust, over the last few weeks I’ve switched
gears to write some code.</p>
<p>First I wrote <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/meta/pull/3" title="Implement JSON Schema for PGXN Meta Spec v1">JSON Schemas for the v1 spec</a> and then wrote a <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/meta/pull/4" title="Fully test schema and fix issues found">full
test suite</a> using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/boon" title="boon JSON Schema Validation crate">boon crate</a>. Next I wrote and tested <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/meta/pull/6" title="Implement v2 Spec JSON Schema">JSON
Schemas for the v2 spec</a>. This process informed revisions to the
<a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/3" title="RFC: Meta Spec v2">RFC</a>, uncovering inconsistencies and unnecessary complexities.</p>
<p>With <code>META.json</code> file JSON Schema validation fully worked up, I decided to
work the functionality into a proper Rust crate and CLI to eventually replace
the old <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/PGXN-Meta-Validator">PGXN::Meta::Validator</a> Perl module and its <code>validate_pgxn_meta</code> CLI.
This turned out to be a decent Rust starter project, requiring a fairly simple
crate and CLI, but also allowed me to develop patterns to build and release
binaries for a variety of platforms and architecture.</p>
<p>As a result, I’m happy to announce the release today of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pgxn_meta" title="pgxn_meta on crates.io">pgxn_meta crate</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/meta/releases/tag/v0.1.0" title="pgxn_meta Release v0.1.0">pgxn_meta CLI v0.1.0</a>, available for download on these platforms,
thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cross-rs/cross" title="“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates">cross</a> and <a href="https://github.com/houseabsolute/actions-rust-cross" title="GitHub Action to compile Rust with cross">houseabsolute/actions-rust-cross</a>:</p>

<p>Download the archive file appropriate to your platform, decompress it, and put
the <code>pgxn_meta</code> (or <code>pgxn_meta.exe</code>) binary in your path. Or use the
<a href="https://github.com/houseabsolute/ubi">universal binary installer (ubi)</a> to install it:</p>
  <code>ubi --project pgxn/meta --exe pgxn_meta --in ~/bin
</code>  <p>And of course you can use <code>cargo</code> to compile it from source:</p>
  <code>cargo install pgxn_meta
</code>  <p>Usage is simple: just run <code>pgxn_meta</code> in a directory containing the
<code>META.json</code> file to validate:</p>
  <code>❯ pgxn_meta 
META.json is OK
</code>  <p>And optionally pass it the name of the file, as in this example parsing a test
file with no <code>version</code> property:</p>
  <code>❯ pgxn_meta corpus/invalid.json 
Error: "corpus/invalid.json jsonschema validation failed with https://pgxn.org/meta/v2/distribution.schema.json#\n- at '': missing properties 'version'"```
</code>  <p>That’s it!</p>
 What’s Next? 
<p>Now that I’ve implemented validation and figured out multi-platform binary
support for Rust apps, my next tasks are to:</p>
 
 Implement a pattern to convert a v1 <code>META.json</code> to the v2 format 
 Create a pattern to merge multiple <code>META.json</code> files into one 
 Write code to build <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> extension into <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/2" title="RFC: Binary Distribution Format">trunk</a> packages 
 Develop patterns to satisfy third-party dependencies for multiple
platforms 
 
<p>Should keep me busy for a few weeks. Updates as I have them.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Court rules Google broke antitrust law, Twitter/X quits San Francisco, Google kills Chromecast, does NVIDIA trains model on Netflix and YouTube videos?</p>  <p>Intel’s rough business outlook and major reorg. It’s a third consecutive year of falling revenue at Intel. The company is reorganizing itself to align with the “foundry model” of the chip-making industry.</p>  <p>Founders of well-funded AI startups keep leaving for Big Tech. Character.ai is the latest AI company founded just 2-3 years ago, to be hollowed out by a brain drain to Big Tech. Is it a sign that AI startups will struggle to monetize, grow, or raise funding?</p>  <p>Buggy app to take Sonos 6 months to fix. The new Sonos app is slow, full of bugs, and unreliable. It took the company 3 months to acknowledge the problem, and now all hands are on deck to fix it. It’s valid to ask how this app ever reached customers.</p>  <p>Fallout of CrowdStrike’s global outage. The security provider is blamed for the mother of all software crashes, last month. But there were several prior cases of operating systems being broken at the kernel level. Now Delta Air Lines is suing for $500M, the reputational damage is vast, and compensation payouts could be devastating.</p>   1. Industry pulse  Google broke law by paying to be default search engine <p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Google, alleging the search giant broke antitrust laws by paying smartphone and browser vendors to be the default search engine on their products and devices. In 2021 alone, Google paid a combined $26B to Apple, Firefox, and other vendors for this, most of which ($18B) went to Apple.</p><p>A judge has now <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rZ1UlL.0yQbo/v0">ruled</a> the agreements were unlawful, stating:</p><blockquote><p>“Google’s monopoly power, maintained by the exclusive distribution agreements, has enabled Google to increase text ads prices without any meaningful competitive constraint.”</p></blockquote><p>There will be a hearing in September to decide what changes to its practices will be mandated for Google. An appeal by the tech giant looks inevitable; but as things stand, it will no longer be able to pay to be the default search engine on other platforms.</p><p>It’s a notable victory for the US regulator, proving that Google has used illegal means to maintain a search monopoly, with the consequence of stifling competition, while increasing its own ad pricing and revenue. It’s currently an open question as to what Google’s argument will be against this judgment – because the ruling appears reasonable and balanced.</p> Twitter/X quits San Francisco

  When should a Postgres extension be pre-loaded and when should it not?
Should it be loaded in user sessions or at server startup? For the Tembo
blog, I dug into this question and wrote up my findings.

<p>The <a href="https://tembo.io/blog" title="Tembo's Blog">Tembo Blog</a> published <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/library-preloading" title="To Preload, or Not to Preload">a post</a> by yours truly last week about when to
preload shared libraries and when not to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently I’ve been trying to figure out when a Postgres extension shared
libraries should be preloaded. By “shared libraries” I mean libraries
provided or used by Postgres extensions, whether <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: LOAD"><code>LOAD</code></a>able libraries or
<code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> libraries written in C or <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>. By “preloaded” I mean
under what conditions should they be added to one of the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD">Shared Library
Preloading</a> variables, especially <code>shared_preload_libraries</code>.</p>
<p>The answer, it turns out, comes very much down to the extension type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I view this post as a kind of proto-chapter for an imagined book about
developing extensions that I’d like to work on someday. I learned quite a lot
researching it and responding to <a href="https://github.com/theory/justatheory/pull/6" title="theory/justatheory#6: Add a post on preloading for extension authors">extensive feedback</a> from more knowledgeable
community members. It resulted in updates to the PGXN Meta <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/blob/7e20662/text/0003-meta-spec-v2.md?plain=1#L513C11-L517" title="PGXN Meta Spec v2 (draft): preload">preload property</a>
that I hope will inform binary distribution in the future. More on that soon.</p>

<p>👋 Hi, this is Gergely with a subscriber-only issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>The Pragmatic Engineer is back after a week-and-a-half’s summer vacation. Things are usually slower during this summer break period – recruitment included – since recruiters and candidates take holidays, too! Also, headcount for the first half of the year (H1) has usually been filled by now, while H2 headcount is often finalized during August, with hiring kicking off in earnest in September.</p><p>But this summer has been different. A subscriber based in New York pinged me, sharing what they’ve seen:</p><blockquote><p>“As a software developer, I've noticed a slight uptick in recruiter activity in the last month or two. I initially dismissed it, but another developer mentioned noticing an increase in LinkedIn recruiter mail, primarily from smaller startups. I was wondering if you've heard of this, [and] if you'd do a piece shedding light on this phenomenon and its causes.”</p></blockquote><p>This piqued my interest and I asked around, messaging more than 40 tech professionals. This revealed an interesting phenomenon: recruitment for software engineers and related disciplines did spike in June and July, defying the conventional pattern.</p><p>We cover this topic in this issue, addressing:</p>  <p>US uptick. Interest from recruiters up on the East and West Coasts.</p>  <p>More UK and EU inbounds. The uptick in Europe is especially interesting, given the summer holidays are longer there, and recruitment is typically lower at this time.</p>  <p>Why an uptick now? Hiring managers and executives share why their companies are hiring more. There are several reasons.</p>  <p>Product and design. Some uptick in recruiter interest for these areas, too.</p>  <p>Reality check. Some companies are not hiring more, and plenty of engineers aren’t seeing more responses.</p>  <p>Appendix: other regions. Data points from the Nordics, Central Europe, India, Latin America, and Israel.</p>   1. US uptick <p>Below are some personal reports from engineering managers, software engineers, and data/ML engineers, who have observed the recruitment uptick. All shared their observations directly with me, and the responses are anonymized.</p> US East Coast <p>Early-stage startups, AI startups, and hedge funds seem to have accelerated hiring in the past few months, based on readers’ first-hand accounts:</p><p>An engineering manager (EM) at Big Tech, 10 years of experience (YOE), based in New York City (NYC):</p><blockquote><p>“I have noticed an uptick in recruiting messages over the past month. These are mostly from early startups looking to hire for Head of Engineering positions, or AI startups looking for an Engineering Manager or Tech Lead. Also, it seems like finance headhunters are unusually active at the moment.”</p></blockquote><p>Tech Lead, 8 YOE, NYC:</p><blockquote><p>“I've been receiving an uptick in recruiter messages related to AI and scaleups. Even more of the ‘usual’ hedge fund recruiters have been active in the past few months.”</p></blockquote><p>Senior ML Engineer, startup, 7 YOE, Boston:</p><blockquote><p>“I've been noticing inbounds ratcheting up since April to the point that I had to turn off my ‘open to work’ settings on LinkedIn. I am still getting a decent amount of inbound, even with the setting turned off. It's definitely not like the peak late-2021-2022 frenzy (something I'd be surprised to see again) but it’s similar to – maybe higher than – the pre-Covid status quo.</p><p>My inbounds are largely from startups, but most of my experience is working in early stage startups, so there is a potential confounder in me!”</p></blockquote><p>Senior Engineer, startup, 5 YOE, NYC:</p><blockquote><p>“I’ve noticed that in the past month, there have been relatively more recruiters reaching out. As context, I've been looking for jobs since May. At the same time, out of all of the applications I've sent, only one company started the interview process with me.”</p></blockquote><p>Software engineer, ex-Big Tech, 10 YOE Seattle:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“I got laid off in May. Since then, I have been reached out to by recruiters from Amazon, Bytedance, and various consultancies. After I upgraded to Linkedin Premium, there has been an uptick in reach-outs from recruiters on Linkedin. I’m still unsure if the uptick could be attributed to this change, or if the market is getting better.”</p></blockquote><p>Companies are seeing offer acceptance rates dropping, which is one indicator that it’s a bit more of an “employee’s market” than we’ve been used to in the recent past. From a director of engineering at a publicly traded tech company in Boston:</p><blockquote><p>“While our hiring slowed slightly, our rate of hiring has been relatively steady over the past 2 years. For experienced roles, 6 months ago our offer acceptance rates were close to 100%, now they're at 75% or lower, for roughly the same offers, compensation-wise. Definitely feels like a thaw in the job market to me.”</p></blockquote> US West Coast <p>AI startups, startups, and mid-sized tech companies, seem to be increasing their recruitment pace. Readers’ observations:</p><p>Senior software engineer (ex-Big Tech), at a scaleup, 10 YOE, San Francisco (SF):</p><blockquote><p>“There has been an influx from AI startups for sure, and some regular startups, but I am now seeing mid-size and large companies reaching out too, with very few public companies reaching out.”</p></blockquote><p>Senior engineer, publicly traded tech company, SF, 8 YOE:</p><blockquote><p>“I've left my profile as "Open to work" for the last 4-5 months. This month (July), I've gotten a significant amount of inbounds from internal and external recruiters:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13c8b14f-6b5a-45ab-a07e-a78a6a8491d0_1406x1034.png">    </a>Inbound recruiter messages to a senior engineer at a publicly traded tech company in SF </blockquote><p>Tech lead, Big Tech, 10 YOE, SF:</p><blockquote><p>“My observation on the hiring uptick is that it isn’t just startups / scaleups. I'm starting to get more messages from the likes of Airbnb and Snowflake.”</p></blockquote><p>Software engineer, 2 YOE, Los Angeles (LA):</p><blockquote><p>“I had a recruiter from a startup reach out right after I announced my promotion, and another one via direct email. As someone with less than 2 years experience, that was very encouraging.”</p></blockquote> Rest of the US <p>Startups and some mid-size and larger tech companies have been reaching out more, nationwide.</p><p>Senior frontend engineer, Big Tech, 15 YOE, western US:</p><blockquote><p>“I have seen an uptick — and not just from startups! I've had reachouts from Datadog and TikTok in the past month. A few more than usual from my local market as well (Utah, which has a budding tech economy) that are higher quality than I normally see. Hopefully, this is evidence of a normalizing tech job market! “</p></blockquote><p>Senior software engineer, startup, 8 YOE, midwest US:</p><blockquote><p>“Recruiter messages to me on LinkedIn have absolutely picked up. I noticed because my inbox was pretty dead for the last year. Mostly startups, but 1 friend also sent me a job description for a position at GitHub as well.”</p></blockquote><p>Director of data science, consultancy, 7 YOE northwest US:</p><blockquote><p>“I have had an uptick in legitimate outreach. A few months ago it was dry, but it has suddenly gotten better.”</p></blockquote><p>Lead engineer, startup, 6 YOE, western US:</p><blockquote><p>“I categorized reach outs into three categories:</p>  <p>“Relevant” jobs are exactly my niche or current stack.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Almost relevant” jobs are outside my niche, or related to stacks I've used in the past.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Irrelevant” are totally off-base stacks, or things that look like spam/mass messages.</p>  </blockquote><p>Here’s the “relevant” reach outs this person has received in 2024:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfa22bcd-65de-406e-9528-086039682c8e_1426x1026.png">    </a>Relevant recruiter messages to a full remote, lead engineer at a startup, western US <p>Software architect, publicly traded company, 15 YOE, southern central US:</p><blockquote><p>“I’m getting a lot of requests for interviews on LinkedIn lately. My inbox had been quiet for a long time, I probably received more recruiters messages in the last couple of weeks than the last 4 months.”</p></blockquote><p>Software engineer, 2 YOE, southwestern US</p><blockquote><p>“It's been pretty much a drought for the last two months; about one message a month. I did get a message from a new founder last week which led to a good conversation, though he won't be making any hiring decisions for at least another month. It sounded like he got a decently large block of funding, but is being extra cautious about where and how he deploys it.</p><p>In the past, namely 2021-2023, I was getting multiple messages per week, sometimes per day.”</p></blockquote> 2. More UK and EU inbounds <p>Recruiters in Europe take longer summer vacations than in the US, which makes the increase in recruitment activity across Europe eye-catching. Here’s what I’ve heard from tech professionals in these markets.</p> UK <p>Startups, finance companies, scaleups, and AI companies, seem to have increased recruitment reach outs in the last few months, according to some first-hand accounts:</p><p>Engineering manager, Big Tech, 15 YOE:</p><blockquote><p>“I have observed an increase in reach outs from recruiters.</p><p>At work, I now also get a higher number of interview requests popping in my work calendar: 2-3 a week, vs 2-3 a month, 6-12 months ago. These interviews are all for L5+ (senior-and-above levels.)</p><p>I suppose we’re perhaps seeing the green shoots after a bleak 18-24 months. Or it might be temporary due to ‘AI hype’ (my company is investing in AI, big time!) Time will tell!”</p></blockquote><p>Software engineer, publicly traded tech company, 10 YOE:</p><blockquote><p>“The recruiter messages never dried up – they’ve been coming fairly regularly and (at least here in London) they’ve been a mix of startups, finance companies, and the occasional pre-IPO scale up. The only thing missing is Big Tech – save for Meta and Amazon, both of which have been fairly active.”</p></blockquote><p>Staff software engineer, scaleup 15 YOE:</p><blockquote><p>“I can confirm that I’ve seen an uptick in recruiter messages and with lower importance connection requests. I generally haven’t put effort into my LinkedIn profile, so for the past year it’s been rather quiet. Recently, I’ve gotten noticeably more ‘template’ recruitment messages than before.”</p></blockquote><p>Senior backend engineer, 10 YOE:</p><blockquote><p>“I’m seeing way more recruiter inbound activity over the past month or two. Mostly in fintech and climate tech in my case. Inbound is still limited to hybrid, or fully in person roles, which is acceptable to me. Willingness to sponsor visas still seems to be lacking in the inbound roles, which indicates to me there’s still some softness in the UK market.”</p></blockquote><p>Senior ML Engineer at a Big Tech, 8 YOE:</p><blockquote><p>“I have seen a huge uptick in reach outs from recruiters. This is largely smaller companies, but also includes top tier companies recently including OpenAI, Anthropic and Jane Street.”</p></blockquote><p>ML engineer, publicly traded tech company, 5 YOE:</p><blockquote><p>“There is an absolute uptick of recruiter inbound messages. In the last two months, the job specs have suddenly started flowing again. This is particularly true in my area of work in the MLOps / ML Platform space. The market for that is better than it was before the end of zero percent interest rates, mainly because it's a new skill market.”</p></blockquote><p>Senior data scientist, 5 YOE:</p><blockquote><p>“I have my profile as ‘not looking’ and had several approaches in the last few weeks (above normal.)”</p></blockquote> Western Europe <p>Driving the hiring uptick seems to be startups and scaleups raising funding, mid-size companies, and some larger companies. Observations from a senior engineer, 8 YOE, Switzerland:</p><blockquote><p>“I got around 4-5 messages from various recruiters in the past 1.5 weeks, which wasn’t the case in the last few months! Most are from startups and small/mid-sized companies”</p></blockquote><p>Senior engineer, 7 YOE, Switzerland:</p><blockquote><p>“I am seeing an uptick in inbound messages from recruiters. Until recently, it was one per week or less. Around a third are from crypto startups, the rest are mid-to-large scaleups. None are from Big Tech.”</p></blockquote><p>Staff engineer, scaleup, 10 YOE, the Netherlands:</p><blockquote><p>“I am seeing an increase in reach outs in the last 2 months. This is mostly from larger companies, and some from startups.”</p></blockquote><p>Software engineer, 5 YOE, the Netherlands:</p><blockquote><p>“I have recently set my profile as ‘open to work.’ Although I don't have any big names in my profile and I switched technologies, I still get on average an inbound request from a recruiter every day, even weekends!</p></blockquote><p>Data engineer, 3 YOE, France:</p><blockquote><p>“I'm receiving some more reach outs recently, but not that much compared to previous months. The difference is in the quality of the offers: scaleup reach outs are back, but not as intense as 3 years ago.”</p></blockquote><p>Based on readers’ feedback, it seems that something changed in several countries’ recruitment markets around 2 months ago:</p><p>Backend engineer, 15 YOE, Germany:</p><blockquote><p>“In the spring, I was let go from my company, together with my whole team. As I was browsing job portals, I saw surprisingly few software engineer job postings, but a lot of DevOps openings. So I started to apply for DevOps positions instead.</p><p>Fast forward to June, and software engineer listings were back in larger numbers. Since then, I managed to land a backend engineer position, and I’m starting my new job in September.”</p></blockquote><p>Frontend engineer at a full-remote tech startup, France:</p><blockquote><p>“Definitely seeing a lot more recruiter interest for roles that are actually not bad. It had died down last year, but it's been picking up for 2-3 months now.”</p></blockquote><p>Software test architect, 15 YOE, the Netherlands:</p><p>“I confirm that I started to get messages from recruiters in the last 1-2 months.”</p><p>Engineering director, 10 YOE, publicly traded tech company, Germany:</p><blockquote><p>“My anecdotal evidence is we’re seeing an increase in the last 2 months. In my inbox there is a healthy mix of messages from start-ups/scale-ups that have closed a funding round, established companies, and headhunters trying to fill confidential roles. There is a clear uptick of messages related to startups with fresh funding.”</p></blockquote><p>Data engineer, 4 YOE, Germany:</p><blockquote><p>“Definitely something is moving, received 10 messages in the last 20 days for data engineer roles in startups (in Berlin, or remote in Germany). This is around a 10x increase: I got only 2 messages in previous 3 months (April to June.)”</p></blockquote><p>Hiring for principal, staff and tech lead roles is new to some readers. Two engineers mentioned they were surprised by reach outs for these roles, which was not the case even in 2022! A principal software engineer at a publicly traded company with 15 YOE, said:</p><blockquote><p>“Startups and scaleups started to reach out for principal/staff engineering and tech lead roles seemingly out of the blue, a month or two ago. I get around one reachout per week, after months of nothing. The interesting part is that in 2020-2023 my title was the same, but I only got senior engineer roles as inbound, not principal ones like now.”</p></blockquote><p>Despite the uptick, it’s still hard to get an interview. A director of engineering at a publicly traded tech company in the Netherlands, shared:</p><blockquote><p>“I've definitely seen an uptick in recruitment messages, as well as callbacks from recruiters.</p><p>Even from senior people, I hear that even for very strong job matches they don't even get a call back. No first call, nothing. Just straight up rejection. But this also seems to have improved with a lot more companies being open to at least the first chat.</p><p>One common feedback I hear from friends and colleagues, even senior people or from FAANG, is that even the big ones are hiring too (Uber, Booking, Meta, Adyen, etc.) Still, you get an instant rejection, not even a first call; when a couple of years ago you would always get at least the first call.”</p></blockquote> Southern Europe <p>VC-funded and pre-IPO companies seem to have hastened recruitment in the last two months:</p><p>Security engineer, scaleup, 15 YOE, Spain:</p><blockquote><p>“I can confirm that in the last two months I have received more messages from companies and recruiters offering a job, compared to the last 2 years! All the companies are VC backed, and Series A, or pre-IPO stage. So it looks like there is an interest in growth again.”</p></blockquote><p>Senior engineering manager at a US scaleup, 20 YOE, Italy:</p><blockquote><p>“I see an uptick from Series B/A startups and local companies (many hybrid, a few full remote, and one or two office based). A few come from public tech companies. Unfortunately, a few are recruiters just collecting CVs.</p><p>All in all, it seems like the market is back to pre-Covid days.”</p></blockquote><p>Tech lead, scaleup, 10 YOE, Spain</p><blockquote><p>“I can confirm – I'm not sure why! – there's been a spike in the offers received during the last 3-4 weeks. Most are startups.”</p></blockquote><p>Parts of southern Europe could be seeing more interest due to the lower cost of employing software professionals in the region. A tech lead at a scaleup in Portugal notes that several companies are moving their engineering to the country, or expanding current teams there:</p><blockquote><p>“Last week, I got 10 (!!) inbound recruiter messages in just a day. Usually, I get this many over a week or more. Something is happening.</p><p>50% of messages are from startups. The rest is a mix of mid-size companies and established big companies (the smallest portion.) As context, in Portugal a big portion of companies recruiting are moving here. Either starting to build their IT hubs or reinforcing the existing team.”</p></blockquote><p>For context, Portugal is especially popular in tech recruitment as a gateway to hire and relocate software professionals from Brazil – the world’s 7th largest country by population, with 215M people.</p> 3. Why an uptick now?

<p>This post implements a basic ASP.NET Core API using .NET 9 and the Microsoft OpenAPI implementation. The OpenAPI Nuget package supports both Controller based APIs and minimal APIs. Until now, we used excellent solutions like <a href="https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag">NSwag</a> to produce the API schemas which can be used to auto-generate client code.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/WebApiOpenApi">https://github.com/damienbod/WebApiOpenApi</a></p>



 Setup 



<p>A .NET 9 project can be created using the .NET Web API templates. The required SDKs or Visual Studio version needs to be installed. The OpenAPI Json definitions can be created using the Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi Nuget package. Microsoft learn docs have all the different possibilities for implementing this depending on your preferred development environment. Here’s an example using powershell:</p>


  Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi -IncludePrerelease
  


<p>JWT OAuth authorization is used in this example for the API. I installed the following packages:</p>



 
 Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi 



 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer 



 Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server 
 



<p>The OpenAPI services are added to the project. The API uses JWT Bearer and OAuth and so the OpenAPI definitions should also add this. An BearerSecuritySchemeTransformer implementation was created like in the Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/aspnetcore-openapi">documentation</a>.</p>


  builder.Services.AddOpenApi(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddDocumentTransformer&lt;BearerSecuritySchemeTransformer&gt;();
});
  


<p>The BearerSecuritySchemeTransformer class implements the OpenAPI specific definitions. If using cookies, only the document.Info is required and this can be added directly in the services without an extra class. From the Microsoft docs:</p>


  internal sealed class BearerSecuritySchemeTransformer(IAuthenticationSchemeProvider authenticationSchemeProvider) : IOpenApiDocumentTransformer
{
    public async Task TransformAsync(OpenApiDocument document, OpenApiDocumentTransformerContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var authenticationSchemes = await authenticationSchemeProvider.GetAllSchemesAsync();
        if (authenticationSchemes.Any(authScheme =&gt; authScheme.Name == "Bearer"))
        {
            var requirements = new Dictionary&lt;string, OpenApiSecurityScheme&gt;
            {
                ["Bearer"] = new OpenApiSecurityScheme
                {

<p>The middleware needs to be added to the pipeline. You should only add the OpenAPI in development mode unless you require this in production.</p>


  app.MapOpenApi("/openapi/v1/openapi.json");
  


<p>ASP.NET Core supports two types of API implementations; Controller based and minimal APIs. Controller based APIs are used in this project. This API endpoint requires a valid access token and have the different Endpoint definitions. </p>


  [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "Bearer")]
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class WeatherForecastController(
	ILogger&lt;WeatherForecastController&gt; _logger) : ControllerBase
{
    [EndpointSummary("This is a summary from OpenApi attributes.")]

    [HttpGet("GetWeatherForecast")]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        _logger.LogDebug("GetWeatherForecast with OpenAPI definitions");

        return Ok(Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index =&gt; new WeatherForecast
        {
            Date = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddDays(index)),
            TemperatureC = Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),
            Summary = Summaries[Random.Shared.Next(Summaries.Length)]
        })
        .ToArray());
    }
  


<p>You can also add definitions for POSTs and parameters or whatever you require. </p>


  [EndpointSummary("This is a second summary from OpenApi attributes.")]
[EndpointDescription("This is a second description from OpenApi attributes.")]
[Produces(typeof(IEnumerable&lt;WeatherForecast&gt;))]
[HttpPost("PostWeatherForecast")]
public IActionResult PostWeatherForecast(
    [Description("parameter post item using OpenApi")] WeatherForecast weatherForecast)
{
    return Ok(weatherForecast);
}
  


<p></p>



<p>When the application is started, the Json OpenAPI definitions can be downloaded and used.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>I am not sure how good the OpenAPI specifications are and need to validate how to define the different status codes in the specifications with the correct return types.</p>

A ChatGPT generated image<p>I decided to do some retrieval augmented generation(RAG) with Llama 3.1 8B to see how it went. In short, it went pretty well with my limited testing. More interesting is probably how I set it up to perform the&nbsp;RAG.</p><p>First, I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel. Not yet. I was looing for a way to provide RAG with Llama 3.1 without coding up a user interface for embedding multiple documents and creating chat bot that would use those embeddings. The combination I created was <a href="https://anythingllm.com/">AnythingLLM </a>and <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a> backed by Llama 3.1 8B Instruct q_8&nbsp;model.</p><p>I ran LM Studio as a server using Llama 3.1 underneath. Ran AnythingLLM as a front end to the AnythingLLM embedder and the AnythingLLM provided LanceDB vector store with the combined set pointing to LM Studio server as the LLM provider.</p><p>For AnythingLLM you can then create workspaces that allow for document embedding for that workspace into the vector store. I tried out a doc I was especially curious to chat across as it was both a large PDF and a topic of political and policy interest — the 900+ page Project 2025 “manifesto”. It took 3 minutes for it to create the embedding. I am not sure how many dimensions it embeds but AnythingLLM will show you how many vectors it creates. In this case 5038 which is smaller that I would have expected for 900 pages. It does provide some basic settings around embedding; you can set the chunk size as up to 1000 characters and the overlap (in characters). I used the default which was the maximum of 1000 character chunk size and an overlap of 20. At first I though the overlap was in percentage but it states it is in characters, not tokens or percentage. I am suspicious that 20 character overlap is really enough for the best context and may play with that. That seems a really small number to me; I know Microsoft on their embedding guidance recommends 10% to start&nbsp;with.</p><p>You can also select your embedding model. I have so far only tried the AnythingLLM Embedder but I will likely try other local embedding models and probably Azure OpenAI as I have access to that via my Azure&nbsp;account.</p><p>After setting up my environment I took a workspace I had created and uploaded the Project 2025 document and began to query. My first query was about IVF and it reported back that there was no mention of IVF but did provide a very general description of the the document as a whole. So I decided to drill in a little more deeply and asked about rights of embryo’s and fetuses. It came back with what seemed to be a response I would have expected from the document. That’s when I realized one issue with my test. I hadn’t read the document so I didn’t really know if it provided an accurate analysis. Based on the results it seemed to likely be accurate but I couldn’t be certain. In the image below you can’t see my initial prompt but it was “You are a society and government policy analyst. What does the 2025 Mandate For Leadership say about&nbsp;IVF?”</p><p>This lead me to a different test.</p><p>I created a new workspace and added a document that I was familiar enough with. I could have added it to the existing workspace but wanted to keep a separation for testing purposes. The document uploaded was 43 pages. I didn’t notice how long it took to create the vectors but it did end up with 177 as the vector account. Again, lower than I would have expected.</p><p>I asked it what should have been a pretty softball question about the 10 principles of SSI (self-sovereign identity). The embedded document specifically summarizes them. Keep in mind that it could use the Llama model and/or the document provided. I didn’t restrict/suggest it to using just the document that had been embedded in the vector database. It came back again with what seemed to be a valid response. What I now need to do is compare the document to the inferences and see if there was hallucination or how much it may or may not have mixed the RAG with the underlying Llama model values. It does provide a citation and listed the document, but I don’t know if that means all the inference came from the document or if maybe just some of the inference came from the cited work. I would expect it to mean the latter and thus 1–100% of what it responded was from the document. I may never know the answer to that question. I do know when I created yet another workspace with no document and provided the same prompt it did come back with some responses that I knew were not quite accurate. The inference when it had the RAG was definitely more accurate.</p><p>The “thinking” and the returned tokens/sec were slow but this is running on a local machine with very limited horsepower. (If you wish to see the machine specs check out a prior post “<a href="https://m-ruminer.medium.com/started-llama-3-1-8b-locally-5bab61180a28">Started Llama 3.1 8B Locally</a>”). If I had an OpenAI API account I’d likely try it out against that LLM endpoint with the RAG and see how it performed, but I currently don’t. Perhaps I can do that in Azure as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Keep in mind I had to upload the documents for RAG individually. I don’t see an option to point it to a folder and let it walk the folder recursively. AnythingLLM does say on the upload screen that it “supports text files, csv’s, spreadsheets, audio files, and more!” I’ll have to test it out on some of those items. You can also add website URLs and it has a data connector tab for some other inputs — see the below&nbsp;image.</p><p>All in all, it behaved as I would have hoped for the environment. It is after all only an 8 billion parameter LLM model. AnythingLLM gave me a lot of flexibility with very little effort and turned my LM Studio server into something more than just the underlying Llama&nbsp;3.1.</p><p>Oh I didn’t mention AnythingLLM also has some nature of agent support. I’ll certainly be trying that out in the&nbsp;future.</p>

<p>While writing in private feels liberating, as I can dump every little thought in my head into an archive, I find myself missing the more structured and thought-out articles I used to push myself to publish.</p>
<p>There’s something magical about writing down your thoughts and sharing them with the world, even if nobody sees them. It forces you to rethink your position, clarify your thoughts, and distill the mess in your head into something direct and actionable.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I have missed that feeling, and the itch to continue writing has returned.</p>
<p>All this is simply to say that I’m writing again. The title of my website has always been “Random Thoughts of a Happy Programmer,” so please stay tuned for more of my innermost thoughts and experiments.</p>

<p>I started a load of Llama 3.1 8B onto my local machine. It’s not the beefiest model but is the model that I could support on my aging machine and GPU. I have not yet had time to play with it but this is step one of a multi step experiment.</p><p>It took me less than 30 minutes to get up and running and that is an estimate on the far end. The bulk of that time was deciding if a specific tool was supported on my machine. I needed to make sure my processor had AVX2 support. Once I got over that hurdle it was easy peasy. I decided not to start with Ollama simply because <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a> intrigued me, and I liked the interface for adjusting parameters right in the interface plus the more pleasing interaction experience than just the command line. LM Studio allowed me to install in minutes, select a chat interface, or server, and then provided the interface which allowed me to select which of the models I have installed and I was off and running for a chat session to begin with. The response time was good and returned output at about as fast as I could read&nbsp;it.</p><p>Why the 8B model? Simply because I don’t have the machine specs to run the 70B. You really need multiple terabytes of SSD storage, a much better GPU, and twice as much RAM at a minimum. The 8B is more than sufficient for me to start testing agent creation and execution.</p> My Machine Specs For the&nbsp;8B <p>As an example of the machine specs I was able to get the 8B running under with very reasonable performance.</p>  i7–107000k processor at 3.8&nbsp;GHz  16 GB&nbsp;RAM  Nvidia GTX 1060 with 6GB of&nbsp;RAM  <p>I have a MacBook as well but it is a 2019 MacBook with an Intel processor. Llama 3.1 only supports M1+ processors.</p> 70B Machine&nbsp;Specs <p>According to the 8B model, when asked, the 70B model&nbsp;needs:</p>  Processor: i7 or higher with 8 cores and 16 threads.<br>- So not much required in the CPU department.  GPU: A high-end NVIDIA GeForce or Quadro GPU with at least 24 GB of VRAM (e.g., GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or Quadro RTX&nbsp;8000).  Memory: At least 64 GB of RAM, preferably 128 GB or more.<br>– This will ensure that you have sufficient memory to handle the model’s massive parameter count (70 billion parameters) and other system resources. <br>- Not sure I’ll ever have machine with 128 GB of&nbsp;RAM  A high-speed storage drive with a large capacity (at least 1&nbsp;TB)

<p>When explaining the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model (VC)</a>, <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0">Open Badges 3.0</a>, and <a href="https://lermap.t3networkhub.org/">LERs</a>, I’m often asked about the role of blockchain and if I’m not asked, I feel compelled to explain because misconceptions and confusion are common. Blockchain is one of those technologies that is at once fascinating and cringey, useful and over-used. The business models are still experimental and when it comes down to it, there are simpler, more efficient, and more affordable methods for issuing data rich portable, verifiable digital credentials that meet the needs of issuers, give learners and earners easy access to their data, and a private way to prove that their digitally-signed achievements are theirs for as long as they need&nbsp;them.</p><p>You could say that I’ve spent some time thinking about this. In 2015, I co-founded a group called <a href="http://badgechain.com/">BadgeChain</a> with other Open Badges community members that explored how Open Badges could be more verifiable and have clearer provenance if stored on blockchain. This coincided with Philipp Schmidt and Kim Hamilton Duffy’s leadership on <a href="http://badgechain.com/?s=blockcerts">Blockcerts</a>, an open specification for issuing Open Badges on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Learning Machine continued with this work, which was later acquired by <a href="https://www.hyland.com/en/products/hyland-experience-credentials">Hyland</a>. In 2020 I was the lead researcher on the <a href="https://www.acenet.edu/Research-Insights/Pages/Education-Blockchain-Initiative.aspx">Education and Blockchain initiative</a> with the American Council on Education and the US Department of Education where we reported on the potential uses of blockchain and then supported several projects that used blockchain or blockchain-like technology for education and training credentials.</p><p>I truly believed that we were creating the future and would help society by leveraging what seemed like an obvious use of distributed digital ledgers but what we all learned from this&nbsp;was:</p>  Blockchains are expensive and energy-sucky ways to store and verify credentials  It’s a headache to explain to and request public keys from credential recipients  Storing data on a blockchain (especially long-living ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum), even when <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-hashing/">hashed</a>, is risky for PII (Personal Identifiable Information) and means that once it’s on a chain, it can’t be changed or removed. So, if any mistakes are made or data has changed, there’s no way to remove&nbsp;it.  It can create a vendor lock for the issuer and the recipient. When the vendor/network goes away, where do those credentials go?  It doesn’t free data trapped in centralized silos. It creates new types of&nbsp;silos.  <p>During this time and since, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group at W3C (CCG)</a> started developing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VC)</a>. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">use cases</a> for this were originally sourced from the members of Open Badges community in 2017. The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">W3C Verifiable Credentials for Education Task Force</a> was founded soon after by the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC)</a> and it was this task force which agreed to propose Open Badges 3.0 to 1EdTech in 2021. Now <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0">Open Badges 3.0</a> is final and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">W3C VC 2.0</a> is almost complete.</p><p>Issuing Open Badges 3.0 is not only about how the achievement is described or the structure of the metadata. The metadata is a critical component to the standard but the bigger upgrade is the alignment to W3C VCs so that digital education credentials like badges, micro-credentials, certifications, and even degrees could be stored, shared, verified, and used on the web in the same secure way as <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">driver’s licenses</a> and <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2024/07/09/feature-article-question-who-you-are">citizenship documents</a> that are also issued as W3C VCs. The intention is for all of these credentials to be understandable and verified similarly so that they can be used together.</p><p>W3C VCs are cryptographically verifiable, meaning that verfiers can check via software that the data hasn’t changed since it’s been signed, validate the identity of the issuer, and confirm that the credential hasn’t expired or been revoked. They are digitally signed by the issuer and provided to the credential earner. From that point on, that credential belongs to the earner and whatever they do with it is their business only. It may be that issuers ask if earners are willing to tell them where they use their credentials, but inherently, the basic premise of VCs is that they can be used independently. Just because the data is sourced from the issuer does not mean how that data is used should be shared with the issuer if the earners don’t consent. Would you want the DMV to know every time you share your driver’s license? Should the DMV get paid if you use your driver’s license? Even if it was digital? Why should it be any different for education and training credentials?</p><p>Admittedly, there are interesting blockchain models to explore that are adjacent to or support W3C VCs and Open Badges 3.0. For example, we’re just starting to touch upon the usefulness of issuer registries and blockchain could be useful there; blockchain-like technologies like <a href="https://flur.ee/">Fluree</a> are fueling systems like the <a href="https://tln.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network (TLN)</a> where distributed nodes of data can be accessed by students and alumni to produce VCs; systems like <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic </a>and <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> can be used for longevity and distribution of evidence and supporting files; some <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifier methods</a> that use blockchain are being tested around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>A model where verifiers pay to access and verify credentials in a tokenized blockchain system compromises the privacy of the credential recipients and traps their credentials in a closed network. In the end, it’s the credential earners that get forced into a closed system where others could profit from their credentials that represent the investment of their time, work, and money. Also, what’s the incentive for verifiers to pay tokens for access to credentials when they could evaluate and accept other credentials on the web for&nbsp;free?</p><p>That is the opposite of the intention of W3C Verifiable Credentials and Open Badges 3.0. At the DCC along with many others, we promote the use of W3C VCs as distinct entities of digitally signed achievements that are in the hands of those who earn them, who choose how to use them, and who or what can have access to them. We need to make it easier and affordable for verifiers to get onboard and understand how VCs and Open Badges work so that they become commonplace and useful on the web for everyone.</p><p>For more information on the DCC, including membership, projects, and events, visit our <a href="http://digitalcredentials.mit.edu">website</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/">wiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dccconsortium">Linkedin</a>.

<p>The Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) is advancing the use and understanding of portable, verifiable digital credentials in higher education through open source technology development and leadership, research, and advocacy. What are portable, verifiable digital credentials and why is it important that we advance their&nbsp;use?</p><p>Digital credentials at their most basic definition are electronic assets that describe an achievement or a qualification. <a href="https://credreg.net/ctdl/handbook#credential">Credential Engine’s Credential Transparency Description Language Handbook</a> describes a credential as “A qualification, achievement, personal or organizational quality, or aspect of an identity typically used to indicate suitability”. There are many different <a href="https://credreg.net/ctdl/handbook#credentialtypes">credential types</a> that can be used in education, training, and industry as learning and employment records (LERs) to describe achievements and provide details on related skills and competencies.</p><p>When referring to credentials as “portable” and “verifiable” we are indicating that they have been created in alignment with the key web standards that are used to issue digitally signed, metadata rich digital credentials. The <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/app/page/1b808YBAgwQgD8omWIWcyUb193SW2MvG3Fs5XCX7wHyE">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC) standard</a> is the web standard for digital signatures and proving claims made on the web. <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/standards/open-badges">Open Badges 3.0</a> is a standard conformant with W3C Verifiable Credentials that is specifically tailored to issue education and experience digital credentials. Both standards result in distinct electronic assets that can be held by individuals in wallets or other storage to be used&nbsp;later.</p><p>Through its participation in community standards organizations including the W3C and 1Edtech, the DCC has helped to develop these standards and is advancing their use and understanding so that individuals may have more access to their data and have the agency to freely and privately share and use their credentials. To accomplish this, the DCC is advocating that issuers of digital credentials use software and vendors that prioritize the use of the LER VC standards. Our members are issuing micro-credentials and even degrees as Open Badges and W3C Verifiable Credentials so that their students and alumni can have digitally signed, data rich markers of achievement that describe what they know and can do that are usable anywhere on the web (and in the world) for their lifetimes.</p><p>For more information on the DCC, including membership, projects, and events, visit our <a href="http://digitalcredentials.mit.edu">website</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/">wiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dccconsortium">Linkedin</a>.

<p>If you don’t live in a swing state, but would like to do more than just send money to help encourage voter turnout in those places, what are your options? For me the best one is <a href="https://votefwd.org/">Vote Forward</a>, which orchestrates letter-writing to registered voters. I sent hundreds of such letters in 2020 and am aiming to do lots more, with help from friends, this time around.</p>
<p>Even if I lived in a swing state, I’m not someone who’d be comfortable knocking on doors. And the last thing I want to do is pester people in those places with yet another unwanted phone call or text message. The Vote Forward method is perfect for me personally, and I also think it’s the most clever and sensible way to encourage voters in other states. Here’s how it works.</p>
<p>You “adopt” voters in batches of 5 or 20. I just adopted my first 100: 20 in each of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Hampshire, and North Carolina. You download each batch as a PDF that prints 21 pages. Page one has the instructions and the list of registered voters’ names and addresses</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fact that you write the letters (and address the envelopes) by hand is a great idea. We receive very few hand-addressed letters nowadays, I think they have a pretty good chance of being opened. And once opened, the hand-written message is again unusual. The fact that somebody made the effort to do that signals a rare kind of authenticity.</p>
<p>Likewise, I think the nonpartisan tone of the message is unusual and conveys authenticity. I wish voting were mandatory in the US, as it is in Australia and elsewhere. However the chips fall in November, I would like to know that the result truly reflects what everyone thinks. My message last time was something like:</p>
<p>“… because it’s not really a democracy unless everyone’s voice is heard.”</p>
<p>Pages 2-21 are the letter templates. They look like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The hardest part for me was the handwriting. I famously struggled with cursive writing in fifth grade. By the time I reached high school I had reverted to printing. Then, in college, I realized that cursive is more efficient and relearned how to do it. I had to relearn all over again in 2020 because cursive was the fastest way to write all those letters. And I’ll probably have to relearn again this time. I suspect many in younger generations never learned cursive at all, in which case writing the letters by hand will be even harder. So: keep the message short!</p>
<p>If you’ve received a link to this post directly from me, it’ll come with an invitation to drop by our house, hang out on the porch, and help me complete batches of these letters. Otherwise, I hope you might try this method yourself, and/or share it with others. In the past week I’ve switched from doomscrolling to hopescrolling and that’s a huge relief. But I also want to do something tangible (again, beyond donations) and this will be my focus. It feels good to do the work, and will feel really good when I visit the post office sometime in October and drop off a big stack of hand-addressed envelopes. </p>
<p>But is it effective? That’s another thing I like about Vote Forward. They’ve made a sincere effort to <a href="https://votefwd.org/impact">measure the impact</a>. And they are honest about the findings: the measurable effect is small. I’ll give them the last word here.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Why should we get excited about small differences?</p>
<p>Because getting people who don’t vote to show up at the polls (or mail in a ballot) is actually pretty hard. Most of the factors that affect whether people vote are tied to big, structural issues (like voter ID laws or polling place accessibility) or deep-seated attitudes (e.g., a lack of faith that elections matter). Given these obstacles, boosting turnout by even a small amount is a real achievement! And, when it comes to politics, we know that many races are decided by tight margins, so a small boost in turnout can translate into a meaningful difference in electoral outcomes.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The OpenID Foundation has <a href="https://openid.net/fourth-implementers-draft-of-openid-federation-approved/">approved</a> the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-ID4.html">Fourth Implementer’s Draft of the OpenID Federation Specification</a>.  This is a major step towards having the specification become final.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0-ID3.html">previous Implementer’s Draft</a> was in 2021.  A lot has happened since then, largely motivated by feedback from actual implementations and deployments.  Some highlights of progress made in the spec since then are:</p>
 
 Changed name from OpenID Connect Federation to OpenID Federation, since Federation can be used for trust establishment for any protocol (including OpenID Connect). 
 Introduced distinct Federation endpoints. 
 Clearly defined and consistently used the terms Entity Statement, Entity Configuration, and Subordinate Statement. 
 Clearly defined which claims can occur in which kinds of Entity Statements. 
 Clearly defined Entity Types and the Federation Entity entity type. 
 Enhanced description of Trust Mark issuance and usage. 
 Defined relationship between metadata and metadata policy. 
 Clearly defined interactions between policy operators. 
 Defined where constraints may occur. 
 Tightened descriptions of Automatic Registration and Explicit Registration. 
 Added Historical Keys. 
 Defined and used <code>trust_chain</code> JWS Header Parameter. 
 Allowed Trust Chains to start with non-Trust Anchors. 
 Clarified use of client authentication. 
 Used OAuth Protected Resource Metadata. 
 Consistent error handling. 
 Added General-Purpose JWT Claims section. 
 Comprehensive use of content types and media types. 
 IANA registration of parameters, claims, and media types. 
 Added and improved many diagrams. 
 Substantial rewrites for increased consistency and clarity. 
 Added <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giuseppe-de-marco-bb054245/">Giuseppe De Marco</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirdzhuvinov/">Vladimir Dzhuvinov</a> as editors. 
 
<p>As a preview of coming attractions, I’ll note that profiles of OpenID Federation are being written describing how it being used in wallet ecosystems and how it is being used in open finance ecosystems.  And we’re creating a list of implementations.  Watch this space for future announcements.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 12, 2024</p>



<p>This being our last day in Perth, we had a leisurely start, although that was limited by the need to check out of our hotel room on time. We had breakfast in the hotel, finished packing, and checked our bags for the day at the front desk.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wamuseum.jpg"></a>Entrance to WA Museum Boola Bardip 


<p>We began with a visit to the WA Museum Boola Bardip (Boola Bardip means Many Stories in the local indigenous language), which is located in an area designated as Perth’s cultural center, with theaters and performance venues as well as the Western Australia library and archives. The extensive museum has exhibit halls dedicated to wildlife, cultural, and historical themes. The exhibits, many of them interactive, were well-designed and informative.</p>



<p>It was lunchtime after that, and Kenna remembered a “healthy burgers” chain, Grill’d, that we tried and liked during last spring’s trip to Brisbane. We split a lamb burger, which was a nice change of pace.</p>



<p>We stopped by the Perth Town Hall but couldn’t see much because of an event. The Town Hall is the second-oldest building in Perth, so the receptionist suggested we check out the oldest building, the Old Court House Law Museum. The main room of the building was a small courtroom set up as it would have been in Perth’s early days. The museum also had several exhibits about the evolution of laws applied to Aboriginal people and women, which showed how much things have changed since the beginning of the 20th century and how far we still need to go.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/perthmint.jpg"></a>Perth Mint 


<p>We continued on to the Perth Mint, where we took a short self-guided tour that explained the Mint’s history and how it related to the Australian gold mining industry. It was fun talking with one of the “coin geeks” there. Today, I learned that successive British monarchs face opposite directions when depicted on coins. Queen Elizabeth II faces right, but King Charles faces to the left when he appears on Australian coins.</p>



<p>We then went to Elizabeth Quay for a break and a small snack and watched our final Perth sunset of the trip from there. We walked back to the hotel, collected our bags, and took a taxi to the airport. Unfortunately, we arrived about an hour before check-in opened, but we waited that out, passed through security, and caught our 11:45 flight to Melbourne. After a short layover we caught a nonstop to San Francisco, a 13-hour flight but a comfortable one. It was good to get home, early on June 13. Now for the challenge of staying awake, to get onto California time!</p>

  Tuesday, June 11, 2024 We have heard a lot about Rottnest Island, which is just off the coast of Perth.

<p>Tuesday, June 11, 2024</p>



<p>We have heard a lot about Rottnest Island, which is just off the coast of Perth. Rottnest (“Rotto” to the locals) is a recreational island with cabins for rent, several beaches with snorkeling (in the summer), restaurants, a golf course, skydiving, and more. It is also the home of about 10,000 quokkas. Quokkas are small marsupials billed as “the happiest animals on earth.”</p>



<p>We booked a round trip on the Rottnest Express last night, so we got an early start this morning and grabbed coffee and a breakfast wrap on the way to the pier. We got seats upstairs for both the view and the airflow. The trip started slow (about 10 knots) as we left the pier, increased to about twice that once we reached a broad section of the Swan River, and slowed again as we approached Fremantle. We stopped, picked up more passengers there, and then proceeded to Rottnest Island at a higher speed.</p>



<p>Although we had been equipped with a map, we weren’t sure where to go when we got to Rottnest. We stumbled on the main village and were heading out when we noticed some rain starting to fall. We returned to the village to get some snacks, and the sky opened up: it poured! We were thankful to be in the village as there weren’t a lot of other places to get out of the rain. While there, we noticed our first quokka and gates on the grocery entrance and other businesses designed to keep quokkas out.</p>



<p>Despite a lot of public education not to feed the quokkas, many of them hang out in the village to eat up the crumbs and other droppage from human diners. They are indeed cute, but the “always smiling” thing seemed a little overstated. They can be a little aggressive, too: when Kenna and I shared a chicken sandwich for lunch, a quokka climbed on the bench between us and tried to get to the sandwich. We moved rather quickly.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ospreynest-1.jpg"></a>Osprey Nest at Cape Vlamingh, Rottnest Island 


<p>The rain continued off and on, limiting our ability to venture beyond the village until we boarded a bus for a “discovery” tour we had booked for the afternoon. The tour took us around the perimeter of the island, with excellent descriptive commentary from a guide on the bus. We stopped at several points to take pictures, most notably at the far west end facing the vast Indian Ocean, where there was also a large osprey nest.</p>



<p>Following our tour, we stopped briefly to pick up souvenirs (a t-shirt for me), and it was time for our return trip to Perth. Along the way, in one of the slower-speed segments, a couple of hydrofoil surfers managed to “draft” off our ship, keeping up for quite a long time. We were also tailed briefly by a few dolphins.</p>



<p>Returning to our hotel, we were exhausted but managed to venture out for a quick pizza dinner.</p>

<p>Monday, June 10, 2024</p>



<p>Kenna and I slept in a bit today, then set out into downtown Perth. We grabbed breakfast at one of the many coffee shops. Perth seems to be quite a coffee city, but there are no Starbucks here.</p>



<p>We walked to Elizabeth Quay and the Barrack Street jetty, from which many tour boats originate. We picked up some information on Rottnest Island tours and were surprised when Lee and Colleen, two of our fellow passengers on the Orion, also showed up. We may see them again.</p>



<p>From there, we walked to Kings Park and its botanical garden. We made some wrong turns but eventually found it and discovered it is up quite a hill from downtown and has a great view. The botanical garden is nicely labeled and includes specific sections for areas like the Kimberley. From a distance, we saw Lee and Colleen here too. We could have spent a lot more time here, but we wanted to make it out to Fremantle, so we caught a bus to the train station and a train to Fremantle.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/indianocean.jpg"></a> 


<p>One of our first goals in Fremantle (“Freo” to the locals) was to visit the Indian Ocean for the first time. We went out to a nearby beach and touched the water, which, of course, felt like…water. Soon after that, we ran into a couple of other fellow passengers from the Orion, who had just returned from the Maritime Museum. They told us it was excellent, so we headed over there.</p>



<p>After a quick late lunch in their snack bar, we toured the exhibits. One memorable exhibit for me was Australia II, the Australian winner of the America’s Cup sailing race in 1983. It was a big deal at the time and continues to be a source of pride for Australians.</p>



<p>Fremantle hadn’t initially seemed much like other beach towns (Santa Cruz, Brighton UK, etc.) I have visited. But as we headed more into the city center, we began to see the makings of a beach town: some brewpubs, a game arcade, souvenir shops, etc. It was still somewhat more restrained than many.</p>



<p>Exhausted from several miles of walking, we returned to the train station and rode back to Perth, where we had more walking to do to get to the hotel. We opted to have dinner in the hotel’s pub, which was mediocre and surprisingly closed at 8 p.m. — earlier than most any pub I have seen.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 9, 2024</p>



<p>Today started quite early because they needed to get us off the Orion early and prepare it in eight hours for the next cruise. We had our suitcases out for pickup at 7 a.m., ate breakfast, and exited the ship about 7:30. We had to go through Australian customs, which went smoothly for us but resulted in delays for some others, primarily some MDs who had medical supplies with them and one passenger who had bought a wooden oar somewhere along the way.</p>



<p>There were two busloads of passengers going to the airport. Our bus driver polled the passengers about our departure times and then took us on an impromptu bus tour of Darwin. Darwin is a surprisingly modern and clean city, and the driver was rightfully proud of his home town.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/darwinskyline.jpg"></a>Darwin skyline 


<p></p>



<p>We arrived at the airport about three hours before our flight. Unfortunately, we couldn’t check our luggage until 90 minutes before flight time, so we had to wait outside security. There were enough of us there that we were able to use the time to reminisce about the cruise.</p>



<p>When the time came, we obtained our luggage tags and sent our bags down the conveyor. Unlike in the US, we just entered our names and destinations to check our luggage; no ID was required. Similarly, we went through security without showing an ID or our boarding passes, and there was no ID check getting onto the plane. This was very surprising to us!</p>



<p>The flight to Perth was uneventful. When we arrived in Perth, we found the climate to be very different. While it is the dry season in Darwin and the Kimberley coast, it is the wet season in Perth, which has a climate quite similar to the San Francisco Bay Area but shifted by six months. It was rainy and cloudy when we arrived.</p>



<p>When we got off the plane, we were surprised to see Dave’s friend Bruce and his wife waiting for us at the gate! That’s a consequence of not requiring a boarding pass to go through security and was a nice throwback to pre-9/11 practices.</p>



<p>We checked into our hotel, The Melbourne Hotel (yes, located in Perth), and found that we had booked a nicely outfitted but unusual guest room. For example, there was no door to any of the bathroom area; it was open to the bedroom. This is fine, but it takes a little getting used to.</p>



<p>Dave’s friend Bruce had made reservations for a lovely restaurant in North Fremantle,<br>Bib and Tucker. I had kangaroo for dinner, which had a nice flavor and is a very lean meat (accordingly cooked somewhat rare). Our hosts pointed out that the kangaroo they serve is farmed explicitly for that purpose.</p>



<p>After a very busy day, we said goodbye to Jan and Dave who left for the US that evening and to our hosts. We took the train from North Fremantle back to Perth, where we crashed.</p>

<p>Saturday, June 8, 2024</p>



<p>Today is an at-sea day as we cross back over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf to Darwin, where we will disembark from the Orion tomorrow morning. Again, the seas were rough, but not as much as the outgoing crossing. As with other at-sea days, there were lectures from the naturalists and an information session on future cruises. The day ended with the Captain’s cocktail reception and dinner. The cocktail reception featured a slideshow of photos that passengers had submitted (unfortunately, I misunderstood how to submit mine). There was also an auction of a specially-decorated flag from the ship to benefit the crew welfare fund and of a didgeridoo from Goyma’s family, the proceeds from which went back to his family. Happily, both auctions produced high bids for the beneficiaries.</p>



<p>For dinner, Dave and Jan were kind enough to join us in the COVID dining area for our final dinner on the Orion. It was a particularly good dinner, and we witnessed a beautiful sunset and moonset.</p>

<p>Friday, June 7, 2024</p>



<p>I checked in with Dr. Bob early this morning to remind him that I needed to be checked and cleared to take today’s helicopter flight to Mitchell Falls. He told me that I had been diagnosed too recently and had to be removed from the flight list. I was disappointed. I pointed out that I had been diagnosed at 7:45 a.m. the previous day, and the cutoff time was given as 8:00. But after further consultation, he called back and said I was good to go because the helicopter ride was somewhat after 8:00.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/helos-1.jpg"></a> 


<p>We made a Zodiac boat transfer to a nearby beach. A few minutes later, three helicopters landed on the beach. We met our pilot and were given a safety briefing (tl;dr: STAY AWAY FROM THE SPINNING ROTORS). Dave and Jan were the other passengers on the helicopter with us. I had the left front seat next to the pilot (who sat on the right, as if we were flying on the left side of the sky).</p>



<p>With an open window next to me, the view was, as expected, gorgeous (both in the sense of attractiveness and the presence of gorges). We rode the 30 miles up the Mitchell River to the falls, mostly admiring the terrain as no particular animals were visible.</p>



<p>On arrival, we hiked up a short trail to get several good views of Mitchell Falls. We had enough time to explore the rocky terrain in the area before returning to the helicopter landing area for our trip back to the beach. The return trip was equally awesome.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mitchellfalls.jpg"></a> 


<p>For lunch, I joined in with others who had also tested COVID-positive and ate separately from others on the observation deck. This precaution was taken because, even though we were eating outside, eating is one of the times when it is easiest to spread the virus. The upper deck was enjoyable and quiet, although we noticed that several people who we knew had tested positive weren’t there.</p>



<p>After lunch, we had an informative lecture and a trip to another native art site. This schedule was coordinated with another (somewhat larger) ship in the area, Le Jacques Cartier, that we had also seen this morning when visiting Mitchell Falls. Unfortunately, the art site wasn’t big enough to accommodate both ships simultaneously, and we went second. The tide was very low when we went, so we had a very long (and delayed) zodiac boat ride to shore. We had to climb shore rocks to get to where the art was, which was slow for some visitors.</p>



<p>There was quite a bit of Indigenous art to look at, but before we could see it all, an urgent call was put out to return to the zodiac boats because the tide had fallen further. We climbed back down the rocks and waded out farther to reach the zodiac boats. We were disappointed not to have enough time to admire the rest of the art.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wandjina3.jpg"></a>




<p>Today’s delicious dinner was an “Aussie BBQ” with all the trimmings, which I ate with my fellow COVID patients. After dinner, there was a talent show featuring many of the cooks, waiters, and porters from the hotel staff. It was a nice way to introduce them more personally.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 6, 2024</p>



<p>I felt a little stuffy this morning, and given the ship’s COVID outbreak, I decided to get tested. I called Dr. Bob, the ship’s doctor, who came by with a couple of swabs, one for me and one for Kenna. A few minutes later, he called back with the result: I had tested positive, but Kenna was negative. He returned a little while later to check my vitals, listen to my lungs, and deliver Paxlovid, which I had taken on both of my previous COVID cases.</p>



<p>The ship’s protocol for handling this was straightforward: I needed to isolate myself in our room for 24 hours, and Kenna should stay away as much as possible. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus appeared on my cabin door. I selected meals, which were delivered to me in the room. Since the cruise ends on Sunday, I will need to wear a mask on the ship for a few days for the rest of the cruise.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/thorshammer.jpg"></a> 


<p>Kenna went out to eat with the rest of the ship (specifically with Jan and Dave, whom we had spent time with) and then went on the day’s activities. The morning activity was a ride to see Thor’s Hammer, a tall sandstone rock formation. Kenna’s Zodiac was piloted by Karla, the expedition leader, and paired with Kurt, the geologist, in another Zodiac. Between the two, the group got a good geology lesson with specimens of quartz crystals that Karla borrowed from a rocky outcrop where they stopped.</p>



<p>The afternoon excursion was their best opportunity to see crocodiles as the tide was going out on Porosus Creek. They were still a little early, but after a while finally got a few sightings including a chance to watch a crocodile devour a crab, before having to return to the ship.</p>



<p>There was also a briefing for tomorrow’s helicopter trip. The helicopter company was consulted to see if they would permit masked Covid-positive people on the helicopters, and they said it was OK, provided they were diagnosed before 8 am today (I was diagnosed about 7:45). Whew. I will still need to be checked to see if I’m running a fever (I wasn’t today), so my fingers are crossed that I can go.</p>



<p>My day was mostly spent reading and doing consulting work since I had to stay in the cabin anyway.</p>



<p>In the evening, Kenna was told they had found another place for her to sleep to minimize her exposure. It is a cabin for harbor pilots to use when necessary. We appreciate the creativity of the hotel manager, Fran, in finding this for her. Fran has been amazing through this entire cruise, and this evening brought Kenna a night light to use in the temporary cabin.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 5, 2024</p>



<p>Today’s breakfast came with an announced request to allow the COVID-infected people to pick up breakfast first, after which they would clean the serving utensils and invite the rest of us for breakfast. We were asked to wash our hands at a sink on the back deck to limit any further spread.</p>



<p>Today’s activities consisted of two outings in Zodiac boats, which we just toured and didn’t land anywhere. The morning cruise was around a few nearby islands and into a mangrove-lined area where we hoped to see some crocodiles. We didn’t see any, but we did see some birds and the stunning local geology, and we were treated to some more stories from Goyma, our indigenous guide, who happened to be on our zodiac boat.</p>



<p>Around lunchtime, I ran into Dr. Bob, our ship physician. He said there was a “trickle” of additional COVID cases but that some had recovered, none of the existing cases were severe, and most patients were taking Paxlovid. This is probably appropriate considering most passengers’ ages (we estimate the median age at 73).</p>



<p>After another ship repositioning, we were off on zodiac boats to Montgomery Reef, a unique reef formation. The reef is just below sea level at high tide but emerges more than several feet above water level, to the delight of birds and other creatures. We saw several turtles in the water and many birds (mostly egrets) on the reef and in the air. During the approximately 90 minutes we were there, the reef went from just emerging from the water to over 10 feet above water level, with very substantial amounts of water draining from the edges of the reef.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/montgomeryreef.jpg"></a> 


<p>As we were leaving, we noticed a zodiac boat flying the Lindblad/National Geographic flag. Sure enough, we pulled up alongside it and were treated to tropical drinks served from a punchbowl before our ride back to the Orion. </p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/punchbowl.jpg"></a> 


<p>Dinner was again outside and comfortable; meals will probably be outside for the rest of the cruise. After dinner, they arranged to shut off the lights in one area of the ship and held a star party. We easily saw the Southern Cross, as expected, but also the Big Dipper, except it was pointing down to Polaris, which was below the horizon.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 4, 2024</p>



<p>Bigge Island (pronounced “biggie”) is named for someone named Bigge although the island is big. It is the home for some more Gwion Gwion (ancient) and Wandjina (newer) rock art. Starting from the beach where we landed, we took a short hike to the art sites, with narration by our guides, particularly our indigenous guide, Goyma. I practiced some of the photography skills taught by our photo experts at some lectures earlier in the trip, with some success.</p>

<p></p>



<p>After lunch (and some repositioning of the Orion), we landed at a different beach with a few boab trees. This included a huge and notable tree called the Mermaid Tree, around which a low platform had been built to protect its roots, much as has been done around some giant sequoia trees in California.</p>



<p>We then walked further along the trail to where a couple of “parade grounds” built by bower birds were located. The bower bird is very plain-looking, so to impress a potential mate, it creates a straw tunnel and decorates its approach with local materials. These aren’t nests, just ways to attract a mate.</p>

<p>Returning to the ship, we found menus tucked into four doors across the hall, indicating additional COVID cases had been found. Dinner was moved outside to the aft deck, which was very comfortable and pleasant, but a lot of work for the staff since the galley is downstairs, necessitating a lot of shuttling back and forth.</p>

  PGXN Meta Spec v2 represents a significant reworking of the original spec

<p>Two bits of news on the “PGXN v2” project.</p>
 PGXN RFCs: The Book 
<p>First, I’ve moved the RFC process (again, sorry) from <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pgxn/discussions">PGXN Discussions</a>,
which were a bit fussy about Markdown formatting and don’t support inline
comments, to the <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs" title="RFCs for Changes to PGXN">PGXN RFCs</a> project, where use of pull requests on
<a href="https://commonmark.org" title="A strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown">CommonMark</a> Markdown documents address these issues. This process borrows
heavily from the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs" title="RFCs for changes to Rust">Rust RFCs</a> project, right down to publishing accepted RFCs
as a “book” site.</p>
<p>So I’d also like to introduce <a href="https://rfcs.pgxn.org" title="PGXN RFCs — PGXN Book">rfcs.pgxn.org</a>, a.k.a., the PGXN RFCs Book.</p>
<p>It currently houses only one RFC: <a href="https://rfcs.pgxn.org/0001-meta-spec-v1.html" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">Meta Spec v1</a>, dating from 2010. This
document defines the structure of the <code>META.json</code> file required in archives
published on <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.</p>
<p>But I expect many more RFCs to be drafted in the coming years, starting with
<a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/2" title="pgxn/rfcs#2 – RFC: Binary Distribution Format">draft RFC–2</a>, the binary distribution RFC I <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-poc/" title="POC: PGXN Binary Distribution Format">POCed</a> a few weeks ago.
There has already been some great feedback in that pull request, in addition
to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pgxn/discussions/2" title="Proposal: Binary Distribution Format (closed)">previous discussion</a>. More eyes will make it even better.</p>
 PGXN Meta Spec v2 RFC 
<p>Last week I also iterated on the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/rfc-pgxn-metadata-sketch/" title="RFC: PGXN Metadata Sketch">PGXN Metadata Sketch</a> several times to
produce <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/3" title="pgxn/rfcs#2 – RFC: Meta Spec v2">draft RFC–3: Meta Spec v2</a>. This represents a major reworking
of the <a href="https://rfcs.pgxn.org/0001-meta-spec-v1.html" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">original spec</a> in an attempt to meet the following
goals:</p>
 
 Allow more comprehensive dependency specification, to enable packagers to
identify and install system dependencies and dependencies from other
packaging systems, like <a href="https://pypi.org" title="Find, install and publish Python packages with the Python Package Index">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://www.cpan.org" title="Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">CPAN</a> 
 Adopt more industry-standard formats like <a href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/annexes/SPDX-license-expressions/">SPDX License Expressions</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec" title="A minimal specification for purl aka. a package “mostly universal” URL">purls</a>. 
 Improve support multiple types of Postgres extensions, including apps,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: LOAD"><code>LOAD</code></a>able modules, background workers, and <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL (pg_tle)">TLEs</a>. 
 Improve curation and evaluation via categories, badging, and additional
download links. 
 
<p>There’s a lot here, but hope the result can better serve the community for the
next decade, and enable lots of new services and features.</p>
<p>The proof will be in the application, so my next task is to start building the

<p>Monday, June 3, 2024</p>



<p>The Orion was repositioned overnight at our next destination on the Kimberley coast. Fortunately, the seas were relatively calm (as compared with the trip to and from Darwin), and we didn’t need to work as hard to walk around.</p>



<p>Our morning destination was the site of a World War II plane wreck, a C-53 that had gotten lost on a trip from Perth to Broome. They neglected to bring along a navigator. The plane ran out of fuel, tried to land on a mud flat, and skidded into the forest, losing one of its wings and an engine. Fortunately, they were rescued after several days, and everyone survived. The metal frame and skin of the plane are relatively intact, and we had an opportunity to walk around a bit and examine them.</p>



<p>While in the area, we walked through the woods and saw several things described in our preparatory lectures: a boab tree, a paperbark tree (essential to the Aboriginals for many uses), and a potentially quite old termite hill.</p>



<p>We walked back to the beach across the mud flat, examining large sandstone formations along the way.</p>



<p>The afternoon destination was Jar Island, a nearby island featuring ancient Gwion Gwion indigenous rock art. We were given three options for our short hike: “easy,” “moderate,” and “difficult,” with the more challenging routes giving us more to see. We chose the difficult route, which, other than requiring a little use of hands to ascend and descend some rocks, was not that challenging. The rock art was of uncertain (but very old) age and was painted on the sandstone at the three sites we visited.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gwion.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gwion2.jpg"></a>



 
<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/beachparty.jpg"></a> 


<p>Returning to the beach just as the sun was beginning to set, we were surprised by an impromptu beach party (cocktails and music) that the staff had set up. The party was a lot of fun, and we returned to the Orion just as it was getting dark.</p>



<p>Upon our return, our festive mood was quickly dispelled by an announcement from the ship’s doctor that three cases of COVID had been found on board the ship. Masks were distributed (but were voluntary), and arrangements were made to isolate the affected people in their cabins for a minimum of 24 hours and to bring their meals to them. I had noticed someone wearing a mask picking up breakfast early that morning and was suspicious that there was an outbreak on the ship. It soon became evident who the affected people were, as dinner menus appeared in the document holders on their cabin doors. Two of the cabins across the hall from ours were included.</p>

<p>One of the key aspects to the bubbles model for federated identity systems is the fact that within the bubble, the account for each user is fully authoritative for that space. But since bubbles don’t exist in a vacuum, that same person probably has accounts that exist in other bubbles. In fact, the attributes in their account probably came from somewhere else to begin with. And of course, our bubble can in turn act as a source for another system downstream.</p>Three stages of an identity in&nbsp;bubbles<p>With that model in mind, from the perspective of our bubble, we’ve got three distinct identity processing systems that all need to come together to make things work: the local identity management system for our bubble, something to process inbound accounts, and something to package accounts up for outbound transmission to somewhere else.</p> The Local&nbsp;Bubble <p>Within the bubble itself, we are using a cohesive IdAM system and are almost certainly using federation technology to connect out to a set of RP’s within the bubble. All of these systems can look towards one authoritative IdP within the bubble for the source of all account information.</p><p>Inside the bubble, we have tons of freedom for how we want to connect our users to our systems. While we probably want to use current best-of-class technologies like OpenID Connect and passkeys, we only really need to be compatible internally, using whatever makes the most sense for our environment.</p><p>The important thing here is that each user has an account that is accessible within the bubble at all times, and is not dependent on reaching out to anything outside the bubble for local authentication.</p> Inbound Processing <p>Most of the users in a bubble probably came from somewhere. If we onboard an account from an external system, it means that we’re creating an account based on a set of attributes from a known source. These attributes can come in with an assertion, credential, certificate, API call, or some other technology. The important thing, for us, is that we can now tie these attributes to a known account, and we can cache the attributes as we received them. A lot of these are going to be immensely useful — we won’t have to have every user type in all their attributes every time they connect into a new&nbsp;bubble.</p><p>But it’s not enough that we’re just making a cached copy. In many cases, we’ll want to override or update these attributes locally, but we don’t necessarily want to lose the data from the source when we do that override. After all, we don’t control the data source, and we want to know where all of our information came&nbsp;from.</p><p>We can use an overlay style data structure that lets us keep both updated data and the source data at the same time. Let’s say, for instance, that Patty O’Sullivan gets an account onboarded into the system, but it turns out that everyone inside the bubble just calls her Sully. We can create a local value that overrides the official value, but the official value doesn’t go away: it’s still sitting in its own structure. If we don’t have an override, when we look up an attribute we can follow a pointer to an upstream source and get it directly without having to copy&nbsp;it.</p><p>The approach also allows us to very efficiently take care of cases where we don’t have a need for referencing an attribute that was handed to us, or that we need to create a brand new attribute that doesn’t exist at the source. And in fact, this pattern can be applied up the chain, since our source might have gotten its information from somewhere else in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>And we can just keep copying this pattern, even pointing at multiple sources at the same time. We can optimize this graph structure for both storage size and lookup efficiency, but more importantly it allows us to keep the data sources separate from each other in a meaningful fashion. We can tell where we’re getting each attribute value from, and we can differentiate between local updates and data copied from elsewhere.</p><p>This also means that we can put restrictions on data from different layers. For example, maybe we want a policy that needs an update on a cached value every so often. Or if I’m doing a local override of an important attribute, like one that gets used in security decision making, then I need to check that the override is still valid after a certain timeout. This can avoid a class of configuration errors that we see in the field, where something gets changed in order to solve an immediate problem, but never gets changed back when things de-escalate.</p> Outbound Packaging <p>And of course, we also want our bubble to be able to act as the source for some downstream receivers as well. In order to do that, we need to be able to package up our accounts and assert them outbound.</p><p>But wait a moment — isn’t that the same exact thing we’re doing inside of the bubble for our apps? Aren’t we already going through a federation process to connect on the inside? Shouldn’t we just use that same IdP again, since it’s already set up and has all the same accounts?</p><p>While it would be possible to re-use the same component, it makes more sense to have a dedicated IdP that only speaks to external receivers. This separation allows us to deliberately control which information we share and with whom, and without it being conflated with local policy, changes, overrides, and other concerns. When we’re talking to an external receiver, we likely want to give a very specific view of an account in this context, especially considering that we want to minimize the transmission of sensitive data across boundaries.</p> Stacking the Three Pieces&nbsp;Together <p>Each identity system we’ve talked about here has a distinct role to play. In this way, the three parts of a bubble system — inbound, local, and outbound — can work together to create a cohesive path for an account, its attributes, and the person who’s using&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/OR13b">Orie Steele</a> and I have updated the “Fully-Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE” specification to incorporate working group last call (WGLC) feedback.  Thanks to all who took the time to comment on the draft.  Your feedback was exceptionally actionable and helped to substantially improve the specification.  Responses to each WGLC comment thread were sent on the <a href="https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/jose@ietf.org/)">IETF JOSE working group mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>The updated draft attempts to discuss the full range of the problems created by polymorphic algorithm identifiers.  Guided by working group feedback, it strikes an engineering balance between which of these problems to fix immediately in the specification and which to describe how future specifications can fix later as the need arises.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing next steps for the specification at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/meeting/120/">IETF 120 in Vancouver</a>.</p>

<p>Die Chatkontrolle ist wieder auf der Tagesordnung der Regierungen der EU. Am <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/195500/imfname_11406149.pdf">23. September</a> sollen sich die EU-Regierungen zum <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/st12406.en_clean.pdf">neuesten Vorstoß</a> positionieren. Die EU-Innenminister sollen die Chatkontrolle am <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2024/09/2024-08-29_Council_Presidency_CSAR_Policy-debate_12319.pdf">10./11. Oktober</a> beschließen. <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/neuester-eu-anlauf-zur-chatkontrolle-werden-messenger-dienste-in-europa-gesperrt/">Neuestes Update vom 12. September…</a></p>



<p>Im Juni <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/chatkontrolle-vertagt-megaerfolg-bei-verteidigung-des-digitalen-briefgeheimnisses/">war es uns gelungen</a> die beispiellosen Pläne <a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/chatkontrolle-bei-whatsapp-und-co-gesetzesvorhaben-geht-in-naechste-runde-19803049.html">mit einer extrem knappen „Sperrminorität“ der EU Regierungen aufzuhalten</a>: Die Befürworter der Chatkontrolle erreichten damals 63,7% der 65%-Mehrheit, die im Rat der EU für eine qualifizierte Mehrheit erforderlich ist.</p>



<p>Zahlreiche Regierungen wie Frankreich, die sich früher gegen die Pläne gestellt hatten, haben ihren Widerstand bereits aufgegeben. Viele Regierungen wie die deutsche Bundesregierung, die immer noch kritisch zum Vorschlag stehen, melden nur noch geringfügigen Änderungsbedarf an (z.B. eine Ausnahme für Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung ), womit unsere private Kommunikation von den meisten Diensten immer noch massenhaft durchsucht und geleaked würde. Darum besteht jetzt aktuell die konkrete Gefahr, dass die benötigte Mehrheit für die massenhafte Durchleuchtung privater Kommunikation während der ungarischen Ratspräsidentschaft erreicht wird (Ungarn unterstützt den Vorschlag).</p>



<p>Deshalb müssen wir uns alle engagieren, unsere Stimmen gegenüber unseren Regierungen erheben und die Bevölkerung aufklären.</p>



  
 
 Regierungen, welche den Chatkontrolle-Vorschlag bisher unterstützt haben, müssen überzeugt werden ihre Position zu ändern 



 Sich kritisch verhaltende Regierungen müssen dazu gebracht werden, umfassende und nicht nur kleine Änderungen am Vorschlag zu fordern, so <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/beitraege/chatkontrolle/#epmandat">wie sie das Europäische Parlament fordert</a>. 
 
  



<p>Dieser Blogartikel erklärt verschiedene Möglichkeiten, wie du aktiv werden kannst. Jede*r kann sich einbringen. Um uns erfolgreich gegen die Chatkontrolle zu wehren, müssen wir uns alle engagieren!</p>







<p>Auf dieser Karte (die du gerne online teilen kannst!) kannst du die Positionen der EU-Mitgliedstaaten zur Chatkontrolle Stand 4. September 2024 laut eines <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/interne-dokumente-sperrminoritaet-gegen-chatkontrolle-wackelt/">geleakten Berichts</a> sehen. Die Länder sind außerdem in der Tabelle unten aufgeführt.</p>



<p>Ist deine Regierung für die Chatkontrolle? <br>→ Verlange eine Erklärung und dass die Regierung ihren Kurs ändert.</p>



<p>Enthält sich deine Regierung? <br>→ Frage sie nach den Gründen und fordere, dass sie sich in Zukunft entschieden gegen die Chatkontrolle einsetzt.</p>



<p>Ist deine Regierung gegen die Chatkontrolle?<br>→ Prima, aber schau genaue hin: Einige Regierungen, wie z. B. die deutsche Bundesregierung, lehnen nur das Scannen verschlüsselter Kommunikation ab, sind aber mit dem anlasslosen Scannen anderer privater Kommunikation einverstanden, oder mit dem Ende anonymer Kommunikation durch verpflichtende Alterskontrollen, oder mit der Einführung eines Mindestalters für vermeintlich „riskante“ Messenger und Apps zur Kommunikation. Auch müssen Regierungen jetzt ihren Einfluss im Rat der EU besser geltend machen <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/chatkontrolle-vertagt-megaerfolg-bei-verteidigung-des-digitalen-briefgeheimnisses/">und sich mit anderen kritischen Staaten auf gemeinsame Forderungen verständigen</a> und den Vorschlag damit grundliegend überarbeiten. Wenn diese Änderungen nicht umgesetzt werden, sollten die Regierungen von der Europäischen Kommission eine Rücknahme des Chatkontrolle-Vorschlags verlangen.</p>



 Wie deine Regierung zum aktuellen Chatkontrolle-Vorschlag steht 



Für den VorschlagNicht für den VorschlagUnentschieden / unklarBulgariaAustriaBelgiumCroatiaEstoniaCzech RepublicCyprusGermanyFinlandDenmarkLuxembourgItalyGreecePolandNetherlandsHungarySloveniaPortugalIrelandSwedenLatvia<br><br>Lithuania<br><br>Malta<br><br>Romania<br><br>Slovakia<br><br>Spain<br><br>



<p>Die sechs Länder, die sich kritisch geäußert haben, reichen noch nicht für eine <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/voting-calculator/">Sperrminorität</a> aus.</p>



 Das kannst du tun 



<p>Es gibt Maßnahmen, die du sofort und kurzfristig ergreifen kannst, und solche, die mehr Vorbereitung erfordern. Für den Anfang:</p>



 
 Bitte deine Regierung, von der Europäischen Kommission die Rücknahme des Vorschlags zur Chatkontrolle zu fordern. Weise sie auf einen gemeinsamen Brief hin, der gerade von Kinderrechts- und Digitalrechtsgruppen aus ganz Europa veröffentlicht wurde. <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/joint-statement-on-the-future-of-the-csa-regulation/">Klicke hier, um den Brief und weitere Informationen zu finden</a>. 



 Aus Deutschland? Fordere die Bundesregierung dazu auf, die Chatkontrolle konsequent und vollständig abzulehnen und den eigenen Einfluss im Rat der EU zum Schutz unserer Grundrechte geltend zu machen. 



 Aus einem anderen Land als Deutschland? Überprüfe das Abstimmungsverhalten deiner Regierung (siehe oben) und bitte sie um eine Begründung, falls sie für oder gegen die Chatkontrolle gestimmt hat. Sage ihnen, dass du als Bürger*in willst, dass sie den Vorschlag ablehnen, dass die Chatkontrolle von vielen Expert*innen kritisiert wird und dass keiner der bisher im Rat der EU vorgelegten Vorschläge akzeptabel ist. Fordere sie auf, die Privatsphäre deiner Kommunikation und deine IT-Sicherheit zu schützen. 



 Teile diesen Aufruf zum Handeln online. 
 



<p>Die besten Anlaufstellen in deiner Regierung sind in der Regel das <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/service/kontakt-uebersicht/kontaktuebersicht-node.html">Innenministerium</a> (federführend) und Ministerien für <a href="https://www.bmj.de/DE/service/kontakt/kontakt_node.html">Justiz</a> und für <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/service/kontakt?view=">Digitalisierung</a> / Telekommunikation / <a href="https://www.bmwk.de/Navigation/DE/Service/Kontakt/kontakt.html">Wirtschaft</a>. Außerdem gibt es für jedes Land eine Ständige Vertretung bei den EU-Institutionen. <a href="https://op.europa.eu/de/web/who-is-who/organization/-/organization/COREPER/">Die Kontaktdaten der Ständigen Vertretungen findest du, indem du hier klickst</a>.<br><br>Es kann auch sehr helfen sich an die Abgeordneten in den nationalen Parlamenten zu wenden, da sie das Stimmverhalten ihres Landes festlegen können. Sprich deine politischen Vertreter*innen an. Ob es sich um die neu gewählten Abgeordneten des Europäischen Parlaments oder um lokale Gruppen der politischen Parteien handelt: Sie alle sollten erfahren, worum es bei der Chatkontrolle geht und dass du von der Politik erwartest, deine Grundrechte gegen den Chatkontrolle-Vorschlag zu verteidigen!<br><br>Tipp: Wenn du mit Politiker*innen in Kontakt treten willst, solltest du möglichst einen echten Brief schreiben, im Büro anrufen oder zu einer lokalen Parteiveranstaltung oder zu Öffnungszeiten des Büros gehen und dort ein persönliches Gespräch führen. Das hat eine noch größere Wirkung als eine E-Mail. Die Kontaktdaten findest du in der Regel auf den Websites der Politiker*innen und der Ortsgruppen der Parteien. Denk daran, dass du deinen Standpunkt entschlossen vertreten, dabei aber auch höflich bleiben solltest, da sie dir sonst nicht zuhören werden.<br><br>Hier findest du eine <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/beitraege/chatkontrolle/#WeitereArgumenteChatkontrolle">Argumentationshilfe zur Chatkontrolle</a>. Und nachfolgend mehrere Erklärungen, warum die bisher von den Regierungen vorgesehenen Änderungen nicht ausreichen, um den Gefahren der Chatkontrolle entgegenzuwirken: <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/chatkontrolle-blockade-wackelt-chatkontrolle-verweigerer-sollen-mit-foto-und-linkverbot-bestraft-werden/">von uns</a>, <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/be-scanned-or-get-banned/">von EDRi</a>, <a href="https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/May-2024-CDT-Europe-Feedback-on-the-Belgian-Presidencys-compromise-on-the-Regulation-on-Child-Sexual-Abuse-Material.pdf">von CDT</a>.<br><br>Während wir den Kampf gegen die Chatkontrolle fortführen, müssen wir den Widerstand noch weiter ausbauen:</p>



 
 Erklär deinen Bekannten, warum das ein wichtiges Thema ist. <a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/cwyRic7cC5zcfHk?path=%2FVideos%2Fall%20languages">Dieses kurze Video</a>, das in alle europäische Sprachen übersetzt wurde, kann ein hilfreicher Anfang sein. Du kannst es frei nutzen und teilen! Auch verfügbar auf <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpGSqroLomg">YouTube</a> und <a href="https://digitalcourage.video/w/mNHKXBrVHgsRAFzXFvXG63">PeerTube</a>. 



 Aktiv zu werden funktioniert besser und ist motivierender, wenn man zusammenarbeitet. Versuche also, Verbündete zu finden und Allianzen zu schmieden. Ob in einem lokalen Hackspace oder in einem Sportverein: Deine lokale Aktionsgruppe gegen Chatkontrolle kann überall an den Start gehen. Dann könnt ihr kreativ werden und überlegen, welche Art von Aktion am besten zu euch passt. 
 



<p>Werde jetzt aktiv. Der Widerstand gegen die Chatkontrolle sind wir alle!</p>

<p>Offene Fragen</p>



 
 Wer hat an den Treffen der EuGoingDark-Arbeitsgruppe und ihrer Unter-Arbeitsgruppen teilgenommen? Teilnehmerlisten sind nach wie vor <a href="https://digitalcourage.social/@echo_pbreyer/111499644713378703">Verschlusssache</a> . <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/why-privacy-matters/going-dark">Mullvad VPN</a> hat berichtet, dass, mindestens ein ehemaliger US-Geheimdienstler teilgenommen hat. 



 Warum wurden digitale Grundrechte-NGOs wie etwa <a href="https://edri.org/?s=going+dark">EDRi</a> auch auf Nachfrage nicht zu den Treffen der Arbeitsgruppe eingeladen obwohl diese laut Website eine „kollaborative und integrative Plattform für Interessengruppen“ ist? 



 Wurden die Transparenzregeln der Gruppe mitten im Arbeitsprozess heimlich ausgetauscht und dabei massiv eingeschränkt? Die <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2024-001335_EN.html">schriftliche Anfrage von Dr. Patrick Breyer</a> dazu ist nach wie vor unbeantwortet. 



 Warum sind die Arbeitsgruppe und ihre Unter-Arbeitsgruppen nicht im <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/home?lang=de">Register für Expertengruppen und ähnliche Foren</a>  (z. B. Beratungsgremien) der Kommission eingetragen, wodurch ihre Transparenz stark eingeschränkt ist? 



 Wie bewerten die neuen, direkt und indirekt mit den betroffenen Themen befassten Kommissarinnen und Kommissare der EU-Kommission, die Europäischen Bürgerbeauftragte, die Datenschutzbeauftragten der EU und der Mitgliedsländer, IT-Sicherheitsexperten, Verbraucherschutzverbände und andere die Arbeitsweise und Pläne der #EuGoingDark-Gruppe?

This public internet of IP addresses and domain names was released in 1996 for public consumption.</p><p>Vint Cerf, co-creator of TCP/IP at DARPA, via private communication with author while at MCI, in question about why TCP/IP deployment via domain registries prioritized a renter model of cost support rather than an owner model, answered: "that was considered in 1976 and discarded".</p><p>As a result of this discarded consideration, and subsequent growth of TCP/IP use in American/Global civil societies, the original intent of DARPA within the engineering design choices made in 1976, prior and after, end "users" of this innovative technology have received a relationship structure via this infrastructure giving meaning and utility to data at scale ("Big Data"), and as of 2023, artificial intelligence systems deriving utility from public sources of data derived by human interactions. This relationship structure is well-informed by basic definitions in computing and economics, such as "renter", or "slave".</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiHf2omtWayFI4VUzkAFQK1SnKjtKVmXj4khqZ8rM2lz5z8tkg_DM3CBEtQYO2q5tb508dlm3DJK_fNcyW7rfHe4RdSZfDmZ6cwc4dNcGPXlP720b-Z4_rTW0ruGtkeMTZZxtg_qgEhCkahYfJDiGzYQ3wKUI9RqLvI4W7L1AJPayg3GR_hh6bXUA"></a> <br><br><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;Data Slave: Renter</p><p>As a result of an engineering design process aimed at goals conceived of by DARPA, and subsequent deployment of public access technologies within American civil society in coordination with the National Science Foundation, "We The People" have received an architectural relationship to the utilities built atop this infrastructure. As can be viewed by inspecting the subsequent TCP/IP dependent solutions where human data interactions are enticed/suggested/served/supported/scaled, people have been packaged as "data product" to be sold to "customers of data context" by the "Master" of such web interactions as a webmaster may serve from time to time.

"We the People" exist as a data structure, a deeply personal one.

Every human life that acquires a birth certificate, whether for your child or another, or for yourself when needed, understands how a data structure works. Lawyers will understand that "Rights" are for people, not birth certificates. But try proving that at the border of American Sovereignty where it matters. Words don't accomplish much in those moments, especially legalese.&nbsp;</p><p>Structure yields results at the border. Root administration over the data structure of American Sovereignty is an edge-driven experience. It happens at the authentic border of authentic Sovereignty itself, or it doesn't. And when it doesn't, there is a reason. This is where failures carry meaning, and can instruct us on flaws in need of fixes.</p><p>When DARPA yielded TCP/IP and the NSF made it public, there were other examples that perhaps the notions of future utility were not adequately conceived, and were going to need fixes to flaws faster than originally understood. IPv4 -&gt; IPv6 is one such example... the system was going to run out of addressable spaces to serve the inter-network to users. Other examples are the increasing absence of a default archival system, and IAM work to service the identity space where citizen identifiers are utilized broadly, as the ultimate data silo.</p><p>If given a choice, which one do you look to by default for more information:</p><p>&nbsp;Slave: Renter</p><p>&nbsp;Root: Owner</p><p>Without any additional information concerning architectural choices, infrastructure requirements, engineering design choices, or participatory patterns of engagement... which do you select?</p><p>Functional literacy for American citizens REQUIRES a new consideration of 1976 choices, once more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

  Introducing the SQL/JSON Path package, a PostgresSQL-compatible jsonpath

<p>For a personal project, I needed to parse and execute PostgreSQL-compatible
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/datatype-json.html#DATATYPE-JSONPATH" title="PostgreSQL Docs: jsonpath Type">jsonpath</a> expressions.<a>1</a> So I’ve spent just about every spare evening and
weekend the last several months porting Postgres jsonpath to Go, and it’s
finally ready to ship.</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="https://github.com/theory/sqljson" title="theory/gosqljson: PostgreSQL-compatible SQL-standard SQL/JSON in Go">Go SQL/JSON</a>, featuring the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/sqljson/path" title="go.pkg.dev: github.com/theory/sqljson/path">path package</a>. This project provides
full support for all of the PostgresSQL 17 jsonpath features<a>2</a> in the
Go programming language. An <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/sqljson/path#example-package-WithVars">example</a>:</p>
  <code>package main

import (
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/theory/sqljson/path"
	"github.com/theory/sqljson/path/exec"

func main() {
	// Parse some JSON.
	var value any
	err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(`{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}`), &amp;value)
	if err != nil {

</code>  <p>I think the API is decent, but may implement better patterns as I discover
them. Overall I’m quite satisfied with how it turned out, and just how well
its implementation and performance compare to the original.</p>
 🛝 Playground 
<p>But why stop there? One of the nice things about this project is that Go
supports compiling applications into <a href="https://webassembly.org">WebAssembly</a> (a.k.a. Wasm) via <a href="https://go.dev/wiki/WebAssembly" title="Go Wiki: WebAssembly">Go
WebAssembly</a>. Borrowing from the <a href="https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/" title="yuin/goldmark: 🏆 A markdown parser written in Go">Goldmark</a> project, I created and published
the <a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/playground">sqljson/path playground</a> and populated <a href="https://github.com/theory/sqljson/blob/main/path/README.md" title="Go SQL/JSON Path: The SQL/JSON Path Language">the docs</a> with links for all of
its examples.</p>
<p>Now anyone can experiment with SQL/JSON path expressions, and share links to
demonstrate patterns and techniques. The Playground is a stateless
JavaScript/Wasm web application: data persists only in permalink
URLs.<a>3</a></p>

<p>I’ve enjoyed learning how to implement a lexer, a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goyacc" title="pkg.go.dev: golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goyacc">goyacc</a> parser, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" title="Wikipedia: Abstract syntax tree">AST</a>,
and an execution engine. The Playground was a bonus bit of fun!</p>
<p>I’m stoked to build cool stuff on this package, but don’t know whether anyone
else will find it useful. If you do — or just enjoy messing about on the
Playground, let me know!</p>

<p>Von den Chats, die mithilfe der “freiwilligen Chatkontrolle” der US-Konzerne (allen voran Meta) an die Polizei geleakt werden, ist ein so geringer Anteil wie noch nie tatsächlich strafrechtlich relevant – zuletzt sogar weniger als die Hälfte. <a href="https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/JahresberichteUndLagebilder/SexualdeliktezNvKindernuJugendlichen/BLBSexualdeliktezNvKindernuJugendlichen2023.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4">Dies ergibt sich aus dem heute veröffentlichten „Bundeslagebild Sexualdelikte“ des BKA. </a>Danach ist die Zahl der zumeist automatisiert an das BKA ausgeleiteten Chatverläufe von 2022 auf 2023 massiv gestiegen (von 136.450 auf 180.300 Chats), die Zahl der für strafrechtlich relevant befundenen Chatverläufe aber zurückgegangen (von 89.850 auf 89.350 Chats).</p>



<p>„Die Zerstörung unseres Briefgeheimnisses nimmt immer dramatischere Ausmaße an“, kritisiert der Europaabgeordenete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer. „Erstmals sind mehr als die Hälfte der ausgeleiteten Chats völlig legal. Noch nie sind so viele private und intime Familienfotos, Partnerfotos, Sexting durch Kinder usw. in Hände gelangt, in die sie nicht gehören und in denen sie nicht sicher sind. Dass die Bundesregierung diese freiwillige Chatkontrolle unterstützt, ist der völlig falsche Weg. Unsere Kinder werden durch die Chatkontrolle massenhaft kriminalisiert, anstatt sie zu schützen – selbst wenn sie aus eigenen Stücken Selbstaufnahmen verschicken.</p>



<p>Nach meinen Informationen ist die Ursache dieser Rekord-Unzuverlässigkeit, dass einige Plattformen angefangen haben, Textchats nach Schlüsselwörtern zu scannen, denen jeder Bezug zu Kindesmissbrauch fehlt. Mit den privaten Schnüffelalgorithmen werden Millionen verdient, die Hersteller lobbyieren aber gegen jegliche Zuverlässigkeitsanforderungen, Transparenz und unabhängige wissenschaftliche Überprüfung.<br>Die von der Bundesregierung unterstützte eigenmächtige Chatkontrolle 1.0 ist ein gefährlicher Irrweg der US-Konzerne. Sie konnte die Menge des ‚verdächtigen‘ Materials an den teilnehmenden Plattformen nie eindämmen. Die Entlastung der Polizei von der Flut zum großen Teil falscher Verdachtsmeldungen würde Kapazitäten für die verstärkte Verfolgung und verdeckte Ermittlungen gegen organisierten Kindesmissbrauchs freimachen, was Kinder wirklich schützt und die Hintermänner stoppt. Big Tech unterlässt wirklich wirksame Schutzmaßnahmen durch sichere Gestaltung sozialer Netzwerke (Security by Design), weil sie ihren Profiten schaden würden. Warum werden Nutzer etwa nicht durchgängig und altersunabhängig gefragt, bevor ihre Fotos öffentlich sichtbar sind und sie für Fremde ansprechbar sind? Naheliegende Schutzmaßnahmen vor sexueller Annäherung sind wirksamer als jede ungezielte Massenüberwachung!”</p>



<p>Breyer klagt aktuell gegen die freiwillige Chatkontrolle vor dem Oberlandesgericht Schleswig. Auch die Klage eines Missbrauchsbetroffenen ist anhängig.</p>

<p>My family, on my dad’s side, were Jews from Poland and Ukraine. His parents came to America before the shit hit the fan, but I grew up knowing two people who weren’t so lucky. Seymour Mayer lived across the street during my teens. And Annie Braunschweig, who we knew as Brownie, had taken care of my sister and me as four- and five-year-old kids when our mom – unusually at that time – went back to work full-time teaching at a university. Both Seymour and Brownie were survivors of Nazi concentration camps, with tattooed numbers on their arms.</p>
<p>I never heard Seymour talk about it. Brownie rarely did, though I remember one story about a mother who tossed her swaddled baby to a stranger as the train was leaving to take her to the gas chambers.</p>
<p>Very few survivors remain. And there are not many of us who have known survivors. I’ve thought a lot, over the years, about what happens when that kind of personal connection ends, and living memories fall off the continental shelf into the deep ocean of history. I suspect the Holocaust may seem no more real, to many born in this century, than the Spanish Inquisition.</p>
<p>I don’t know if Seymour and Brownie ever read “It Can’t Happen Here” but I am pretty sure they’d have thought it absolutely can, they’d be even more horrified in this moment than many of us are, and they’d reject the fatalism that I see taking root among friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t happened yet,” they’d say, “you can still prevent it, do not despair prematurely, there is still time, but you must find a way to focus your efforts and unite all whose votes can matter.” </p>

<p>That little voice whispered it was time to get out of the apartment and clear my head. I’d been working on additions to a map for several days, and it was going slower than I wanted it to go. My mother, in her 80s, moved into assisted living last month. As is to be expected, all the changes have been difficult for her. Compounding that, our communication lines seem to be experiencing a lot of psychic static; an ongoing family curse. So I’m trying to navigate that even as my own circumstances are still unsettled, at least for another month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does one undertake the responsibilities of a good daughter, when for some reason the gate to a mother’s heart continues to malfunction? Can you insert yourself into someone’s life if all signs indicate you’re not really welcome? Maybe not yet. Maybe things have to get worse before resolution is possible. When does the child take on the role of the mother? It doesn’t feel like a role that can be stepped into gracefully. Plus, I don’t have anyone physically here in my corner to lean on, which is not what I expected at this stage of the game. I guess I should see it as an opportunity to exercise my self-reliance muscles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite offers of assistance, none were warmly welcomed. So I’m left with a lot of question marks. I send flowers and prayers across several thousand miles and try to come to terms with my situation. A friend found a small medallion in a parking lot with the inscription “Family Is Everything” only to later realize that it was a Disney branded trinket, which put a new spin on the pithy trope. No, not everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every family comes with its own lessons, and oh those morphogenetic fields can be a bear. Perhaps the best thing is to offer what you can with an open, tender, and decidedly imperfect heart and let the pieces fall where they may. I think we do this more than once. Maybe my mother and I have done it a hundred times already. Maybe this round I fared better than in the last one, and in the next I’ll make more progress. It’s the journey, right? Not the destination…</p>
<p>So I drove across town to my rented PO box to pick up a book and some linen fabric I’d treated myself to. The colors are gray cashmere and Montana grape, which will make a lovely skirt and blouse for fall. I’m looking forward to pulling out my sewing machine and embroidery floss again. The purchase, which was spurred on by an emailed discount code, was my way of staking a claim on that future. The book was Bohm and Hiley’s “The Undivided Universe.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impatient and curious, I flipped through the pages on quantum consciousness in the parking lot as I placed the packages in the trunk and blanched at the equations therein. I really am hopeless with math and physics, but hopefully I can glean some insights on active information and the meaning of our oneness. As much as my mother exasperates me, I love her and I suspect she loves me too, just as I love my prodigal child. The signals are choppy – entangled human weather in the swirling gyre.</p>
<p>My inner voice said take the growing collection of feathers on the shelf above the desk here in the apartment. There is a strange giant gold hand with some books around it that clearly came from the decorator, books by the yard, not ones that were actually ever read by anyone. In the hand I’d placed a sprig of mistletoe that fell out onto the windshield of my car from the towering willow oaks that line the street where I’m staying. I have a small pile of stones, pinecones, and other bits and bobs. I put most of the feathers and a few of the stones in a soul-bright yellow canvas bag my friend Juliana entrusted to me during our Lititz foray. I decided on my way back I’d stop at “Space Odyssey” Allsopp Park and make a heartfelt intention for my mom during this time of her bumpy transition.</p>
<p>I think my hearts confound some people. They don’t know how to integrate the Alison that makes maps about inscrutable things with the Alison who walks around making patterns with acorns and leaves. I think some people think I ought to be embarrassed, perhaps not that I make them, but that I share them publicly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though I used to consider myself a progressive, I began to see that I’m really more spiritually-minded than materialist inclined. I have my reasons for being skeptical of institutional faith communities, but I do feel the pull towards a benevolent creator. The gift of sacred cyclical beauty in nature is part of that. A woman on Facebook inspired my hearts. She posted photos spelling out “love” in sticks and stones. During that terrible period of the lockdowns, it felt like a meaningful affirmation and it still does.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is an implicate order, why not seek to communicate with it? For me, making hearts is like a guided meditation. I’m not a good meditator in the regular sense. My wheelhouse is symbol and story. For me, the practice works, and I share it, because it may work for other people too. Someone gifted me a version of their prayer, and I made it my own, and so may it be for others if it makes sense in your life. If not, feel free to immerse yourself in my maps instead. They are both valuable sides of the complex pattern that is Alison McDowell this time around.</p>
<p>I was still working at the garden during Covid, so I had ample materials to work with. Eventually, I decided laying out a heart shape was preferable to using words. Ever since I’ve made 3-4 hearts a month with nature’s findings. Sometimes I do it to neutralize fraught energy in a place I’ve researched, but not always. Sometimes I simply do it as a way to reaffirm my place in the world. With each I offer an intention for “life, health, and open paths” that Cliff Gomes taught me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I hoarded materials, thinking that was what was needed; but with time, I realized the gift of a public heart is a reflection of a given place. Rather than bringing new materials to a spot, it was better to seek out the message from the location itself. What communication awaits? The trickiest part of heart-making is finding materials to outline the shape. From there, you can decorate inside and outside with a smattering of this or that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I got out of the car with my little yellow sack, I first saw a bountiful native pollinator garden full of sunflowers and bee balm and ironweed, a towering presence with deep purple flowers that I remember standing guard over the lower garden in high summer. I didn’t pick any of them though. The bees and wasps were enjoying them too much. I turned to head down the path and saw a giant wild wisteria vine clambering into a tree. The blossoms were spent, but there were a dozen or so soft, green velvet seed pods. That’s what I picked for the outline of today’s heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wisteria is named for the Wistar family of Philadelphia, peers of John Bartram, glass makers, and doctors. In the late nineteenth-century the Wistar Institute, which is located on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, became one of the first biomedical research labs in the world with a focus on vaccines. The first standardized experimental lab rat was created there, the Wistar rat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, some ferny wild carrot tops caught my eye. I didn’t harvest any, but a wave of remembrance came over me for the summers of my childhood where I played in the dirt lots and tree lines of corporate suburbs in the making. Those summers in the late 1970s and early 1980s where carrot beings anchored themselves into the imaginative world building exercises of feral youth. Even as my adult world has fallen apart, that broken-ness gifted me the chance to renew my connection with the younger version of Alison, the one who would jump the fence onto a neighboring farm to walk the creek and pretend she lived in Narnia.</p>
<p>I left the pavement and took the high route up the wooded hillside. At the bottom I scooped up a few small pieces of bark from a fallen branch that was coated with a bluish-green lichen, still damp from the thunderstorm that rolled in this morning after weeks of dry heat. The storm knocked the dust down and you could still smell the earthiness of the soil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The walk up was uneven and rocky. “We are shapes of the Earth” as John (or Tina) Trudell would say. Their refrain came to me as my sandals found footing among the loose stones. A few slices found their way into my bag, including a shard pierced by a round hole the size of a quarter. The path affirmed our mineral connection. Gray slate of ancient sea beds pitched vertically with cataclysmic force; the sheets splayed out like a library of plundered books with bindings broken, quires unmoored. The consciousness of those stones spoke my language of order lost to chaos, but with elegance and meaning, undertones of their present disheveled arrangement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the top of the hill was a signpost. I took a turn to the right and followed along the edge of a small ravine to where the Nandina grew. I thought about the Hot Springs park ranger berating the shrub for being an interloper, but it has a special place in my heart. After I left home, my parents moved into a house with an elaborately landscaped yard. There was a hedge of Nandina and I dug up a sprout and brought it home with me to Philadelphia where it flourished in our small patio garden. I would have to cut it back pretty vigorously every year and it never flowered like it did in the South, but it reminded me of my dad, so of course I grabbed a sprig and put it on the bag.</p>
<p>I also saw three purple mist flowers, blue boneset. I love purple, so I put them in, too. There were also huge stands of poke on the other side of the path. Their flower panicles were in just the early stages of white and green, before the intense purple berries arrive. The white, pink, and green pokeweed always reminds me of the preppy era when pink and green attire was all the rage in middle school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my walk, the woods were infused with R&amp;B music from a distant picnic pavilion. When I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed a white pick-up truck towing a huge barbeque grill. There were a bunch of families having a cookout, which made me think about the big gatherings you see on summer weekends in Fairmount Park. It made me a tiny bit homesick, but in a good way.</p>
<p>When I used to live near <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/04/10/one-thought-can-produce-millions-of-vibrations-and-they-all-go-back-to-god-a-love-supreme/">John Coltrane’s Philadelphia house on 33rd Street</a>, they had papers in the windows with the saying “one thought can create millions of vibrations and they all go back to God.” So, I go into nature with questions and an inner knowing that on the other side at least it will be ok; we will all be ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can make an offering to try and harmonize the present moment of uncertainty. It may look like a milky quartz stone surrounded by lichen and feathers and pinecones and wisteria pods with a smattering of purple, because that’s what I like. That’s what little Ally liked, too. And we can weave a story of love even if the creaky lock is stuck, because one day it will open. The vibrations are slipping under the threshold and loosening the resistance. The path is open. We just need to find our way to the trailhead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not a nihilist. I’m studying the quantum and ontopoesis and the participatory universe, because I know that love finds a way. Meg knew that. Patience isn’t my strong suit, but this journey may carry across dimensions and I have to learn to endure and cultivate a sense of humor in the absurdity of it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spoiler alert – love wins!&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: I didn’t take my camera with me, so this heart will just have to live in your imagination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This three-hour chat with my friend Lynn Davenport of Dallas, Texas was initially triggered by my frustration with a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmGyGEyDOPc">RFK Jr. video</a> promoting blockchain as the future. </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmGyGEyDOPc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmGyGEyDOPc</a>
<p>While I wanted to deconstruct the silly nationalist tone of his video, promoters of decentralized ledger tech know that the whole point is peer-to-peer communication and borderless payment processing, we ended up having a much deeper conversation with many updates around education policy in the Lone Star state, including Open Education Resources (see our playlist of videos on that topic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO7Ieb_QCLhpyU8tMvMFmsiI">here</a>) and manufactured culture wars that are serving as a major distraction from getting people up to speed on the ethical implications of linking AI to hive mind, swarm intelligence protocol layers in the name of radical democracy. </p>
<p>I know most people are not going to make time to listen to the whole thing, so I pulled two short teaser clips. One is about the OER being blockchain badges, not Bible-study paper print outs as some Texas representatives would have you believe. The other is my frustration over the Diane Ravitch / Badass Teachers Association brain boxing and the perils of manufactured heroes and structured teaming. I am indebted to both, however, for giving me the eyes to see the role of RFK Jr. and health freeDOM influencers in steering consciousness and sheep dogging folks into the box canyon of Web3 quantified self wearables and wellness key performance indictors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today is Red White and Blue day – if you celebrate, please remember the superorganism has no flag!&nbsp;It’s time to get serious folks. Step away from your assigned team and start thinking for yourself.</p>
<p>Teaser #1: OER is about blockchain badges and digital ID. 2 Minutes</p>

What DALL-E thought DICE 2024&nbsp;was…<p>After decades with hundreds of conferences, DICE, the <a href="https://diceurope.org/">Digital Identity unConference Europe</a>, has quickly become one of my favourites. Firstly, because of the format, which I thoroughly enjoy and find incredibly useful at fostering meaningful conversations. Also, it is not a vendor sales driven event. Even competitors meet here and discuss possible solutions to current challenges openly. And lastly, because of the people. The mix of backgrounds, ages, experiences really makes for a diverse set of perspectives.</p> Competency <p>What’s more, the Swiss government is engaging at this conference in ways that are really unusual. Starting with <a href="https://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/en/home/the-fdjp/beat-jans.html/">Swiss Federal Council Beat Jans</a>, whose opening notes were competent to a level of detail that surpassed several of the regular participants, to the 13 Swiss governmental employees — most of them working on the <a href="https://www.eid.admin.ch/en">Swiss eID</a> — who held several sessions, and found themselves constructively engaging with the community on a wide variety of&nbsp;issues.</p><p>This dialog is also something that we’re experiencing on an ongoing basis within DIDAS, the<a href="https://www.didas.swiss/"> Swiss Digital Identity Association</a>, the organizers of this conference. But when Beat Jans went off-script in the following discussion, spoke about the critical nature of identity and drew connections of topics discussed during DICE to the political challenges around asylum seekers in Europe, it was truly impressive.</p><p>It was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rufftim/">Timothy Ruff</a> who during one of the sessions around <a href="https://keri.one">KERI</a> made an impassionate plea&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“Identity is a matter of life and&nbsp;death!”</blockquote><p>based on the understanding that problems in the design of the identity system will result in people losing their reputation, livelihood and health — causing deaths from suicide, murder and lack of proper healthcare.</p><p>The Federal Department of Justice and Police is responsible also for asylum seekers in Switzerland. Federal Council Jans is leading the department and gave practical perspectives for how accurate that assessment is. His answers reflected how seriously he takes these responsibilities and how mindful he is of the consequences of bad technological and political decisions.</p><p>Which makes it all the more unfortunate that some communities are still under-represented at DICE, especially people with security background.</p> Security <p>Considering the significance of identity, session announcements like “I know did:web is not secure, but I have built some tooling that makes it really easy to use” make me wonder whether it is perhaps a good idea many companies still struggle with adoption.</p><p>That is not to say did:web does not have a use case. We have for instance very successfully used it at <a href="https://vereign.com">Vereign</a> in rapid prototyping early stage Proof of Concept developments.</p><blockquote>And there will be use cases where did:web may prove sufficient. Basically, if classic Web 2.0 security with all its known attack vectors is deemed “good enough”, lack of privacy is not a concern, and tamper evidence is not required, did:web is an inexpensive method to put a thin “SSI Interaction Layer” on the classic&nbsp;Web.</blockquote><p>Use cases where this can be appropriate will mostly involve organisations in largely centralized structures. But as soon as natural people enter the picture, did:web is probably not such a great idea any more since it brings with it all the concerns that plague the current Web. It may still be ok for governmental use cases, but users should be aware that the system won’t really be “privacy by&nbsp;design.”</p><p>Because these issues are meanwhile widely known and documented, some people in the community now work on better versions of did:web. All the convenience, none of the disadvantages, or so it seems. Based on the sessions at DICE, the currently most popular such proposal is <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/trustdidweb/">did:tdw</a>, or “Trust DID&nbsp;Web.”</p> The problem with&nbsp;did:tdw <p>The means by which did:tdw aims to address the issues of did:web make it more complex, but ultimately less secure than did:web itself. And it’s the additions that were supposed to make it more secure that make it less so. Which in security circles will surprise no-one. It has happened to people thousands of&nbsp;times.</p><p>So what happened? Inspired by key pre-rotation in KERI as a means to allow recovering from compromise, and reacting to fundamental changes such as quantum cryptography, among other things, did:tdw also specifies a mechanism for key pre-rotation.</p><p>Borrowing from the KERI Key Event Log (KEL), it provides a JSON DID log, allowing to backtrace the rotations over time for the identifier in order to arrive at the root identifier. Which seems&nbsp;great.</p><p>But KERI also has a mechanism by which it can ensure that older versions of identifiers, using keys that have already been rotated, are no longer considered valid and trusted. This mechanism is provided by the witnesses and watchers in&nbsp;KERI.</p><blockquote>Trust DID Web has no such mechanism. Compromised keys remain valid, allowing an attacker to create a fully credible history of key rotation, arriving at their own current key, and validating back to the original root identifier they have taken&nbsp;over.</blockquote><p>So in the event of key takeover, the only thing stopping an attacker from impersonating an entity are the authoritative roots of trust based on DNS and TLS, as well as the security of the web server&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In fact, DID TDW also has a <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/trustdidweb/#moving-a-did">Move mechanism</a> which preserves the same identifier, but authoritatively moves it to another domain. So taking over DNS or the web server isn’t required. Because even without resorting to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">IDN Homograph Attack</a> there are plenty of “credible enough” domains available to an attacker.</p><blockquote>For the benefit of people not familiar with the IDN Homograph Attack: Large parts of the security model of Web 2.0 — and consequently did:web and did:tdw — depend on humans being alerted by the difference between did:tdw:vеrеign.com and did:tdw:vereign.com when not paying attention.</blockquote><p>And yes, did:tdw has a section about <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/trustdidweb/#international-domain-names">International Domain Names</a>. But whenever security people see something like this in a specification, experience tells them someone is bound to get this wrong, someone is bound to get burned, and the user is going to get damage and blame as is commonplace in our industry&nbsp;today:</p><p>Most of these vulnerabilities result from combining identity and identifier together in a DID. Which is how the web works. A URL is an explicit identity statement. Users are meant to assume the domain microsoft.com is authoritative for the Microsoft company identity.</p><p>So while the desire to create easier migration paths and integration scenarios for Web2 services is understandable, the result is an import of explicit identity assumption into SSI that is problematic.</p><p>KERI — and some other methods — avoid this by using Autonomous Identifiers (AIDs) instead. Which unlike DNS names also do not have such a high risk of being considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) under data protection law.</p><blockquote>Adding key pre-rotation in did:tdw was meant to increase security, but has ultimately achieved the opposite. Using ephemeral identifiers or the much simpler did:web are the better choice for security.</blockquote><p>And if using did:tdw cannot be helped or avoided, the next key commitment is better left empty. Key pre-rotation in did:tdw should never be used, and a fresh identifier should be generated instead.</p> /whois service&nbsp;endpoint <p>That is not to say did:tdw does not have some good ideas to contribute to the domain. Personally I think the <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/trustdidweb/#the-whois-use-case">/whois endpoint</a> is an intriguing idea. Organizations might start to routinely provide their verifiable presentation of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">GLEIF vLEI</a> at that endpoint, allowing for an easier automatic discovery and verification of organizational identities.</p><p>And I really hope that the above is received in the way it was meant: As honest and constructive criticism, and perhaps a reminder of why early peer review at conceptual stage should include people with security background. Security is hard. And very easy to get wrong. All of us have fallen into traps laid by our own mind&nbsp;before.</p><p>So I really hope that more people from the security community will join that particular dialog and help us avoid making mistakes in the identity infrastructure of the future that may otherwise prove fatal — and not only in the metaphorical sense.</p> eIDAS 2.0 <p>All of this is relevant context especially because the European Union has been working on the electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market, also known as <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a>. In essence, eIDAS 1.0 has been an adoption failure due to the involvement of the centralized administrative trust industry, i.e. Certification Authorities, which ended up choking the market before it even&nbsp;existed.</p><blockquote>eIDAS 2.0 was supposed to correct that adoption failure, among other things by enabling Self Sovereign Identity and less centralized approaches. After years of very active participation by the centralized administrative trust industry, they are now again deeply interwoven with the regulation.</blockquote><p>This is reflected in the technical choices, which are mostly based on Web 2.0, including usage of did:web, which was <a href="https://rubric.cc/podcast/2156/">never intended by its authors</a> for this kind of use case, and which does not technically protect privacy and security as much as would be possible.</p><p>Understandably, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-architecture-and-reference-framework-outline">European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework</a> was a big topic at DICE 2024, with several sessions touching upon the pilots and the implementation of&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>One of the most important take-aways was the complexity that had meanwhile fully sunk in to wallet implementors, and a certain level of frustration that even made its way into the final conclusion round in the form of comments “whether it would be possible to implement this, at&nbsp;all.”</p><p>Complexity has always been used as a barrier to market entry for competition by the centralized administrative trust industry. So it is perhaps not surprising it’s also being employed against competition from the SSI space. And perhaps the end result will be that European Citizens will need to wait for eIDAS 3.0 for a truly privacy by design, decentralized, affordable and usable eID without gatekeepers that will see some large scale adoption. Time will&nbsp;tell.</p><blockquote>Which then could perhaps draw inspiration from Switzerland where the work on the eID is happening with a somewhat different focus and in process that is more open, participatory and transparent than any other I’ve seen in the past. The declared goal is to end up with a system that is as secure as we can make it, and offers protection of privacy that is technical, and not just administrative.</blockquote> KERI <p>To my knowledge, the currently best proposal to achieve that is the <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> by Sam Smith, who was participating at DICE this year, and whose sessions were exceptional. Personally I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the security architecture deep dive, where Sam took us on a tour of how his own understanding evolved.</p><p>The path from administrative root of trust, over ledgers as a global, technical root of trust, to a system like KERI, which uses what might be described as a “locally consistent, tamper evident” approach, which brings benefits in terms of scalability (no need to establish a global consensus all the time) and also practical benefits like garbage collection (no need for test ledgers for fears of cluttering up expensive global storage).</p><p>Following Sams route through this evolution reminded me of my own. The next step along that route will be the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification/">Trust Spanning Protocol</a> which is currently being worked on at the Trust over IP Foundation.</p>Sam Smith at DICE2024 talking about the Trust Spanning&nbsp;Layer<p>It’s been great to see the interest in KERI throughout DICE. Sessions were many, lively and packed. Yet from talking to people at the conference it seems there is still a gap that keeps us as a community to rally behind KERI. So what is that&nbsp;gap?</p><blockquote>As of today, KERI is already in production issuing vLEI credentials at <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">GLEIF</a>, based on the Python reference implementation. Which is a great achievement.</blockquote><p>But there is still very little information available about the current network of Witnesses and Watchers, and thus no way to make an informed decision about the actual security of the current&nbsp;system.</p><p>Also, in conversations with third parties, I’ve come across a concern of using Python at protocol level in a security critical, network connected backend&nbsp;service.</p><p>Partially due to concerns of a lack of competency within the organisation to adequately understand the entire application and maintain it, if necessary. And partially due to concerns about maintaining and supporting Python in production which have been <a href="https://josvisser.substack.com/p/why-python-is-terrible">outlined by Jos Visser</a> last&nbsp;year.</p><p>Many of the people I’ve spoken to seem to wait for a complete KERI agent that can be wrapped and integrated into the frontend or backend interchangeably, using the same technology stack and implementation.</p><p>Which means ideally it ought to be in a language like Rust which plays well both with Javascript / Typescript, the dominant choice on the client side, and Golang, Java or other technology in the&nbsp;backend.</p><p>In order to allow KERI to develop rapidly in both specification and implementation at the same time, Python is of course a great&nbsp;choice.</p><p>I believe it would be in the interest of our community to make sure we allow Sam Smith to continue focusing on the hard conceptual issues, and delivering them as both specification and reference implementation going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>But to increase adoption and build a community, we should also provide an implementation in Rust (or language with similar properties) for a full agent with tooling and libraries that can be deployed on any device, with any number of resource constraints, and inside any technology family. Ideally it would also provide command line tooling to facilitate easy scripting and experimentation.</p><blockquote>All the cryptographic operations of the Python reference implementation are already in low-level libraries, many of which are written in C and some in&nbsp;Rust.</blockquote><p>In addition, the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">Human Colossus Foundation</a> has started work on a Rust implementation, which has seen substantial development over the past years. On the other hand, being published under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#EUPL-1.2">EUPL</a> may have inhibited adoption somewhat, and it seems that it already diverged to some degree from the reference implementation.</p><p>Another valiant attempt at a Rust implementation has been <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keriox">KERIOX</a>, but that hasn’t seen a lot of contribution in the past two&nbsp;years.</p><blockquote>If we want to see adoption of KERI to speed up and eventually reach critical mass, we should focus on avoiding fragmentation of effort. Perhaps using a common vehicle to align resources so we can reach a state where we can point toward a full set of complete implementations with good documentation and examples, as well as reference nodes and a bit of marketing which would then be crucial to promote adoption in the technical community.</blockquote><p>Getting this done is not rocket science. But it must start somewhere and can then improve over time. I’d love to hear from people who’d like to collaborate toward this end. Because helping ourselves while working together is what we do in the software freedom community.</p><p>And if you would like to learn more about KERI in the meantime, the <a href="https://kerisse.org">KERI Suite Search Engine (KERISSE)</a> has a lot of great resource to get you&nbsp;started.</p> Principles of Governance <p>On closing, I’d like to go back to Timothy Ruff again, whose <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ykWiSvpBxVSZYA2BidSBixwEwYp0C7cRl133jS6e0jo/edit">session on models for government</a> was intriguing. Basically, he proposes to break down the values for governments into functions of Utility, Security and Autonomy.</p><p>His postulate is that virtually all governments have an interest in functioning well, and being secure. But when it comes to the level of Autonomy, and issues such as transparency of government towards its citizens, or privacy of citizens vis a vis the government, there is a sliding scale of expectations, which is largely cultural in&nbsp;nature.</p><p>At face value, that seems to hold true. Although I would argue that there are also governments that have a similar sliding scale for Utility and Security. Because lack of Utility can keep people so occupied with daily chores that they do not think about overthrowing the government. And lack of Security can increase the desire for a strong leader. Likewise, lack of both can even keep different factions in the government at bay because they are too busy to complain about one another while struggling with somehow getting their job&nbsp;done.</p><p>It might be an interesting exercise to look at different countries around the world to see where they fall on these sliding scales from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). For instance Switzerland is aiming for a (10, 10, 10) with its eID System. But finds the need for compatibility with the EU; which is closer to (8, 8, 6), now putting challenges ahead of Switzerland in its practical ability to get close to that&nbsp;goal.</p><blockquote>Where would you place your own country or region in this&nbsp;scale?</blockquote> DICE 2025 <p>In any case: DICE 2024 was an amazing confererence, to the extent that people were asking to perhaps hold it twice a year during the closing session. While I am sure the organizers briefly had a slight heart attack at the thought, no better compliment can or need be&nbsp;given.</p><p>Make sure to keep an eye out for the next edition and register early. This year has been at maximum capacity, and there were no last minute tickets available any&nbsp;more.</p> Addendum <p>Have you been able to detect the difference between those two DIDs in the section about the IDN Homograph Attack?</p><blockquote>If not, this article successfully conducted a so-called “Punycode Attack” on&nbsp;you.</blockquote><p>If you look very closely, you will notice the “e” is slightly bolder in the font used on Medium. In some other fonts, the lower bound of the upper part of the e is slightly slanted. And in some fonts, they look entirely the&nbsp;same.</p><p>You can make it a bit more obvious by using a tool like <a href="https://www.punycoder.com/">Punycoder.com</a>. If you cut &amp; paste only the domain parts of both DIDs, you should see something like&nbsp;this:</p><p>So while they may look the same, they are not the&nbsp;same.</p><p>Which is a fundamental weakness in all DNS based methods with human readable identifiers. Which is what the Web relies on for its security.</p><blockquote>By using Web based methods, Self-Sovereign Identity is opening itself to a whole host of attack vectors which are very hard to defend against, and with which attackers have decades of sophisticated experience.</blockquote><p>Which is the point I was trying to demonstrate, above. So I hope you’ll forgive me the Punycode attack — it was purely for educational purposes.</p>

<p>Auf <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2024-000826_DE.html">Anfrage des Europaabgeordneten der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer hat sich EU-Binnenmarktkommissar Breton zu Herstellern</a>, die ihre Produkte mit Abschalteinrichtungen oder „kill switches“ ausstatten, geäußert. Anlass für diese Anfrage war ein aktueller Fall, bei dem festgestellt wurde, dass der polnische Zughersteller NewAg in mehrere elektrische Triebzüge „Abschalteinrichtungen“ eingebaut hat, die unter bestimmten Bedingungen (Standort oder Betriebsdauer) die Stromzufuhr und die Kompressoren des Zuges abschalten. Durch die Abschaltfunktion wollte der Hersteller u.a. eine Reparatur der Züge durch Konkurrenzunternehmen und auch eine Analyse der Zugsoftware verhindern. In <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2024-000826-ASW_DE.pdf">seiner Antwort</a> räumt EU-Kommissar Breton ein, dass bestehende oder geplante EU-Regeln zum Recht auf Reparatur weitgehend auf den Schutz von Verbrauchern beschränkt sind und auf Betriebsvermögen keine Anwendung finden.</p>



<p>Patrick Breyer kommentiert:</p>



<p>„Diese Praxis einiger Hersteller, die Reparatur und Wartung ihrer Produkte durch unabhängige Unternehmen zu erschweren oder gar zu verhindern, ist inakzeptabel. Die EU sollte klare Regelungen schaffen, um derartige Übergriffe zu unterbinden und die Rechte der Läufer sowie die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit unabhängiger Reparaturdienste zu schützen. Das Recht auf Reparatur muss genauso für Unternehmenskunden gelten.</p>



<p>Ein bloßes Recht auf Reparatur greift im Informationszeitalter aber zu kurz. Nutzer müssen die volle Kontrolle über die Technologie haben, die sie in ihrem täglichen Leben verwenden. Wir müssen das Recht haben, unsere rechtmäßig erworbenen Geräte selbst zu verändern, anzupassen und zu verbessern. Dass das Urheberrecht dies bisher ausschließt, ist entmündigend und lädt zu Missbrauch ein, wie der polnische Fall zeigt.“</p>



<p>Eine ähnliche Problematik wird auch bei Computerspielen beobachtet, bei denen Hersteller beliebte Spiele nach Belieben unbrauchbar machen. In Zusammenarbeit mit der <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/computerspiele-sterben-piraten-fordern-kulturschutz-fuer-games/">Spielerinitiative „Stop killing games“ fordert Patrick Breyer einen Kulturschutz für Games.</a></p>

<p>This article looks at different ways to create hashes in .NET Core. Hashes are useful for one way encryption which can be used for password storage, JWT validation and some other security use cases. When storing hashes in a database, extra care must be taken and the recommended approach from Microsoft should be used when implementing this. In general, creating hashes and storing the hashes in a database should be avoided as much as possible</p>







<p></p>



 History 



 
 2024-07-01 Updated the SHA512 hash methods using feedback from Kévin Chalet 
 



 Using SHA512 



<p>The fastest and simplest way is to user the SHA512 directly. This takes a string and hashes it directly using a one way encryption. This is good when the hashes are not persisted in a database or when attackers don’t have time to do a dictionary attack.</p>


  public static string ToHashedCodeV1(string code)
{
	using var sha512 = SHA512.Create();
	var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(code);
	var hash = sha512.ComputeHash(bytes);
	return Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
}

public static bool VerifyCodeV1(string code, string storedCode)
{
	using var sha512 = SHA512.Create();
	var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(code);
	var hash = sha512.ComputeHash(bytes);

	var storedHash = Convert.FromBase64String(storedCode);

	return CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals(hash, storedHash);
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The SHA512.HashDataAsync method can also be used to create the hashes.</p>


  public static async Task&lt;string&gt; ToHashedCodeV2(string code)
{
	var bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(code);
	var hash = await SHA512.HashDataAsync(new MemoryStream(bytes));
	return Convert.ToHexString(hash);
}

public static async Task&lt;bool&gt; VerifyCodeV2(string code, string storedCode)
{
	var storedHash = Convert.FromHexString(storedCode);

	var bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(code);
	var hash = await SHA512.HashDataAsync(new MemoryStream(bytes));

	return CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals(hash, storedHash);
}
  


<p></p>



 Using Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2 



<p>The Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2 method can be used to create hashes and when using this, a salt of 8 bytes or more should be used and more than 10000 iterations. This makes it harder to reverse engineer the original hash values. </p>


  private const int _keySize = 32;
private const int _iterations = 10000;
private static readonly HashAlgorithmName _algorithm = HashAlgorithmName.SHA512;

public static string ToHashedCode(string toHash, string userId)
{
     var salt = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(userId);

     var hash = Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2(
         toHash,
         salt,
         _iterations,
         _algorithm,
         _keySize
     );

     return Convert.ToBase64String(hash);
}

public static bool VerifyCode(string code, string userId, string storedCode)
{
     var salt = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(userId);
     var storedHash = Convert.FromBase64String(storedCode);

     var hash = Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2(
         code,
         salt,
         _iterations,
         _algorithm,
         _keySize
     );

     return CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals(hash, storedHash);
}
  


<p></p>



 Using ASP.NET Core Identity 



<p>ASP.NET Core Identity provides interfaces to create password hashes for data storage. You can use any C# type to define the password hasher and the Identity user class is normally used to create an instance of the PasswordHasher class. The hashes from this implementation can be saved to a database. This hash implementation is slow to create the hashes.</p>


  private readonly PasswordHasher&lt;string&gt; _passwordHasher = new();
    
public static string ToHashedCode(string code, string userId, 
      PasswordHasher&lt;string&gt; passwordHasher)
{
	var hash = passwordHasher.HashPassword(userId, code);
	return hash;
}

public static bool VerifyCode(string code, string userId, string storedCode)
{
	var passwordHasher = new PasswordHasher&lt;string&gt;();
	var result = passwordHasher.VerifyHashedPassword(userId, storedCode, code);
	return result == PasswordVerificationResult.Success;
}
  


<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>Using the right hash implementation is important and choosing the wrong one could result in a security problem. You should aim for solutions where implementing this should not be required. When storing hash values to a database, the Microsoft recommendations should be followed. Best would be to use the default implementation from ASP.NET Core Identity, when this is possible.</p>

<p>For a long time there were only two essential things that I carried everywhere: keys and wallet. Two was a manageable number of objects that I had to remember to put into pockets, and two was a manageable number of pockets to put them in.</p>
<p>Then my first phone bumped that number to three. When reading glasses became the fourth must-carry item, it started to feel like there were too many objects to always remember and too few pockets to put them in. When the seasons changed, or when traveling, it got harder to reset the canonical locations for all four things. </p>
<p>Although I listen to tons of podcasts, headphones never made the list of always-carry items. But when I emptied my pockets the other day I realized that my magic number is now five. AirPods are the new take-everywhere item. </p>
<p>For a while I resisted the recommendation to upgrade from a wired headset to AirPods. Did I really need another small, rechargeable, easy-to-lose object (actually, three of them)? I’ve learned not to expect that yet another electronic gadget will improve my life. But this one has. Dave Winer, you were right.</p>
<p>Obviously this trend can’t continue indefinitely. Will that thing we anachronistically call a “phone” absorb the wallet, and maybe even the keys? I’m not sure how I feel about that!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s my trusty belt pack. It’s dorky but there’s a pocket for everything, and it works consistently across seasons and continents. </p>

<p>This week Stephers came across a <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Emerald-Gate-Subtle-Energy-and-Biofield-Healing-Plan-2020.pdf">document</a> that was put out by the <a href="https://www.chi.is/">Consciousness and Healing Initiative</a> in 2020 with financial support from <a href="https://emeraldgatefoundation.org/team/">Jason Youtopolous</a> (former head of SAP Global Research) with the <a href="https://emeraldgatefoundation.org/">Emerald Gate Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/61543752">Walker Family Foundation</a> (<a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/jeffreyw/overview/">Jeffrey C.

<p>“<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Emerald-Gate-Subtle-Energy-and-Biofield-Healing-Plan-2020.pdf">Subtle Energy and Biofield Healing: Evidence, Practice, and Future Directions</a>” is a systems change plan to implement standards, evidence collection, and technology development that will restructure loosely networked healers and body workers into a global investment market. I believe those markets will, in turn, manage human psyches and etheric fields in the name of “health,” “wellbeing,” and “self-care” through telemedicine. The ultimate goal is to replace healers with apps linked to blockchain health records / digital twins, optimizing agents in the simulation and facilitating noetic convergence. </p>
<p>Bobby and Nicole’s promotion of AI-mediated healthcare and Web3 to address our nation’s chronic health “emergency” would dovetail nicely with such an effort. Remember, RFK Jr. gave a keynote speech at the <a href="https://www.eomega.org/about-omega/press-center/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-award-winning-environmental-innovators-to-speak-at">2008 Omega Institute conference</a> in Rhinebeck, NY on the importance of water to carbon-neutral sustainable living.</p>
<p>I anticipate new markets in digital alternative medicine will be hooked up to pay for success finance deals and programs like John Pollak’s <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/214328-John_Pollak">CommonHealth Wellcoin effort</a> based out of Cornell-Technion. With JP Morgan and Silicon Valley venture capital involved, how could it not? Oh, and a major funder is the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/474259772">Rob and Melani Walton Foundation</a>. Rob is worth $61 billion as the former chair of Walmart. His sister, Alice, is working closely with Deepak Chopra on community wellness and mindfulness as well as public art. </p>
<p>As with the field of education, my point of entry into the matrix, it seems human involvement will be gradually minimized in favor of automated systems. Touch will be studied and mirrored into AI assistants where sensors and actuators (sound, light, and haptics) end up embedded into spatial computing where they can facilitate our creative human potential as parallel processors in the networked collective, the digital commons as shared computational game board. </p>
<p>Human agents in the “game” remade as gooey, foraging nodes of slime mold in the name of democracy, free markets, and the American way if you are conservative. If you’re an NPR progressive / leftist, then your story will be that we need Web3 digital alternative health to uplift indigenous culture, stop capitalism, and save the planet from the Anthropocene. These folks have enough money to buy all the stories, and they know what each of us wants to hear. They’ll know even more once they use the alternative health space, keepers of etheric bodies, to bring us under their engineered dome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-hour talk below starts with a thought experiment I’ve been having about Web3 possibly being a “language” to interface with energetic elemental beings in a different layer of information space. I need to do more looking into Gurdjieff’s “law of three” and carbon (wallets) signifying action. The language may actually be envisioned as a vehicle for group manifestation into our shared information realm. Yes, I know that sounds highly unusual, but the more research I do the more I realize that high-level physics is not so far off spiritualism. Given all the money that the US military has spent in these areas over the past century makes psychical research hard to discount.</p>
<p>In the talk below, I touch on the movie “Arrival” and Thomas Mayer’s book “Answering the Call of the Elements.” Mayer is an Austrian teacher of Anthroposophic meditation who engages with elementals and has spent several decades working in direct democracy and positive Swiss money systems. Sure sounds to me like token engineering and gamified protocol layers may be a planned communication infrastructure. I then describe several serendipitous experiences I have had in Arkansas over the past month – not really synchronicities, more in the line of <a href="https://australianhumanitiesreview.org/2007/03/01/an-invitation-to-ontopoetics-the-poetic-structure-of-being/">ontopoetics</a>, a term I just learned but am enjoying playing with in the context of Wheeler’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.2277">participatory universe</a> and Basil Hiley’s non-commutative <a href="http://www7.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/CanMindEffMatterBJHPP05.pdf">active information</a> fields. Recent pics are included in the presentation and below. Who knows, there may be some clues I need to refer to later.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>If you feel like it, once you’re done with the talk and have browsed the document, consider Michael Levin’s discussion of manipulating bioelectrical fields. My sense is the biofield / AI electroceutical program mediated by AI / Blockchain smart contracts is meant to facilitate the emergence of a global soul-based computational superorganism.</p>

  Dear Postgres extension developers: Please review and give feedback on the
proposed patch adding ABI and API Guidance to the C language documentation.

<p>TL;DR: If you’re a Postgres extension developer interested in understanding
what to expect from core API and ABI stability, please review and give
feedback on <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/48/5080/" title="Commitfest — Docs: API &amp; ABI Guidance">this patch</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a>) adding ABI and API
Guidance to the documentation.</p>
 
<p>In my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/pgconf-future-ecosystem/" title="PGConf.dev 2024">PGConf.dev report</a> a couple days ago, I mentioned that a few actionable
items came out of the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Developer_Unconference#Improving_extensions_in_core">Improving extensions in core</a> unconference session. One
was the need to document the heretofore unofficial policy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" title="Wikipedia: API">API</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" title="Wikipedia: Application binary interface">ABI</a>
stability between major and, especially, minor versions of Postgres.</p>
<p>A frequent topic at the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/extension-ecosystem-summit/" title="Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024">Extension Summit and Mini-Summits</a> and a number of
PCConf sessions has been concern regarding compatibility changes between minor
releases of Postgres. At <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/05/mini-summit-five/">Mini Summit Five</a>, for example, Yurri Rashkovskii
presented a few examples of such changes, leading him to conclude, along with
several others in the community, that C API-using extensions can only be used
when built against the minor release with which they’re used.</p>
<p>In the Unconference session, core committers reported that such changes are
carefully made, and rarely, if ever, affect extensions compiled for different
minor releases of the same major version. Furthermore, they carefully make
such changes to avoid compatibility issues. In <a href="https://x.com/petervgeoghegan/status/1785720228237717627" title="Peter Geoghegan on Twitter: You must be referring to my commit 714780dc…">the case Yurii
found</a>, for example, a field was added to a struct’s padding,
without affecting the ordering of other fields, thus minimizing the risk of
runtime failures.</p>
<p>It became clear that, although the committers follow a policy — and read new
committers into it via patch review — it’s not documented anywhere. The
result has been a bunch of sturm und drang amongst extension developer unsure
what level of compatibility to depend on and what changes to expect.</p>
<p>The week after the conference, I started a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> proposing to
document the committer policy. Following some discussion and review of
potential ABI breaks in minor releases, the consensus seemed to be that the
committers strive to avoid such breaks, that they’re quite uncommon in minor
releases, and that most of the reported issues were due to using more obscure
APIs.</p>
<p>As a result, we started drafting a policy, and after a few iterations, <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter
Eisentraut</a> pulled things together from the perspective of a core team member,
reframed as “Server API and ABI Guidance”. I converted it into a <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/48/5080/" title="Commitfest — Docs: API &amp; ABI Guidance">patch</a> (and
<a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a>) to add it to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: C-Language Functions">C Language docs</a>. A key statement on minor
releases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, extension code that compiles and works with a minor release
should also compile and work with any other minor release of the same major
version, past or future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope this document clarifies things. Even if it’s not as strict as some
might hope, it at least documents the project approach to compatibility, so we
have a better idea what to expect when using the C APIs. If you see gaps, or
you have additional questions, please respond to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> — or
the <a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a> (I’ll propagate comments to hackers).</p>

  At PGConf.dev, I attended some great talks, made one of my own, and enjoyed
the commearderie of fellow PostgreSQL extension authors and core developers. A
brief report.

<p>In addition to the afore-blogged <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/extension-ecosystem-summit/" title="🏔 Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024">Extension Summit</a>, I also attended a slew of
the regular <a href="https://2024.pgconf.dev" title="PostgreSQL Development Conference 2024">PGConf.dev</a> sessions, gave a talk on the future of the extension
ecosystem, socialized with extension authors and core developers, and joined
discussions in a number of unconference sessions. Some notes on selected talks
and events:</p>
 Sessions 
<p>I enjoyed <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/174/">The road to new SQL/JSON features</a>, where <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/75/">Álvaro Herrera</a> gave a
brief history of SQL/JSON in Postgres, starting with the JSON type in 9.2
(2012), JSONB in 2014, and SQL standard jsonpath in Postgres 12 (2017).
Getting the SQL/JSON syntax finished turned out to be substantially more
difficult, thanks to parsing issues. It took many attempts and a couple of
reversions before most of the functionality was completed last year and
included in Postgres 16. The forthcoming Postgres 17 finishes the work, with
the standard fully supported except for “the <code>JSON_TABLE</code> plan param and json
simplified accessor.”</p>
<p>It’s a great time to use Postgres for JSON object storage and management.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/49/">Anarchy in the Database</a>, subtitled “A Survey and Evaluation of Database
Management System Extensibility”, Abigale Kim described her Master’s thesis
work investigating Postgres extension incompatibilities. Installing and
running tests for pairs of extensions, she found a number of conflicts and
issues, such as a bug when <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/citus/" title="citus: Scalable PostgreSQL for real-time workloads">Citus</a> was paired with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auto-explain.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: auto_explain — log execution plans of slow queries">auto_explain</a> (fixed in
May). In all, 17% of pairs failed! Abi also found that 19% of extensions
contain code copied from the Postgres core; <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pageinspect.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs pageinspect — low-level inspection of database pages">page_inspect</a> is 75% copied code!</p>
<p>Abi advocates for adding an extension manager into core, with well-defined
hooks to manage extension load order and to streamline enabling and disabling
extensions. Very interesting research, highlighting the need to think more
deeply about how best to enable and empower the extension ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/88-jeff-davis/">Jeff Davis</a> and <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/13-jeremy-schneider/">Jeremy Schneider</a> gave a thorough overview of <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/95/">Collations
from A to Z</a>. The problem rose to wide attention about six years ago when an
libc upgrade changed a collation, leading to data loss, crashes, and duplicate
primary keys. Ideally, sort orders would never change. But humans gotta human,
language will evolve, and the order of things will need to be updated. In such
situations, one must be aware of the changes and reindex or rebuild all
indexes (and replace hot standbys, which can’t be reindexed).</p>
<p>I very much appreciated the context, as the ongoing issue with collations and
upgrades has confused me. Should application authors choose collations or
should DBAs? The new [builtin] collation provider in PostgresSQL 17 tries
tries to bridge the gap by supporting unchanging Unicode code-point collation
ordering that’s reasonably meaningful to humans. But I also realize that, for
some projects with no need for human sort ordering, the <code>C</code> collations is more
than sufficient.</p>
<p>In her keynote, <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/192/">When Hardware and Databases Collide</a>, <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/139-margo-seltzer/">Margo Seltzer</a> offered
a provocation: Could PostgreSQL adopt something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_Express_Link" title="Wikipedia: “Compute Express Link”">CXL</a> to scale to a
virtually infinite pool of memory? Could one build a “complete fabric of CXL
switches to turn an entire data center into a database”? I have no idea! It
sure sounds like it could enable gigantic in-memory databases.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/119/">Tricks from in-memory databases</a> by <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/97-andrey-borodin/">Andrey Borodin</a> mostly went over my
head, but each of the experiments sped things up a few percentage points.
Together they might add up to something.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/86/">Making PostgreSQL Hacking More Inclusive</a> panel was terrific, and
much-needed. I’m grateful that <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/48-amit-langote/">Amit Langote</a>, <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/20-masahiko-sawada/">Masahiko Sawada</a>, and <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/8-melanie-plageman/">Melanie
Plageman</a> shared their experiences as up-and-coming non-white-male committers.
I think the resulting discussion will help drive new inclusion initiatives in
the PostgreSQL community, such as session moderator <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/27-robert-haas/">Robert Haas</a>’s
recently-announced <a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2024/06/mentoring-program-for-code-contributors.html">Mentoring Program for Code Contributors</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and I gave a talk, <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/91/">The future of the extension ecosystem</a>, in which I
expanded on my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/mini-summit-one/" title="Mini Summit One">mini-summit talk</a> to suss out the needs of various members of
the extension ecosystem (authors, users, DBAs, industry) and our plans to meet
those needs in <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGXN_v2">PGXN v2</a>. Links:</p>

 Unconference 
<p>I also participated in the Friday <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Developer_Unconference" title="PostgreSQL Wiki: PGConf.dev 2024 Developer Unconference">Unconference</a>. <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/42/">Abi</a>, <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/speaker/6-yurii-rashkovskii/">Yurii</a>,
and I led a discussion on <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Developer_Unconference#Improving_extensions_in_core">Improving extensions in core</a>. We discussed the
need for an ABI stability policy, extension management, smoke testing
(including for conflicts between extensions), a coalition to advocate for
extensions in core (since launched as the <a href="https://github.com/pgedc">Postgres Extension Developers
Coalition</a>), inline extensions, <a href="https://webassembly.org">WASM</a>-based extensions, and server
installation immutability. Great discussions and a few actionable outcomes,
some of which I’ve been working on. More soon in future posts.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Developer_Unconference#Increase_Community_Participation">Increase Community Participation</a>, we talked about the challenges for
broadening the PostgreSQL contributor community, attracting and retaining
contributors, recognizing contributions, and how to address issues of burnout
and allow people to “retire”. I joined the discourse on how we could adopt or
at least support GitHub workflows, such as pull requests, to encourage more
patch review in a familiar environment. Personally, I’ve been creating <a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pulls" title="theory/postgres: Pull Requests">pull
requests in my fork</a> for my patches for this very reason.</p>
<p>We also touched on training and mentoring new contributors (hence the
<a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2024/06/mentoring-program-for-code-contributors.html">mentoring announcement</a>) and changes to postgresql.org, notably
adding dedicated pages for each project governance committee, especially for
the Contributors Committee (there’s a Contributors Committee?), as well as
information for how to become a contributor and be listed on the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/" title="PostgreSQL Contributor Profiles">contributor
page</a>.</p>
 Final Thoughts 
<p>I attended <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/" title="PGCon: The PostgreSQL Conference">PGCon</a> from 2009 to 2014, and always enjoyed the commearderie in
Ottawa every year. Most people went to the same pub after sessions every night
(or for some part of each evening), where random connections and deep
technical nerdery would continue into the small hours, both indoors and out.
The Black Oak was a highlight of the conference for me, every year.</p>
<p>In the intervening years I got busy with non-Postgres work and scaled back my
participation. I finally returned in 2023 (other than a virtual unconference
in 2022), and found it much the same, although the Black Oak had closed, and
now there were 2-3 where people went, diluting the social pool a bit —
though still a highlight.</p>
<p>As the new iteration of the Postgres Developer Conference, PGConf.dev is a
worthy successor. Vancouver was a nice city for it, and people bought the same
energy as always. I connected with far more people, and more meaningfully,
than at any other conference. But other than the reception and dinner on
Wednesday, there was no one (or three) place where people tended to aggregate
into the wee hours. Or at least I wasn’t aware of it. The end of PGCon is
bittersweet for me, but I’m happy to continue to participate in PGCONf.dev.</p>
<p>See you next year!</p>

<p> The CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims in COSE Headers specification has been published as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9597.html">RFC 9597</a>!  This closes a gap for COSE relative to JOSE, adding the ability to use CWT claims in COSE header parameters, just as JWT claims can be used in JOSE header parameters.</p>
<p>The specification abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This document describes how to include CBOR Web Token (CWT) claims in the header parameters of any CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) structure. This functionality helps to facilitate applications that wish to make use of CWT claims in encrypted COSE structures and/or COSE structures featuring detached signatures, while having some of those claims be available before decryption and/or without inspecting the detached payload. Another use case is using CWT claims with payloads that are not CWT Claims Sets, including payloads that are not CBOR at all.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Special thanks to my co-author <a href="https://x.com/tplooker">Tobias Looker</a>, who had a use case for this functionality and wrote an RFC with me defining it (his first!).  It was a pleasure working with Tobias on the draft as we navigated the ins and outs of working group feedback and IETF processes.  The spec was refined by the journey we took together.  And as with <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2548">CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) “typ” (type) Header Parameter</a> (now <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9596.html">RFC 9596</a>) that immediately preceded it, I believe the CBOR and COSE ecosystems are better for it.</p>

<p>About a year ago, <a href="https://justinsecurity.medium.com/federation-bubbles-3df0d4e433ff">I wrote about a new concept</a> I’d started to develop: a new way to look at how we view account provisioning, and how we use federation technologies, especially in a world where the connection properties are always changing. I called this idea federation bubbles, and in the last year I’ve been privileged to talk to a lot of people about this idea and what it could mean, and I’ve even been able to prototype out some key pieces of the puzzle. I’ve gotten to present the idea at a few conferences, and I even recently <a href="https://www.identityatthecenter.com/listen/episode/2621a476/291-identity-bubbles-with-justin-richer">did a whole podcast episode</a> on the topic (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-GtiJ2HvnA">with a video version</a>!) for <a href="https://www.identityatthecenter.com/">Identity At The&nbsp;Center</a>.</p><p>Through all of that, several major concepts have risen to the surface, and I’ll be looking to tackle these in a few different posts — questions like “can’t we just copy the user store?” and “isn’t this just like an interfederation?” get brought up quickly each time. But I wanted to start with something very concrete before getting into the what and why: how would you make a&nbsp;bubble?</p> It’s Not New Technology <p>The central idea behind a bubble in this world is that it’s an internally-cohesive network of systems, with clear boundaries and processes to cross those boundaries. I think we can start building bubbles today out of tech that we’re already using for similar and related purposes.</p>Some of the technologies we can make bubbles out&nbsp;of<p>An important corollary to that is that I deeply believe that this concept is not conducive to a single technology stack. So many times through tech history, we’ve been told that if the whole world would just adopt this one particular way of doing things, then all the problems would be solved. This line is usually delivered by a person selling the new way of doing things, or at the very least the picks and shovels to make it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>For bubbles, though? I think we’ve got all the most important parts already. What’s fundamentally different is how we use everything, and the assumptions we make around the moving parts and how we stick them together.</p> Crossing The&nbsp;Borders <p>In order to create and update accounts in the bubble, we often want to pull that information from elsewhere. Whether it’s an authoritative source that created the bubble in the first place, or it’s a peer we’re bumping up against in the field, we want to be able to copy identifiers and other attributes into our local&nbsp;account.</p><p>For the more structured cases, SCIM gives us a really powerful system for propagating user objects across systems. X.509 certificates and Verifiable Credentials also give us a way to carry a stack of user information into our system, while also providing a convenient key-proofing mechanism with the delivery.</p><p>But not everything is that structured, since we’ll also want to be talking to peers in the field about their accounts. We need to be able to do this without going all the way back up our peer’s hierarchy, and so we can do just-in-time provisioning based on a federation protocol as&nbsp;needed.</p><p>When that stack of user attributes gets to us, it becomes an input into an account management system — but just one input among potentially many. Instead of just overwriting or overriding a record we might already have, the incoming information feeds into the account in a way that makes sense for the local environment.</p><p>When we need to send updates about changes to others in the system, the shared signals and events frameworks give us a really solid base to build on. But what SSE, CAEP, and RISC are missing is a semantic layer that can talk about the kinds of dynamic accounts in distributed systems that we expect in a bubble environment.</p> It’s Familiar on the&nbsp;Inside <p>Within a bubble, everything is local. Because of that, we want to have a clear notion of a single account for each user. We can use federation technology like OpenID Connect (and the OAuth 2 it’s built on) to connect that one account to a variety of applications, devices, APIs, and whatever the bubbled system needs. This is a wholly separate federation protocol from the onboarding and outward facing processes we talked about above. We can also use SCIM to transmit internal user attributes and updates proactively, or we can just rely on the federation transactions to carry good-enough propagation of these attributes to our&nbsp;apps.</p><p>We aren’t going to be using external federation or similar technologies once the onboarding has taken place. For logging in to the IdP itself, we really should be using passkeys everywhere. Since we control the onboarding process, we get to control how we associate the accounts with the authenticators. Sometimes, this means we’ll hand someone their shiny new authenticator at the moment we make their account active. Sometimes, we’ll have them plug it in and bind it when we set things up. Sometimes, a record of their authenticator might come across the wire with&nbsp;them.</p><p>And if we’ve got applications, users, or circumstances that make some authenticators unworkable sometimes? Since the account is local, we have the ability to manage this in a way that makes sense in our environment. For example, a firefighter wearing heavy gloves is not going to be able to use a fingerprint reader in the field, but they could probably use one when back at HQ, not to mention all of the other users in the system that don’t have the same constraints. In other words, we can adapt as we need to because we are close to the environment that requires the adaptation.</p> Addressing The&nbsp;World <p>As we collect information about an account, we need to record not only what the information is, but also where we got it. Our view of that account is the amalgamation of all of our information sources, plus all of the local information about that account. In order for this view to make sense, we need to have a reasonable way to talk about where something came&nbsp;from.</p><p>Traditional federation models like to use hostnames for this, but not everything in our environment is going to be addressable on a stable, publicly-accessible URL. We can’t rely on a common data fabric (e.g., assuming everyone uses the same blockchain), and we can also be pretty sure that keys will change over time for different parties and circumstances, so we can’t just use the keys directly when we need a&nbsp;record.</p><p>OpenID Connect Federation brings a solution that works well for the online, connected world, but would need to be adapted for a space where the federation domains and their availability are much more dynamic. The SPIFFE project also brings us the concept of trust bundles, which tie a set of keys to identifiers in a way that can be passed between different domains. While not an exact analogue to the more macro problem here, there are some key similarities to what we’re seeing in the workload&nbsp;space.</p> Pulling it&nbsp;Together <p>The final solution isn’t going to be a single protocol, or even a single technology stack. Interoperability in this space is going to be defined by a complicated and contextual set of decisions. Two bubbles might not always be able to talk in a given dimension — one might speak OIDC outbound and another might only take in VC’s — but it’s going to be important that they can still speak in other dimensions. In the end, it’s people that make the technologies work, and we need to embrace the dirt and uncertainty of the world if we want any hope of surviving in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Can you summarize your recent research into a single sentence? </p>
<p>That was the emailed request.</p>
<p>“Tagged archetypal cybernetic avatars team up to forage for contextualized information (qualia) in interdimensional “space” and bring it back to be collectively processed (composted?) in a globally-networked “gut brain.” This novel “brain,” managed through precision nutrition, uses quorum sensing and token-engineered consensus (Ethereum’s Consensys) to adjust a shared topological game board, which in turn performs some collective calculation or puzzle solving task that appears to have been delegated to us, as a highly-evolved distributed intelligence, from a source outside our shared layer of space/time.”</p>
<p>Ok, I ended up breaking into into two sentences, because the first run-on attempt was just too tricky. </p>
<p>The requestor didn’t understand my response.</p>
<p>I cannot insert the knowledge of my unique lived experience into any person’s consciousness, nor would I want that. Everyone has a road of discovery to walk. I’m not done with my journey yet, so don’t pressure me to commit to one final theory of what is happening. </p>
<p>The video below describes a recent visit I made to a botanic garden on Lake Hamilton just south of Hot Springs, Arkansas. There I encountered a steampunk squirrel sculpture in a $1.8 million “children’s treehouse” on a former tract of cut-over timber. </p>
<p>My assessment is that the mountain-climbing adventure squirrel and his sidekick the skydiving cardinal are encoded artefacts. When examined (mentally unlocked like the bronze acorns in the squirrel’s satchel and around the tree trunk) with curiosity in the larger context of information flows from a podcast shared with me earlier that day, a view opened onto a vast landscape of ideas about information theory, choice, the social physics of self-assembly, morphogenetic fields, and the realization of human potential. </p>
<p>My video concludes with a half hour where I discuss the ideas that welled up during that excursion and how they intersect with ASU astrobiologist Sara Walker’s recent conversation with Lex Fridman. </p>
<p>Poke around and see what you find in your corner of the world. I found deep time artefacts, synesthetic communication, and fairy houses sitting on quartz crystals.</p>

<p>A couple months ago, Álvaro Hernández <a href="https://www.ongres.com/blog/why-postgres-extensions-should-be-distributed-and-packaged-as-oci-images/" title="Álvaro Hernández: Why Postgres Extensions should be packaged and distributed as OCI images">suggested</a> that Postgres extensions
should be distributed as OCI (née Docker) images:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s all about not reinventing the wheel, and leveraging the ecosystem
around OCI. Many of the problems (solutions) in building, packaging and
distributing extensions are already solved by OCI: there’s a whole ecosystem
of tools around OCI that provide additional benefits in terms of tooling,
infrastructure and common knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a relatively experienced Docker image builder and distributor, I found this
idea intriguing. I wasn’t familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/manifest.md">OCI Image Manifest
Specification</a>, which defines how to build OCI images containing arbitrary
files, or “artifacts”. But if we could adopt an existing protocol and federated
registry system like OCI/Docker, it would save pretty significant development
time over building our own — plus we’d be adopting and potentially
contributing to a standard.</p>
<p>After PGConf.dev, I decided to see if I could work out how to distribute
packages in the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-poc/" title="POC: PGXN Binary Distribution Format">recently-proposed trunk format</a> such that an
OCI/Docker-style image URL could be used to install a version of an extension
compiled for the appropriate architecture.</p>
<p>Thanks to the denizens of the <code>#oras</code> and <code>#zot</code> channels on the <a href="https://communityinviter.com/apps/cloud-native/cncf">CNCF Slack</a>,
I extended the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-poc/" title="POC: PGXN Binary Distribution Format">trunk format POC</a> in <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/pull/69" title="theory/pg-semver#69: POC pushing &amp; pulling trunk from an OSI registry">pg-semver PR 69</a> to build the
necessary JSON manifest files, push them to a registry, and then pull and
install the architecturally-appropriate package. Here’s how it works.</p>
 Metadata generation 
<p>First, I extended <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/pull/69/files#diff-3f827bb78f3b94ffb22530202fd79242800814585635d00d5d9154bb302d279c"><code>trunk.mk</code></a>, which <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-poc/" title="POC: PGXN Binary Distribution Format">builds a trunk package</a>, with a
few more targets that create the JSON files with metadata necessary to build
OCI manifests. The files that <code>make trunk</code> now also generates are:</p>
 
 <code>{extension}_annotations.json</code> 
 OCI standard annotations describing a package, including license, vendor,
and URLs. The <code>semver_annotations.json</code> file looks like this:
  <code>{
  "org.opencontainers.image.created": "2024-06-20T18:07:24Z",
  "org.opencontainers.image.licenses": "PostgreSQL",
  "org.opencontainers.image.title": "semver",
  "org.opencontainers.image.description": "A Postgres data type for the Semantic Version format with support for btree and hash indexing.",
  "org.opencontainers.image.source": "https://github.com/theory/pg-semver",
  "org.opencontainers.image.vendor": "PGXN",
  "org.opencontainers.image.ref.name": "0.32.1",
  "org.opencontainers.image.version": "0.32.1",
  "org.opencontainers.image.url": "https://github.com/theory/pg-semver"
}
</code>   
 <code>{package_name}_config.json</code> 
 An object with fields appropriate for OCI platform specification, plus the
creation date. Here are the content of
<code>semver-0.32.1+pg16-darwin-23.5.0-arm64_config.json</code>: 
 
  <code>{
  "os": "darwin",
  "os.version": "23.5.0",
  "architecture": "arm64",
  "created": "2024-06-20T18:07:24Z"
}
</code>   
 <code>{package_name}_annotations.json</code> 
 An object defining annotations to use in an image, built for a specific
platform, all under the special key <code>$manifest</code> to be used later by the
<a href="https://oras.land" title="Distribute Artifacts Across OCI Registries With Ease">ORAS</a> CLI to put them in the right place.
<code>semver-0.32.1+pg16-darwin-23.5.0-arm64_annotations.json</code> example: 
 
  <code>{
  "$manifest": {
    "org.opencontainers.image.created": "2024-06-20T18:07:24Z",
    "org.opencontainers.image.title": "semver-0.32.1+pg16-darwin-23.5.0-arm64.trunk",
    "org.opencontainers.image.licenses": "PostgreSQL",
    "org.opencontainers.image.description": "A Postgres data type for the Semantic Version format with support for btree and hash indexing.",
    "org.opencontainers.image.source": "https://github.com/theory/pg-semver",
    "org.opencontainers.image.vendor": "PGXN",
    "org.opencontainers.image.ref.name": "0.32.1",
    "org.opencontainers.image.version": "0.32.1",
    "org.opencontainers.image.url": "https://github.com/theory/pg-semver",
    "org.pgxn.trunk.pg.version": "16.3",
    "org.pgxn.trunk.pg.major": "16",
    "org.pgxn.trunk.pg.version_num": "160003",
    "org.pgxn.trunk.version": "0.1.0"
  }
}
</code>   
 
<p>The <code>org.opencontainers.image</code> keys are the same as in
<code>semver_annotations.json</code>, while the new <code>org.pgxn.trunk</code> annotations are
intended for an install client to find the image appropriate for the
version of Postgres, although that functionality isn’t part of this POC.</p>
 
 
<p>The only change to the <code>Makefile</code> to support these annotations are the
addition of a <code>DESCRIPTION</code> variable to populate
<code>org.opencontainers.image.description</code> and a <code>REPO_URL</code> to populate
<code>org.opencontainers.image.source</code>. <code>trunk.mk</code> includes a couple other new
variables, too: <code>TITLE</code> (defaults to <code>EXTENSION</code>), <code>VENDOR</code> (defaults to
“PGXN”), and <code>URL</code> (defaults to <code>REPO-URL</code>).</p>
 Publishing Images 
<p>The new shell script <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/pull/69/files#diff-543b555ee5586af46bdf528b1f907c07f8f044ebe57e63ba518190d3cfd9b917"><code>push_trunk</code></a> uses the <a href="https://oras.land" title="Distribute Artifacts Across OCI Registries With Ease">ORAS</a> CLI and <code>jq</code> to build the
necessary manifest files and push them to an OCI registry. It currently works
only two trunk files like those built in the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-poc/" title="POC: PGXN Binary Distribution Format">trunk POC</a>. It first
“pushes” the trunks to a locally-created <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-layout.md" title="OCI Image Layout Specification">OCI layout</a>, then constructs
manifests associated the SHA ID of each just-pushed image with annotations and
platform configurations and writes them into an <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-index.md" title="OCI Image Index Specification">image index</a> manifest.
Finally, it pushes the complete OCI layout described by the index to a remote
registry.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a lot of steps, you’re right, it adds up. But the result,
following a precedent established by <a href="https://brew.sh" title="Homebrew: The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)">Homebrew</a> (as described in <a href="https://github.com/oras-project/oras/issues/237" title="oras-project/oras#237: Pushing an image index">this issue</a>)
is multiple images for different platforms indexed at a single URI. Once we
publish the two trunks:</p>
  <code>./push_trunk localhost:5000/theory/semver:0-32.1 \
    semver-0.32.1+pg16-darwin-23.5.0-arm64 \
    semver-0.32.1+pg16-linux-amd64
</code>  <p>We can fetch the manifests. The address for the image index is that first
parameter, <code>localhost:5000/theory/semver:0-32.1</code>; we fetch the manifest with
the command</p>
  <code>oras manifest fetch localhost:5000/theory/semver:0-32.1
</code>  <p>Which returns:</p>
  <code>{

}
</code>  <p>Note the <code>manifests</code> array, which lists images associated with this URI. The
first one is for amd64 linux and the second for arm64 darwin. They also
contain the <code>org.pgxn.trunk</code> annotations that would allow filtering for an
appropriate Postgres version. The idea is to download an index like this, find
the manifest information for the appropriate platform and Postgres version,
and download it. To get the darwin image, pull it by its digest:</p>
  <code>oras pull localhost:5000/theory/semver:0-32.1@sha256:385fcfe6b33c858c3f126fb4284afe23ba8c2f7c32db8a50a607dfece6dd9162
</code>  <p>Which downloads the file:</p>
  <code>$ ls -l *.trunk
semver-0.32.1+pg16-darwin-23.5.0-arm64.trunk
</code>  <p>Nice! The OCI protocol allows for filtering on platform directly, skipping the
need to download and examine the image index. This is how <code>docker pull --platform</code> works, but is general to OCI. We can fetch a manifest with this
command:</p>
  <code>oras manifest fetch --platform linux/amd64 localhost:5000/theory/semver:0-32.1
</code>  <p>Which returns not the image index, but the manifest for the Linux image:</p>
  <code>{

}
</code>  <p>Or we can pull the file by platform with:</p>
  <code>rm *.trunk
oras pull --platform linux/amd64 localhost:5000/theory/semver:0-32.1
</code>  <p>And now the Linux image has been downloaded:</p>
  <code>$ ls -1 *.trunk
semver-0.32.1+pg16-linux-amd64.trunk
</code>  <p>Pretty nice! These examples use <a href="https://zotregistry.dev/" title="OCI-native container image registry, simplified">zot</a> running in a local Docker container, but
could just as easily use the Docker registry (<code>docker.io</code>) or the GitHub
registry (<code>ghcr.io</code>) — which is where Homebrew stores its images (e.g.,
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pkgs/container/core%2Fsqlite/221454310?tag=3.46.0" title="ghcr.io/Homebrew/homebrew-core/core/sqlite:3.46.0">sqlite 3.46.0</a>).</p>
 Installation 
<p>With these manifests configured and pushed, changes to <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/pull/69/files#diff-1ef82a7c5bea66c6f95d8b5c65cca31e46671f4ef073fb8ab8d64c9a5f56f147"><code>install_trunk</code></a> use
this knowledge to download from the registry instead of relying on an existing
file (as implemented for the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-poc/" title="POC: PGXN Binary Distribution Format">trunk POC</a>). Now we call it like so:</p>
  <code>./install_trunk localhost:5000/theory/semver:0-32.1
</code>  <p>First, it assembles platform information from <code>uname</code>, then pulls the
platform-specific image with this <code>oras</code> command:</p>
  <code>oras pull --no-tty --plain-http \
     --format 'go-template={{(first .files).path}}' 
     --platform "$platform" "$trunk"
</code>  <p>As before, it downloads the image appropriate for the platform. The <code>--format</code>
option, meanwhile, causes it to also download annotations and extract the path
for the downloaded file. So in addition to downloading the file, it also emits
its full path:</p>
 <code>/tmp/pgxn/semver-0.32.1+pg16-darwin-23.5.0-arm64.trunk
</code> <p>the script proceeds to unpack the image with that file name and continues with
the installation process as <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-poc/#install-trunk" title="POC: PGXN Binary Distribution Format — install_trunk">before</a>.</p>
 Demo 
<p>The last new file in <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/pull/69" title="theory/pg-semver#69: POC pushing &amp; pulling trunk from an OSI registry">the PR</a> is <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/pull/69/files#diff-e45e45baeda1c1e73482975a664062aa56f20c03dd9d64a827aba57775bed0d3"><code>docker_compose.yml</code></a>,
which sets up an amd64 Linux container for building an extension for Postgres
16, and a <a href="https://zotregistry.dev/" title="OCI-native container image registry, simplified">zot</a> container to push to and pull from. I used it to build this
POC and record this demo:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>To use it yourself, run these commands with <code>docker_compose.yml</code>:</p>
  <code>git clone https://github.com/theory/pg-semver.git
cd pg-semver
git checkout -b trunk-oci origin/trunk-oci
docker compose up -d
</code>  <p>This clones the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver.git">pg-semver</a> repository, checks out the <code>trunk-oci</code> branch,
fires up the containers. Wait a couple minutes for Postgres to start and be
configured, then, assuming you can build against Postgres 16 on your local
machine, you can follow the same steps. The commands in the demo are:</p>
  <code>make trunk
docker compose exec linux bash
make clean
make trunk
exit
ls -1 *.trunk
ls -1 *.json
./push_trunk localhost:5000/theory/semver:0.32.1 \
    semver-0.32.1+pg16-darwin-23.5.0-arm64 \
    semver-0.32.1+pg16-linux-amd64
./install_trunk localhost:5000/theory/semver:0.32.1
docker compose exec linux bash
./install_trunk zot:5000/theory/semver:0.32.1
exit
</code>  <p>You might need to adjust the first trunk image name if your local
configuration is not the same as mine.</p>
 Concept Proven 
<p>Honestly, this POC far exceeded my expectations. It worked great! Not only
does the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-poc/" title="POC: PGXN Binary Distribution Format">trunk format</a> seem to work well, but distributing via OCI
registries is even better! It brings a bunch of benefits:</p>
 
 We could build a community registry that automatically builds images for
PGXN releases for a variety of platforms. This could grow to become the
default method for installing extensions, perhaps via a command such as
<code>pgxn trunk install theory/semver</code>. 
 Anyone can use any other registry, and the tooling will work with it. Just
as you can pull Docker images from <code>docker.io</code>, you can also pull them
from <code>ghcr.io</code>, <code>quay.io</code>, or any other OCI-compliant registry. The same
applies here. Extension authors can build and publish trunks to their own
registries if they like. 
 Better yet, organizations can build extension registries for their own use
cases, to complement the community registry. Think internal registries for
private extensions, or commercial registries that additional features,
such as security scans or curation. 
 
<p>Super promising! I’m just about ready to get to work building this stuff,
though I anticipate a few challenges:</p>
 
 We’ll need a way to find the latest version (tag) of a release. I’m sure
this is do-able, since Homebrew does it. There must be some other index
for tags (<code>ghcr.io/homebrew/core/sqlite:latest</code> doesn’t return a result,
alas). 
 In addition to filtering on platform specification when pulling an image,
it would be nice to filter on other attributes, such as the
<code>org.pgxn.trunk</code> annotations defining Postgres the version. For now it
will be fine for the CLI to download an image index and find the right
image, but additional server-side filtering would be very nice. 
 Will need to support extensions that can run on any architecture, such as
pure SQL extensions. I think this will be pretty easy by publishing a
single tagged image instead of an image index. 
 If we build a community registry, where should it be hosted? Homebrew uses
<code>ghcr.io</code>, presumably avoiding hosting costs, but it might be nice to have
a specific community registry, perhaps at <code>trunk.pgxn.org</code> or perhaps
<code>oci.postgresql.org</code>. 
 If we do host a registry, might we want to allow extension authors to
publish their own trunks within their namespaces? How might that be
organized? 
 
<p>I can imagine workable solutions to these relatively minor challenges. As long
as we can encapsulate them into the commands for a single command-line client,
it should work out well.</p>
<p>Can’t wait to get started. What do you think?</p>

<p>In an effort to make discussion of PGXN and related improvements as accessible
as possible, I’ve set up <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pgxn/discussions">PGXN Discussions</a> on GitHub. Of course GitHub
created default categories for all sorts of conversation, and all is welcome,
in accordance with the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/policies/coc/">PostgresSQL Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>But I hope more people will be able to find, read, comment on, and even write
their own RFCs than was possible on the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/" title="PostgreSQL Wiki">Postgres Wiki</a> or <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/rfc-pgxn-metadata-sketch/" title="RFC: PGXN Metadata Sketch">on Just a Theory</a>.
Therefore, please have a look at <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pgxn/discussions/2" title="Proposal-2: Binary Distribution Format">Proposal-2: Binary Distribution
Format</a>, which draws inspiration from the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/" title="Python Binary distribution format">Python wheel format</a> and
<a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">Trunk</a> to define a packaging format that allows for platform and PostgreSQL
version matching to quickly install pre-compiled binary PostgreSQL extension
packages.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/orgs/pgxn/discussions/2" title="Proposal-2: Binary Distribution Format">The proposal</a> has the details, but the basic idea is that files to be
installed are stored in directories named for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgconfig.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: pg_config">pg_config</a> directory
configurations. Then all an installer has to do is install the files in those
subdirectories into the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgconfig.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: pg_config">pg_config</a>-specified directories.</p>
 POC 
<p>I <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/rfc-pgxn-metadata-sketch/#binary-distribution-format" title="🏔 Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024 —&nbsp;Binary Distribution Format">ran this idea past some colleagues</a>, and they thought it
worth exploring. But the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pgxn/discussions/2" title="Proposal-2: Binary Distribution Format">proposal</a> itself didn’t feel sufficient. I
wanted to prove that it could work.</p>
<p>So I created a proof-of-concept (POC) implementation in just about the
quickest way I could think of and applied it to the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver" title="A semantic version data type for PostgreSQL">semver extension</a> in
<a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/pull/68" title="theory/pg-semver#68: POC Trunk binary distribution format">PR 68</a>. Here’s how it works.</p>
 <code>trunk.mk</code> 
<p>A new file, <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/pull/68/files#diff-3f827bb78f3b94ffb22530202fd79242800814585635d00d5d9154bb302d279c"><code>trunk.mk</code></a>, dupes all of the install targets from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="Postgres Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> and
rejiggers them to install into the proposed package directory format. The
<a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/pull/68/files#diff-76ed074a9305c04054cdebb9e9aad2d818052b07091de1f20cad0bbac34ffb52"><code>Makefile</code></a> simply imports <code>trunk.mk</code>:</p>
  <code>--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile
@@ -22,6 +22,7 @@ endif
 
 PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
 include $(PGXS)
+include ./trunk.mk
 
 all: sql/$(EXTENSION)--$(EXTVERSION).sql
 
</code>  <p>And now there’s a <code>trunk</code> target that uses those packaging targets. Here’s its
output on my amd64 Mac (after running <code>make</code>):</p>

</code>  <p>Pretty much the same, as expected. Now we have two trunks:</p>
  <code>$ ls -1 *.trunk
semver-0.32.1+pg16-darwin-23.5.0-arm64.trunk
semver-0.32.1+pg16-linux-amd64.trunk
</code>  <p>The package name format is:</p>
 <code>{package}-{version}+{pgversion}-{os}-{os_version}-{architecture}.trunk
</code> <p>Here you see the same package, version, and Postgres version, but then the
OSes differ, macOS includes the optional OS version, and then the
architectures differ. This will allow an install client to download the
appropriate trunk.</p>
<p>Note the directories into which files are copied under a top-level directory
with that format (without the <code>.trunk</code> extension):</p>
 
 SHAREDIR files go into <code>pgsql/share</code> 
 DOCDIR files go into <code>pgsql/doc</code> 
 PKGLIB files go into <code>pgsql/pkglib</code> 
 
<p>What else is there?</p>

<p>Die EU-Regierungen werden sich heute nicht wie geplant für die Chatkontrolle aussprechen, die das Ende privater Nachrichten und sicherer Verschlüsselung eingeläutet hätte. Der belgische Ratsvorsitz nahm den Punkt kurzfristig von der Tagesordnung. Damit scheitert die Chatkontrolle zum wiederholten Male im Rat. Der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei, digitale Freiheitskämpfer und Verhandlungsführer seiner Fraktion im Europäischen Parlament, Dr. Patrick Breyer, jubelt:</p>



<p>„Ohne das Engagement und den Protest von unzähligen Personen und Organisationen in Europa in den letzten Tagen hätten die EU-Regierungen heute totalitäre flächendeckende Chatkontrollen beschlossen, das digitale Briefgeheimnis und sichere Verschlüsselung beerdigt. Danke an alle, die Politikern geschrieben oder angerufen haben. Dass wir die orwellsche Chatkontrolle trotz des Umfallens Frankreichs erneut stoppen konnten, gehört gefeiert!</p>



<p>Die Überwachungsextremisten unter den EU-Regierungen und Big Sister Ylva Johansson sind damit gescheitert, eine qualifizierte Mehrheit herbeizutricksen. Wann lernen sie endlich vom EU-Parlament, dass wirksamer, gerichtsfester und mehrheitsfähiger Kinderschutz anders geht?</p>



<p>Jetzt muss die Bundesregierung endlich ihre Hausaufgaben machen und sich mit anderen kritischen Staaten auf gemeinsame Forderungen verständigen. Es reicht eben nicht, nur verschlüsselte Kommunikation ausnehmen zu wollen. Die verdachtslose, fehleranfällige Durchleuchtung privater Nachrichten ist der toxischste Teil des Verordnungsentwurfs, aber die Probleme gehen weit darüber hinaus. Wir brauchen deshalb einen neuen Ansatz, der auf vorbeugenden Kinderschutz statt Massenüberwachung und Bevormundung setzt! Der letzte ‚Kompromissvorschlag‘ der belgischen Ratspräsidentschaft muss in mindestens 4 Punkten grundlegend überarbeitet werden:</p>



<p>1. Keine verdachtslose Chatkontrolle: Anstelle flächendeckender Nachrichten- und Chatkontrolle soll die Justiz nur die Durchsuchung der Nachrichten und der Uploads von Verdächtigen anordnen können. Nur so kann vermieden werden, dass eine unverhältnismäßige Verordnung zur Massenüberwachung zwangsläufig vor Gericht scheitert und für Kinder überhaupt nichts erreicht wird.</p>



<p>2. Sichere Verschlüsselung schützen: Das sogenannte client-side scanning zur Unterwanderung sicherer Verschlüsselung muss ausdrücklich ausgeschlossen werden. Allgemeine Bekenntnisse zu Verschlüsselung im Gesetzestext sind nichts wert, wenn noch vor der Verschlüsselung durchleuchtet und ausgeleitet wird. Unsere persönlichen Geräte dürfen nicht zu Scannern pervertiert werden.</p>



<p>3. Anonymität schützen: Streichung verpflichtender Altersüberprüfungen durch alle Kommunikationsdienste, um das Recht auf anonyme Kommunikation zu retten. Whistleblower drohen zu verstummen, wenn sie vor Leaks dem Kommunikationsdienst gegenüber Ausweis oder Gesicht vorzeigen müssen.</p>



<p>4. Keine Appzensur für junge Menschen: Jugendliche zum Schutz vor Grooming ganz von Allerweltapps wie Whatsapp, Instagram oder Games ausschließen zu wollen, ist weltfremd und inakzeptabel. Stattdessen müssen die Voreinstellungen der Dienste datenschutzfreundlicher und sicherer werden.“</p>



<p>Hintergrund:</p>



<p>Nach dem neuesten Gesetzentwurf, der als „Uploadmoderation“ präsentiert wird, sollen Nutzer von Apps und Diensten mit Chatfunktionen gefragt werden, ob sie das verdachtslose und fehleranfällige Scannen und gegebenenfalls Ausleiten ihrer privat verschickten Bilder, Fotos und Videos akzeptieren. Mit „künstlicher Intelligenz“ sollen auch bisher unbekannte Bilder und Videos durchleuchtet werden. Lehnt ein Nutzer die Chatkontrolle ab, soll er gar keine Bilder, Fotos, Videos oder Links mehr verschicken oder empfangen können (Artikel 10). Trotz Lippenbekenntnissen für Verschlüsselung müssten Ende-zu-Ende-verschlüsselte Dienste die Chatkontrolle durch Einbau von Überwachungsfunktionen umsetzen, die „vor der Datenübertragung“ greifen sollen (sog. client-side scanning, Artikel 10a). Auf die Durchsuchung von Textnachrichten nach Hinweisen auf „Grooming“, die auch bisher kaum zum Einsatz kommt, soll genauso verzichtet werden wie auf das noch nie eingesetzte Scannen von Sprachkommunikation. Die Chats der Mitarbeiter von Sicherheitsbehörden und Militär sollten von der fehleranfälligen Chatkontrolle ausgenommen werden.</p>



<p>In einer Sitzung am 24. Mai machte der Juristische Dienst des Rates deutlich, dass eine verdachtslose massenhafte Chatkontrolle weiterhin vorgesehen sei und nach wie vor grundrechtswidrig bleibe.</p>

<p>Morgen (Donnerstag) sollen die EU-Regierungen über einen Gesetzentwurf abstimmen (offiziell „Verordnung gegen sexuellen Missbrauch von Kindern“, aber bekannt als „Chatkontrolle“), der die automatisierte Durchsuchung und gegebenenfalls Ausleitung privater Chats vorsieht, darunter auch Ende-zu-Ende-verschlüsselte Chats, die verdächtige Fotos oder Videos enthalten sollen.[1] Lehnt ein Nutzer diese „Upload-Moderation“ seiner Chats ab, wird kann er keinerlei Bilder, Videos oder URLs mehr senden oder empfangen. 48 Abgeordnete aus Deutschland, Österreich, Luxemburg, der Tschechischen Republik und den Niederlanden haben einen Brief an ihre Regierungen veröffentlicht, in dem sie die Ablehnung der neuesten Version der Chatkontrolle fordern mit der Begründung, dass Massenüberwachung Grundrechte verletze und vor Gericht scheitern würde.[2] Signal und Threema haben angekündigt, dass sie ihre Dienste in der EU einstellen würden, wenn sie gezwungen würden, die vorgeschlagene automatisierte Überwachung (sogenanntes „Client-Side Scanning“) umzusetzen. Whatsapp-Chef Will Cathcart warnt: „Das Scannen von Nachrichten, wie es die EU vorschlägt, bricht die Verschlüsselung.“[3] Gestern Abend äußerte sich auch der NSA-Whistleblower Edward Snowden auf X und nannte den Vorschlag „eine erschreckende Massenüberwachungsmaßnahme“.[4]</p>



<p>Es ist noch nicht klar, ob die Befürworter genügend EU-Regierungen überzeugen können, um eine qualifizierte Mehrheit zu bilden, weshalb der Tagesordnungspunkt für morgen als „möglich“ gekennzeichnet ist.[1]</p>



<p>Vor diesem Hintergrund hat der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei, Patrick Breyer, der die Position des Europaparlaments zu dem Vorschlag mitverhandelt hat[5], einen Aufruf an alle Bürger veröffentlicht, sich an die EU-Regierungen zu wenden. Breyer nennt die EU-Länder, deren Regierungen noch unentschlossen sein könnten.[6]</p>



<p>„Wenn die Chatkontrolle kommt, werden wir gängige sichere Messenger ganz einfach nicht mehr nutzen können – das bedeutet wir verlieren den Kontakt zu unseren Freunden und Kollegen in der ganzen Welt“, warnt Breyer. „Wollen wir wirklich, dass Europa weltweit führend beim Abhören unserer Smartphones und der flächendeckenden Überwachung der Chats von Millionen gesetzestreuer Bürger wird? Wir im Europäischen Parlament sind überzeugt, dass diese orwellsche Chatkontrolle das dringliche Anliegen eines besseren Kinder- und Opferschutzes verrät, weil sie unweigerlich vor Gericht scheitern wird. Wir fordern deshalb einen wirklich wirksamen Kinderschutz durch sicherere Apps, proaktive Säuberung des Internets und eine Pflicht zur Löschung illegaler Inhalte – nichts davon ist in dem dem belgischen Vorschlag vorgesehen, über den die Regierungen morgen abstimmen werden.“</p>

  I decided to compile Postgres with LLVM this week but ran into failing tests
due to server crashes. Here’s how to avoid the issue.

<p>A quick post on the need to use a compatible <a href="https://clang.llvm.org" title="Clang: a C language family frontend for LLVM">Clang</a> compiler when building
Postgres with <a href="https://llvm.org" title="The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure">LLVM</a> support. TL;DR: always point the <code>CLANG</code> variable to the
correct Clang binary when compiling Postgres <code>--with-llvm</code>.</p>
 The Problem 
<p>I’m working on a POC for Postgres binary packaging (more on that soon) and
wanted to try it with LLVM support, which generates <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/jit-extensibility.html" title="Postgres Docs: JIT Extensibility">JIT inline extensions</a>.
So I installed <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/llvm">LLVM from Homebrew</a> on my Mac and built a new Postgres
<code>--with-llvm</code> and a pointer to <code>llvm-config</code>, as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-make.html#CONFIGURE-OPTIONS-FEATURES" title="Postgres Docs: Building and Installation with Autoconf and Make — PostgreSQL Features">described in the docs</a>:</p>
  <code>brew install llvm
./configure \
    --prefix=$HOME/pgsql-devel \
    --with-llvm \
    LLVM_CONFIG=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-config
make -j8
make install
</code>  <p>No problems, excellent. Now let’s run the tests:</p>
  <code>$ make check
# output elided
1..222
# 37 of 222 tests failed.
# The differences that caused some tests to fail can be viewed in the file "src/test/regress/regression.diffs".
# A copy of the test summary that you see above is saved in the file "src/test/regress/regression.out".
make[1]: *** [check] Error 1
make: *** [check] Error 2
</code>  <p>This was a surprise! A quick look at that <code>regression.diffs</code> file shows:</p>
 <code>+FATAL:  fatal llvm error: Unsupported stack probing method
+server closed the connection unexpectedly
+	This probably means the server terminated abnormally
+	before or while processing the request.
+connection to server was lost
</code> <p>Yikes, the server is crashing! What’s in the log file,
<code>src/test/regress/log/postmaster.log</code>? (Took a while to find it, thanks
depesz!):</p>
 <code>2024-06-18 14:13:52.369 EDT client backend[49721] pg_regress/boolean FATAL:  fatal llvm error: Unsupported stack probing method
</code> <p>Same error. I tried with both the current master branch and the Postgres 16
release branch and got the same result. I pulled together what data I could
and opened <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/95804" title="llvm/llvm-project#95804 fatal llvm error: Unsupported stack probing method on llvm 18.1.7">an LLVM issue</a>.</p>
 The Solution 
<p>After a few hours, one of the maintainers got back to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The error message is LLVM reporting the backend can’t handle the particular
form of “probe-stack” attribute in the input LLVM IR. So this is likely a
bug in the way postgres is generating LLVM IR: please file a bug against
Postgres. (Feel free to reopen if you have some reason to believe the issue
is on the LLVM side.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay so maybe it’s actually a Postgres bug? Seems odd, given the failures on
both master and Postgres 16, but I wrote to pgsql-hackers about it, where
Andres Freund quickly <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/20240617203721.rl5dbk4katakbbk5%40awork3.anarazel.de" title="Re: FYI: LLVM Runtime Crash">figured it out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect the issue might be that the version of clang and LLVM are
diverging too far. Does it work if you pass
CLANG=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang to configure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I gave it a try:</p>
  <code>make clean
./configure \
    --prefix=$HOME/pgsql-devel \
    --with-llvm \
    LLVM_CONFIG=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-config \
    CLANG=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang

make -j8
make install
</code>  <p>And then <code>make check</code>:</p>
  <code>$ make check
# output elided
1..222
# All 222 tests passed.
</code>  <p>Yay, that worked! So what happened? Well, take a look at this:</p>
  <code>$ which clang                                                    
/usr/bin/clang
</code>  <p>That’s Clang as installed by the <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/how-to/install-xcode-command-line-tools/">Xcode CLI tools</a>. Apparently there can be
incompatibilities between Clang and LLVM. So one has to be sure to use the
Clang that’s compatible with LLVM. Conveniently, the Homebrew LLVM formula
includes the proper Clang; all we have to do is tell the Postgres <code>configure</code>
script where to find it.</p>
<p>Pity the Xcode CLI package doesn’t include LLVM; it would avoid the problem
altogether.</p>
 Upshot 
<p>Always point the <code>CLANG</code> variable to the correct Clang binary when compiling
Postgres <code>--with-llvm</code>. I’ve updated my <a href="https://github.com/theory/pgenv" title="pgenv — PostgreSQL binary manager">pgenv</a> configuration, which depends
on some other [Homebrew]-installed libraries and <a href="https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv" title="plenv — perl binary manager">plenv</a>-installed Perl, to do
the right thing on macOS:</p>
  <code>PGENV_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS=(
    --with-perl
    "PERL=$HOME/.plenv/shims/perl"
    --with-libxml
    --with-uuid=e2fs
    --with-zlib
    --with-llvm
    LLVM_CONFIG=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-config
    CLANG=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang
    --with-bonjour
    --with-openssl # Replaced with --with-ssl=openssl in v14
    --enable-tap-tests
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig
    'CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/opt/readline/include -I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include -I/opt/homebrew/opt/libxml2/include -I/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/include'
    'CFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/opt/readline/include -I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include -I/opt/homebrew/opt/libxml2/include -I/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/include'
    'LDFLAGS=-L/opt/homebrew/opt/readline/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/libxml2/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/icu4c/lib'
)
</code>  <p>And now perhaps this post has helped you fix the same problem.</p>

<p>The PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/191/" title="PGConf.dev: Extensions Ecosystem Summit: Enabling comprehensive indexing, discovery, and binary distribution">Extension Ecosystem Summit</a> took place at PGConf.dev in
Vancouver on May 28, 2024 and it was great! Around 35 extension developers,
users, and fans gathered for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology" title="Wikipedia: Open space technology">open-space technology</a> (OST)-style
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" title="Wikipedia: Unconference">unconference</a>. I opened with a brief presentation (<a href="https://justatheory.com/shared/extension-ecosystem-summit/extension-summit-2024.pdf" title="🏔 PostgreSQL Extension Summit: An Unconference">slides</a>) to introduce the
Summit Theme:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Extension issues, designs and features 
 Development, packaging, installation, discovery, docs, etc. 
 Simplify finding, understanding, and installing 
 Towards ideal ecosystem of the future 
 For authors, packagers, DBAs, and users 
 Lots of problems, challenges, decisions 
 Which do you care about? 
 Collaborate, discover, discuss, document 
 Find answers, make decisions, set directions 
 Inform the PGXN v2 project 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Before the Summit my co-organizers and I had put up large sticky notes with
potential topics, and after reviewing the <a href="https://www.facilitator.school/blog/open-space-technology#open-space-technology-principles" title="Open Space Technology Principles">four principles</a> and one law of
[OST], we collectively looked them over and various people offered to lead
discussions. Others volunteered to take notes and later published them on the
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Extension_Summit" title="PostgreSQL Wiki: PGConf.dev 2024 Extension Summit">community wiki</a>. Here’s our report.</p>
 Extension Metadata 
<p>Samay Sharma of Tembo took point on this discussion, while David Wagoner of
EDB took <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Extension_Summit#Extension_Metadata" title="PostgreSQL Wiki: PGConf.dev 2024 Extension Summit --- Extension Metadata">notes</a>. The wide-ranging discussion among the five
participants covered taxonomies, versioning, system dependencies, packaging &amp;
discoverability, development &amp; compatibility, and more.</p>
<p>The discoverability topic particularly engaged the participants, as they
brainstormed features such as user comments &amp; ratings, usage insights, and
test reporting. They settled on the idea of two types of metadata:
developer-provided metadata such as external dependencies (software packages,
other extensions the extension depends on etc.) and user metadata such as
ratings. I’m gratified how closely this hews to the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/rfc-pgxn-metadata-sketch/" title="RFC: PGXN Metadata Sketch">metadata sketch</a>’s
proposed <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/rfc-pgxn-metadata-sketch/#package-metadata" title="RFC: PGXN Metadata Sketch --- Packaging Metadata">packaging</a> (author) and <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/rfc-pgxn-metadata-sketch/#registry-metadata" title="RFC: PGXN Metadata Sketch --- Registry Metadata">registry</a> (third party) metadata.</p>
 Binary Distribution Format 
<p>I led this session, while Andreas “ads” Scherbaum took <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Extension_Summit#Binary_Distribution_Format" title="PostgreSQL Wiki: PGConf.dev 2024 Extension Summit --- Binary Distribution Format">notes</a>.
I proposed to my four colleagues an idea I’d been mulling for a couple months
for an extension binary distribution format inspired by <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/" title="Python Packaging Guide: Binary distribution format">Python wheel</a>. It
simply includes pre-compiled files in subdirectories named for each
<code>pg_config</code> directory config. The other half of the idea, inspired by an
<a href="https://www.ongres.com/blog/why-postgres-extensions-should-be-distributed-and-packaged-as-oci-images/" title="OnGres Blog: Why Postgres Extensions should be packaged and distributed as OCI images">Álvaro Hernández blog post</a>, is to distribute these packages via <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md" title="Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification">OCI</a> — in
other words, just like Docker images. The participants agreed it was an
interesting idea to investigate.</p>
<p>We spent much of the rest of the time reviewing and trying to understand the
inherent difficulty of upgrading binary extensions: there’s a period between
when an extension package is upgraded (from Yum, Apt, etc.) and <code>ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE</code> updates it in the database. If the new binary doesn’t work
with old versions, it will break (and potentially crash Postgres!) until they
update. This can be difficult in, say, a data analytics environment with uses
of the extension in multiple databases and functions, and users may not have
the bandwidth to <code>ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE</code> any code that depends on the
extension.</p>
<p>This issue is best solved by defensive coding of the C library to keep it
working for new and old versions of an extension, but this complicates
maintenance.</p>
<p>Other topics included the lack of support for multiple versions of extensions
at one time (which could solve the upgrade problem), and determining the
upgrade/downgrade order of versions, because the Postgres core enforces no
version standard.</p>
 ABI/API discussion 
<p>Yurii Rashkovskii took point on this session while David Christensen took
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Extension_Summit#ABI.2FAPI_discussion" title="PostgreSQL Wiki: PGConf.dev 2024 Extension Summit --- ABI/API discussion">notes</a>. Around 25 attendees participated. The discussion focused
in issues of API and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" title="Wikipedia: Application binary interface">ABI</a> compatibility in the Postgres core. Today virtually
the entire code base is open for use by extension developers — anything in
header files. Some <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/05/mini-summit-five/" title="Mini Summit Five">recent research</a> revealed a few potentially-incompatible
changes in minor releases of Postgres, leading some to conclude that
extensions must be compiled and distributed separately for every minor
release. The group brainstormed improvements for this situation. Ideas
included:</p>
 
 Spelunking the source to document and categorize APIs for extensions 
 Documenting color-coded safety classifications for APIs: green, yellow, or
red 
 Designing and providing a better way to register and call hooks
(observability, administration, isolation, etc.), rather than the simple
functions Postgres offers today 
 Developing a test farm to regularly build and tests extensions, especially
ahead of a core release 
 And of course creating more hooks, such as custom relation type
handling, per-database background workers, a generic node visitor pattern,
and better dependency handling 
 
 Including/Excluding Extensions in Core 
<p>Keith Fiske led the discussion and took <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Extension_Summit#Including.2FExcluding_Extensions_in_Core" title="PostgreSQL Wiki: PGConf.dev 2024 Extension Summit --- Including/Excluding Extensions in Core">notes</a> for this
session, along with 10-15 or so attendees. It joined two topics: When should
an extension be brought into core and when should a contrib extension be
removed from core. The central point was the adoption of new features in core
that replace the functionality of and therefore reduce the need for some
extensions.</p>
<p>Replacing an extension with core functionality simplifies things for users.
However, the existence of an extension might prevent core from ever adding its
features. Extensions can undergo faster, independent development cycles
without burdening the committers with more code to maintain. This independence
encourages more people to develop extensions, and potentially compels core to
better support extensions overall (e.g., through better APIs/ABIs).</p>
<p>Contrib extensions currently serve, in part, to ensure that the extension
infrastructure itself is regularly tested. Replacing them with core features
would reduce the test coverage, although one participant proposed a patch to
add such tests to core itself, rather than as part of contrib extensions.</p>
<p>The participants collaborated on a list of contrib extensions to consider
merging into core:</p>
 
 amcheck 
 pageinspect 
 pg_buffercache 
 pg_freespacemap 
 pg_visibility 
 pg_walinspect 
 pgstattuple 
 
<p>They also suggested moving extension metadata (SQL scripts and control files)
from disk to catalogs and adding support for installing and using multiple
versions of an extension at one time (complicated by shared libraries),
perhaps by the adoption of more explicit extension namespacing.</p>
 Potential core changes for extensions, namespaces, etc. 
<p>Yurii Rashkovskii and David Christensen teamed up on this session, as well
(<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Extension_Summit#Potential_core_changes_for_extensions.2C_namespaces.2C_etc" title="PostgreSQL Wiki: PGConf.dev 2024 Extension Summit --- Potential core changes for extensions, namespaces, etc">notes</a>). 15-20 attendees brainstormed core changes to improve
extension development and management. These included:</p>
 
 File organization/layout, such as putting all the files for an extension
in a single directory and moving some files to the system catalog. 
 Provide a registry of “safe” extensions that can be installed without a
superuser. 
 Adding a GUC to configure a second directory for extensions, to enable
immutable Postgres images (e.g., Docker, Postgres.app). The attendees
consider this a short term fix, but still useful. (Related: I started a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/E7C7BFFB-8857-48D4-A71F-88B359FADCFD%40justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: RFC: Additional Directory for Extensions">pgsql-hackers thread</a> in April for a patch to to just this). 
 The ability to support multiple versions of an extension at once, via
namespacing, came up in this session, as well. 
 Participants also expressed a desire to support duplicate names through
deeper namespacing. Fundamentally, the problem of namespace collision
redounds to issues un-relocatable extensions. 
 
 Until Next Time 
<p>I found it interesting how many topics cropped up multiple times in separate
sessions. By my reading most cited topics were:</p>
 
 The need to install and use multiple versions of an extension 
 A desire for deeper namespacing, in part to allow for multiple versions of
an extension 
 A pretty strong desire for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" title="Wikipedia: Application binary interface">ABI</a> compatibility policy and clearer
understanding of extension-friendly APIs 
 
<p>I expect to put some time into these topics; indeed, I’ve already started a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D%40justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">Hackers thread proposing an ABI policy</a>.</p>
<p>I greatly enjoyed the discussions and attention given to a variety of
extension-related topics at the Summit. So much enthusiasm and intelligence in
one places just makes my day!</p>
<p>I’m thinking maybe we should plan to do it again next year. What do you think?

<p>Der folgende Brief von Abgeordneten aus verschiedenen Parlamenten in der Europäischen Union wurde heute versendet (und ist weiter für Unterschriften offen). In diesem Beitrag ist eine deutsche Übersetzung des Briefs, hier ein <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/lawmakers-across-the-eu-call-on-eu-council-to-reject-the-chat-control-proposal/">Link zur englischen Originalfassung</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Sehr geehrter Rat der Europäischen Union,</p>



<p>Sehr geehrte nationale Regierungen,</p>



<p>in den letzten Tagen der belgischen EU-Ratspräsidentschaft hat Belgien seine letzte Initiative vorgelegt, um im Rat der EU eine allgemeine Ausrichtung zur stark umstrittenen CSA-Verordnung (Vorschlag für eine Verordnung des Europäischen Parlaments und des Rates mit Vorschriften zur Verhütung und Bekämpfung des sexuellen Missbrauchs von Kindern) zu erreichen. Mit der möglichen Abstimmung über die CSA-Verordnung am 19. Juni riskiert der Rat weit mehr als nur die Verabschiedung einer einfachen Verordnung.</p>



<p>Sexueller Missbrauch und die Ausbeutung von Kindern, einschließlich der Verbreitung von Material über den sexuellen Missbrauch von Kindern, müssen mit äußerster Entschlossenheit im Einklang mit der Rechtsstaatlichkeit bekämpft werden. Der von der EU-Kommission vorgelegte Verordnungsvorschlag enthält zwar einige gute und wichtige Maßnahmen, wie z.B. das EU-Zentrum, aber es ist höchst fraglich, ob zentrale Aspekte der Verordnung mit den europäischen Grundrechten vereinbar sind.</p>



<p>Als Parlamentarier beobachten wir mit großer Sorge den Vorschlag des EU-Rates, der die Vertraulichkeit privater Kommunikation aushebeln würde. Auch wenn die belgische Ratspräsidentschaft nun einen Kompromissvorschlag vorgelegt hat, der die Verpflichtung zum Scannen privater unverschlüsselter sowie verschlüsselter Video- und Bildinhalte einschränkt, bleibt er ein Eingriff in die digitalen Grundrechte und führt die Diskussion zurück an den Ursprung der Debatte. Tatsächlich entspricht der belgische Vorschlag den ersten Pläne der Kommission, die im Dezember 2021 bekannt wurden.</p>



<p>Sichere und verschlüsselte Kommunikation ist für jeden Menschen von größter Bedeutung. Dies gilt auch für Kinder und Opfer von sexuellem Missbrauch, um sichere Rettungs- und Hilfeleistungen zu ermöglichen – insbesondere in Ländern, in denen sich Opferhilfsorganisationen nicht auf die Unterstützung und das Stillschweigen der staatlichen Strafverfolgungsbehörden verlassen können.</p>



<p>Abgesehen von der Gefahr, dass der Eingriff in die digitale Selbstbestimmung der Menschen dem Ziel des CSA-Vorschlags zuwiderläuft, könnte es zu mehreren unbeabsichtigten, aber gefährlichen Nebeneffekten kommen:</p>



 
 Client Side Scanning (CSS) und jede andere Massenüberwachung würde die Übermittlung vertraulicher Informationen unmöglich machen: Das Scannen würde Nutzer betreffen, die auf vertrauliche Kommunikation angewiesen sind und deren Kommunikation einen besonderen Anspruch auf Schutz hat (zur Vertraulichkeit verpflichtete Berufsgruppen wie Journalisten, Rechtsanwälte, der medizinische Bereich, aber auch Whistleblower). Außerdem könnten eingebaute Hintertüren die Vertraulichkeit digital übermittelter Betriebsgeheimnisse und Geschäftsvorgänge gefährden. Verschlüsselung schützt die Identität und den Inhalt der Kommunikationsteilnehmer und wahrt so die Autonomie der Opfer sexueller Gewalt. 



 Eine demokratische Gesellschaft und demokratische Debatten brauchen vertrauliche Schutzräume: Demokratische Gesellschaften brauchen Privatsphäre zur Meinungs- und Willensbildung. Die vorgeschlagenen Maßnahmen bergen die Gefahr, zu einer Selbstzensur zu führen und sichere Räume für Kinder und Opfer sexueller Gewalt, aber auch für alle anderen zu gefährden. Außerdem werden sie wahrscheinlich dazu führen, dass Nutzer digitale Dienste nicht mehr nutzen wollen und das Vertrauen in die Anbieter verlieren, wenn ihre Daten nicht sicher und geschützt sind. 



 Blaupause für autoritäre Staaten und Schwächung der Cybersicherheit: Durch den Aufbau einer Architektur, die jede Möglichkeit der privaten digitalen Kommunikation untergräbt, könnte die Verordnung unbeabsichtigt als Blaupause für die Überwachung in autoritären Staaten dienen und als eingebaute Hintertür dienen, die leicht für alle Arten von Überwachungspraktiken (z. B. Geschäftsgeheimnisse) und Cyberkriminelle ausgenutzt werden kann. Einmal aufgebaut, ist diese IT-Architektur eine Einladung zur Aushöhlung der Privatsphäre. 



 Beeinträchtigung von digitalen Bildungs-, Jugend- und Hilfsdiensten: Die in einigen europäischen Ländern übliche Praxis, wichtige Informationen zur sexuellen Gesundheit an solche Bildungseinrichtungen weiterzugeben, wird dadurch abgeschafft. 
 



<p>Die verpflichtende Überwachung privater Nachrichten ohne Verdacht birgt die Gefahr, ein Klima des Generalverdachts zu schaffen. Ein solcher Ansatz wird dem Bild der Europäischen Union als Garant der Freiheit irreparablen Schaden zufügen.</p>



<p>Wir warnen ausdrücklich davor, dass die Verpflichtung zum systematischen Scannen verschlüsselter Kommunikation, ob nun “Upload-Moderation” oder “Client-Side-Scanning” genannt, nicht nur die sichere Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung brechen würde, sondern mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit auch der Rechtsprechung des Europäischen Gerichtshofs nicht standhalten wird. Vielmehr stünde ein solcher Angriff in völligem Gegensatz zum europäischen Engagement für sichere Kommunikation und digitale Privatsphäre sowie für die Menschenrechte im digitalen Raum.</p>



<p>Wir brauchen daher dringend einen Ansatz, der dem Schutz und der Prävention von sexuellem Kindesmissbrauch Vorrang einräumt, mehr Ressourcen und eine gezieltere Koordinierung der europäischen Strafverfolgungsbehörden vorsieht, die Unterstützung der Opfer im Einklang mit den Grundrechten stärkt und es vermeidet, sich auf ein falsches Gefühl der Sicherheit durch Technosolutionismus zu verlassen.</p>



<p>Als nationale und europäische Parlamentarier sind wir überzeugt, dass die vorgeschlagenen Maßnahmen nicht mit den europäischen Grundrechten vereinbar sind. Wir setzen uns für die Wahrung des Rechts auf anonyme und pseudonyme Nutzung des Internets sowie für die Stärkung der Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung ein.</p>



<p>Wir fordern alle verhandelnden Regierungen im Ausschuss der Ständigen Vertreter (COREPER / AStV) dringend auf, eine allgemeine Ausrichtung auf der Grundlage des von Belgien vorgelegten Kompromissvorschlags abzulehnen.</p>

<p>Last week, I attended and presented at <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/2024" title="POSETTE: An Event for Postgres 2024">POSETTE</a>, An Event for Postgres. A
selection of the presentations I found worthy of attention.</p>
 Good Talks 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3gLgN517JA">Comparing Postgres connection pooler support for prepared statements</a> by
<a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/speakers/jelte-fennema-nio/">Jelte Fennema-Nio</a>. Jelte did a great job outlining the challenges he
encountered adding protocol-level prepared query support to <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org" title="Lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL">PgBouncer</a>. So
many edge cases! Very much a worthwhile effort, and an important contribution.
In the Discord “hallway track”, Jelte said he has some ideas how to add
support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html" title="Postgres Docs: LISTEN">LISTEN</a>/<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-notify.html" title="Postgres Docs: NOTIFY">NOTIFY</a>, which also requires connection affinity. Alas,
there’s no protocol-level support, so it’ll be tricky. I suspect I’ll
eventually move the <a href="https://botsin.space/@pgxn">PGXN Bot</a> to something like <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pgmq/" title="A lightweight message queue like AWS SQS or RSMQ, but on Postgres">pgmq</a> to avoid the issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z77AjEitFMA">How to work with other people</a> by <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/speakers/jimmy-angelakos/">Jimmy Angelakos</a> and <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/speakers/floor-drees/">Floor Drees</a>. Jimmy
&amp; Floor capably highlighted issues of neurodiversity and mental health in the
Postgres community and the workplace. I greatly appreciate the increasing
awareness of and discussions about these issues, which for far to long have
remained hidden or misunderstood. All too often they still are. The more
people talk about them, the more they’ll be accepted and the better things
will become. Love seeing this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6X60ln2VNc">Even JSONB In Postgres Needs Schemas</a> by <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/speakers/chris-ellis/">Chris Ellis</a>. Chris concisely
introduced the concept of JSON validation via <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html" title="Postgres Docs: Constraints">check constraints</a> to ensure
the integrity of data. He started with simple validation with <code>json_typeof()</code>,
moved to more comprehensive validation of various parts of a JSON or JSONB
object, and ultimately full <a href="https://json-schema.org">JSON Schema</a> validation with the <a href="https://github.com/supabase/pg_jsonschema" title="PostgreSQL extension providing JSON Schema validation">pg_jsonschema</a>
extension. Having recently written my own <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/jsonschema/" title="PGXN: jsonschema --- JSON Schema validation functions for PostgreSQL">JSON Schema extension</a>, I was happy
to see this topic receive more attention. The tool Chris developed to <a href="https://nexteam.co.uk/pg-jsonschema-gen/v1/index.html" title="PostgreSQL JSON Validation Function Generator">convert
JSON schema to a SQL function</a> seems super neat, too — a great way to
bootstrap a check constraint from a JSON Schema where no such extension
exists, such as the big cloud providers.</p>
 I Also Spoke 
<p>I also gave a talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6thIB2jw6w">State of the Postgres Extension Ecosystem</a>, expanding
upon my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/mini-summit-one/" title="Mini Summit One">mini-Summit session</a>. I think it came out pretty well, and hope it
helps to get more people interested in extensions and solve the challenges for
finding, evaluating, installing, and using them everywhere. Links:</p>

 Next Year 
<p>I found <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/posette/2024" title="POSETTE: An Event for Postgres 2024">POSETTE</a> a very nice Postgres conference. I applaud its commitment to
a fully-virtual venue. In-person get-togethers are great, but not everyone can
travel to them for reasons of cost, time, family, health, and more. Better
still, the speakers recorded their presentations in advance, allows us to
fully participate in discussion during our talks! (I mostly used my time to
offer corrections and links to relevant resources.)</p>
<p>For those interested in Postgres, I heartily endorse this free, fully remote
conference. Perhaps I’ll “see” you there next year.</p>

<p>What is decentralized identity and why is it important? My attempt at a simple explanation. </p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3cc90cf6-398a-4c28-a414-a05c5c083959_1200x686.heic">    </a> <p>In <a href="https://www.newsletters.identity25.com/p/yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-nah">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nah</a>, Alan Mayo references my recent blog post, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2024/06/decentralized_identity_comes_of_age.shtml">Decentralized Identity Comes of Age</a>, and says:</p><blockquote><p>My challenge to the decentralization community is for them (someone) to explain how it works in relatively simple and reasonable terms. I say relative because identity is not simple, so we should not expect simple solutions.</p></blockquote><p>This post is my attempt to do that for Alan and others.</p><p>Identity is how we recognize, remember, react to, and interact with other people, organizations, and services. Put another way, identity is about <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationships</a>. Online we suffer from a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/10/fixing_the_five_problems_of_internet_identity.shtml">proximity problem</a>. Since we're not near the parties we want to have relationships with, our natural means of recognizing, remembering, and interacting with others can't be used. Digital identity systems are meant to provide us with the means of creating online relationships.</p><p>Traditional identity systems have not served us well because they are owned and controlled by companies who build them for their own purposes. The relationships they support are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#anemic">anemic and transactional</a>. We can't use them for any purpose except what their owners allow.</p><p>Decentralized identity systems1 on the other hand allow you to create online relationships with any person, organization, or service you choose and give you the tools to manage and use those relationships. They help you recognize, remember, react to, and interact with them. The most important tool is a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/12/wallets_and_agents.shtml">decentralized identity wallet</a>. The world of decentralized identity wallets is still young, but organizations like the Linux Foundation's <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a> give me hope that useful, interoperable wallets are a tool we'll all be able to use soon. They are as foundational to decentralized identity as a browser is to the web.</p><p>Besides helping you manage peer-to-peer relationships with others online, wallets hold <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a>, the digital analog to the credentials and cards you carry in a physical wallet. One of the most important aspects of digital relationships is providing information about yourself to those you interact with. Sometimes that information can come from you—it's self-asserted—but many times the other party wants to reliably know what others say about you. For example, if you establish a banking relationship, the bank is legally obligated to verify things like your name and address independent of what you say. Decentralized identity wallets allow you to prove things about yourself using credentials others provide to you. At the same time, they protect your privacy by limiting the information disclosed and forgoing the need for the party you're interacting with to directly contact others to verify the information you provide.</p><p>In summary, decentralized identity systems allow you to create digital relationships with other parties independently, without relying on any other organization or service. These relationships are direct, private, and secure. They also provide the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml">means for you to prove things about yourself</a> inside these relationships so that even though you're operating at a distance, you and the other party can have confidence in the relationship's authenticity.</p> How Does It Work <p>The preceding paragraphs say what decentralized identity is, and provide its benefits, but don't say how it works. Alan and others will likely want a few more details. Everything I describe below is handled by the wallet. The person using the wallet doesn't need to have any more knowledge of how they work than the operator of a browser needs to understand HTTP and HTML.</p><p>The foundation of a peer-to-peer, decentralized online relationship is an <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identifier</a> like a <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html">peer DID</a>. Identifiers are handles that someone else can use to identify someone or something else online. Peer DIDs can be created by a wallet at will, they're free, and they're self-certifying (i.e., there's no third party). A relationship is created when two identity wallets create and exchange peer DIDs with each other on behalf of their owners. Peer DIDs allow the parties to the relationship to exchange private, secure messages.</p><p>There are four primary interaction patterns that wallets undertake when exchanging messages:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml#didauth">DID Authentication</a> which uses the DIDs to authenticate each other</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml#single_party">Single-Party Credential Authorization</a> where the same party issues and verifies the credential.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml#multi_party">Multi-Party Authorization</a> where the credential issuer and verifier are different parties.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml#data_transfer">Generalized Trustworthy Data Transfer</a> which uses a collection of credentials to aid the wallet owner in completing online workflows.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33d96d89-ebc7-4b3b-b2d3-a958a73de187_768x688.heic">    </a>Generalized credential exchange pattern <p>Verifiable credentials make heavy use of cryptography to provide not only security and privacy, but also confidence that the credential data is authentic. This confidence is based on four properties a properly designed credential presentation protocol provides:</p>  <p>The identifier of the credential issuer</p>  <p>Proof that the credential is being presented by the party it was issued to</p>  <p>Proof that the credential has not been tampered with</p>  <p>The revocation status of the credential</p>  <p>The credential presentation can do all this while only disclosing the information needed for the interaction and without the verifier having to contact the credential issuer. Not having to contact the issuer ensures the credential can be used in situations with poor connectivity, that the issuer needn't be online, and preserves the credential subject's privacy about where the credential is being used.</p><p>A properly designed credential exchange protocol has four important properties:</p>  <p>The system is decentralized and contextual. There is no central authority for all credentials. Every party can be an issuer, an owner, and a verifier. The system can be adapted to any country, any industry, any community, any set of credentials, any set of trust relationships.</p>  <p>Issuers are free to determine what credentials to issue and whether or not to revoke them.</p>  <p>Wallet owners are free to choose which credentials to carry and where and when they get shared. While some verifiers require a specific credential—such as a customs agent requiring a passport—others will accept a range of credentials. Therefore owners can decide which credentials to carry in their wallet based on the verifiers with whom they interact.</p>  <p>Verifiers make their own decisions about which credentials to accept. For example, a bar you are trying to enter may accept any credential you have about your date of birth. This means some credentials (e.g., passports, driving licenses, birth certificates) may be much more useful than just for the original purpose for which they were issued.</p>  <p>These properties make a decentralized identity system <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">self sovereign</a>.</p> Why is Decentralized Identity Important? <p>Decentralized identity systems are designed to provide people with control, security, and privacy while enhancing the confidence we have in our online relationships. Some time ago, I wrote the following. I think it’s an apt way to close to any discussion of decentralized identity because unless we keep our eyes on the goal, we’ll likely take shortcuts in implementation that fail to live up to their promise.</p><p>Presently, people don’t have operational relationships anywhere online.2 We have plenty of online relationships, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Peer-to-peer relationships are the norm in the physical world. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so under the control of some administrative system. Rather, we act as embodied agents and operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. Any properly designed decentralized identity system must provide people with the tools they need to be “embodied” in the digital world and act autonomously.</p><p>Time and again, various people have tried to create decentralized marketplaces or social networks only to fail to gain traction. These systems fail because they are not based on a firm foundation that allows people to act in relationships with sovereign authority in systems mediated through protocol rather than by the whims of companies. We have a fine example of a protocol mediated system in the internet, but we’ve failed to take up the daunting task of building the same kind of system for identity. Consequently, when we act, we do so without firm footing or sufficient leverage.</p><p>Ironically, the internet broke down the walled gardens of CompuServe and Prodigy with a protocol-mediated metasystem, but surveillance capitalism has rebuilt them on the web. No one could live an effective life in an amusement park. Similarly, we cannot function as fully embodied agents in the digital sphere within the administrative systems of surveillance capitalists, despite their attractions. The emergence of self-sovereign identity, agreements on protocols, and the creation of metasystems to operationalize them promises a digital world where decentralized interactions create life-like online experiences. The richer relationships that result from properly designed decentralized identity systems promise an online future that gives people the opportunity to act for themselves as autonomous human beings and supports their dignity so that they can live an effective online life.</p>    Notes   <p>I prefer the term self-sovereign to decentralized because it describes the goal rather than the implementation, but I’ll stick with decentralized here. All self-sovereign identity systems are decentralized. Not all decentralized identity systems are self-sovereign.</p>  <p>The one exception I can think of to this is email. People act through email all the time in ways that aren’t intermediated by their email provider. Again, it’s a result of the architecture of email, set up over four decades ago and the culture that architecture supports.</p>  <p>Photo Credit: Young Woman Using a Wallet from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: draw a rectangular picture of a young woman using a wallet.</p><p></p>

<p>Update 2024-03-22: To compliment high-level discussions on the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a>
channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a>, I also created a <a href="https://github.com/theory/justatheory/pull/4">pull request</a> to make it
easer directly comment to this post point by point. Keep the feedback coming,
and thank you!</p>
<p>Update 2024-03-25: Clarified the definition of “Release” and made
“Maintainers” plural. Thanks to Matthias van de Meent for the suggestions!</p>
<p>Update 2024-07-06 Fixed some typos.</p>
<p>Update 2024-07-15 Converted to <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/2" title="pgxn/rfcs#2 – RFC: Binary Distribution Format">RFC–2</a>; <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/07/rfc-pgxn-meta-v2/" title="RFC: PGXN Meta Spec v2">blog post</a>.</p>
 
<p>This post proposes a new metadata standard for extension packaging,
distribution, and delivery, building on the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">PGXN Meta Spec</a> to address its
shortcomings and emerging use cases 12 years on. The goals include:</p>
 
 Don’t break the existing standard, but add to it 
 Add explicit support for different types of Postgres extensions,
such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a> 
 Add additional metadata for curation and automated compilation and binary
packaging 
 Add hooks for registry and third-party-contributed metadata, including
binary distribution options and stats &amp; reports. 
 
<p>There are two high level categories of metadata, split into two separate
files:</p>
 
 <a>Package Metadata</a> provided by extension package
authors 
 <a>Registry Metadata</a> aggregated by the root registry
from various sources, including data derived from the extension source
code or package metadata, but also trusted third parties such as
packagers, smoke testers, security scanners, and more 
 
<p>Following community discussion of this proposal, the <a>Package
Metadata</a> will lead to a draft for PGXN Meta Spec version
2.0.0, while the <a>Registry Metadata</a> will guide the design
and implementation of the Root Registry APIs required to provide it.</p>
 Terms 
<p>Definition of terms as used in this document, because every language and
distribution system uses terms differently. These are ours.</p>
 
 
<p>Extension: A software component that extends the capabilities of a
PostgreSQL database or cluster. Extensions may be <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”">extensions</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a>, command-line apps, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a>,
shared libraries, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Package: A collection of extensions that are released, versioned, and
distributed together. Packages may be downloaded directly from version
control repositories or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_file" title="Wikipedia: “Archive file”">archive files</a> generated by a release tag.</p>
 
 
<p>Package Path: Identifies a package, declared in the <a>package
metadata</a> file. A package path should describe both
what the package does and where to find it. Typically, a package path
consists of a repository root path — the directory that contains the
metadata file — and a directory within the repository.</p>
 
 
<p>Repository: The version control repository where the package is
developed, referenced as package path or URL.</p>
 
 
<p>Repository root path: The portion of the package path that corresponds
to the root directory of the version control repository where the package
is developed, and which contains the metadata file. Most package are
defined in their repository’s root directory, so this is usually the
entire path. For example, <code>github.com/example/pgtap</code> is the repository
root path for the package of the same name.</p>
 
 
<p>Source Distribution: The contents of a single package bundled together
with <a>package metadata</a> into distributable archive
file, usually named with the last part of the package path or the main
extension, a dash, and the version, e.g., <code>pgtap-1.14.3.zip</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Binary Distribution: A binary software distribution of a package,
compiled and packaged for a particular OS version, platform, and hardware
architecture. Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)" title="Wikipedia: “Deb (file format)”">deb</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager" title="Wikipedia: “RPM Package Manager”">RPM</a>, and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/" title="Python Packaging User Guide: Source distribution format">wheel</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Release: A single version of the package made available to the public on
PGXN, expressed as the package path, an at sign, and the <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">semver</a>. Example:
<code>github.com/theory/pgtap@v1.14.3</code>.</p>
 
 
 Package Metadata 
<p>The extension author provides this data as part of a release submitted to the
root registry. The registry itself will not change this data in any way, but
provide it as-is.</p>
 Essentials 
<p>Essential information about the package itself, including its path, name,
version, list of authors, license, etc. Ecosystem applications use this data
for indexing, naming conventions, and display information.</p>
<p>Fields (all required):</p>
 
 Package: A package path uniquely identifying the package (usually the
source repo host name and path; see <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/extension-namespace-rfc/" title="Extension Registry Namespacing RFC">this RFC</a>) 
 Name: The name of the extension package, usually the same as the main
extension, not unique but conflicts are resolved by escalation to
<code>package</code> 
 Version: The version of the package, expressed as a <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">SemVer</a> 
 Abstract: A short description of the purpose of the package 
 Description: A longer description of the package, answering the
question “what is this thing and what value is it?” 
 Maintainers: List of maintainers, each an object with <code>name</code> and either
<code>email</code> or <code>url</code> (or both) 
 License: An <a href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/" title="Annex D SPDX license expressions (Normative)">SPDX 2.3 license expression</a> comprised of one or more
licenses from the <a href="https://spdx.github.io/license-list-data/" title="PREVIEW - SPDX License List">SPDX License List</a> 
 Spec: Information about the metadata spec itself, a version and URL 
 
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
  "package": "github.com/example/pg-pair",
  "name": "pair",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "abstract": "A key/value pair data type",
  "description": "Adds a key/value pair data type to Postgres, useful for specifying arbitrary key/value function parameters.",
  "maintainers": [
    {
        "name": "Naomi Nagata",
        "email": "naomi@example.com",
        "url": "https://example.com/roci/naomi"
    }
  ],
  "license": "PostgreSQL OR MIT",
  "spec": {
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "url": "https://pgxn.org/meta/spec.txt"
  }
}
</code>  <p>Other possibilities:</p>
 
 License File: An alternative to <code>license</code> for nonstandard licenses
(from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields" title="Cargo Manifest Format: The license and license-file fields">cargo</a>) 
 Contributors: List of people who have contributed to the package 
 Emeriti: List of former maintainers and contributors 
 
<p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
 
 Overloads the string representation of the spec v1 field, but it should be
able to parse either one, especially with the spec version to
differentiate. 
 Uniqueness of <code>package</code> and relationship to <code>name</code> 
 PGXN has <code>maintainer</code>; is it really worth pluralizing it? Maybe we don’t
need it at all, given repository and issue links. 
 
 Artifacts 
<p>A list of links and checksums for downloading the extension package in one or
more formats, including source code, binaries, system packages, and more. Apps
use this information (along with <a>registry metadata</a>) to
determine the best option for installing an extension on a particular system.</p>
<p>This information is optional, and provided in addition to the source code
available from the root registry itself. The idea is that, on release, the
release manager creates artifacts in one or more locations (such as GitHub
releases), and it’s useful to link to them from the registry. Binary builds
may be unlikely today, but leave the option open for now by allowing arbitrary
text in the <code>type</code> field.</p>
<p>Each item must have:</p>
 
 Type: The type of artifact: Source, binary, RPM, etc. 
 URL: Link the the artifact 
 SHA: A SHA checksum 
 
<p>Each URL must properly resolve and the checksum must match.</p>
  <code>[
  {

  }
]
</code>  <p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>New object, no conflicts.</p>
 Resources 
<p>External information about the package, mostly links, including source code
repository, bug reporting, documentation, badges, funding, etc. Apps use this
data for links, of course, but also full text indexing, documentation
rendering, and displaying useful information about the extension.</p>
<p>Fields:</p>
 
 Homepage: URL for the package’s home page 
 Issues: URL to issues 
 Documentation: URL to documentation 
 Support: URL to support 
 Repository: Source code repository URL 
 Badges: Array of badge link objects 
 Funding: Array of funding objects

</code>  <p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
 
 <code>issues</code> replaces <code>bugtracker</code> and is just a URL. Can support either 
 <code>repository</code> is just a URL instead of an object. Can support either
but with the <code>package</code> key referencing the repository path perhaps
we don’t need to change it. 
 
 Contents 
<p>A description of what’s included in the package. Often a package consists of
multiple extensions, such as <a href="https://postgis.net" title="PostGIS">PostGIS</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apostgis%2Fpostgis+%22default_version+%3D%22&amp;type=code" title="postgis/postgis: control files">includes</a> <code>postgis</code>,
<code>postgis_tiger_geocoder</code>, <code>address_standardizer</code>, and more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some extensions are not <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>-type <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”">extensions</a> at
all, such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a>, command-line apps, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a>,
shared libraries, and more. Each should be listed along with documentation
links where they differ from the package overall (or are simply more
specific).</p>
<p>Fields:</p>
 
 Extensions: Object describing <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”">extensions</a>. Keys
are extension names, fields are objects with the fields <code>sql</code>, <code>doc</code>,
<code>abstract</code>, <code>control</code> (same as control file, but can use the file itself),
<code>tle</code> (meaning it can be used as a <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="pg_tle: Framework for building trusted language extensions for PostgreSQL">trusted language extension</a>), and
<code>preload</code> (to indicate whether its libraries need to be loaded in advance
via <code>shared_preload_libraries</code>, <code>session_preload_libraries</code>, or
<code>local_preload_libraries</code>). 
 Workers: Object describing background workers. Keys are worker names,
fields are objects with the fields <code>bin</code>, <code>doc</code>, and <code>abstract</code>. 
 Apps: Object describing applications, command-line or otherwise. Keys
are app names, fields are objects with the fields <code>bin</code>, <code>doc</code>, and
<code>abstract</code>. 
 Modules: Object describing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a> that can be loaded into
Postgres (not necessary for extensions that include libraries). Keys are
module names, fields are objects with the fields <code>lib</code> (without file
extension), <code>doc</code>, <code>abstract</code>, and <code>preload</code>. 
 Libraries: Other libraries that may ship in the package and need to be
installed but are not <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a>, such as a dynamic library used
by an app. Keys are library names, fields are objects with the fields
<code>lib</code> (without file extension) or <code>dir</code> (for a directory of files), <code>doc</code>,
and <code>abstract</code>. 
 
  <code>{

      "dir": "lib/gems",
      "abstract": "Ruby libraries required to run the extension"
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>Other options:</p>
 
 Allow or require an array of docs? 
 Specify support for specific doc formats (markdown, manpage, plain text,
MkDocs, etc.)? 
 Support glob patterns? 
 Add libraries as sub-key for workers and apps, e.g. for a Ruby app that
requires a directory of gems? 
 
<p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>Significantly different from the existing <code>provides</code> object, so key this one
under <code>contents</code> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_file" title="Wikipedia: “Manifest file”"><code>manifest</code></a> and continue to support both.</p>
 Dependencies 
<p>A list of external dependencies required to configure, build, test, install,
and run the extensions in the package. These include not only other extension
packages, but also external libraries and system dependencies. And let’s not
forget the versions of Postgres required, as well as any OS and version
dependencies (e.g, does it work on Windows? FreeBSD? What versions?) and
architectures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64" title="Wikipedia: AArch64">arm64</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amd64" title="Wikipedia: AMD64">amd64</a>, etc.)</p>
<p>Fields:</p>
 
 
<p>platforms: Platforms supported by the package, defined as OS and
architecture. Assume all platforms if none are listed.</p>
 
 
<p>postgres: Versions of PostgreSQL required by the package, specified as
a version range, as well as compiled features (<code>--with-*</code> configure
options)</p>
 
 
<p>pipeline: The build pipeline required to build the extension. Options:
<code>pgxs</code>, <code>meson</code> (?) <code>pgrx</code>, <code>gnu</code> (<code>./configure</code>), <code>gem</code>, <code>cpan</code>, <code>pip</code>,
<code>go</code>, etc.</p>
 
 
<p>prereqs: Object defining external dependencies required for different
phases:</p>
 
 configure: Dependencies to configure the package (e.g., items
required for <code>./configure</code> or <code>make</code> to work) 
 build: Dependencies to build the package (in addition to run
dependencies) 
 test: Dependencies to test the package (in addition to build and
run dependencies) 
 run: Dependencies to run the package 
 develop: Dependencies to develop the package (in addition to all
other phase dependencies) 
 
<p>Each points to an object with at least one of these keys:</p>
 
 requires: Required to use the package 
 recommends: Not required, but recommended as a best practice 
 suggests: Not required, but nice to have 
 conflicts: Package will not work with these items 
 
<p>These, in turn, contain at least one of these keys:</p>
 
 package: Other packages, expressed by their package paths,
pointing to a version expression 
 external: External dependencies not included with the package 
 contrib: List of Postgres contrib or development packages 
 
 
 
<p>variations: A list of dependency variations, each with two fields:</p>
 
 where: Specifies a configuration that, when matched, includes the
dependencies. For example, to specify alternate dependencies for Linux
arm64, it would be <code>"platforms": { "linux": "arm64" }</code>. For a specific
version of Postgres, it would be something like
<code>"postgres": { "version": "&gt;= 16, &lt; 17" }</code>. [This likely needs some
deep thinking through.] 
 dependencies: An object containing of the other key structures in
this object, defining the additional dependencies for environments
that match the <code>where</code> field. 
 
 
 
<p>The <code>packages</code> and <code>external</code> keys point to objects in which the keys are
dependency names and the values are version range expressions (empty string
means any version). The <code>postgres.version</code> field is also a version range
expression.</p>
<p>The <code>contrib</code> key points to an array of Postgres-supplied apps and extensions.
Versions are not necessary because they effectively have the same version as a
supported Postgres version.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
  "postgres": {
    "version": "&gt;= 12, &lt; 17",
    "with": [ "xml", "uuid", "perl" ]
  },
  "pipeline": "pgrx",
  "platforms": {
    "linux": [ "amd64", "arm64" ],
    "darwin": [ "amd64", "arm64" ],
    "windows": [ "amd64" ],
    "freebsd": [ "amd64" ]
  },
  "prereqs": {
    "configure": {
      "requires": {
        "external": { "cargo-pgrx": "" }
      }
    },
    "build": {
      "requires": {
        "external": {
          "curl": "",
          "awk": "",
          "sed": "",
          "perl": "5.20"
        }
      },
      "recommends": {
        "external": {
          "jq": "",
          "perl": "5.38"
        }
      }
    },
    "test": {
      "requires": {
        "contrib": [ "pg_regress", "plpgsql", "plperl" ],
        "packages": {
          "github.com/theory/pgtap": "1.1.0"
        }
      }
    },
    "run": {
      "requires": {
        "contrib": [ "plperl" ],
        "packages": {
          "github.com/theory/hostname": ""
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>Notes:</p>
<p>The <code>external</code> field is the tricky one. How does one provide a canonical
dependency for a third-party library or app that may have loads of different
names on different platforms, different packaging systems (apt vs rpm), and
even different versions of them, or split apart for development and runtime
use? Some possibilities:</p>
 
 Use <a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec" title="purl-spec: A minimal specification for purl a.k.a. a package “mostly universal” URL">purl</a> and let downstream services handle the conversion 
 Create a rule set that allows one to predict dependency name changes
across ecosystems, similar to <a href="https://github.com/repology/repology-rules" title="Package normalization ruleset for Repology">repology-rules</a> 
 Just use <a href="https://repology.org" title="Repology, the packaging hub">Repology</a>? 
 
<p>Other notes:</p>
 
 Decide on a version range standards to adopt. Start with the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/#Version.Ranges" title="PGXN Meta Spec: Version Ranges">PGXN version
range</a>, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/" title="PEP 508 – Dependency specification for Python Software Packages">pep-0508</a>, <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver#ranges" title="npm docs: semver advanced range syntax">npm ranges</a>, and <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/rubygems/rdoc/Gem/Version.html">Gem::Version</a>. 
 Is <code>pipeline</code> really necessary, given configure requirements? I think so,
because it tells the client the preferred build system to use, in case it
can’t detect it for some reason. 
 
<p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>Significantly differs from the existing <code>prereqs</code> object, so this one is keyed
under <code>dependencies</code> and we can support either.</p>
 Classification 
<p>Classification metadata lets the extension developer associate additional
information to improve discovery, such as key words. It might also allow
selections from a curated list of extension classifications, such as the
<a href="https://crates.io/category_slugs" title="crates.io valid category slugs">category slugs</a> supported for the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-categories-field" title="Cargo Manifest Format: The categories field">cargo categories field</a>.</p>
<p>Ecosystem apps use this data to organize extensions under key words or
categories, making it easier for users to find extensions that are frequently
used together or for specific workloads or tasks.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
  "tags": [
    "testing",
    "pair",
    "parameter"
  ],
  "categories": [
    "Machine Learning"
  ]
}
</code>  <p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>Conflicts with the existing root-level <code>tags</code> array, but we can support either
one.</p>

</code>  <p>Note that PostgresML also provides a dashboard app, but it does not ship with
the extension, so it’s not listed here. It could have its own package metadata
and be separately distributed.</p>
<p>For the Python dependencies, in the absence of a neutral standard for
specifying package, here they’re specified using a syntax borrowed from RPM to
make clear that they’re Python dependencies. A couple of those dependencies
are Linux-only, so listed in <code>variations</code> where the OS is Linux.</p>
 Registry Metadata 
<p>The second metadata format is registry metadata. It starts by with a copy the
<a>package metadata</a>, but builds from there, adding
information (such as the artifact link, SHA, and cryptographic signature from
the registry itself) and sections (defined below).</p>
<p>Providing a separate metadata format enables broader community collaboration
to augment the metadata for extension packages.</p>
<p>Ideally an ecosystem of trusted services will be developed by various parties,
who will report back to the root registry as the source of record for all
metadata about extension packages. For example, a binary distribution service
like <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt" title="PostgreSQL packages for Debian and Ubuntu">apt.postgresql.org</a> or <a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a> will submit links and checksums for
binary packages and perhaps periodic download stats.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are three typologies for registry metadata:
Distributions, Reports, and Classifications.</p>
 Distributions 
<p>A list of links and checksums for downloading binary distributions for the
extension package. The root registry page for the package can therefore list
all the ways to install an extension and expand the list as new binary
registries add it.</p>
<p>Along with the <a>Artifacts</a> package metadata, the distribution
metadata allows installer tools to select the best option to install based on
the OS, Postgres version, and cluster configuration (e.g., install the
community Apt package if the cluster was installed from the community Apt
registry).</p>
<p>Each item must have:</p>
 
 Registry: The name of the distribution registry, unique 
 Type: The type of distribution: Apt, RPM, TLE, etc. 
 URL: Link to the the registry’s page for the distribution 
 Command: In lieu of a URL and SHA it can provide instructions to
install the distribution, e.g., <code>apt-get install postgresql16-pair</code>. 
 
<p>Each distribution registry must be trusted by the root registry to submit this
information to add to the metadata, and have its own page with additional
contextual information: its home page, docs, basic instructions, whatever. A
README of sorts.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>[
  {
    "registry": "trunk.pgxn.org",
    "type": "trunk",
    "command": "pgxn install github.com/example/pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "apt.postgresql.org",
    "type": "apt",
    "command": "apt-get install postgresql16-pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "yum.postgresql.org",
    "type": "rpm",
    "command": "yum install postgresql16-pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "pgt.dev",
    "type": "apt",
    "url": "https://pgt.dev/extensions/pair",
    "command": "trunk install pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "pgxman.com",
    "type": "apt",
    "url": "https://pgxman.com/x/pair",
    "command": "pgxman install pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "database.dev",
    "type": "sql",
    "url": "https://database.dev/example/pair",
    "command": "SELECT dbdev.install('example-pair');"
  },
]
</code>  <p>Other Options:</p>
 
 Information about installing from a registry that doesn’t offer URLs, like
Homebrew, where one just needs to know what the formula is called. Maybe
the same should apply to Apt? 
 
 Metrics and Reports 
<p>This object includes data such as number of downloads, build and test status
on various Postgres/OS/version combinations, binary packaging distributions,
test coverage, security certification, vulnerability detection, quality
metrics and user ratings, and more. Some of these bits of data might include
badges, e.g., for ratings or security assessments.</p>
<p>In the broader ecosystem, it would be the responsibility of the root registry
to ensure that data comes only from trusted sources. However this data will be
publicly readable, allowing any downstream applications to extend and
publish metrics and reports with their own information.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
    "aggregates": {
      "downloads": 32
    },
    "sources": {
      "smoke-tester.example.com": {
        "stats": {
          "passes": 32,
          "fails": 8,
          "unknown": 0
        },
        "link": "https://smoke-tester.example.com/extension/pair",
        "badge": "https://smoke-tester.example.com/extension/pair.svg"
      },
      "pgt.dev": {
        "downloads": 12,
        "tags": ["two", "kv"],
        "categories": ["Analytics"]
      },
      "pgxman.com": {
        "downloads": 20
      },
      "ratings.example.com": {
        "stats": {
          "ratings": 324,
          "average": 3.2,
          "comments": 13
        },
        "link": "https://ratings.example.com/extension/pair",
        "badge": "https://ratings.example.com/extension/pair.svg"
      },
      "stats.example.com": {
        "contributors": 2,
        "stars": 14,
        "last_active": "2024-01-12",
      },
      "security-scan.example.com": {
        "advisories": {
          "high": 2,
          "moderate": 11,
          "low": 1,
          "cves": 0
        },
        "link": "https://security-scan.example.com/extension/pair",
        "badge": "https://security-scan.example.com/extension/pair.svg"
      }
    }
}
</code>  <p>Notes:</p>
 
 
<p>The <code>aggregates</code> section aggregates results from multiple sources, for
example summing all downloads or averaging ratings. The list of items to
aggregate could evolve regularly.</p>
 
 
<p>Each key in <code>sources</code> identifies a trusted downstream source of
information. Each would have its own schema describing its objects and
their meaning, along with URI templates to link to. For example,
<code>stats.example.com</code> might have these templates:</p>
  <code>{
  "contributors": {
    "alt": "List of people who have contributed to the {name} project",
    "badge": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/contributors.svg",
    "uri": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/contributors"
  },
  "stars": {
    "alt": "Star ratings for the {name} project",
    "badge": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/stars.svg",
    "uri": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/stars"
  }
}
</code>   
 
<p>Might be worth adopting more of an API of multiple files, rather than one big file.
Example: <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/docs/api/#analytics" title="Homebrew JSON API Documentation: Analytics">Homebrew analytics</a>. Note also its support for date ranges for analytics
(30/90/365 days, stats when directly installed vs. installed as a dependency).</p>
