<p>In 2018, all European member states, together with Norway and Lichtenstein, signed a declaration stating the joint ambition to take advantage of blockchain technology. These 29 countries founded the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP), and within this partnership, they decided to build the so-called European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI).</p><p>EBSI was created aiming to, on the one hand, provide blockchain capabilities used by the partner of the EPB to implement and realize blockchain projects and use cases within these countries. Moreover, on the other hand, to achieve certain use cases on a European level. The so-called use case groups were defined and present the working groups related to a specific use case to support the latter idea. These use case groups consist of representatives of the EBP member counties, domain experts as well as the European Commission.</p><p>Initially, four use case groups were founded, namely the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), the diploma use case, document traceability, and secure document transfer. ESSIF focuses on digital identities where the user is in control over her identity data. The diploma use case focuses on educational diplomas of students and related processes such as issuing, verifying, revocation, and all of these processes in cross-border scenarios. Document traceability considers the anchoring of document-related identifiers like hashes on the blockcahin and secure document sharing on tax-related information transfer.</p><p>EBSI defined so-called use case groups that should be achieved using the provided capabilities to showcase their functionality and bring in expertise in the specific fields. Each use case group consists of representatives of the member states, domain experts, and the European Commission.</p> About EBSI4Austria <p>EBSI4Austria is a CEF funded project with two main objectives. First, EBSI4Austria aims to set up, operate and maintain the Austrian’s EBSI node. Second, we pilot the diploma use case on the Austrian level supported by two Universities and data providers as well as verifiers.</p><p>EBSI created a so-called early adopter program to speed up the use case integration of the participating countries. EBSI4Austria joined this ambiguous program already in the first wave reflecting our project’s motivation.</p> Partners <p>EBSI4Austria consists of three partners, namely two Universities such as <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/">Graz University of Technology (TU Graz)</a> and the <a href="https://www.wu.ac.at/">Vienna University of Economics (WU Vienna)</a>, together with <a href="https://danubetech.com/">Danube Tech</a>, a Vienna based company that provides leading expertise in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) as well as distributed systems and is involved in related standardization bodies. The Universities are responsible for issuing students’ diplomas and also verifying them. Austrian’s EBSI node is set up and operated at the department eGovernment innovation center (EGIZ), which is part of Graz University of technology.</p> User Story <p>Figure 1 illustrates the user story that is covered in our project. A student studying at the Graz University of Technology is finishing her bachelor’s program. TU Graz issues her diploma credential stating her bachelor’s degree, which the student stores in her wallet. Next, she wants to apply for a master’s program at the Vienna University of Economics and Business; thus, she presents her bachelor’s diploma credential. After successfully finishing her master’s program at WU Vienna, the university issues her master’s diploma credential to the student. The student is very ambitious; therefore, she applies for a Ph.D. position at the Berlin Institute of Technology by presenting her diplomas. All involved parties utilize the EBSI blockchain network to verify if the issuing universities are trusted&nbsp;issuers.</p>Figure 1: User Story of the Diploma Use&nbsp;Case Technology <p>In order to implement our EBSI4Austria project, we used similar technologies as many other Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) initiatives, i.e., based on building blocks such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p><p>We created two DIDs on the EBSI blockchain for the two universities, as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Test DID for TU Graz: <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:ebsi:zuoS6VfnmNLduF2dynhsjBU">did:ebsi:zuoS6VfnmNLduF2dynhsjBU</a>  Test DID for WU Vienna: <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:ebsi:z23EQVGi5so9sBwytv6nMXMo">did:ebsi:z23EQVGi5so9sBwytv6nMXMo</a>  <p>In addition, we registered them in EBSI’s Trusted Issuer Registry&nbsp;(TIR).</p><p>We also designed Verifiable Credentials to model digital versions of university diplomas. We implemented them using different credential and proof formats to accommodate changing requirements and guidelines in the EBSI specifications throughout the year. See here for some examples in different formats:</p><p>Example Diploma by TU&nbsp;Graz:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jsonld">JSON-LD+LD-Proofs</a>  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jsonldjwt">JSON-LD+JWT</a> (also see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jsonldjwt.payload">JWT payload&nbsp;only</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jwt">JSON+JWT</a> (also see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-tu-graz.jwt.payload">JWT payload&nbsp;only</a>)  <p>Example Diploma by WU&nbsp;Wien:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/master_beispiel_de.png">Paper version</a> (in&nbsp;German)  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/master_beispiel_en.png">Paper version</a> (in&nbsp;English)  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jsonld">JSON-LD+LD-Proofs</a>  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jsonldjwt">JSON-LD+JWT</a> (also see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jsonldjwt.payload">JWT payload&nbsp;only</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jwt">JSON+JWT</a> (also see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/verifiablecredentials/diploma-wu-wien.jwt.payload">JWT payload&nbsp;only</a>)  <p>We also designed our own (experimental) JSON-LD context in order to be able to work with Linked Data Proofs (see <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples/blob/main/context/essif-schemas-vc-2020-v1.jsonld">essif-schemas-vc-2020-v1.jsonld</a>). In our opinion, it would be preferable if JSON-LD contexts were provided by EBSI to all member states instead of having to do this separately for each EBSI pilot&nbsp;project.</p><p>We use the following technologies in our&nbsp;project:</p>  <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">Universal Resolver</a> → For resolving DIDs.  <a href="https://uniregistrar.io/">Universal Registrar</a> → For creating&nbsp;DIDs.  <a href="https://uniissuer.io/">Universal Issuer</a> → For issuing&nbsp;VCs.  <a href="https://univerifier.io/">Universal Verifier</a> → For verifying VCs.  <a href="https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/infrastructure_2/danubetech/SSI_Java_Libraries_project_summary">SSI Java Libraries</a>  <a href="https://github.com/weboftrustinfo/ld-signatures-java">ld-signatures-java</a> — For Linked Data Signatures.  <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/verifiable-credentials-java">verifiable-credentials-java</a> — For Verifiable Credentials.  <p>We set up the following demonstration websites:</p>  <a href="https://tugraz.ebsi4austria.danubetech.com/">https://tugraz.ebsi4austria.danubetech.com/</a> — Issuer demo&nbsp;website  <a href="https://wuwien.ebsi4austria.danubetech.com/">https://wuwien.ebsi4austria.danubetech.com/</a> — Verifier demo&nbsp;website  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/danubetech/ebsi4austria-examples">this Github repository</a> for additional technical details about EBSI4Austria.</p> Multi-University Pilot <p>Within EBSI’s early adopter program, EBSI4Austria also joined the multi-university pilot (MU pilot) in which the focus is on issuing and verifying student diplomas between universities but in this case, even in a cross-border scenario. This multi-university pilot should underpin the possibilities even across countries.</p><p>While working on the MU pilot, we participated in several EBSI Early Adopter program meetings to identify issuers, verifiers, and types of credentials. We were in contact with members of Spanish EBSI pilot projects (especially from the SSI company Gataca), to compare our approaches to EBSI DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. We had several technical discussions and email exchanges regarding details of those credentials, e.g. about the JSON-LD contexts and exact proof formats we were planning to use. During these exchanges, we were able to exchange initial examples of verifiable credentials and verify&nbsp;them.</p><p>Within one of the “clusters” of the EBSI MU pilot, we also collaborated closely with the “UniCert” project led by the Technical University of Berlin, a member of the EBSI early adopter program and the German IDunion consortium. This collaboration proved to be particularly interesting for the following reasons:</p><p>1. Since TU Berlin participates both in EBSI and IDunion, they have unique insights into the similarities and differences between these different SSI networks.</p><p>2. TU Berlin was also able to share some experiences regarding the use of existing standards such as Europass and ELMO/EMREX, which can help with semantic interoperability of Verifiable Credentials use in&nbsp;EBSI.</p>Figure 2: Multi-university pilot scenario.<p>See <a href="https://github.com/pherbke/ebsi4germany">this Github repository</a> for more details about the UniCert project (also known as “EBSI4Germany “), led by TU&nbsp;Berlin.</p><p>Note: This blog post was co-authored by Andreas Abraham (<a href="https://www.egiz.gv.at/">eGovernment Innovation Center</a>) and Markus Sabadello (<a href="https://danubetech.com/">Danube&nbsp;Tech</a>).</p>

  <p>Summary:      Metasystems promote network effects because they provide leverage: one infrastructure that not only serves many purposes, but also engenders consistent behavior.</p>


<p>
    I recently saw the following tweet (since deleted):
</p>

	<a></a>
  

 
<p>
    Soooo many questions:
</p>
 
     Would a vaccination status NFT be transferable (a core feature of most NFTs)? 
     What's the underlying platform's security? 
     How's the smart contract written? 
     Who has control? 
     How do identifiers work in this system? 
     What are the privacy implications? 
     How much PII is on the blockchain? 
 

<p>
    Answering these questions would require significant work. And that work might have to be redone for each NFT used for SSI, depending on how <a href="https://origintrail.io/">Origin Trail</a> is architected. If they are based on <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC-721</a>, that tells us some things we may need to know, but doesn't answer most of the questions I pose above. If Origin Trail runs its own blockchain, then there are even more questions. 
</p>

<p>
    One of the big value propositions of an identity metasystem is that many of these questions can be answered once for the metasystem rather than answering them for each identity system built on top of it. In particular, the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml">metasystem guarantees the fidelity of the credential exchange</a>. Credential fidelity comprises four important attributes. Credential exchange on the identity metasystem:
</p>
 
     Reveals the identifier of the issuer 
     Ensures the credential was issued to the party presenting it 
     Ensures the credential has not been tampered with 
     Reveals whether or not the credential has been revoked 
 

<p>
    I don't know anything about Origin Trail. It's possible that they have worked all this out. The point is simply that the tweet caused me to think about the advantages of a metasystem. 
</p>

<p>
    Metasystems give us leverage because their known behavior makes reasoning about systems built on top of them easier. Knowing how TCP works lets us know important properties of the protocols that operate on top of it. Similarly, in the identity metasystem, knowing how DIDs, DID Registries, DIDComm, and verifiable credential exchange protocols function means that we can more easily understand the behavior of a system built on top of it, like the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_health_passes_and_the_design_of_an_ecosystem_of_ecosystems.shtml">health pass ecosystem</a>. This leverage is an important component of the network effects that a well designed metasystem can provide.

And because so many people are excited about it, the hype itself may generate the platform. It’s like if a collective delusion was capable of birthing a tangible thing.</p><p>A ton of marketing dollars have been poured into generating this hype, but it’s in some ways arbitrary. Virtual reality has been around for a very long time and has never really taken hold in the markets; seeding this excitement allows those investments to finally come to fruition.</p><p>Imagine, though, if the same hype machine was directed elsewhere. What if we were excited to build a Star Trek future instead of a Ready Player One future? A post-money society where information and resources are ubiquitous and communities collaborate to push the boundaries of human experience and boldly go where no-one has gone before?</p><p>Or what about a cyberpunk future, where every piece of hardware is repairable and endlessly remixable into new devices?</p><p>You can’t sell headsets or NFTs that way, of course, so there’s little incentive for anyone to market this alternative future in the same way the metaverse has been. But we do need competing visions of the future that challenge hyper-commercial interests. The narratives we tell about the future really matter. The metaverse is a top-down, highly-financed commercial vision, which has partially gained popularity because its ill-defined nature allows everyone to pin their own imagination on it. We would all benefit from an alternative, bottom-up, collaborative vision that trades commerce for community.</p>

 Thoughts   My high school yearbook said that I was likely to become a journalist. Aside from a brief foray into film reviewing (one of the best gigs I’ve ever had), that didn’t happen. Instead, I was sucked into software development as a way to tell stories. 
 There’s a huge gulf between writing code as a self-directed creative endeavor and writing it as an act of engineering as part of a business. I learned the former, and then I had to learn the latter all over again as a distinct discipline. 
 But, as it turns out, they’re not distinct. The act of writing software for fun can lead you down paths you never would have explored as a professional endeavor. Visualizations, hardware hacking, game-writing, toys and gizmos with no ROI and no reason for being at all except for fun give you skills and insights that could, if you wanted, also be used for work. 
 Code is poetry, <a href="https://medium.com/@launchyard/code-is-poetry-3d13d50a36b3">as someone smart once said</a>. 
 Play and work <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/why-play-matters-1be75e4ab77b">have an integral relationship</a>. But play requires space that we don’t often think to provide: physical, temporal, and mental. You have to start with the intention to include play. At work, you need to make it an inseparable part of your culture. Particularly in highly competitive environments, that’s not something that people tend to think to do. 
 Highly competitive environments are counter-productive overall. 
 I’m in awe of people who have retained that sense of naïve fun: of building something for the art of it, whether to explore, tell a story, or reveal something about ourselves. Keeping hold of that sense of play is a hard thing to do when the world around you is urging you to be productive, to make money, to financially succeed. Those goals are ultimately empty, and yet. 
 I want to spend more time playing; making things for the art of it; exploring what might be possible. Art is one of the best aspects of human civilization, and making it is freeing. It’s innately human. And that’s something I wish more of us could spend more time being. 
  Actions   It’s a big deadline week. There’s a lot to keep on top of, and I’m doing my best to be helpful. The best way I can do that is by providing the right environment, and making sure everyone has the resources they need. 
 I also woke up this morning with a giant cold, so I need to also take care of myself. Lots of tea. 
 I owe so many people so many emails. 
 And I need to finish my Christmas shopping. But that should be fine, right? Christmas is a month or two away? Right? Right? 
 In the spirit of play, I want to restart work on <a href="https://untitled.werd.io">Untitled</a>, my fiction work in progress. I had to stop while driving across country - it was just too much - but I really want to finish the story.

<p>What are ZKP BBS+ verifiable credentials </p>



<p>BBS+ verifiable credentials are built using JSON-LD and makes it possible to support selective disclosure of subject claims from a verifiable credential, compound proofs of different VCs, zero knowledge proofs where the subject claims do not need to be exposed to verify something, private holder binding and prevent tracking. The <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">specification</a> and implementation are still a work in progress.</p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The solution is setup to issue and verify the BBS+ verifiable credentials. The credential issuers are implemented in ASP.NET Core as well as the verifiable credential verifier. One credential issuer implements a BBS+ JSON-LD E-ID verifiable credential using SIOP together with Auth0 as the identity provider and the MATTR API which implements the access to the ledger and implements the logic for creating and verifying the verifiable credential and implementing the SSI specifications. The second credential issuer implements a county of residence BBS+ verifiable credential issuer like the first one. The ASP.NET Core verifier project uses a BBS+ verify presentation to verify that a user has the correct E-ID credentials and the county residence verifiable credentials in one request. This is presented as a compound proof using credential subject data from both verifiable credentials. The credentials are presented from the MATTR wallet to the ASP.NET Core verifier application.</p>







<p>The BBS+ compound proof is made up from the two verifiable credentials stored on the wallet. The holder of the wallet owns the credentials and can be trusted to a fairly high level because SIOP was used to add the credentials to the MATTR wallet which requires a user authentication on the wallet using OpenID Connect. If the host system has strong authentication, the user of the wallet is probably the same person for which the credentials where intended for and issued too. We only can prove that the verifiable credentials are valid, we cannot prove that the person sending the credentials is also the subject of the credentials or has the authorization to act on behalf of the credential subject. With SIOP, we know that the credentials were issued in a way which allows for strong authentication.</p>







<p>Implementing the Credential Issuers</p>



<p>The credentials are created using a credential issuer and can be added to the users wallet using SIOP. An ASP.NET Core application is used to implement the MATTR API client for creating and issuing the credentials. Auth0 is used for the OIDC server and the profiles used in the verifiable credentials are added here. The Auth0 server is part of the credential issuer service business. The application has two separate flows for administrators and users, or holders of the credentials and credential issuer administrators.</p>



<p>An administrator can signin to the credential issuer ASP.NET Core application using OIDC and can create new OIDC credential issuers using BBS+. Once created, the callback URL for the credential issuer needs to be added to the Auth0 client application as a redirect URL. </p>



<p>A user can login to the ASP.NET Core application and request the verifiable credentials only for themselves. This is not authenticated on the ASP.NET Core application, but on the wallet application using the SIOP flow. The application presents a QR Code which starts the flow. Once authenticated, the credentials are added to the digital wallet. Both the E-ID and the county of residence credentials are added and stored on the wallet. </p>



 Auth0 Auth pipeline rules 



<p>The credential subject claims added to the verifiable credential uses the profile data from the Auth0 identity provider. This data can be added using an Auth0 auth pipeline rule. Once defined, if the user has the profile data, the verifiable credentials can be created from the data.</p>


  function (user, context, callback) {
    const namespace = 'https://damianbod-sandbox.vii.mattr.global/';
    context.idToken[namespace + 'name'] = user.user_metadata.name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'first_name'] = user.user_metadata.first_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'date_of_birth'] = user.user_metadata.date_of_birth;
  
    context.idToken[namespace + 'family_name'] = user.user_metadata.family_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'given_name'] = user.user_metadata.given_name;

    context.idToken[namespace + 'birth_place'] = user.user_metadata.birth_place;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'gender'] = user.user_metadata.gender;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'height'] = user.user_metadata.height;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'nationality'] = user.user_metadata.nationality;
  
    context.idToken[namespace + 'address_country'] = user.user_metadata.address_country;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'address_locality'] = user.user_metadata.address_locality;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'address_region'] = user.user_metadata.address_region;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'street_address'] = user.user_metadata.street_address;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'postal_code'] = user.user_metadata.postal_code;
  
    callback(null, user, context);
}
  


<p>Once issued, the verifiable credential is saved to the digital wallet like this:</p>

<p>For more information on adding BBS+ verifiable credentials using MATTR, see the documentation, or a previous blog in this series. </p>



<p>Verifying the compound proof BBS+ verifiable credential</p>



<p>The verifier application needs to use both E-ID and county of residence verifiable credentials. This is done using a presentation template which is specific to the MATTR platform. Once created, a verify request is created using this template and presented to the user in the UI as a QR code. The holder of the wallet can scan this code and the verification begins. The wallet will use the verification request and try to find the credentials on the wallet which matches what was requested. If the wallet has the data from the correct issuers, the holder of the wallet consents, the data is sent to the verifier application using a new presentation verifiable credential using the credential subject data from both of the existing verifiable credentials stored on the wallet. The webhook or an API on the verifier application handles this and validates the request. If all is good, the data is persisted and the UI is updated using SignalR messaging.</p>



<p>Creating a verifier presentation template</p>



<p>Before verifier presentations can be sent a the digital wallet, a template needs to be created in the MATTR platform. The CreatePresentationTemplate Razor page is used to create a new template. The template requires the two DIDs used for issuing the credentials from the credential issuer applications.</p>


  public class CreatePresentationTemplateModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly MattrPresentationTemplateService _mattrVerifyService;
	public bool CreatingPresentationTemplate { get; set; } = true;
	public string TemplateId { get; set; }

	[BindProperty]
	public PresentationTemplate PresentationTemplate { get; set; }
	public CreatePresentationTemplateModel(MattrPresentationTemplateService mattrVerifyService)
	{
		_mattrVerifyService = mattrVerifyService;
	}
	public void OnGet()
	{
		PresentationTemplate = new PresentationTemplate();
	}

	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
	{
		if (!ModelState.IsValid)
		{
			return Page();
		}

		TemplateId = await _mattrVerifyService.CreatePresentationTemplateId(
			PresentationTemplate.DidEid, PresentationTemplate.DidCountyResidence);

		CreatingPresentationTemplate = false;
		return Page();
	}
}

public class PresentationTemplate
{
	[Required]
	public string DidEid { get; set; }

	[Required]
	public string DidCountyResidence { get; set; }
	
}
  


<p>The MattrPresentationTemplateService class implements the logic required to create a new presentation template. The service gets a new access token for your MATTR tenant and creates a new template using the credential subjects required and the correct contexts. BBS+ and frames require specific contexts. The CredentialQuery2 has two separate Frame items, one for each verifiable credential created and stored on the digital wallet.</p>

<p>The presentation template is ready and can be used now. This is just a specific definition used by the MATTR platform. This is not saved to the ledger.</p>



<p>Creating a verifier request and present QR Code</p>



<p>Now that we have a presentation template, we initialize a verifier presentation request and present this as a QR Code for the holder of the digital wallet to scan. The CreateVerifyCallback method creates the verification and returns a signed token which is added to the QR Code to scan and the challengeId is encoded in base64 as we use this in the URL to request or handle the webhook callback.</p>


  public class CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly MattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService _mattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService;

	public bool CreatingVerifier { get; set; } = true;

		CallbackUrlDto.CallbackUrl = $"https://{HttpContext.Request.Host.Value}";
	}

	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
	{

<p>The CreateVerifyCallback method uses the host as the base URL for the callback definition which is included in the verification. An access token is requested for the MATTR API, this is used for all the requests. The last issued template is used in the verification. A new DID is created or the existing DID for this verifier is used to attach the verify presentation on the ledger. The InvokePresentationRequest is used to initialize the verification presentation. This request uses the templateId, the callback URL and the DID. Part of the body payload of the response of the request is signed and this is returned to the Razor page to be displayed as part of the QR code. This signed token is longer and so a didcomm redirect is used in the QR Code and not the value directly in the Razor page..</p>

<p>Validating the verification callback</p>



<p>After the holder of the digital wallet has given consent, the wallet sends the verifiable credential data back to the verifier application in a HTTP request. This is sent to a webhook or an API in the verifier application. This needs to be verified correctly. In this demo, only the challengeId is used to match the request, the payload is not validated which it should be. The callback handler stores the data to the database and sends a SignalR message to inform the waiting client that the verify has been completed successfully.</p>

<p>The demo UI displays the data after a successful verification. The next steps of the verifier process can be implemented using these values. This would typically included creating an account and setting up an authentication which is not subject to phishing for high security or at least which has a second factor.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>The MATTR BBS+ verifiable credentials look really good and supports selective disclosure and compound proofs. The implementation is still a WIP and MATTR are investing in this at present and will hopefully complete and improve all the BBS+ features. Until BBS+ is implemented by the majority of SSI platform providers and the specs are completed, I don’t not see how SSI can be adopted unless of course all converge on some other standard. This would help improve some of the interop problems between the vendors.</p>

</p>
<p>
You can’t do that with a longtime mate because he knows all that old material. With a long relationship, things die then are rekindled, and that shared process of rebirth deepens the love. It’s hard work, though, and a lot of people run at the first sign of trouble. You’re with this person, and suddenly you look like an asshole to them or they look like an asshole to you — it’s unpleasant, but if you can get through it you get closer and you learn a way of loving that’s different from the neurotic love enshrined in movies.

   It is suggested that all which glitters is gold when it comes to data: the more data, the better. I have challenged this thinking that more data is better on numerous occasions, and essentially they all come to the same point. Data volume does not lead to better decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>A “simplistic” graph is doing the rounds (again) and is copied below. The two-axis links the quality of a decision and the person's capability with data.&nbsp; It infers that boards, executives and senior leadership need to be “data-savvy” if they are to make better decisions. Data Savvy is a position between being “data-naive or data-devoid” and “drunk on data.”&nbsp; The former has no data or skills; the latter is too much data or cannot use the tools. Data Savvy means you are skilled with the correct data and the right tools.</p><p>This thinking is driven by those trying to sell data training by simplifying a concept to such a point its becomes meaningless but is easy to sell/ buy and looks great as a visual.&nbsp; When you don’t have enough time to reflect on the graph and the message, it looks logical, inspired and correct - it is none of these things. &nbsp; The basis of the idea is that a board or senior leadership team who are data-savvy will make better decisions, based on the framing that if you are naive or drunk on data, you will make poor decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first issue I have is that if the data does not have <a href="https://opengovernance.net/updating-board-paper-for-a-data-attestation-section-db59d736ccc5">attestation</a>, your capability (data-savviness) will make no difference to the quality of the decision. &nbsp;One could argue that you will test the data if data-savvy, but this is also untrue as most boards cannot test the data, relying on the organisations' processes and procedures to ensure “quality” data. This is a wild assumption.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><p>It is worth searching for what “data-savvy” means and reading a few articles.&nbsp; You will find that many put becoming data-savvy as a step in the journey to being data-driven.&nbsp; To a second point:&nbsp; data-driven means you will always be late.&nbsp; To wait for enough data to reduce the risk to match your risk framework means that you will be late in the decision-making process.&nbsp; Data-driven does not make you fast, agile, ahead, innovative or adaptive. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/12/hard-fast-vs-late-slow.html">Data-driven makes you late, slow, behind and a follower.</a></p><p>Is the reality of wanting to be data-savvy or a desire to be data-driven that you look to use data to reduce risk and therefore become more risk-averse, which means you miss the <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/06/the-shadowy-hierarchy.html">signals</a> that would make you genuinely innovative?</p><p>The question as a CDO (data or digital) we should reflect on is “how do we reconcile that we want to be first, innovative, creative or early; but our processes, methods, and tools depend on data that means we will always be late!” The more innovative we want to be, the less data we will have and the more risk we need to take, which does not align to the leadership, culture or rewards/ incentives that we have or operate to.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We know now that technology and business models are accelerating at a faster pace than ever before in human history. In 10 years time, who knows what kind of conversations we’re going to be having, but the one thing we know is that we’re all going to be increasingly vulnerable, as more of our services, more of our citizen identity, move online.” – Surash Patel, VP EMEA, TeleSign Corporation 2021 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1569s)">click here to listen</a>).1</p></blockquote>
 
 <p></p>
<p>I recently sat down with &nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/surashpatel/?originalSubdomain=uk">Surash Patel, VP EMEA</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telesign.com/">TeleSign</a>&nbsp;and Board Member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/about/global-board/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF)</a>&nbsp;to discuss the personal data &amp; identity (PD&amp;I) market, for a PD&amp;I market assessment report I’m working on for the MEF (the report will be out in January 2022).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1569s">Surash’s above quote</a>&nbsp;stuck out to me because I think he is right. It also reminds me of another quote, one from WPP:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2030 society will no longer tolerate a business model that relies on mass transactions of increasingly sensitive personal data: a quite different system will be in place.” – WPP2</p></blockquote>
<p>I took away three key insights, although are more, from my interview with Surash:</p>
 
 Enterprises must immediately start learning how to master [mobile] identity verification; mobile identity verification can help reduce losses to fraud and self-inflicted losses of revenue. 
 Enterprises that effectively use mobile identity verification can create value and generate trust and engagement at every stage of the customer journey. 
 There is much we—people, private organizations, and public institutions—need to know and do to equip for the now and prepare for the future. 
 
<p>The following summarizes my conversation with Surash. . To watch the complete interview with Surash Patel of TeleSign (39:11 min),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM">click here</a>.</p>
 Risk Mitigation, Value Creation, and the Customer Journey 
<p>When introducing himself and his background, Surash opened with a wonderfully self-reflective quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I completely missed a trick on my career and where it was going, in that I thought about the value exchange between the consumer and the brand. From a marketing perspective, I never really considered it from the digital identity perspective before–seeing the numbers on digital fraud right now I think that case is becoming more and more clear to me.” – Surash Patel, VP EMEA, Telesign Corporation 2021&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=50s">click here</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p>By reading between the lines of his statement, I gather that, as a marketer, he previously saw identity as a tool for audience targeting and promotion. But, once he went into the infrastructure side of the business, he realized identity plays an even bigger role throughout the industry. This is because identity has a critical role at every touchpoint along the customer journey–not just for marketing, but for fraud prevention, revenue protection, and trust.</p>
 Risk Mitigation and managing losses 
<p>Drawing from industry reports, Surash notes that&nbsp;t&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javelinstrategy.com/content/2021-identity-fraud-report-shifting-angles-identity-fraud">businesses are losing upwards of $56 billion a year to fraud each year</a>.4&nbsp;Because of this, “knowing your customer,” i.e., knowing that there is a legitimate human on the other side of a digital transaction, is not just a nice to have, but a business imperative. Surash points out that it’s not just fraud that brands must contend with when it comes to losses. They must also contend with self-inflicted wounds.</p>
<p>Surash referenced a report from&nbsp;<a href="http://file///Users/michaelbecker/Dropbox/MEF%20PD&amp;I%20Mkt%20Assessment%20Materials/Becker%20Articles/Under_Review/%5Bhttps://www.checkout.com/connected-payments/black-boxes-and-paradoxes%5D(https://www.checkout.com/connected-payments/black-boxes-and-paradoxes)">Checkout.com</a>&nbsp;which found that, in 2019, brands in the UK, US, France, and Germany lost $20.3 billion in 2019 due to false declines at check out, i.e.&nbsp;identity verification system failures. $12.7 billion of these losses went to competitors, while $7.6 billion just evaporated.5&nbsp;My takeaway from this is that it’s necessary for brands to see identity verification as a strategic imperative, not just an IT function.</p>
<p>But, reducing fraud and managing revenue breakage is not all Surash brought up. He also noted that, based on findings in the Checkout.com report, consumers would pay an average of $4 to be sure their transactions are secure. So, not only can brands reduce fraud, but they can also retain sales by more effectively identifying their customers (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=693s">listen to his comments here</a>).</p>
 The Potential For Harm is Real and Must Be Managed 
<p>Let’s briefly return to Surash’s quote above:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We know now that technology and, you know, business models are accelerating at a faster pace than ever before in human history. In 10 years time, who knows what kind of conversations we’re going to be having, but the one thing we know is that we’re all going to be increasingly vulnerable as more of our services, more of a citizen identity, move online.” – Surash Patel, VP EMEA, Telesign Corporation 2021 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1569s">click here to listen</a>).6</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with him–the people, not just businesses, are at risk of being even more vulnerable than they are now, but that does not mean the risks we face today are trivial. Harm from the misuse of personal data is all around us. We primarily measure this in financial terms. For example, in 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2021/texts-smartphone.html">U.S. consumers reported losses of $86M to fraud originating from text messaging scams</a>&nbsp;.7</p>
 On harm 
<p>There is&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/459427-privacy-law-needs-privacy-harm">more privacy harm out there than financial loss</a>, noted by Ignacio N. Cofone,8 and it is not a trivial discussion to be slipped under the rug. In fact, it is one of the fundamental drivers behind emerging people-centric regulations, industry best practices, and the reshaping of law.</p>
<p>This topic is too big to cover in this article, but I can provide a good resource for you on privacy harm. One of my go-to resources when considering this issue is&nbsp;<a href="https://teachprivacy.com/">Daniel Solove</a>, who recently, along with Danielle Keates Citron, updated the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3782222">Typology of Privacy Harms</a>. This is a must-read if you are a student on the topic of being of service to the connected individual.</p>
 The Customer Journey and Balance of Power Shift 
<p>To address these privacy harms, Surash specifically calls for the government to get involved. However, Surash thinks brands and individuals alike can do more as well. Surash makes it clear that individuals need to be more aware and accountable for their own actions and interactions. He also thinks, however, that brands need to learn to engage people in an even value exchange (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=774s">hear Surash’s comment</a>). Furthermore, he recognizes that people are taking more control of their data, and as this continues, we may eventually see the evolution of consumer “curation services &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5WlrHSohpM&amp;t=1527s">hear his remark</a>),” what may call “infomediaries.” Again, I’m drawn to the WPP quote above. Brands need to prepare for fundamental shifts in people’s attitudes and expectations. The implications of these shifts will be profound, as they will force a change in competition, business models, product offerings, and business practices.</p>
 There is Much We All Need to Know and Do 
<p>So, after taking all this in, what’s next?</p>
<p>What I learned from my time with Surash is that an effective identity management implementation can collectively save brands billions, while building trust and improving their ability to serve their customer throughout the customer’s journey.</p>
<p>Surash emphasized that the people must know that they are at risk and be aware of all that is going on in the industry. As a result of this knowledge, they can take steps to advocate for and protect themselves. He notes that individuals “absolutely need to know the value of their data” and “how they can challenge” the brands’ use of their data. Surash suggested that individuals need to start shifting the balance of power by approaching brands and questioning, “Do you really need that data to serve me? If not, don’t ask me for it.” Surash does recognize, however, that this is going to be hard for individuals to go up against the “large” brand. As noted below, we believe in both the companies’ and the government’s abilities to do more.</p>
<p>For brands, Surash wants them to:</p>
 
 Take cyberattacks seriously and prepare as the attacks are expected to get worse. 
 Get the fraud and marketing teams working together and not at loggerheads 
 Not just onboard individuals after the first transaction, but to continually evaluate and authenticate their customers as their customers move along the journey. He suggests that brands must learn to evaluate the local context of each engagement, regularly verify and authenticate their customers, and show the people they serve some respect by making an effort to validate if individuals’ circumstances (preferences, address, phone number, etc.) have changed over time. Surash implies that these actions will both reduce the risk of fraud and cybercrime, but also improve the relationship they have with those they serve. 
 Ensure there is always an even value exchange, and if the brand wants more in return during a transaction, e.g.&nbsp;more data to support a future upsell, then they should consider paying the individual for it. 
 
<p>As for public institutions, .e.g. governments, Surash suggests that “there isn’t enough being done to protect the consumers.” Governments should work with industry to refine value propositions, institute consistent standards, and advocate for consumers.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is all just the tip of the iceberg. There is definitely more to come.</p>

 cibuildwheel, maintained by the Python Packaging Authority, builds and tests Python wheels across multiple platforms. I hadn't realized quite how minimal a configuration using their GitHub Actions action was until I looked at how Pyjion was using it.

  <p>I've stopped considering my projects "shipped" until I've written a proper blog entry about them, so yesterday I finally <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Dec/7/git-history/">shipped git-history</a>, coinciding with the release of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/releases/tag/0.6">version 0.6</a> - a full 27 days after the first <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/releases/tag/0.1">0.1</a>.</p>
<p>It took way more work than I was expecting to get to this point!</p>
<p>I wrote the first version of <code>git-history</code> in an afternoon, as a tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/15/weeknotes-git-history/">for a workshop I was presenting</a> on Git scraping and Datasette.</p>
<p>Before promoting it more widely, I wanted to make some improvements to the schema. In particular, I wanted to record only the updated values in the <code>item_version</code> table - which otherwise could end up duplicating a full copy of each item in the database hundreds or even thousands of times.</p>
<p>Getting this right took a lot of work, and I kept on getting stumped by weird bugs and edge-cases. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/issues/33">This bug</a> in particular added a couple of days to the project.</p>
<p>The whole project turned out to be something of a bug magnet, partly because of a design decision I made concerning column names.</p>
<p><code>git-history</code> creates tables with columns that correspond to the underlying data. Since it also needs its own columns for tracking things like commits and incremental versions, I decided to use underscore prefixes for reserved columns such as <code>_item</code> and <code>_version</code></p>
<p>Datasette uses underscore prefixes for its own purposes - special table arguments such as <code>?_facet=column-name</code>. It's supposed to work with existing columns that use underscores by converting query string arguments like <code>?_item=3</code> into <code>?_item__exact=3</code> - but <code>git-history</code> was the first of my projects to really exercise this, and I kept on finding bugs. Datasette <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-59-2">0.59.2</a> and <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-59-4">0.59.4</a> both have related bug fixes, and there's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1527">a re-opened bug</a> that I have yet to resolve.</p>
<p>Building the <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident">ca-fires demo</a> also revealed a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map/issues/38">bug in datasette-cluster-map</a> which I fixed in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map/releases/tag/0.17.2">version 0.17.2</a>.</p>
 s3-credentials --public 
<p>The <code>git-history</code> live demos are built and deployed by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-demos.yml">this GitHub Actions workflow</a>. The workflow works by checking out three separate repos and running <code>git-history</code> against them. It takes advantage of that tool's ability to add just new commits to an existing database to run faster, so it needs to persist database files in between runs.</p>
<p>Since these files can be several hundred MBs, I decided to persist them in an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/3/s3-credentials/">s3-credentials tool</a> provides the ability to create a new S3 bucket along with restricted read-write credentials just for that bucket, ideal for use in a GitHub Actions workflow.</p>
<p>I decided to make the bucket public such that anyone can download files from it, since there was no reason to keep it private. I've been wanting to add this ability to <code>s3-credentials</code> for a while now, so this was the impetus I needed to finally ship that feature.</p>
<p>It's surprisingly hard to figure out how to make an S3 bucket public these days! It turned out the magic recipe was adding a JSON bucket policy document to the bucket granting <code>s3:GetObject</code> permission to principal <code>*</code> - here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/blob/0.8/README.md#public-bucket-policy">that policy in full</a>.</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/releases/tag/0.8">s3-credentials 0.8</a> with a new <code>--public</code> option for creating public buckets - here are the release notes in full:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>s3-credentials create my-bucket --public</code> option for creating public buckets, which allow anyone with knowledge of a filename to download that file. This works by attaching <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/blob/0.8/README.md#public-bucket-policy">this public bucket policy</a> to the bucket after it is created. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/42">#42</a>
 
 
<code>s3-credentials put-object</code> now sets the <code>Content-Type</code> header on the uploaded object. The type is detected based on the filename, or can be specified using the new <code>--content-type</code> option. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/43">#43</a>
 
 
<code>s3-credentials policy my-bucket --public-bucket</code> outputs the public bucket policy that would be attached to a bucket of that name. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/44">#44</a>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote up this TIL which doubles as a mini-tutorial on using <code>s3-credentials</code>: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/s3-bucket-github-actions">Storing files in an S3 bucket between GitHub Actions runs</a>.</p>
 datasette-hovercards 
<p>This was a quick experiment which turned into a prototype Datasette plugin. I really like how GitHub show hover card previews of links to issues in their interface:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided to see if I could build something similar for links within Datasette, specifically the links that show up when a column is a foreign key to another record.</p>
<p>Here's what I've got so far:</p>
<p></p>
<p>There's an interactive demo running on <a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/github/issues">this table page</a>.</p>
<p>It still needs a bunch of work - in particular I need to think harder about when the card is shown, where it displays relative to the mouse pointer, what causes it to be hidden again and how it should handle different page widths. Ideally I'd like to figure out a useful mobile / touch-screen variant, but I'm not sure how that could work.</p>
<p>The prototype plugin is called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-hovercards">datasette-hovercards</a> - I'd like to eventually merge this back into Datasette core once I'm happy with how it works.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Kim Cameron's Laws of Identity are a foundational work in online identity. He used his technical knowledge and position to advance the state of online identity in countless ways over multiple decades. We will miss him.</p>




<p>
    I got word early last week that Kim Cameron, a giant of the identity world, had passed away. I was shocked. I still am. Kim was one of those people who played such a big role in my life over so many years, that it's hard to imagine he's not there any more. The week before we'd been scheduled to talk and he'd canceled cause he wasn't feeling well. He wanted to talk about verifiable credential exchange over OpenID Connect SIOP. He was still in the trenches...working on identity. I'm sad we'll never get that last talk. 
</p>

<p>
    I had met Kim and talked to him at several identity conferences back in the early 2000's. But my relationship with him grew into friendship through Internet Identity Workshop (IIW). We held the first IIW in October 2005. Along with many others, Kim was there to talk about his ideas and plans for identity. He'd already published his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a> and was working on a project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    At that first IIW, we went to dinner at the end of day one. The idea was that everyone would pay for their own meal since the workshop hadn't collected any money in the registration for that. Kim, with his typical generosity, told everyone that Microsoft would buy dinner...and drinks. Later he confided to me that he wasn't sure Microsoft would really pick up the tab—which turned out to be surprisingly large because of the alcohol—but he'd make sure it was covered either way. That started a tradition. Microsoft has sponsored the workshop dinner at every in-person IIW we've held. Not only with dinner, but in countless other ways, Kim's participation and support was instrumental in building IIW over the years. 
</p>



<p>
    Over the last several years I've remarked several times that Kim must be a being from the future. With his laws, Kim was telling us things about identity in 2004 that we weren't ready to hear until just the last few years. Kim not only saw the need for a set of laws to govern online identity system architecture, but also foresaw the need for an identity metasystem on the internet. Whether you view the laws as leading to the metasystem design or springing from it, they are both necessary to a future where people can live rich, authentic online lives. The laws are Kim's legacy in the identity world.  
</p>

<p>
Kim's technical excellence got him a seat at the table. His position at Microsoft gave him a big voice. But what made Kim effective was his gentle approach to technical discussions, especially those he thought might be contentious. He listened, asked questions, and guided discussion. As a result of his leadership we made progress in many ways that might not have otherwise happened. The identity world will sorely miss his leadership. I will miss his company, learning from him, and, most of all, his friendship.
</p>

   I described Git scraping last year: a technique for writing scrapers where you periodically snapshot a source of data to a Git repository in order to record changes to that source over time. 
 The open challenge was how to analyze that data once it was collected. git-history is my new tool designed to tackle that problem.

  <p>I described <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping</a> last year: a technique for writing scrapers where you periodically snapshot a source of data to a Git repository in order to record changes to that source over time.</p>
<p>The open challenge was how to analyze that data once it was collected. <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">git-history</a> is my new tool designed to tackle that problem.</p>
 Git scraping, a refresher 
<p>A neat thing about scraping to a Git repository is that the scrapers themselves can be really simple. I demonstrated how to run scrapers for free using GitHub Actions in this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/5/git-scraping/">five minute lightning talk</a> back in March.</p>
<p>Here's a concrete example: California's state fire department, Cal Fire, maintain an incident map at <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/">fire.ca.gov/incidents</a> showing the status of current large fires in the state.</p>
<p>I found the underlying data here:</p>
 <code>curl https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents
</code> 
<p>Then I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/scrape.yml">a simple scraper</a> that grabs a copy of that every 20 minutes and commits it to Git. I've been running that for 14 months now, and it's collected <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history">1,559 commits</a>!</p>
<p>The thing that excites me most about Git scraping is that it can create truly unique datasets. It's common for organizations not to keep detailed archives of what changed and where, so by scraping their data into a Git repository you can often end up with a more detailed history than they maintain themselves.</p>
<p>There's one big challenge though; having collected that data, how can you best analyze it? Reading through thousands of commit differences and eyeballing changes to JSON or CSV files isn't a great way of finding the interesting stories that have been captured.</p>
 git-history 
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">git-history</a> is the new CLI tool I've built to answer that question. It reads through the entire history of a file and generates a SQLite database reflecting changes to that file over time. You can then use <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> to explore the resulting data.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires">an example database</a> created by running the tool against my <code>ca-fires-history</code> repository. I created the SQLite database by running this in the repository directory:</p>
  git-history file ca-fires.db incidents.json \
  --namespace incident \
  --id UniqueId \
  --convert 'json.loads(content)["Incidents"]'  
<p></p>
<p>In this example we are processing the history of a single file called <code>incidents.json</code>.</p>
<p>We use the <code>UniqueId</code> column to identify which records are changed over time as opposed to newly created.</p>
<p>Specifying <code>--namespace incident</code> causes the created database tables to be called <code>incident</code> and <code>incident_version</code> rather than the default of <code>item</code> and <code>item_version</code>.</p>
<p>And we have a fragment of Python code that knows how to turn each version stored in that commit history into a list of objects compatible with the tool, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/blob/0.6/README.md#custom-conversions-using---convert">--convert in the documentation</a> for details.</p>
<p>Let's use the database to answer some questions about fires in California over the past 14 months.</p>
<p>The <code>incident</code> table contains a copy of the latest record for every incident. We can use that to see <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident">a map of every fire</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This uses the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> plugin, which draws a map of every row with a valid latitude and longitude column.</p>
<p>Where things get interesting is the <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version">incident_version</a> table. This is where changes between different scraped versions of each item are recorded.</p>
<p>Those 250 fires have 2,060 recorded versions. If we <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item">facet by _item</a> we can see which fires had the most versions recorded. Here are the top ten:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=174">Dixie Fire</a> 268

<p>This looks about right - the larger the number of versions the longer the fire must have been burning. The Dixie Fire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Fire">has its own Wikipedia page</a>!</p>
<p>Clicking through to <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=174">the Dixie Fire</a> lands us on a page showing every "version" that we captured, ordered by version number.</p>
<p><code>git-history</code> only writes values to this table that have changed since the previous version. This means you can glance at the table grid and get a feel for which pieces of information were updated over time:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <code>ConditionStatement</code> is a text description that changes frequently, but the other two interesting columns look to be <code>AcresBurned</code> and <code>PercentContained</code>.</p>
<p>That <code>_commit</code> table is a foreign key to <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/commits">commits</a>, which records commits that have been processed by the tool -  mainly so that when you run it a second time it can pick up where it finished last time.</p>
<p>We can join against <code>commits</code> to see the date that each version was created. Or we can use the <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version_detail">incident_version_detail</a> view which performs that join for us.</p>
<p>Using that view, we can filter for just rows where <code>_item</code> is 174 and <code>AcresBurned</code> is not blank, then use the <a>datasette-vega</a> plugin to visualize the <code>_commit_at</code> date column against the <code>AcresBurned</code> numeric column... and we get a graph of <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version_detail?_item__exact=174&amp;AcresBurned__notblank=1#g.mark=line&amp;g.x_column=_commit_at&amp;g.x_type=temporal&amp;g.y_column=AcresBurned&amp;g.y_type=quantitative">the growth of the Dixie Fire over time</a>!</p>
<p></p>
<p>To review: we started out with a GitHub Actions scheduled workflow grabbing a copy of a JSON API endpoint every 20 minutes. Thanks to <code>git-history</code>, Datasette and <code>datasette-vega</code> we now have a chart showing the growth of the longest-lived California wildfire of the last 14 months over time.</p>
 A note on schema design 
<p>One of the hardest problems in designing <code>git-history</code> was deciding on an appropriate schema for storing version changes over time.</p>
<p>I ended up with the following (edited for clarity):</p>
  CREATE TABLE [commits] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [hash] TEXT,
   [commit_at] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [item] (
   [_id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [_item_id] TEXT,
   [IncidentID] TEXT,
   [Location] TEXT,
   [Type] TEXT,
   [_commit] INTEGER
);
CREATE TABLE [item_version] (
   [_id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [_item] INTEGER REFERENCES [item]([_id]),
   [_version] INTEGER,
   [_commit] INTEGER REFERENCES [commits]([id]),
   [IncidentID] TEXT,
   [Location] TEXT,
   [Type] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [columns] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [namespace] INTEGER REFERENCES [namespaces]([id]),
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [item_changed] (
   [item_version] INTEGER REFERENCES [item_version]([_id]),
   [column] INTEGER REFERENCES [columns]([id]),
   PRIMARY KEY ([item_version], [column])
);  
<p>As shown earlier, records in the <code>item_version</code> table represent snapshots over time - but to save on database space and provide a neater interface for browsing versions, they only record columns that had changed since their previous version. Any unchanged columns are stored as <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>There's one catch with this schema: what do we do if a new version of an item sets one of the columns to <code>null</code>? How can we tell the difference between that and a column that didn't change?</p>
<p>I ended up solving that with an <code>item_changed</code> many-to-many table, which uses pairs of integers (hopefully taking up as little space as possible) to record exactly which columns were modified in which <code>item_version</code> records.</p>
<p>The <code>item_version_detail</code> view displays columns from that many-to-many table as JSON - here's <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version_detail?_version__gt=1&amp;_col=_changed_columns&amp;_col=_item&amp;_col=_version">a filtered example</a> showing which columns were changed in which versions of which items:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires?sql=select+columns.name%2C+count%28*%29%0D%0Afrom+incident_changed%0D%0A++join+incident_version+on+incident_changed.item_version+%3D+incident_version._id%0D%0A++join+columns+on+incident_changed.column+%3D+columns.id%0D%0Awhere+incident_version._version+%3E+1%0D%0Agroup+by+columns.name%0D%0Aorder+by+count%28*%29+desc">a SQL query</a> that shows, for <code>ca-fires</code>, which columns were updated most often:</p>
  select columns.name, count(*)
from incident_changed
  join incident_version on incident_changed.item_version = incident_version._id
  join columns on incident_changed.column = columns.id
where incident_version._version &gt; 1
group by columns.name
order by count(*) desc  
 
 Updated: 1785 
 PercentContained: 740 
 ConditionStatement: 734 
 AcresBurned: 616

 CrewsInvolved: 256 
 WaterTenders: 225 
 Dozers: 211 
 AirTankers: 181 
 StructuresDestroyed: 125 
 Helicopters: 122 
 
<p>Helicopters are exciting! Let's find all of the fires which had at least one record where the number of helicopters changed (after the first version). We'll use a nested SQL query:</p>
  select * from incident
where _id in (
  select _item from incident_version
  where _id in (
    select item_version from incident_changed where column = 15
  )
  and _version &gt; 1
)  
<p>That returned 19 fires that were significant enough to involve helicopters - <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires?sql=select+*+from+incident%0D%0Awhere+_id+in+%28%0D%0A++select+_item+from+incident_version%0D%0A++where+_id+in+%28%0D%0A++++select+item_version+from+incident_changed+where+column+%3D+15%0D%0A++%29%0D%0A++and+_version+%3E+1%0D%0A%29">here they are on a map</a>:</p>
<p></p>
 Advanced usage of --convert 
<p>Drew Breunig has been running a Git scraper for the past 8 months in <a href="https://github.com/dbreunig/511-events-history">dbreunig/511-events-history</a> against <a href="https://511.org/">511.org</a>, a site showing traffic incidents in the San Francisco Bay Area. I loaded his data into this example <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/sf-bay-511">sf-bay-511 database</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>sf-bay-511</code> example is useful for digging more into the <code>--convert</code> option to <code>git-history</code>.</p>
<p><code>git-history</code> requires recorded data to be in a specific shape: it needs a JSON list of JSON objects, where each object has a column that can be treated as a unique ID for purposes of tracking changes to that specific record over time.</p>
<p>The ideal tracked JSON file would look something like this:</p>
  [
  {
    "IncidentID": "abc123",
    "Location": "Corner of 4th and Vermont",
    "Type": "fire"
  },
  {
    "IncidentID": "cde448",
    "Location": "555 West Example Drive",
    "Type": "medical"
  }
]  
<p>It's common for data that has been scraped to not fit this ideal shape.</p>
<p>The <code>511.org</code> JSON feed <a href="https://backend-prod.511.org/api-proxy/api/v1/traffic/events/?extended=true">can be found here</a> - it's a pretty complicated nested set of objects, and there's a bunch of data in there that's quite noisy without adding much to the overall analysis - things like a <code>updated</code> timestamp field that changes in every version even if there are no changes, or a deeply nested <code>"extension"</code> object full of duplicate data.</p>
<p>I wrote a snippet of Python to transform each of those recorded snapshots into a simpler structure, and then passed that Python code to the <code>--convert</code> option to the script:</p>
 <code>#!/bin/bash
git-history file sf-bay-511.db 511-events-history/events.json \
  --repo 511-events-history \
  --id id \
  --convert '
data = json.loads(content)
if data.get("error"):
    # {"code": 500, "error": "Error accessing remote data..."}
    return
for event in data["Events"]:
    event["id"] = event["extension"]["event-reference"]["event-identifier"]
    # Remove noisy updated timestamp
    del event["updated"]
    # Drop extension block entirely
    del event["extension"]
    # "schedule" block is noisy but not interesting
    del event["schedule"]
    # Flatten nested subtypes
    event["event_subtypes"] = event["event_subtypes"]["event_subtype"]
    if not isinstance(event["event_subtypes"], list):
        event["event_subtypes"] = [event["event_subtypes"]]
    yield event
'
</code> 
<p>The single-quoted string passed to <code>--convert</code> is compiled into a Python function and run against each Git version in turn. My code loops through the nested <code>Events</code> list, modifying each record and then outputting them as an iterable sequence using <code>yield</code>.</p>
<p>A few of the records in the history were server 500 errors, so the code block knows how to identify and skip those as well.</p>
<p>When working with <code>git-history</code> I find myself spending most of my time iterating on these conversion scripts. Passing strings of Python code to tools like this is a pretty fun pattern - I also used it <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/6/sqlite-utils-convert/">for sqlite-utils convert</a> earlier this year.</p>
 Trying this out yourself 
<p>If you want to try this out for yourself the <code>git-history</code> tool has <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/blob/main/README.md">an extensive README</a> describing the other options, and the scripts used to create these demos can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/tree/main/demos">demos folder</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/topics/git-scraping">git-scraping topic</a> on GitHub now has over 200 repos now built by dozens of different people - that's a lot of interesting scraped data sat there waiting to be explored!</p>

<p>No doubt the Covid wealth extraction plan has gone, well - according to plan!</p>

<p>That said, the extraction has been going on for a long time, with no abatement. I think history is likely to record ‘this period’ as a blip on the steady extraction that has been occurring for decades!</p>

<p>This is about credit where due, and unwanted by the credited. I speak here of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)">Kim Cameron</a>, a man whose modesty was immense because it had to be, given the size of his importance to us all.</p>
<p>See, to the degree that identity matters, and disparate systems getting along with each other matters—in both cases for the sakes of each and all—Kim’s original wisdom and guidance matters. And that mattering is only beginning to play out.</p>
<p>But Kim isn’t here to shake his head at what I just said, because (as I reported in&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/12/03/remembering-kim-cameron/">my prior post</a>) he passed last week.</p>
<p>What I want to celebrate, however, isn’t just Kim’s thoughts and works, but his example: of how an open and generous person in a giant company can use its power for good, and not play the heavy doing it. That’s what Kim did for the two decades he was the top architect of Microsoft’s approach to digital identity and meta systems (that is, systems that make disparate systems work as if just one). I first saw him practice these powers at the inaugural meeting of a group that called itself the Identity Gang.</p>
<p>That name was given to the gang by <a href="https://twitter.com/stevegillmor">Steve Gillmor</a>, who hosted <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail394.html">a Gillmor Gang podcast</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.windley.com/audio/GillmorGang-2004.12.31.mp3">here’s the audio</a>) on the topic of digital identity. That was on New Years Eve—the last day of 2004. To follow that up, seven of the nine people in that podcast, plus about as many more, gathered during a break at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson">Esther Dyson</a>‘s PC Forum conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on March 20, 2005. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157720211859061">Here is an album of photos</a>&nbsp;I shot of the Gang, sitting around an outside table. (The shot above is one of them.)</p>
<p>Kim was the most powerful participant, owing both to his position at Microsoft and for having issued, one by one,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Seven Laws of Identity</a>, over the preceding months. Like the Ten Commandments, Kim’s laws are rules which, even if followed poorly, civilize the world.</p>
<p>Kim always insisted that his Laws were not carved on stone tablets and that he was no burning bush, but those laws were, and remain, enormously important. And I doubt that would be so without Kim’s 200-proof Canadian modesty.</p>
<p>The next time the Identity Gang met was in October of that year, in Berkeley. By then the gang had grown to about a hundred people. Organized by <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya (IdentityWoman) Young</a>, <a href="http://windley.org">Phil Windley</a> and myself (but mostly the other two), the next meeting was branded <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a>, and it has been held every Fall and Spring since then at the Computer History Museum (and, on three pandemic occasions, online), with hundreds, from all over the world, participating every time.</p>
<p>IIW is an open space workshop, meaning that it consists entirely of breakouts on topics chosen and led by the participants. There are no keynotes, no panels, no vendor booths. Sponsor involvement is limited to food, coffee, free wi-fi, projectors, and other graces that carry no other promotional value. (Thanks to Kim, it has long been a tradition for Microsoft to sponsor an evening at a local restaurant and bar.) Most importantly, the people attending from big companies and startups alike are those with the ability to engineer or guide technical developments that work for everyone and not for just those companies.</p>
<p>I’m biased, but I believe IIW is the most essential and productive conference of any kind. Conversations and developments of many kinds are moved forward at every one of them. Examples of developments that might not be the same today but for IIW include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_cloud">personal clouds</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/picos">picos</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">SSI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">VRM</a>, <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/key-event-receipt-infrastructure-keri-secure-identifier-overlay-internet-sam-smith-webinar-58/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/distributed-ledger-technology">distributed ledgers</a>.</p>
<p>I am also sure that progress made around digital identity would not be the same (or as advanced) without Kim Cameron’s strong and gentle guidance. Hats off to his spirit and his legacy—and especially those laws.</p>

<p>I have implemented many Blazor WASM ASP.NET Core hosted applications now for both Azure AD and Azure B2C authentication. I always implement security for this type of application now using the Backend for Frontend (BFF) security architecture and can remove the tokens from the client. This is also what I recommend. At present, no Microsoft templates exist for this and it takes too much effort to set this up every time I start a new project. </p>



<p>To fill this gap, I created two templates to speed up the development process:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template">Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template</a>  <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Blazor.BFF.AzureB2C.Template">Blazor.BFF.AzureB2C.Template</a>  



<p>The two separate Nuget packages were created, one for Azure AD and one for Azure B2C due to the restrictions and differences in the identity providers. Both packages use <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web">Microsoft.Identity.Web</a> to authenticate and also use Microsoft Graph to access the profile data. I have included the typical security headers required using the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package. The security headers and the CSP are setup ready for production deployment. (As best as Blazor allows)</p>







<p>Using the templates</p>



<p>You can install the Azure B2C template as follows:</p>


  dotnet new -i Blazor.BFF.AzureB2C.Template
  


<p>and the Azure AD template with</p>


  dotnet new -i Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template
  


<p>Then you can create a new project using the dotnet CLI</p>


  dotnet new blazorbffb2c -n YourCompany.MyB2cBlazor
  


<p>or</p>


  dotnet new blazorbffaad -n YourCompany.MyADBlazor
  


<p>You need to create the Azure App registrations for the applications as requires. If using Azure B2C, the user flow needs to be created. This is well documentation on the Microsoft.Identity.Web github repo. The Graph permissions also need to be added and configured in the app.settings.json. The app.settings.json have been configured with the values expected. Once all configured, you can run the application and also deploy this to an Azure Web App or whatever.</p>



<p>Each template implements an API call and a user profile view using the Microsoft Graph data.</p>







<p>If you have any comments, or ways of improving these templates, please create an issue or a PR in the github repo.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 14, 2021</p>



<p>We got an early start, said good-bye to Celeste (who got to stay in the room a little longer), and headed for Paddington Station about 7 am to catch the <a href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/#/">Heathrow Express</a>. We bought our tickets, got out on the platform, and were greeted with a message board saying that there were delays on the line and that some trains had been canceled. This made us a little nervous, but the Network Rail application on my phone reassured us that there would, in fact, be a train soon. Although we had a bit more than the usual wait for Heathrow Express, the train proceeded normally and was not excessively crowded.</p>



<p>After the usual long walk, we reached the ticket counter and checked in. They were thorough in checking our vaccination and COVID testing status, although not to the point of actually checking the QR codes associated with each. After checking bags, there was another long walk to the vicinity of the gate. United’s lounge in London is still closed, but in the meantime they have an arrangement with Singapore Airlines for the use of their lounge where we were able to get breakfast.</p>



<p>At the gate, Kenna was diverted for extra security screening because the “SSSS” designation was printed on her boarding pass. Following that inconvenience, our flight departed on time, which given that we have only a 2-hour layover in Chicago (including customs and immigration) we appreciated. However, our arrival gate was occupied by another plane, resulting in about a 30 minute delay which made us understandably nervous.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7860.jpg"></a>Greenland from the air



<p>Having seen US Customs signs back in San Francisco promoting the <a href="https://mobilepassport.us/">Mobile Passport</a> immigration application for our phones, we entered our passport information and customs declaration. But after racing to the immigration hall, we were told, “We don’t use that any more. Get in line.” More nervousness about the time. After getting through Customs (which left us outside security), we took the tram to Terminal 1 for our flight to San Francisco.</p>



<p>Here we noticed that Kenna didn’t have the TSA Precheck designation on her boarding card, probably as a result of the SSSS designation earlier. It may not have mattered; there were signs saying precheck was closed and the people checking boarding passes didn’t seem to know. So we both went through the “slow line”, and unfortunately Kenna set something off and had to go through some extra screening. Apparently they thought there was something about one of her shoes, which they ran through the X-ray machine again; more delay. It was interesting that there were a number of women having their shoes rechecked at the same time.</p>



<p>We raced to our gate, nearly the furthest from the security checkpoint, and made it in enough time, but with not much to spare. The ride to San Francisco was unremarkable, and we collected our bags and caught our ride home, according to plan.</p>



 Epilogue 



  
<p>Arriving home we were severely jet lagged as expected, but tried to stay up as late as we could manage. After a few hours of sleep, I awoke about 2 am. I could hear some water dripping, which I attributed to a downspout being clogged with leaves following some recent rainfall. So I got up to investigate, and instead discovered that there was a substantial amount of water dripping from the ceiling into our guest room. It turns out that a hot water pipe in the attic had developed a pinhole leak and over time had soaked one wall. So we now have a new project.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 13, 2021</p>



<p>London isn’t in Sussex, that’s just the theme of the trip.</p>



<p>Celeste expressed a lot of interest in visiting the <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london">Imperial War Museum</a>, which none of us had visited, so we decided to make that our first destination. After a quick <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> breakfast, we took the Tube to the south side of London. The first thing you notice is the battleship guns at the front. My interest was also piqued by a short segment of Berlin Wall near the front entrance.</p>



<p>The museum has a large collection on several floors, with areas emphasizing World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the Holocaust, etc. One could easily spend several days to see all of the exhibits. Toward the end of our visit, we went in to the World War II gallery (having already seen quite a number of exhibits dealing with WW II), and it went on…and on. The gallery was very large and went into great detail, including many stories about participants in the war, German as well as Allied. We hadn’t expected the gallery to be nearly as large as it was, and might have allocated more time if we had.</p>



<p>Early in the afternoon we tired of the museum and decided to look for lunch. We thought we might like German food, so guided by our phones, we walked north and came to <a href="https://www.mercatometropolitano.com/">Mercato Metropolitano</a>, a large semi-outdoor food court with sustainable food from many world cuisines. Each of us selected something we like, but we never found the German restaurant we thought was there.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7846x-1.jpg"></a>



<p>Continuing north, we got to the <a href="https://boroughmarket.org.uk/">Borough Market</a>, a large trading market established in 1756. Perhaps because it was a Saturday, it was very crowded. Normally this might not have been as notable but that since the COVID epidemic we have avoided and become unaccustomed to crowds. We walked through quickly and then continued on to the Thames, where we went along the south shore to the Millennium Bridge. We walked out on the bridge, took some pictures, and continued west to the Westminster Bridge. All along the way there were people — lots of people.</p>



<p>After crossing the Westminster bridge, we took a short Tube ride to the West End. Again, everything was crowded. We tried a couple of places for dinner, but nothing was available without an advance booking. The Five Guys burger restaurant was jammed, and there was even a long queue at McDonalds (!). We couldn’t figure out the attraction there.</p>



<p>We finally settled on <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, the same Asian-themed fast food chain that we had tried in Brighton. We were able to find a table and had an enjoyable light meal.</p>



  
<p>The big event of the day was this evening: we had tickets to <a href="https://www.backtothefuturemusical.com/">Back to the Future: The Musical</a>, playing at the <a href="https://lwtheatres.co.uk/theatres/adelphi/">Adelphi Theatre</a> on The Strand. This is a new show that that just opened in July 2021 and has not yet made it to the United States. The theatre was, as expected, nearly full. But we had been told that COVID vaccination, negative tests, and the wearing of masks would be required. In fact, we were never asked about vaccinations or tests, and the majority of the audience did not wear masks. We felt somewhat less safe as a result.</p>
  



<p>Still, the show was very enjoyable. As Celeste pointed out, this is a “tech show” with the strong point being special effects. Most of the performances, particularly Doc Brown, were excellent as well, although Celeste noted that some of the actors had trouble with American accents.</p>



<p>We took the Tube back to our hotel and are retiring quickly. Tomorrow will be an early day for Jim and Kenna’s flight back home.</p>

<p>He wrote these in 2004, when he was still early in his tenure as Microsoft’s chief architect for identity (one of several similar titles he held at the company). Perhaps more than anyone at Microsoft—or at any big company—Kim pushed constantly toward openness, inclusivity, compatibility, cooperation, and the need for individual agency and scale. His laws, and other contributions to tech,&nbsp;are still only beginning to have full influence. Kim was way ahead of his time, and its a terrible shame that his own is up. He died of cancer on November 30.</p>
<p>But Kim was so much more—and other—than his work. He was a great musician, teacher (in French and English), thinker, epicure, traveler, father, husband, and friend. As a companion, he was always fun, as well as curious, passionate, caring, gracious. Pick a flattering adjective and it likely applies.</p>
<p>I am reminded of what a friend said of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky">Amos Tversky</a>, another genius of seemingly boundless vitality who died too soon: “Death is unrepresentative of him.”</p>
<p>That’s one reason it’s hard to think of Kim in the past tense, and why I resisted the urge to update <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)">Kim’s Wikipedia page</a>&nbsp;earlier today. (Somebody has done that now, I see.)</p>
<p>We all get our closing parentheses. I’ve gone longer without closing mine than Kim did before closing his. That also makes me sad, not that I’m in a hurry.&nbsp;Being old means knowing you’re in the exit line, but okay with others cutting in. I just wish this time it wasn’t Kim.</p>
<p>Britt Blaser says life is like a loaf of bread. It’s one loaf no matter how many slices are in it. Some people get a few slices, others many. For the sake of us all, I wish Kim had more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157720199287768">Here is an album of photos</a> of Kim, going back to 2005 at Esther Dyson’s PC Forum, where we had the first gathering of what would become the <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">Internet Identity Workshop</a>, the 34th of which is coming up next Spring. As with many other things in the world, it wouldn’t be the same—or here at all—without Kim.</p>

<p>Friday, November 12, 2021</p>



<p>Since it is now 2 days before our return to the United States, today was the day for our pre-trip COVID test. We were a little nervous about that because, of course, it determines whether we return as planned. Expecting a similar experience as for our Day 2 test, we were a bit surprised that this time we would have to do a proctored test where the proctor would watch us take the test via video chat. The next surprise was that you seem to need both a smartphone to run their app and some other device for the chat session. So we got out our iPads, and (third surprise) there was apparently a bug in their application causing it not to work on an iPad. So we got out my Mac laptop and (fourth surprise) couldn’t use my usual browser, Firefox, but could fortunately use Safari. Each test took about half an hour, including a 15-minute wait for the test to develop. Following the wait, a second video chat was set up where they read the test with you and issued your certificate. Very fortunately, both of our tests were negative.</p>



<p>We checked out of the apartment/hotel just before checkout time and stored our bags. Then the question was what to do until Celeste finished classes so we could all take the train to London. The answer was the <a href="https://www.visitsealife.com/brighton/">Sea Life Brighton</a>, apparently the oldest aquarium in the world. While not an extensive collection, many of the exhibits were in a classic style with ornate frames supporting the glass windows. There was a very enjoyable tunnel where you can sit while fish (and turtles!) swim overhead. The aquarium covered a number of regions of the world, with more of an emphasis on fresh-water fish than many others we have seen.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7828-1.jpg"></a>




<p>After browsing a bookstore for a while, we collected our bags and headed for the train station. Trains run to Victoria Station in London every half hour, and fortunately that connected well with the train Celeste took from Falmer to meet us.</p>



<p>After the train trip and Tube ride to Paddington Station, we walked the short distance to our hotel, a newly renovated boutique hotel called <a href="https://www.inhabithotels.com/">Inhabit</a>. We chose it largely because it had nice triple rooms, including an actual bed (not sofa bed) for Celeste. No London trip would be complete without a hotel where it’s necessary to lug your bags up a flight of stairs, but fortunately this one only required a single flight. Our room was modern and comfortable.</p>



<p>I had booked a table at the <a href="https://www.victoriapaddington.co.uk/">Victoria</a>, a pub in the Paddington area, and we were seated in a pleasant and not noisy dining room upstairs. Dinner was excellent. Upon returning to the hotel, Celeste immediately collapsed for the night on her cozy bed.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 11, 2021</p>



<p>While Celeste was in classes, Kenna and I set out on foot for Hove, Brighton’s “twin” city to the west. We had a rather pleasant walk through a shopping district, but there wasn’t much remarkable to see. In Hove, we turned south and followed the main road along the Channel back to the west. We stopped to look at one of the characteristic crescent-shaped residential developments, and continued toward Brighton. We considered going on the <a href="https://britishairwaysi360.com/">i360</a> observation tower, but it wasn’t particularly clear and the expense didn’t seem worth it.</p>



<p>Celeste and a friend of hers (another exchange student from Colorado) joined us in the afternoon to go ice skating at the <a href="https://royalpavilionicerink.co.uk/">Royal Pavilion Ice Rink</a>. While I am used to hockey skates, it was a bit of an adjustment to the others who are used to the toe picks on figure skates. We all got the hang of it; the ice was beautifully maintained (although with some puddles) and the rink was not particularly crowded for our 3 pm session.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_4511.jpeg"></a>




<p>After skating we sat in the attached cafe to chat until it was time for dinner, which we had at an Italian restaurant, <a href="https://www.bellaitalia.co.uk/italian-restaurant/brighton/market-street#!">Bella Italia</a>, in the Lanes.</p>

<p>Wednesday, November 10, 2021</p>



<p>Celeste has a busy class schedule the early part of the day, so Kenna and I set out on our own, first for a hearty breakfast at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d467437-Reviews-Billie_s_Cafe-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html">Billie’s Cafe</a> and then to the <a href="https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/royalpavilion/">Royal Pavilion</a>, one of the sightseeing highlights of Brighton. Originally a country estate, it was remodeled by King George IV into an ornate building, with the exterior having an Indian theme and the interior extensively decorated and furnished in Chinese style.</p>



<p>Brighton’s Royal Pavilion has had a varied history, having been of less interest to Queen Victoria (George IV’s successor in the throne) who moved most of the furnishings to London and sold the building to the City of Brighton. Over the years it has been refurnished in the original style and with many of the original furnishings, some of which have been loaned by Queen Elizabeth. The Pavilion was in the process of being decorated for Christmas, which reminded us of a visit we made two years ago to <a href="https://filoli.org/">Filoli</a> in California.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7769.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7770-1.jpg"></a>




<p>After the Pavilion, we went across the garden to the Brighton Museum, which had a wide range of exhibits ranging from ancient history of the British Isles and ancient Egypt to LGBT styles of the late 20th century and modern furniture.</p>



<p>Having finished her classes, Celeste joined us for lunch at <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, one of a chain of Asian-inspired fast food restaurants. We then returned with Celeste to the museum to see a bit more and allow her time to do some research she had planned.</p>



<p>We then made our way behind the Pavilion, where a seasonal ice rink is set up for recreational ice skating. With its location next to the Pavilion it is a particularly scenic place to skate. We are looking forward to doing that tomorrow.</p>



<p>Celeste returned to campus, and Kenna and I, having had a substantial lunch, opted for a light dinner at <a href="https://www.tengreenbottles.com/">Ten Green Bottles</a>, a local wine bar.</p>

  The title might sound like a movie but this article is about unpacking decision making.  <br><br>We need leaders to be confident in their decisions so we can hold them accountable.  We desire leaders to lead, wanting them to be early. They achieve this by listening to the signals and reacting before is is obvious to the casual observer.  However, those in leadership who we hold accountable do not want to make the “wrong” decisions. A wrong decision can mean liability, loss of reputation or perceived to be too risky.  A long senior leadership career requires navigating a careful path between not takingtoo much risk by going too “early”, which leads to failure, and not being late such that anyone could have made the decision earlier and looking incompetent.  Easy leadership does not look like leadership as it finds a path of not being early or late (the majority)<br><br><br><br>When we unpack leadership trends over the past 100 years that include ideas such as improving margin, diversification, reduction, speed to market, finance lead decisions, data-led, customer first, agile, just-in-time, customer centricity, digital first, personalisation, automated decisions, innovation, transformation, ethics, diversity, privacy by design, shareholder primacy, stakeholder management, re-engineering, outsourcing to name a few.  Over the same period of time our ideas of leadership styles has also evolved. <br><br><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#"></a><br><br>There is an inference or hypothesis that we can test, which is that our approach to risk means we have the leaders that we now deserve. Does our risk create the leadersghip we have or does leadership manage risk to what we want is a cause and effect problem that results from the complex market we have. <br><br>The Ladder of Inference below is a concept developed by the late Harvard Professor Chris Argyris, to help explain why anyone reading this and looking at (the same/a) set of evidence we can draw very different conclusions. However, the point is that what we want leadership who has the courage for decisions that are “hard and fast”, but what we get “late and slow”   Data led, waiting for the data, following the model all confirm that the decisions we are taking are late and slow.  We know there is a gap, it is just hard to know why.  Hard and fast occurs when there is a lack of data or evidence and rests on judgment and not confirmation, the very things we value but peanilse for at the same time.<br><br><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#"></a><br><br><br><br>Right now we see this with how the government have reacted to COVID, again we can conclude with hindsight that no-one country leadership got it right and the majority appear to continuen to get it wrong in the view that the voters will not vote from them if they take the hard choices, follow the science, follow the data making sure we are late and slow.<br><br>Climate change and COP26.  There will never be enough data and waiting for more data confirms our need to manage to a risk model that does not account for the environment with the same weight as finance.  <br><br>Peak Paradox<br><br>The Peak Paradox framework forces us to address the question “what are we optimising for?”  Previous articles have highlighted the issues about decision making at Peak Paradox, however at each point we should also consider the leadership style “Hard &amp; Fast versus Late &amp; Slow”<br><br><br><br><br><br>The Peak Paradox model gives us a position in space, at each point where we are, thinking about hard &amp; fast vs late and slow introduces a concept of time and direction into the model.<br><br>

  <p>I've been mostly <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">shaving yaks</a> this week - two in particular: the Datasette table refactor and the next release of <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">git-history</a>. I also built and released my first Web Component!</p>
 A Web Component for embedding Datasette tables 
<p>A longer term goal that I have for Datasette is to figure out a good way of using it to build dashboards, tying together summaries and visualizations of the latest data from a bunch of different sources.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the potential of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a> to help solve this problem.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-notebook">datasette-notebook</a> project is a very early experiment in this direction: it's a Datasette notebook that provides a Markdown wiki (persisted to SQLite) to which I plan to add the ability to embed tables and visualizations in wiki pages - forming a hybrid of a wiki, dashboarding system and Notion/Airtable-style database.</p>
<p>It does almost none of those things right now, which is why I've not really talked about it here.</p>
<p>Web Components offer a standards-based mechanism for creating custom HTML tags. Imagine being able to embed a Datasette table on a page by adding the following to your HTML:</p>
  &lt;datasette-table
    url="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants.json"
&gt;&lt;/datasette-table&gt;  
<p>That's exactly what <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-table">datasette-table</a> lets you do! Here's <a href="https://simonw.github.io/datasette-table/">a demo</a> of it in action.</p>
<p>This is version 0.1.0 - it works, but I've not even started to flesh it out.</p>
<p>I did learn a bunch of things building it though: it's my first Web Component, my first time using <a href="https://lit.dev/">Lit</a>, my first time using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> and the first JavaScript library I've ever packaged and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/datasette-table">published to npm</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a detailed TIL on <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/npm/publish-web-component">Publishing a Web Component to npm</a> encapsulating everything I've learned from this project so far.</p>
<p>This is also my first piece of yak shaving this week: I built this partly to make progress on <code>datasette-notebook</code>, but also because my big Datasette refactor involves finalizing the design of the JSON API for version 1.0. I realized that I don't actually have a project that makes full use of that API, which has been hindering my attempts to redesign it. Having one or more Web Components that consume the API will be a fantastic way for me to eat my own dog food.</p>
 Link: rel="alternate" for Datasette tables 
<p>Here's an interesting problem that came up while I was working on the <code>datasette-table</code> component.</p>
<p>As designed right now, you need to figure out the JSON URL for a table and pass that to the component.</p>
<p>This is usually a case of adding <code>.json</code> to the path, while preserving any query string parameters - but there's a nasty edge-case: if your SQLite table itself ends with the string <code>.json</code> (which could happen! Especially since Datasette promises to work with any existing SQLite database) the URL becomes this instead:</p>
 <code>/mydb/table.json?_format=json
</code> 
<p>Telling users of my component that they need to first construct the JSON URL for their page isn't the best experience: I'd much rather let people paste in the URL to the HTML version and derive the JSON from that.</p>
<p>This is made more complex by the fact that, thanks to <code>--cors</code>, the Web Component can be embedded on any page. And for <code>datasette-notebook</code> I'd like to provide a feature where any URLs to Datasette instances - no matter where they are hosted - are turned into embedded tables automatically.</p>
<p>To do this, I need an efficient way to tell that an arbitrary URL corresponds to a Datasette table.</p>
<p>My latest idea here is to use a combination of HTTP <code>HEAD</code> requests and a <code>Link: rel="alternate"</code> header - something like this:</p>
 <code>~ % curl -I 'https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/compound_three_primary_keys'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Sat, 27 Nov 2021 20:09:36 GMT
server: uvicorn
Link: https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/compound_three_primary_keys.json; rel="alternate"; type="application/datasette+json"
</code> 
<p>This would allow a (hopefully fast) <code>fetch()</code> call from JavaScript to confirm that a URL is a Datasette table, and get back the JSON that should be fetched by the component in order to render it on the page.</p>
<p>I have a prototype of this in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1533">Datasette issue #1533</a>. I think it's a promising approach!</p>
<p>It's also now part of the ever-growing table refactor. Adding custom headers to page responses is currently far harder than it should be.</p>
 sqlite-utils STRICT tables 
<p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_37_0.html">SQLite 3.37.0</a> came out at the weekend with a long-awaited feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html">STRICT tables</a>, which enforce column types such that you get an error if you try to insert a string into an integer column.</p>
<p>(This has been a long-standing complaint about SQLite by people who love strong typing, and D. Richard Hipp finally shipped the change for them with some salty release notes saying it's "for developers who prefer that kind of thing.")</p>
<p>I started researching how to add support for this to my <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html">sqlite-utils Python library</a>. You can follow my thinking in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/344">sqlite-utils issue #344</a> - I'm planning to add a <code>strict=True</code> option to methods that create tables, but for the moment I've shipped <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/commit/e3f108e0f339e3d87ce48541bbca8f891bfaf040">new introspection properties</a> for seeing if a table uses strict mode or not.</p>
 git-history update 
<p>My other big yak this week has been work on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history">git-history</a>. I'm determined to get it into a stable state such that I can write it up, produce a tutorial and maybe produce a video demonstration as well - but I keep on finding things I want to change about how it works.</p>
<p>The big challenge is how to most effectively represent the history of a bunch of different items over time in a relational database schema.</p>
<p>I started with a <code>item</code> table that presents just the most recent version of each item, and an <code>item_version</code> table with a row for every subsequent version.</p>
<p>That table got pretty big, with vast amounts of duplicated data in it.</p>
<p>So I've been working on an optimization where columns are only included in an <code>item_version</code> row <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/issues/21">if they have changed since the previous version</a>.</p>
<p>The problem there is what to do about <code>null</code> - does <code>null</code> mean "this column didn't change" or does it mean "this column was set from some other value back to <code>null</code>"?</p>
<p>After a few different attempts I've decided to solve this with a many-to-many table, so for any row in the <code>item_version</code> table you can see which columns were explicitly changed by that version.</p>
<p>This is all working pretty nicely now, but still needs documentation, and tests, and then a solid write-up and tutorial and demos and a video... hopefully tomorrow!</p>
<p>One of my design decisions for this tool has been to use an underscore prefix for "reserved columns", such that non-reserved columns can be safely used by the arbitrary data that is being tracked by the tool.</p>
<p>Having columns with names like <code>_id</code> and <code>_item</code> has highlighted several bugs with Datasette's handling of these column names, since Datasette itself tries to use things like <code>?_search=</code> for special query string parameters. I released <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-59-4">Datasette 0.59.4</a> with some relevant fixes.</p>

<p>Tuesday, November 9, 2021</p>



<p>Somewhat at the midpoint of our trip, it was time to take care of a few things like laundry. It’s also time for the thrice-annual <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> meeting, which was supposed to be in Madrid, but is being held online (again) due to the pandemic. I co-chaired a session from noon to 2 pm local time today, so I needed to be at the hotel for that. Meanwhile Kenna and Celeste did some exploring around the little shops in the Brighton Lanes.</p>



<p>Our downtime day also gave us an opportunity to do some laundry. One of the attractive features of our “aparthotel” is a compact combination washer/dryer. Our room also came with a couple of detergent pods, which were unfortunately and unexpectedly heavily scented. We will be using our own detergent in the future. The dryer was slow, but it did the job.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_4493x.jpg"></a>IETF virtual venue



<p>I am again thankful for the good internet service here; the meeting went without a hitch (my co-chair is in Melbourne, Australia). Kenna and Celeste brought lunch from <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> to eat between meeting sessions I needed to attend. Following the second session we went off for dinner at a pizza place we had discovered, <a href="https://www.francomanca.co.uk/">Franco Manca</a>. The pizza and surroundings were outstanding; we would definitely return (and Celeste probably will). We then saw Celeste off to her bus back to campus and we returned to our hotel.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago, I switched roles at Oracle and joined the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Product Management team working on Identity and Access Management (IAM) services. It's been an incredibly interesting (and challenging) year leading up to our release of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/identity-cloud/">OCI IAM identity domains</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We merged an enterprise-class Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution with our OCI-native IAM service to create a cloud platform IAM service unlike any other. We encountered numerous challenges along the way that would have been much easier if we allowed for customer interruption. But we had a key goal to not cause any interruptions or changes in functionality to our thousands of existing IDaaS customers. It's been immeasurably impressive to watch the development organization attack and conquer those challenges.<br></p><p>Now, with a few clicks from the OCI admin console, customers can create self-contained IDaaS instances to accommodate a variety of IAM use-cases. And this is just the beginning. The new, upgraded OCI IAM service serves as the foundation for what's to come. And I've never been more optimistic about Oracle's future in the IAM space.</p><p>Here's a short excerpt from our blog post <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/introducing-oci-iam-identity-domains">Introducing OCI IAM Identity Domains</a>:<br></p><p></p><blockquote><p>"Over the past five years, Oracle Identity  Cloud Service (IDCS) has grown to support thousands of customers and  currently manages hundreds of millions of identities. Current IDCS  customers enjoy a broad set of Identity and Access Management (IAM)  features for authentication (federated, social, delegated, adaptive, multi-factor authentication (MFA)), access management, manual or automated identity lifecycle and entitlement management, and single sign-on (SSO) (federated, gateways, proxies, password vaulting).</p> <p>In addition to serving IAM use cases for workforce and consumer  access scenarios, IDCS has frequently been leveraged to enhance IAM  capabilities for <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a>&nbsp;(OCI) workloads. The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/identity-cloud/">OCI Identity and Access Management (OCI IAM)</a> service, a native OCI service that provides the access control plane  for Oracle Cloud resources (networking, compute, storage, analytics,  etc.), has provided the IAM framework for OCI via authentication, access  policies, and integrations with OCI security approaches such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm">compartments and tagging</a>.  OCI customers have adopted IDCS for its broader authentication options,  identity lifecycle management capabilities, and to provide a seamless  sign-on experience for end users that extends beyond the Oracle Cloud.</p> <p>To better address Oracle customers’ IAM requirements and to simplify  access management across Oracle Cloud, multi-cloud, Oracle enterprise  applications, and third-party applications, Oracle has merged IDCS and  OCI IAM into a single, unified cloud service that brings all of IDCS’  advanced identity and access management features natively into the OCI  IAM service. To align with Oracle Cloud branding, the unified IAM  service will leverage the OCI brand and will be offered as OCI IAM. Each instance of the OCI IAM service will be managed as identity domains in the OCI console."</p></blockquote><p></p><p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/introducing-oci-iam-identity-domains">Learn more about OCI IAM identity domains</a> <br></p>

<p>Monday, November 8, 2021</p>



<p>We started our day fairly early, getting a quick Starbucks breakfast before getting on the bus to University of Sussex to meet Celeste at 9:30 am. Celeste has an hour-long radio show, “Oops That Had Banjos”, on the campus radio station, <a href="https://www.urfonline.com/">University Radio Falmer</a>. She invited us to co-host the show. The studio was exactly as I had imagined, and it was a lot of fun doing the show with her. We each contributed a couple of songs to the playlist, and got to introduce them briefly.</p>



<p>After the show, Celeste had classes so we continued on to Lewes. We hadn’t been able to see much on our short visit Sunday evening. We started out at <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/lewes-castle-museum/">Lewes Castle &amp; Museum</a>, again getting an idea of the history of the place and then visiting portions of the castle itself. It was a clear day, and the view from the top was excellent. As with many of these sites, the castle went through many changes through the centuries as political conditions changed.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7759-1.jpg"></a>

<p>After climbing around the castle, we were ready for lunch. We checked out a few restaurants in town before settling on the Riverside Cafe, in an attractive area on the River Ouse. After lunch, we walked among a number of small shops before entering a <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/">Waterstones bookstore</a>. How we miss spending time in quality bookstores! I expect we’ll be seeking them out more once we return.</p>



<p>We then took the train back to Brighton, since I had a meeting to attend for work. The meeting went well; the internet connection at the hotel is solid and makes it seem like it hardly matters where in the world I am when attending these meetings.</p>



<p>Celeste came down to Brighton to have dinner with us. We decided to go with Latin American food at a local chain called Las Iguanas. The food was quite good although somewhat standard, at least to those of us from California and Colorado.</p>

  <p>Summary: Digital memories are an important component of our digital embodiment. SSI provides a foundation for self-sovereign digital memories to solve the digital-analog memory divide.</p>



<p>
    In a recent thread on the VRM mailing list, StJohn Deakins of <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/">Citizen Me</a> shared a <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/memory-the-simple-trick-to-understanding-personal-data/">formulation of interactions</a> that I thought was helpful in unpacking the discussions about data, identity, and ownership.  His framework concerns analog vs digital memories. 
</p>

<p>
    In real life, we often interact with others—both people and institutions—with relative anonymity. For example, if I go the store and use cash to buy a coke there is no exchange of identity information. If I use a credit card it's rarely the case that the entire transaction happens under the administrative authority of the identity system inherent in the credit card. Only the financial part of the transaction takes place in that identity system. This is true of most interactions in real life.
</p>

<p>
    In this situation, the cashier, others in the store, and I all share a common experience. Even so, we each retain our own memories of the interaction. No one participating would claim to "own" the interaction. But we all retain memories which are our own. There is no single "true" record of the interaction. Every participant will have a different perspective (literally). 
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, the store, as an institution, retains a memory of having sold a coke and the credit card transaction. This digital memory of the transaction can easily persist longer than any of the analog memories of the event. Because it is a digital record we trust it and tend to think of it as "true." For some purposes, say proving in a court of law that I was in the store at a particular time, this is certainly true. But for other purposes (e.g. was the cashier friendly or rude?) the digital memory is woefully anemic. 
</p>

<p>
    Online, we only have digital memories. And people have very few tools for saving, managing, recalling, and using them. I think digital memories are one of the primary features of digital embodiment—giving people a place to stand in the digital world, their own perspective, memories, and capacity to act. We can't be peers online without having our own digital memories. 
</p>

<p>
    StJohn calls this the "analog-digital memory divide." This divide is one source of the power imbalance between people and administrative entities (i.e. anyone who has a record of you in an account). CitizenMe provides tools for people to manage digital memories. People retain their own digital memory of the event. While every participant has a similar digital memory of the event, they can all be different, reflecting different vantage points. 
</p>

<p>
    One of the recent trends in application development is microservices, with an attendant denormalization of data. The realization that there doesn't have to be, indeed often can't be, a single source of truth for data has freed application development from the strictures of centralization and led to more easily built and operated distributed applications that are resilient and scale. I think this same idea applies to digital interactions generally. Freeing ourselves from the mindset that digital systems can and should provide a single record that is "true" will lead to more autonomy and richer interactions. 
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereign identity (SSI) provides a foundation for our digital personhood and allows us to not only taking charge of our digital memories but operationalize all of our digital relationships. Enriching the digital memories of events by allowing everyone their own perspective (i.e. making them self-sovereign) will lead to a digital world that is more like real life.

  <p>The more I think about Facebook’s Meta’s pivot to the metaverse, the less it appears
like they do this voluntarily. I think they have no other choice: their existing
business is running out of steam. Consider:</p>
 
 
<p>At about
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/">3.5 billion month active users</a>
of at least one of their products (Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp etc),
they are running out of more humans to sign up.</p>
 
 
<p>People say they use Facebook to
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2011/12/22/using-social-media-to-keep-in-touch/">stay in touch with family and friends</a>.
But there is now one ad in my feed for each three or four posts that I actually want to
see. Add more ads than this, and users will turn their backs: Facebook doesn’t help
them with what they want help with any more, it’s all ads.</p>
 
 
<p>While their ARPU is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/">much higher in the US</a>
than in Europe, where in turn it is much higher than the rest of the world – hinting that
international growth should be possible – their distribution of ARPU is not all that
different from the whole ad market’s
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258071/global-advertising-spending-by-region/">distribution of ad revenues in different regions</a>.
Convincing, say, Africa to spend much more on ads does not sound like a growth story.</p>
 
 
<p>And between the regulators in the EU and elsewhere, moves to effectively ban further
Instagram-like acquisitions, lawsuits left and right, and Apple’s privacy moves, their
room to manoever is getting tighter, not wider.</p>
 
 
<p>Their current price/sales ratio of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/key-statistics?p=FB">just under 10</a>
is hard to be justified for long under these constraints. They must also be telling themselves
that relying on an entirely ad-based business model is not good long-term strategy any
more, given the backlash against surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>I think you change the fundamentals of your business at the same time you change the
conversation, leveraging the technology you own. And you end up with:</p>
 
 
<p>Oculus as the replacement for the mobile phone;</p>
 
 
<p>Headset and app store sales, for Oculus, as an entirely new business model that’s
been proven (by the iPhone) to be highly profitable and is less under attack by regulators
and the public; it also supports potentially much higher ARPU than just ads;</p>
 
 
<p>Renaming the company to something completely harmless and bland sounding; that will also
let you drop the Facebook brand should it become too toxic down the road.</p>
 
 
<p>The risks are immense, starting with: how many hours a day do you hold your mobile phone
in your hand, in comparison to how many hours a day you are willing to wear a bucket
on your head, ahem, a headset? Even fundamental interaction questions, architecture questions
and use case questions for the metaverse are still completely up in the air.</p>
<p>Credit to Mark Zuckerberg for pulling off a move as substantial as this for an
almost trillion dollar company. I can’t think of any company which has ever done anything
similar at this scale. When Intel pivoted from memory to CPUs, back in the 1980’s and at
a much smaller scale, at least it was clear that there was going to be significant, growing
demand for CPUs. This is not clear at all about headsets beyond niches such as gaming.
So they are really jumping into the unknown with both feet.</p>
<p>But I don’t think any more they had a choice.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 7, 2021</p>



<p>Having gone west to <a href="https://altmode.org/2021/11/27/sussex-day-3-chichester-and-fishbourne/">Chichester</a> yesterday, today we went east to Hastings, notable for the Norman conquest of 1066 (although the actual Battle of Hastings was some distance inland). We arranged to meet Celeste on the train as we passed through Falmer, where her campus is located, for the hour-or-so trip along the coast. Unfortunately, it seems like it’s an hour train ride to most sights outside Brighton.</p>



<p>Hastings is an attractive and somewhat touristy town, along the Channel and in a narrow valley surrounded by substantial hills. We walked through the town, stopping for a fish and chips lunch along the way, and admiring the small shops in the Old Town. We took a funicular up one of the two hills and had an excellent view of the surrounding terrain. Unfortunately, the ruins of the castle at Hastings were closed for the season.<br><br></p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7741-1.jpg"></a>
Funicular and view from the top



<p>After returning via funicular, we continued through the town to the <a href="http://www.hmag.org.uk/">Hastings Museum</a>, a well curated (and free!) small museum that was thorough in its coverage of the history of the area, from the Iron Age to the present. It also included an extensive collection from a local family that sailed around the world in the 1800s.</p>



<p>Taking the train back, we had a change of trains in Lewes, which Celeste had visited and enjoyed previously. We stopped at the Lewes Arms pub, but unfortunately (since it was Sunday evening) the kitchen had closed so we couldn’t get food. So Celeste returned to campus and got dinner there, while Kenna and I got take-out chicken sandwiches to eat in our hotel.</p>



<p>Our weekly family Zoom conference is on Sunday evening, England time, so we ate our sandwiches while chatting with other family members back home. It’s so much easier to stay in close touch with family while traveling than it was just a few years ago.</p>

  A quick tip for speeding up Perl builds in GitHub workflows by caching dependencies.

<p>I’ve spent quite a few hours evenings and weekends recently building out a
comprehensive suite of <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/actions">GitHub Actions for Sqitch</a>. They cover a dozen versions
of Perl, nearly 70 database versions amongst nine database engines, plus a
coverage test and a release workflow. A pull request can expect over 100 actions
to run. Each build requires over 100 direct dependencies, plus all their
dependencies. Installing them for every build would make any given run
untenable.</p>
<p>Happily, GitHub Actions include a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows" title="GitHub Actions: “Caching dependencies to speed up workflows”">caching feature</a>, and thanks to a
<a href="https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-setup-perl/pull/892">recent improvement to shogo82148/actions-setup-perl</a>,
it’s quite easy to use in a version-independent way. Here’s an example:</p>
  <code>name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  OS:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu, macos, windows ]
        perl: [ 'latest', '5.34', '5.32', '5.30', '5.28' ]
    name: Perl ${{ matrix.perl }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Perl
        id: perl
        uses: shogo82148/actions-setup-perl@v1
        with: { perl-version: "${{ matrix.perl }}" }
      - name: Cache CPAN Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: local
          key: perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: cpm install --verbose --show-build-log-on-failure --no-test --cpanfile cpanfile
      - name: Run Tests
        env: { PERL5LIB: "${{ github.workspace }}/local/lib/perl5" }
        run: prove -lrj4
</code>  <p>This workflow tests every permutation of OS and Perl version specified in
<code>jobs.OS.strategy.matrix</code>, resulting in 15 jobs. The <code>runs-on</code> value determines
the OS, while the <code>steps</code> section defines steps for each permutation. Let’s take
each step in turn:</p>
 
 “Checkout Source” checks the project out of GitHub. Pretty much required for
any project. 
 “Setup Perl” sets up the version of Perl using the value from the matrix.
Note the <code>id</code> key set to <code>perl</code>, used in the next step. 
 “Cache CPAN Modules” uses the <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">cache action</a> to cache the directory named
<code>local</code> with the key <code>perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}</code>. The key
lets us keep different versions of the <code>local</code> directory based on a unique
key. Here we’ve used the <code>perl-hash</code> output from the <code>perl</code> step defined
above. The <code>actions-setup-perl</code> action outputs this value, which contains a
hash of the output of <code>perl -V</code>, so we’re tying the cache to a very specific
version and build of Perl. This is important since compiled modules are not
compatible across major versions of Perl. 
 “Install Dependencies” uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-cpm/view/script/cpm" title="cpm - a fast CPAN module installer"><code>cpm</code></a> to quickly install Perl dependencies. By
default, it puts them into the <code>local</code> subdirectory of the current directory
— just where we configured the cache. On the first run for a given OS and
Perl version, it will install all the dependencies. But on subsequent runs
it will find the dependencies already present, thank to the cache, and
quickly exit, reporting “All requirements are satisfied.” In <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/runs/4275487924?check_suite_focus=true">this Sqitch
job</a>, it takes less than a second. 
 “Run Tests” runs the tests that require the dependencies. It requires the
<code>PERL5LIB</code> environment variable to point to the location of our cached
dependencies. 
 
<p>That’s the whole deal. The first run will be the slowest, depending on the
number of dependencies, but subsequent runs will be much faster, up to the
seven-day caching period. For a complex project like Sqitch, which uses the same
OS and Perl version for most of its actions, this results in a tremendous build
time savings. CI configurations we’ve used in the past often took an hour or
more to run. Today, most builds take only a few minutes to test, with longer
times determined not by dependency installation but by container and database
latency.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 6, 2021</p>



<p>After a pleasant breakfast at a cafe in The Lanes, we met up with Celeste at the Brighton train station and rode to Chichester, about an hour to the west. Chichester is a pleasant (and yes, touristy) town with a notable cathedral. Arriving somewhat late, we walked through the town and then found lunch at a small restaurant on a side road as many of the major restaurants in town were quite crowded (it is a Saturday, after all).<br><br><br><br></p>



  
<p>One of the main attractions in the area is the <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/fishbourne-roman-palace-gardens/">Fishbourne Roman Palace</a>, one village to the west. We set out on foot, through a bit of rain, for a walk of a couple of miles. But when we arrived it was well worth the trip. This is an actual Roman palace, constructed in about 79AD, that had been uncovered starting in the 1960s, along with many coins, implements, and other artifacts. The mosaic floors were large and particularly impressive. As a teenager, I got to visit the ruins in Pompeii; these were of a similar nature. This palace and surrounding settlements were key to the Roman development of infrastructure in England.</p>
  



  
<p>Returning from Fishbourne to Chichester, we made a short visit to <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/">Chichester Cathedral</a>. Unfortunately, the sun had set and it was difficult to see most of the stained glass. At the time of our visit, there was a <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/news/50000-people-visited-luke-jerrams-museum-moon-chichester-cathedral">large model of the Moon</a>, traveling to several locations in Europe, that was hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the church. It was a striking thing to see, especially as we first entered.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7719-2.jpeg"></a>

  



<p>After our train trip back from Chichester, we parted with Celeste who returned to campus. Since it was a Saturday night, restaurants were crowded, but we were able to get dinner at a large chain pub, <a href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/east-sussex/the-post--telegraph-brighton">Wetherspoons</a>. The pub was noisy and table service was minimal. We ordered via their website and they only cleared the previous patrons’ dirty dishes when they delivered our food. The food was acceptable, but nothing to blog about.</p>

<p>Friday, November 5, 2021</p>



<p>These days, “day 2” after arriving in the UK has a special implication: it is on this day that you must take and report the results of a COVID-19 test. As required, we ordered the tests and had them delivered to our hotel. After breakfast (in our room/apartment, with groceries we picked up previously), we very methodically followed the instructions and 15 minutes later happily had negative test results. You send an image of the test stick next to the information page from your passport and a little while later they send a certificate of your test results. Presumably the results were sent to the authorities as well so they don’t come looking for us.</p>



<p>Celeste had classes at various times (including an 8:30 pm meeting with the Theater Department in Colorado) so Kenna and I were on our own today. We set out to explore Brighton, a city that bears resemblance to both Santa Cruz and Berkeley, California. We took a rather long walk, beginning with  the shore area. We walked out to the end of <a href="https://www.brightonpier.co.uk/">Brighton Palace Pier</a>, which includes a sizable game arcade and a small amusement park with rides at the end.</p>



<p>We decided to continue eastward along the shore and walked a long path toward Brighton Marina. Along the way were a variety of activities, including miniature golf, a sauna, an outdoor studio including a yoga class in session, and an electric railway. There was also quite a bit of construction, which makes sense since it’s off-season.</p>



<p>We arrived at the marina not entirely clear on how to approach it by foot: the major building we saw was a large parking garage. So we continued along the Undercliff Trail, the cliffs being primarily chalk. This is how we picture the White Cliffs of Dover must be (although Dover probably has higher cliffs). At the far end of the marina we found a pedestrian entrance, and walked back through the marina to find some lunch. We ate outdoors at <a href="https://www.bitesussex.com/taste-sussex">Taste Sussex</a>, which was quite good, although our seating area got a little chilly once the sun fell behind a nearby building.</p>

Brighton cliffs and marina



<p>Our return took us through the areas of the marina that didn’t look very pedestrian-friendly, but were actually OK. We took a different route back to the hotel through the Kemptown District. We’re not sure we found the main part of Kemptown but we did walk past the Royal Sussex Hospital.</p>



<p>We had heard about the <a href="https://www.brightontoymuseum.co.uk/">Brighton Toy and Model Museum</a>, and had a little time so we went looking for it. The maps indicated that it is located adjacent to the train station, so we went to the train station and wandered around for quite a while before discovering that it’s sort of under the station, accessed through a door on the side of an underpass. The museum is physically small, but they have a very extensive collection of classic toys and model trains, primarily from the early 20th century. The staff was helpful and friendly, even offering suggestions for what else to see while in the area.</p>



<p>We had a late lunch, so instead of going out for dinner we opted for wine/beer and a charcuterie plate from the small bar in the hotel. It included a couple of unusual cheeses (a black-colored cheddar, for example) and met our needs well.</p>



<p>Guy Fawkes Day is traditionally celebrated in the UK with bonfires and fireworks displays to commemorate his 1605 attempt to blow up Parliament. Although our room faces the Channel, we heard but had limited visibility to various fireworks being set off on the shore. So we again set out on foot and saw a few, but since the fireworks are unofficial (set off by random people on the beach), they were widely dispersed and unorganized.</p>



<p>It has been a good day for walking, with over 10 miles traveled.</p>

Considering how much additional library complexity has emerged in Python world from having these two different colours of functions it's noteworthy that PHP has chosen to go in a different direction here.</p>

<p>Setup Azure App Service</p>



<p>An Azure App Service was created which uses .NET and 64 bit configurations. The Azure App Service is configured to require incoming client certificates and will forward this to the application. By configuring this, any valid certificate will work. The certificate still needs to be validated inside the application. You need to check that the correct client certificate is being used.</p>







<p>Implement the API with certificate authentication for deployment</p>



<p>The AddAuthentication sets the default scheme to CertificateAuthentication. The AddCertificate method adds the required configuration to validate the client certificates used with each request. We use a self signed certificate for the authentication. If a valid certificate is used, the MyCertificateValidationService is used to validate that it is also the correct certificate.</p>


  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;MyCertificateValidationService&gt;();

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCertificate(options =&gt;
    {
        // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/certauth
        options.AllowedCertificateTypes = CertificateTypes.SelfSigned;

        options.Events = new CertificateAuthenticationEvents
        {
            OnCertificateValidated = context =&gt;
            {
                var validationService = context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetService&lt;MyCertificateValidationService&gt;();

                if (validationService != null &amp;&amp; validationService.ValidateCertificate(context.ClientCertificate))
                {
                    var claims = new[]
                    {
                        new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, context.ClientCertificate.Subject, ClaimValueTypes.String, context.Options.ClaimsIssuer),
                        new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, context.ClientCertificate.Subject, ClaimValueTypes.String, context.Options.ClaimsIssuer)
                    };

                    context.Principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(new ClaimsIdentity(claims, context.Scheme.Name));
                    context.Success();
                }
                else
                {
                    context.Fail("invalid cert");
                }

                return Task.CompletedTask;
            }
        };
    });

builder.Host.UseSerilog((hostingContext, loggerConfiguration) =&gt; loggerConfiguration
    .ReadFrom.Configuration(hostingContext.Configuration)
    .Enrich.FromLogContext()
    .MinimumLevel.Debug()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.File(
        //$@"../certauth.txt",
        $@"D:\home\LogFiles\Application\{Environment.UserDomainName}.txt",
        fileSizeLimitBytes: 1_000_000,
        rollOnFileSizeLimit: true,
        shared: true,
        flushToDiskInterval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)));
  


<p>The middleware services are setup so that in development no authentication is used and the requests are validated using basic authentication. If the environment in not development, certificate authentication is used and all API calls require authorization. </p>


  var app = builder.Build();

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    app.MapControllers().RequireAuthorization();
}
else
{
    app.UseAuthorization();
    app.MapControllers();
}

app.Run();
  


<p>The MyCertificateValidationService validates the certificate. This checks if the certificate used has the correct thumbprint and is the same as the certificate used in the client application, in these case the Azure B2C API connector.</p>


  public class MyCertificateValidationService 
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;MyCertificateValidationService&gt; _logger;

	public MyCertificateValidationService(ILogger&lt;MyCertificateValidationService&gt; logger)
	{
		_logger = logger;
	}

	public bool ValidateCertificate(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
	{
		return CheckIfThumbprintIsValid(clientCertificate);
	}

	private bool CheckIfThumbprintIsValid(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
	{
		var listOfValidThumbprints = new List&lt;string&gt;
		{
			// add thumbprints of your allowed clients
			"15D118271F9AE7855778A2E6A00A575341D3D904"
		};

		if (listOfValidThumbprints.Contains(clientCertificate.Thumbprint))
		{
			_logger.LogInformation($"Custom auth-success for certificate  {clientCertificate.FriendlyName} {clientCertificate.Thumbprint}");

			return true;
		}

		_logger.LogWarning($"auth failed for certificate  {clientCertificate.FriendlyName} {clientCertificate.Thumbprint}");

		return false;
	}
}
  


<p>Setup Azure B2C API connector with certification authentication</p>



<p>The Azure B2C API connector is setup to use a certificate. You can create the certificate anyway you want. I used the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/CertificateManager/">CertificateManager</a> Nuget package to create a RSA 512 certificate with a 3072 key size. The thumbprint from this certificate needs to be validated in the ASP.NET Core API application.</p>







<p>The Azure B2C API connector is added to the Azure B2C user flow. The use flow requires all the custom claims to be defined and the values can be set in the API Connector service.

<p>You can create certificates using .NET Core using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/CertificateManager/">CertificateManager</a> Nuget package which provides some helper methods for creating the X509 certificates as required.</p>


  class Program
{
	static CreateCertificates _cc;
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
			.AddUserSecrets&lt;Program&gt;();
		var configuration = builder.Build();

		var sp = new ServiceCollection()
		   .AddCertificateManager()
		   .BuildServiceProvider();

		_cc = sp.GetService&lt;CreateCertificates&gt;();

		var rsaCert = CreateRsaCertificateSha512KeySize2048("localhost", 10);

		string password = configuration["certificateSecret"];
		var iec = sp.GetService&lt;ImportExportCertificate&gt;();

		var rsaCertPfxBytes = iec.ExportSelfSignedCertificatePfx(password, rsaCert);
		File.WriteAllBytes("cert_rsa512.pfx", rsaCertPfxBytes);

		Console.WriteLine("created");
	}

	public static X509Certificate2 CreateRsaCertificateSha512KeySize2048(string dnsName, int validityPeriodInYears)
	{
		var basicConstraints = new BasicConstraints
		{
			CertificateAuthority = false,
			HasPathLengthConstraint = false,
			PathLengthConstraint = 0,
			Critical = false
		};

		var subjectAlternativeName = new SubjectAlternativeName
		{
			DnsName = new List&lt;string&gt;
			{
				dnsName,
			}
		};

		var x509KeyUsageFlags = X509KeyUsageFlags.DigitalSignature;

		// only if certification authentication is used
		var enhancedKeyUsages = new OidCollection
		{
			OidLookup.ClientAuthentication,
			// OidLookup.ServerAuthentication 
			// OidLookup.CodeSigning,
			// OidLookup.SecureEmail,
			// OidLookup.TimeStamping  
		};

		var certificate = _cc.NewRsaSelfSignedCertificate(
			new DistinguishedName { CommonName = dnsName },
			basicConstraints,
			new ValidityPeriod
			{
				ValidFrom = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
				ValidTo = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddYears(validityPeriodInYears)
			},
			subjectAlternativeName,
			enhancedKeyUsages,
			x509KeyUsageFlags,
			new RsaConfiguration
			{ 
				KeySize = 3072,
				HashAlgorithmName = HashAlgorithmName.SHA512
			});

		return certificate;
	}
}
  


<p>Running the applications</p>



<p>I setup two user flows for running and testing the applications. One is using ngrok and local development with basic authentication. The second is using certification authentication and the deployed Azure App service. I published the API to the App service and run the UI application. When the user signs in, the API connector is used to get the extra custom claims from the deployed API and is returned.</p>

  <p>Updates to six major projects this week, plus finally some concrete progress towards Datasette 1.0.</p>
 Fixing Datasette's proxy bugs 
<p>Now that Datasette has had its fourth birthday I've decided to really push towards hitting <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/milestone/7">the 1.0 milestone</a>. The key property of that release will be a stable JSON API, stable plugin hooks and a stable, documented context for custom templates. There's quite a lot of mostly unexciting work needed to get there.</p>
<p>As I work through the issues in that milestone I'm encountering some that I filed more than two years ago!</p>
<p>Two of those made it into the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-59-3">Datasette 0.59.3</a> bug fix release earlier this week.</p>
<p>The majority of the work in that release though related to Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/settings.html#base-url">base_url feature</a>, designed to help people who run Datasette behind a proxy.</p>
<p><code>base_url</code> lets you run Datasette like this:</p>
 <code>datasette --setting base_url=/prefix/ fixtures.db
</code> 
<p>When you do this, Datasette will change its URLs to start with that prefix - so the hompage will live at <code>/prefix/</code>, the database index page at <code>/prefix/fixtures/</code>, tables at <code>/prefix/fixtures/facetable</code> etc.</p>
<p>The reason you would want this is if you are running a larger website, and you intend to proxy traffic to <code>/prefix/</code> to a separate Datasette instance.</p>
<p>The Datasette documentation includes <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#running-datasette-behind-a-proxy">suggested nginx and Apache configurations</a> for doing exactly that.</p>
<p>This feature has been <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues?q=is%3Aissue+base_url">a magnet for bugs</a> over the years! People keep finding new parts of the Datasette interface that fail to link to the correct pages when run in this mode.</p>
<p>The principle cause of these bugs is that I don't use Datasette in this way myself, so I wasn't testing it nearly as thoroughly as it needed.</p>
<p>So the first step in finally solving these issues once and for all was to get my own instance of Datasette up and running behind an Apache proxy.</p>
<p>Since I like to deploy live demos to Cloud Run, I decided to try and run Apache and Datasette in the same container. This took a lot of figuring out. You can follow my progress on this in these two issue threads:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1521">#1521: Docker configuration for exercising Datasette behind Apache mod_proxy</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1522">#1522: Deploy a live instance of demos/apache-proxy</a> 
 
<p>The short version: I got it working! My Docker implementation now lives in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/tree/0.59.3/demos/apache-proxy">demos/apache-proxy</a> directory and the live demo itself is deployed to <a href="https://datasette-apache-proxy-demo.fly.dev/prefix/">datasette-apache-proxy-demo.fly.dev/prefix/</a>.</p>
<p>(I ended up deploying it to <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly</a> after running into a bug when deployed to Cloud Run that I couldn't replicate on my own laptop.)</p>
<p>My final implementation uses a Debian base container with Supervisord to manage the two processes.</p>
<p>With a working live environment, I was finally able to track down the root cause of the bugs. My notes on
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1519">#1519: base_url is omitted in JSON and CSV views</a> document how I found and solved them, and updated the associated test to hopefully avoid them ever coming back in the future.</p>
 The big Datasette table refactor 
<p>The single most complicated part of the Datasette codebase is the code behind the table view - the page that lets you browse, facet, search, filter and paginate through the contents of a table (<a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties">this page here</a>).</p>
<p>It's got very thorough tests, but the actual implementation is mostly <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/main/datasette/views/table.py#L303-L992">a 600 line class method</a>.</p>
<p>It was already difficult to work with, but the changes I want to make for Datasette 1.0 have proven too much for it. I need to refactor.</p>
<p>Apart from making that view easier to change and maintain, a major goal I have is for it to support a much more flexible JSON syntax. I want the JSON version to default to just returning minimal information about the table, then allow <code>?_extra=x</code> parameters to opt into additional information - like facets, suggested facets, full counts, SQL schema information and so on.</p>
<p>This means I want to break up that 600 line method into a bunch of separate methods, each of which can be opted-in-to by the calling code.</p>
<p>The HTML interface should then build on top of the JSON, requesting the extras that it knows it will need and passing the resulting data through to the template. This helps solve the challenge of having a stable template context that I can document in advance of Datasette 1.0</p>
<p>I've been putting this off for over a year now, because it's a lot of work. But no longer! This week I finally started to get stuck in.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'll stick with it, but my initial attempt at this is a little unconventional. Inspired by how <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html#back-to-fixtures">pytest fixtures work</a> I'm experimenting with a form of dependency injection, in a new (very alpha) library I've released called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asyncinject">asyncinject</a>.</p>
<p>The key idea behind <code>asyncinject</code> is to provide a way for class methods to indicate their dependencies as named parameters, in the same way as pytest fixtures do.</p>
<p>When you call a method, the code can spot which dependencies have not yet been resolved and execute them before executing the method.</p>
<p>Crucially, since they are all <code>async def</code> methods they can be executed in parallel. I'm cautiously excited about this - Datasette has a bunch of opportunities for parallel queries - fetching a single page of table rows, calculating a <code>count(*)</code> for the entire table, executing requested facets and calculating suggested facets are all queries that could potentially run in parallel rather than in serial.</p>
<p>What about the GIL, you might ask? Datasette's database queries are handled by the <code>sqlite3</code> module, and that module releases the GIL once it gets into SQLite C code. So theoretically I should be able to use more than one core for this all.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asyncinject/blob/0.2a0/README.md">asyncinject README</a> has more details, including code examples. This may turn out to be a terrible idea! But it's really fun to explore, and I'll be able to tell for sure if this is a useful, maintainable and performant approach once I have Datasette's table view running on top of it.</p>
 git-history and sqlite-utils 
<p>I made some big improvements to my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history">git-history</a> tool, which automates the process of turning a JSON (or other) file that has been version-tracked in a GitHub repository (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping</a>) into a SQLite database that can be used to explore changes to it over time.</p>
<p>The biggest was a major change to the database schema. Previously, the tool used full Git SHA hashes as foreign keys in the largest table.</p>
<p>The problem here is that a SHA hash string is 40 characters long, and if they are being used as a foreign key that's a LOT of extra weight added to the largest table.</p>
<p><code>sqlite-utils</code> has a <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-lookup-tables">table.lookup() method</a> which is designed to make creating "lookup" tables - where a string is stored in a unique column but an integer ID can be used for things like foreign keys - as easy as possible.</p>
<p>That method was previously quite limited, but in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-18">sqlite-utils 3.18</a> and <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-19">3.19</a> - both released this week - I expanded it to cover the more advanced needs of my <code>git-history</code> tool.</p>
<p>The great thing about building stuff on top of your own libraries is that you can discover new features that you need along the way - and then ship them promptly without them blocking your progress!</p>
 Some other highlights 
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/releases/tag/0.6">s3-credentials 0.6</a> adds a <code>--dry-run</code> option that you can use to show what the tool would do without making any actual changes to your AWS account. I found myself wanting this while continuing to work on the ability to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/12">specify a folder prefix</a> within S3 that the bucket credentials should be limited to. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-vercel/releases/tag/0.12">datasette-publish-vercel 0.12</a> applies some pull requests from Romain Clement that I had left unreviewed for far too long, and adds the ability to customize the <code>vercel.json</code> file used for the deployment - useful for things like setting up additional custom redirects. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/2.0">datasette-graphql 2.0</a> updates that plugin to <a href="https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/wiki/v3-release-notes">Graphene 3.0</a>, a major update to that library. I had to break backwards compatiblity in very minor ways, hence the 2.0 version number. 
 
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite/releases/tag/1.3">csvs-to-sqlite 1.3</a> is the first relase of that tool in just over a year. William Rowell contributed a new feature that allows you to populate "fixed" database columns on your imported records, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite/pull/81">PR #81</a> for details.

<p>A Reader’s&nbsp;Guide</p><p>How should crypto be regulated? And by whom? These are the big questions the industry is grappling with in the wake of the infrastructure bill being signed with the haphazardly expanded definition of a broker dealer for tax reporting provisions. So now the industry is *atwitter* with ideas about where to go from&nbsp;here.</p><p>Three large companies have all come out with policy suggestions: FTX, Coinbase and and A16z. While these proposals differ in approach, they all seek to address a few central policy questions. I’ll break down the proposals based on key subject&nbsp;areas:</p><p>Consumer Protection</p><p>A16: Suggests a framework for DAO’s to provide disclosures.</p><p>Coinbase: Sets a goal to “​​Enhance transparency through appropriate disclosure requirements. Protect against fraud and market manipulation”</p><p>FTX: Similarly suggests framework for “disclosure and transparency standards”</p><p>All three of these make ample mention of consumer protections that seem to begin and end at disclosures. Regulators might want something with a little more teeth. FTX provides a more robust outline for combating fraud, suggesting the use of on-chain analytics tools. This is a smart and concrete suggestion of how to improve existing regulation that relies on SARS reports filed AFTER suspicious activity.</p><p>Exactly how Decentralized?</p><p>A16: Seeks to create a definition and entity status for DAO’s, which would ostensibly require a different kind of regulation than more custodial services.</p><p>Coinbase: ​Platforms and services that do not custody or otherwise control the assets of a customer — including miners, stakers and developers — would need to be treated differently</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t mention decentralization.</p><p>These are really varied approaches. I’m not criticizing FTX here, they are focusing on consumer protections and combating fraud which are good things to highlight. However the core regulatory issues is- can we differentiate between decentralized and centralized products and does that create a fundamentally conflict with existing law. A16z’s approach is novel, a new designation without a new&nbsp;agency.</p><p>The Devil You Know vs The Devil you&nbsp;Don’t</p><p>A16- Suggests the Government Office of Accountability “assess the current state of regulatory jurisdiction over cryptocurrency, digital assets, and decentralized technology, and to compare the costs and benefits of harmonizing jurisdiction among agencies against vesting supervision and oversight with a federally chartered self-regulatory organization or one or more nonprofit corporations.”</p><p>Coinbase- Argues that this technology needs a new regulatory agency and that all digital assets should be under a single regulatory authority. Also suggests coordination with a Self Regulatory Organization.</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t step into that&nbsp;morass.</p><p>Coinbase has the most aggressive position here. I personally am not convinced of the need for a new regulatory agency. We haven’t tried it the old fashioned way yet, where existing agencies offer clarity about what would bring a digital asset into their jurisdiction and what would exclude it. Creating a new agency is a slow and expensive process. And then that agency would need to justify its existence by aggressively cracking down. It’s a bit like creating a hammer and then inevitably complaining that it sees everything as a&nbsp;nail.</p><p>How to achieve regulatory change in the US for&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Stop tweeting aggressively at the people who regulate you. Negative points if you are a billionaire complaining about&nbsp;taxes.  Spend some time developing relationships with policymakers and working collaboratively with communities you want to support. Lotta talk of unbanked communities- any stats on how they are being served by this tech? (Seriously please&nbsp;share)  Consider looking at who is already doing the work you want to accelerate and consider working with them/learning from and supporting existing efforts rather than whipping out your proposal and demanding attention. Examples: CoinCenter, Blockchain Association. At the state level: <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">Blockchain Advocacy Coalition </a>of course, Cascadia Blockchain Council, Texas Blockchain Council&nbsp;etc.  <p>A16: <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9">https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9</a></p><p>Coinbase: <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86">https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86</a>c</p><p>FTX: <a href="https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/">https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/</a></p>

  <p>Summary:      The hype over NFTs and collectibles is blinding us to their true usefulness as trustworthy persistent data objects. How do they sit in the landscape with verifiable credentials and picos?</p>




<p>
    Listening to this <a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/87?t=0">Reality 2.0 podcast about NFTs</a> with <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a>, <a href="https://katherinedruckman.com">Katherine Druckman</a>, and their guest <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/users/greg-bledsoe">Greg Bledsoe</a> got me thinking about NFTs. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/03/what_we_learn_about_self-sovereignty_from_cryptokitties.shtml">I first wrote about NFTs</a> in 2018 regarding what was perhaps the first popular NFT: Cryptokitties. I bought a few and played with them, examined the contract code, and was thinking about how they might enable self-sovereignty, or not. I wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>[E]ach kitty has some interesting properties:</p>
     
         Each Kitty is distinguishable from all the rest and has a unique identity and existence 
         Each kitty is owned by someone. Specifically, it is controlled by whoever has the private keys associated with the address that the kitty is tied to. 
     
</blockquote>
<p>
    This is a good description of the properties of NFTs in general. Notice that nothing here says that NFTs have to be about art, or collectibles, although that's the primary use case right now that's generating so much hype. Cryptokitties were more interesting than most of the NFT use cases right now because the smart contract allowed them to be remixed to produce new kitties (for a fee).
</p>

<p>
    Suppose I rewrote the quote from my post on Cryptokitties like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[E]ach verifiable credential (VC) has some interesting properties:</p>
     
         Each VC is distinguishable from all the rest and has a unique identity and existence 
         Each VC is owned by someone. Specifically, it is controlled by whoever has the private keys associated with the address that the VC was issued to. 
     
</blockquote>
<p>
    Interesting, no? So, if these properties are true for both NFTs and verifiable credentials, what's the difference? The primary difference is that right now, we envision VC issuers to be institutions, like the DMV, your bank, or employer. And institutions are centralized. In contrast, because NFTs are created using a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, we think of them as decentralized. But, not so fast. As I noted in my post on Cryptokitties, you can't assume an NFT is decentralized without examining the smart contract. 
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>There is one problem with CryptoKitties as a model of self-sovereignty: the CryptoKitty smart contract has a "pause" function that can be executed by certain addresses. This is probably a protection against bugs—no one wants to be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">theDAO</a>—but it does provide someone besides the owner with a way to shut it all down.</p>
    <p>I have no idea who that someone is and can't hold them responsible for their behavior—I'd guess it's someone connected with CryptoKitties. Whoever has control of these special addresses could shutdown the entire enterprise. I do not believe, based on the contract structure, that they could take away individual kitties; it's an all or nothing proposition. Since they charged money for setting this up, there's likely some contract law that could be used for recourse. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    So, without looking at the code for the smart contract, it's hard to say that a particular NFT is decentralized or not. They may be just as centralized as your bank1.  
</p>

<p>
    To examine this more closely, let's look at a property title, like a car title, as an example. The DMV could decide to issue car titles as verifiable credentials tomorrow. And the infrastructure to support it is all there: well-supported open source code, companies to provide issuing software and wallets, and specifications and protocols for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/10/ugh_theres_an_app_for_that.shtml">interoperability</a>2. Nothing has to change politically for that to happen. 
</p>

<p>
    The DMV could also issue car titles as NFTs. With an NFT, I'd prove I own the car by exercising control over the private key that controls the NFT representing the car title. The state might do this to provide more automation for car transfers.  Here too, they'd have to find an infrastructure provider to help them, ensure they had a usable wallet to store the title, and interact with the smart contract. I don't know how interoperable this would be.
</p>

<p>
    One of the key features of an NFT is that they can be transfered between owners or controllers. Verifiable credentials, because of their core use cases are not designed to be transferred, rather they are revoked and reissued.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose I want to sell the car. With a verifiable credential, the state would still be there, revoking the VC representing my title to the car and issuing a new VC to the buyer when the title transfers. The record of who owns what is still the database at the DMV. With NFTs we can get rid of that database. So, selling my car now becomes something that might happen in a decentralized way, without the state as an intermediary. Note that they could do this and still retain a regulatory interest in car titling if they control the smart contract.
</p>

<p>
    But, the real value of issuing a car title as an NFT would be if it were done using a smart contract in a way that decentralized car titles. If you imagine a world of self-driving cars that own and sell themselves, then that's interesting.  You could also imagine that we want to remove the DMV from the business of titling cars altogether. That's a big political lift, but if you dream of a world with much smaller government, then NFT-based car titles might be a way to do that. But I think it's a ways off. So, we could use NFTs for car titles, but right now there's not much point besides the automation.  
</p>

<p>
    You can also imagine a much more decentralized future for verifiable credentials. There's no reason a smart contract couldn't issue and revoke verifiable credentials according to rules embodied in the code. Sphereon has an <a href="https://sphereon.com/solution/integration-of-verifiable-credentials-for-daml-workflows/">integration between</a> verifiable credentials and the <a href="https://github.com/digital-asset/daml#readme">Digital Assets Markup Language (DAML)</a>, a smart contract language. Again, how decentralized the application is depends on the smart contract, but decentralized, institution-independent verifiable credentials are possible. 
</p>

<p>
    A decade ago, Lucas, Ballay, and McManus wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008SGNFJQ/windleyofente-20">Trillions: Thriving in the Emerging Information Ecology</a>. One of the ideas they talked about was something they called a persistent data object (PDO). I was <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2012/12/programing_the_cloud_with_persistent_data_objects.shtml">intrigued by persistent data objects</a> because of the work we'd been doing at Kynetx on personal clouds. In applying the idea of PDOs, I quickly realized that what we were doing was much more than data because our persistent data objects also encapsulated code and the name <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/ten_reasons_to_use_picos_for_your_next_decentralized_programming_project.shtml">persistent compute objects, or picos</a> was born.
</p>

<p>
    An NFT is one possible realization of Trillion's PDOs. So are verifiable credentials. Both are <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">persistent containers for data</a>. They are both <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X20303067">capable of inspiring confidence</a> that the data they contain has <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">fidelity and, perhaps, a trustworthy provenance</a>. A pico is an agent. Picos can:
    </p> 
         have a wallet that holds and exchanges NFTs and credentials according to the rules encapsulated in the pico.  
         be programmed to interact with the smart contract for an NFT to perform the legal operations. 
         be programmed to receive, hold, and present verifiable credentials according to the proper <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDCommm protocols</a>.3  
     
<p></p>


	<a></a>
	Relationship between NFTs, verifiable credentials, and picos (click to enlarge)


<p>
    NFTs are currently in their awkward, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com">Pets.com</a> stage. Way too much hype and many myopic use cases. But I think they'll grow to have valuable uses in creating more decentralized, trustworthy data objects. If you listen to the reality 2.0 podcast starting about <a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/87?t=3350">56 minutes</a>, Greg, Katherine, and Doc get into some of those. Greg's starting with games—a good place, I think. Supply chain is another promising area. If you need decentralized, automated, trustworthy, persistent data containers, then NFTs fit the bill. 
</p>

<p>
    People who live in a country with a strong commitment to the rule of law, might ask why decentralizing things like titles and supply chains is a good idea. But that's not everyone's reality. Blockchains and NFTs can inspire confidence in systems that would otherwise be too costly or untrustworthy otherwise. Picos are a great way to create distributed systems of entity-oriented compute nodes that are capable of using PDOs. 
</p>


 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Note that I'm not saying that Cryptokitties is as centralized as your bank. Just that without looking at the code, you can't tell.  
     Yeah, I know that interop is still a work in progress. But at least it's in progress, not ignored. 
     These are not capabilities that picos presently have, but they do support DIDComm messaging. Want to help add these to picos? Contact me.

    Suppose Peggy needs to prove to Victor that she is in possession of a secret without revealing the secret. Can she do so in a way that convinces Victor that she really does know the secret? This is the question at the heart of one of the most powerful cryptographic processes we can employ in identity systems: zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Suppose for example that Peggy has a digital driver's license and wants to prove to Victor, the bartender, that she's over 21 without just handing over her driver's license or even showing him her birthdate. ZKPs allow Peggy to prove her driver's license says she's at least 21 in a way that convinces Victor without Peggy having to reveal anything else (i.e., there's zero excess knowledge).
</p>

<p>
    This problem was first explored by MIT researchers Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali and Charles Rackoff in the 1980s as a way of combatting information leakage. The goal is to reduce the amount of extra information the verifier, Victor, can learn about the prover, Peggy.
</p>

<p>
    One way to understand how ZKPs work is the story of the Cave of Alibaba, first published by cryptographers Quisquater, Guillou, and Berson1.  The following diagram provides an illustration.
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Peggy and Victor in Alibaba's Cave (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The Cave of Alibaba has two passages, labeled A and B, that split off a single passageway connected to the entrance. Peggy possesses a secret code that allows her to unlock a door connecting A and B. Victor wants to buy the code but won't pay until he's sure Peggy knows it. Peggy won't share it with Victor until he pays.</p>

<p>
    The algorithm for Peggy proving she knows the code proceeds as follows:
</p>
 
     Victor stands outside the cave while Peggy enters and selects one of the passages. Victor is not allowed to see which path Peggy takes.  
     Victor enters the cave and calls out "A" or "B" at random. 
     Peggy emerges from the correct passageway because she can easily unlock the door regardless of which choice she made when entering. 
     Of course, Peggy could have just gotten lucky and guessed right, so Peggy and Victor repeat the experiment many times.  
 

<p>
    If Peggy can always come back by whichever passageway Victor selects, then there is an increasing probability that Peggy really knows the code. After 20 tries, there's less than one chance in a million that Peggy is simply guessing which letter Victor will call. This constitutes a probabilistic proof that Peggy knows the secret.
</p>

<p>
    This algorithm not only allows Peggy to convince Victor she knows the code, but it does it in a way that ensures Victor can't convince anyone else Peggy knows the code. Suppose Victor records the entire transaction. The only thing an observer sees is Victor calling out letters and Peggy emerging from the right tunnel. The observer can't be sure Victor and Peggy didn't agree on a sequence of letters in advance to fool observers. Note that this property relies on the algorithm using a good pseudo-random number generator with a high-entropy seed so that Peggy and third-party observers can't predict Victor's choices. 
</p>

<p>
    Thus, while Peggy cannot deny to Victor that she knows the secret, she can deny that she knows the secret to other third parties. This ensures that anything she proves to Victor stays between them and Victor cannot leak it—at least in a cryptographic way that proves it came from Peggy. Peggy retains control of both her secret and the fact that she knows it.
</p>

<p>
    When we say "zero knowledge" and talk about Victor learning nothing beyond the proposition in question, that's not perfectly true. In the cave of Alibaba, Peggy proves in zero knowledge that she knows the secret. But there are many other things that Victor learns about Peggy that ZKPs can do nothing about. For example, Victor knows that Peggy can hear him, speaks his language, walk, and is cooperative. He also might learn things about the cave, like approximately how long it takes to unlock the door. Peggy learns similar things about Victor. So, the reality is that the proof is approximately zero knowledge not perfectly zero knowledge.
</p>

<a></a>
 ZKP Systems 

<p>
    The example of Alibaba's Cave is a very specific use of ZKPs, what's called a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge. Peggy is proving she knows (or possesses something). More generally, Peggy might want to prove many facts to Victor. These could include propositional phrases or even values. ZKPs can do that as well.
</p>

<p>
    To understand how we can prove propositions in zero knowledge, consider a different example, sometimes called the Socialist Millionaire Problem. Suppose Peggy and Victor want to know if they're being paid a fair wage. Specifically, they want to know whether they are paid the same amount, but don't want to disclose their specific hourly rate to each other or even a trusted third party. In this instance, Peggy isn't proving she knows a secret, rather, she's proving an equality (or inequality) proposition.
</p>

<p>
    For simplicity, assume that Peggy and Victor are being paid one of $10, $20, $30, or $40 per hour. The algorithm works like this:
</p>
 
     Peggy buys four lock boxes and labels them $10, $20, $30, and $40.  
     She throws away the keys to every box except the one labeled with her wage.  
     Peggy gives all the locked boxes to Victor who privately puts a slip of paper with a "+" into the slot at the top of the box labeled with his salary. He puts a slip with a "-" in all the other boxes.  
     Victor gives the boxes back to Peggy who uses her key in private to open the box with her salary on it.  
     If she finds a "+" then they make the same amount. Otherwise, they make a different amount. She can use this to prove the fact to Victor. 
 

<p>
    This is called an oblivious transfer and proves the proposition <code>VictorSalary = PeggySalary</code> true or false in zero knowledge (i.e., without revealing any other information).
</p>

<p>
    For this to work, Peggy and Victor must trust that the other will be forthcoming and state their real salary. Victor needs to trust that Peggy will throw away the three other keys. Peggy must trust that Victor will put only one slip with a "+" on it in the boxes.
</p>

<p> 
    Just like digital certificates need a PKI to establish confidence beyond what would be possible with self-issued certificates alone, ZKPs are more powerful in a system that allows Peggy and Victor to prove facts from things others say about them, not just what they say about themselves. For example, rather than Peggy and Victor self-asserting their salary, suppose they could rely on a signed document from the HR department in making their assertion so that both know that the other is stating their true salary. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml?utm_campaign=Technometria&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Verifiable Credentials</a> provide a system for using ZKPs to prove many different facts alone or in concert, in ways that give confidence in the method and trust in the data.
</p>

<a></a>
 Non-Interactive ZKPs 

<p>
    In the previous examples, Peggy was able to prove things to Victor through a series of interactions. For ZKPs to be practical, interactions between the prover and the verifier should be minimal. Fortunately, a technique called SNARK allows for non-interactive zero knowledge proofs.
</p>

<p>
    SNARKs have the following properties (from whence they derive their name):
</p>
 
     Succinct: the sizes of the messages are small compared to the length of the actual proof. 
     Non-interactive: other than some setup, the prover sends only one message to the verifier.  
     ARguments: this is really an argument that something is correct, not a proof as we understand it mathematically. Specifically, the prover theoretically could prove false statements given enough computational power. So, SNARKs are "computationally sound" rather than "perfectly sound".  
     of Knowledge: the prover knows the fact in question.   
 

<p>
    You'll typically see "zk" (for zero-knowledge) tacked on the front to indicate that during this process, the verifier learns nothing other than the facts being proved.
</p>

<p>
    The mathematics underlying zkSNARKs involves homomorphic computation over high-degree polynomials. But we can understand how zkSNARKs work without knowing the underlying mathematics that ensures that they're sound. If you'd like more details of the mathematics, I recommend <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/"> Christian Reitwiessner's "zkSNARKs in a Nutshell"</a>.
</p>

<p>
As a simple example, suppose Victor is given a <code>sha256</code> hash, <code>H</code>, of some value. Peggy wants to prove that she knows a value <code>s</code> such that <code>sha265(s) == H</code> without revealing <code>s</code> to Victor.  We can define a function <code>C</code> that captures the relationship:
</p>

 C(x, w) = ( sha256(w) == x )
 

<p>
    So, <code>C(H, s) == true</code>, while other values for <code>w</code> will return <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Computing a zkSNARK requires three functions <code>G</code>, <code>P</code>, and <code>V</code>. <code>G</code> is the key generator that takes a secret parameter called <code>lambda</code> and the function <code>C</code> and generates two public keys, the proving key <code>pk</code> and the verification key <code>vk</code>. They need only be generated once for a given function <code>C</code>. The parameter <code>lambda</code> must be destroyed after this step since it is not needed again and anyone who has it can generate fake proofs.
</p>

<p>
    The prover function <code>P</code> takes as input the proving key <code>pk</code>, a public input <code>x</code>, and a private (secret) witness <code>w</code>. The result of executing <code>P(pk,x,w)</code> is a proof, <code>prf</code>, that the prover knows a value for <code>w</code> that satisfies <code>C</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The verifier function <code>V</code> computes <code>V(vk, x, prf)</code> which is true if the proof <code>prf</code> is correct and false otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    Returning to Peggy and Victor, Victor chooses a function <code>C</code> representing what he wants Peggy to prove, creates a random number <code>lambda</code>, and runs <code>G</code> to generate the proving and verification keys:
</p>

 (pk, vk) = G(C, lambda)
 

<p>
    Peggy must not learn the value of <code>lambda</code>. Victor shares <code>C</code>, <code>pk</code>, and <code>vk</code> with Peggy.
</p>

<p>
    Peggy wants to prove she knows the value <code>s</code> that satisfies <code>C</code> for <code>x = H</code>. She runs the proving function <code>P</code> using these values as inputs:
</p>
 prf = P(pk, H, s)
 

<p>
    Peggy presents the proof <code>prf</code> to Victor who runs the verification function:
</p>
 V(vk, H, prf)
 

<p>
    If the result is true, then the Victor can be assured that Peggy knows the value <code>s</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The function <code>C</code> does not need to be limited to a hash as we did in this example. Within limits of the underlying mathematics, <code>C</code> can be quite complicated and involve any number of values that Victor would like Peggy to prove, all at one time.
</p>

<p>Setup the Azure B2C App Registration</p>



<p>An Azure App registration is setup for the ASP.NET Core Razor page application. A client secret is used to authenticate the client. The redirect URI is added for the app. This is a standard implementation. </p>







<p>Setup the API connector</p>



<p>The API connector is setup to add the extra claims after a sign in. This defines the API endpoint and the authentication method. Only Basic or certificate authentication is possible for this API service. Both of these are not ideal for implementing and using this service to add extra claims to the identity. I started <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok </a>using the cmd and used the URL from this to configure Azure B2C API connector. Maybe two separate connectors could be setup for a solution, one like this for development and a second one with the Azure App service host address and certificate authentication used.</p>







<p>Azure B2C user attribute</p>



<p>The custom claims are added to the Azure B2C user attributes. The custom claims can be add as required.</p>







<p>Setup to Azure B2C user flow</p>



<p>The Azure B2C user flow is configured to used the API connector. This flow adds the application claims to the token which it receives from the API call used in the API connector.</p>







<p>The custom claims are added then using the application claims blade. This is required if the custom claims are to be added.</p>







<p>I also added the custom claims  to the Azure B2C user flow user attributes.</p>







<p>Azure B2C is now setup to use the custom claims and the data for these claims will be set used the API connector service. </p>



<p>ASP.NET Core Razor Page </p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core Razor Page uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to authenticate using Azure B2C. This is a standard setup for a B2C user flow.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAdB2C"));

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.FallbackPolicy = options.DefaultPolicy;
});
builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

var app = builder.Build();

JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
  


<p>The main difference between an Azure B2C user flow and an Azure AD authentication is the configuration. The SignUpSignInPolicyId is set to match the configured Azure B2C user flow and the Instance uses the b2clogin from the domain unlike the AAD configuration definition.</p>


  "AzureAdB2C": {
	"Instance": "https://b2cdamienbod.b2clogin.com",
	"ClientId": "ab393e93-e762-4108-a3f5-326cf8e3874b",
	"Domain": "b2cdamienbod.onmicrosoft.com",
	"SignUpSignInPolicyId": "B2C_1_ExtraClaims",
	"TenantId": "f611d805-cf72-446f-9a7f-68f2746e4724",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	//"ClientSecret": "--in-user-settings--"
},
  


<p>The index Razor page returns the claims and displays the values in the UI.</p>


  public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
	[BindProperty]
	public IEnumerable&lt;Claim&gt; Claims { get; set; } = Enumerable.Empty&lt;Claim&gt;();

	public void OnGet()
	{
		Claims = User.Claims;
	}
}
  


<p>This is all the end user application requires, there is no special setup here.</p>



<p>ASP.NET Core API connector implementation</p>



<p>The API implemented for the Azure API connector uses a HTTP Post. Basic authentication is used to validate the request as well as the client ID which needs to match the configured App registration. This is weak authentication and should not be used in production especially since the API provides sensitive PII data. If the request provides the correct credentials and the correct client ID,  the data is returned for the email. In this demo, the email is returned in the custom claim. Normal the data would be returned using some data store or whatever.</p>


  [HttpPost]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; PostAsync()
{
	// Check HTTP basic authorization
	if (!IsAuthorized(Request))
	{
		_logger.LogWarning("HTTP basic authentication validation failed.");
		return Unauthorized();
	}

	string content = await new System.IO.StreamReader(Request.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
	var requestConnector = JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;RequestConnector&gt;(content);

	// If input data is null, show block page
	if (requestConnector == null)
	{
		return BadRequest(new ResponseContent("ShowBlockPage", "There was a problem with your request."));
	}

	string clientId = _configuration["AzureAdB2C:ClientId"];
	if (!clientId.Equals(requestConnector.ClientId))
	{
		_logger.LogWarning("HTTP clientId is not authorized.");
		return Unauthorized();
	}

	// If email claim not found, show block page. Email is required and sent by default.
	if (requestConnector.Email == null || requestConnector.Email == "" || requestConnector.Email.Contains("@") == false)
	{
		return BadRequest(new ResponseContent("ShowBlockPage", "Email name is mandatory."));
	}

	var result = new ResponseContent
	{
		// use the objectId of the email to get the user specfic claims
		MyCustomClaim = $"everything awesome {requestConnector.Email}"
	};

	return Ok(result);
}

private bool IsAuthorized(HttpRequest req)
{
	string username = _configuration["BasicAuthUsername"];
	string password = _configuration["BasicAuthPassword"];

	// Check if the HTTP Authorization header exist
	if (!req.Headers.ContainsKey("Authorization"))
	{
		_logger.LogWarning("Missing HTTP basic authentication header.");
		return false;
	}

	// Read the authorization header
	var auth = req.Headers["Authorization"].ToString();

	// Ensure the type of the authorization header id `Basic`
	if (!auth.StartsWith("Basic "))
	{
		_logger.LogWarning("HTTP basic authentication header must start with 'Basic '.");
		return false;
	}

	// Get the the HTTP basinc authorization credentials
	var cred = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(auth.Substring(6))).Split(':');

	// Evaluate the credentials and return the result
	return (cred[0] == username &amp;&amp; cred[1] == password);
}
  


<p>The ResponseContent class is used to return the data for the identity. All custom claims must be prefixed with the extension_ The data is then added to the profile data.</p>


  public class ResponseContent
{
	public const string ApiVersion = "1.0.0";

	public ResponseContent()
	{
		Version = ApiVersion;
		Action = "Continue";
	}

	public ResponseContent(string action, string userMessage)
	{
		Version = ApiVersion;
		Action = action;
		UserMessage = userMessage;
		if (action == "ValidationError")
		{
			Status = "400";
		}
	}

	[JsonPropertyName("version")]
	public string Version { get; }

	[JsonPropertyName("action")]
	public string Action { get; set; }

	[JsonPropertyName("userMessage")]
	public string? UserMessage { get; set; }

	[JsonPropertyName("status")]
	public string? Status { get; set; }

	[JsonPropertyName("extension_MyCustomClaim")]
	public string MyCustomClaim { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
}
  


<p>With this, custom claims can be added to Azure B2C identities. This can be really useful when for example implementing verifiable credentials using id_tokens. This is much more complicated to implement compared to other IDPs but at least it is possible and can be solved. The technical solution to secure the API has room for improvements.</p>



<p>Testing</p>



<p>The applications can be started and the API connector needs to be mapped to a public IP. After starting the apps, start ngrok with a matching configuration for the HTTP address of the API connector API.</p>


  ngrok http https://localhost:5002
  


<p>This URL in the API connector configured on Azure needs to match this ngrok URL. all good, the applications will run and the custom claim will be displayed in the UI.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>The profile data in this API is very sensitive and you should use maximal security protections which are possible. Using Basic authentication alone for this type of API is not a good idea. It would be great to see managed identities supported or something like this. I used basic authentication so that I could use ngrok to demo the feature, we need a public endpoint for testing. I would not use this in a productive deployment. I would use certificate authentication with an Azure App service deployment and the certificate created and deployed using Azure Key Vault. Certificate rotation would have to be setup. I am not sure how good API connector infrastructure automation can be implemented, I have not tried this yet. A separate security solution would need to be implemented for local development. This is all a bit messy as all these extra steps end up in costs or developers taking short cuts and deploying with less security. </p>

  <p>My main project this week was a 90 minute workshop I delivered about Git scraping at <a href="https://escoladedados.org/coda2021/">Coda.Br 2021</a>, a Brazilian data journalism conference, on Friday. This inspired the creation of a brand new tool, git-history, plus smaller improvements to a range of other projects.</p>
 git-history 
<p>I still need to do a detailed write-up of this one (update: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/15/weeknotes-git-history/">git-history: a tool for analyzing scraped data collected using Git and SQLite</a>), but on Thursday I released a brand new tool called <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">git-history</a>, which I describe as "tools for analyzing Git history using SQLite".</p>
<p>This tool is the missing link in the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping pattern</a> I described here last October.</p>
<p>Git scraping is the technique of regularly scraping an online source of information and writing the results to a file in a Git repository... which automatically gives you a full revision history of changes made to that data source over time.</p>
<p>The missing piece has always been what to do next: how do you turn a commit history of changes to a JSON or CSV file into a data source that can be used to answer questions about how that file changed over time?</p>
<p>I've written one-off Python scripts for this a few times (here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/blob/6f6bcb9437c0d44c4bcf94c111c631cc50bc2744/build_database.py">my CDC vaccinations one</a>, for example), but giving an interactive workshop about the technique finally inspired me to build a tool to help.</p>
<p>The tool has <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">a comprehensive README</a>, but the short version is that you can take a JSON (or CSV) file in a repository that has been tracking changes to some items over time and run the following to load all of the different versions into a SQLite database file for analysis with <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>:</p>
 <code>git-convert file incidents.db incidents.json --id IncidentID
</code> 
<p>This assumes that <code>incidents.json</code> contains a JSON array of incidents (reported fires for example) and that each incident has a <code>IncidentID</code> identifier key. It will then loop through the Git history of that file right from the start, creating an <code>item_versions</code> table that tracks every change made to each of those items - using <code>IncidentID</code> to decide if a row represents a new incident or an update to a previous one.</p>
<p>I have a few more improvements I want to make before I start more widely promoting this, but it's already really useful. I've had a lot of fun running it against example repos from the <a href="https://github.com/topics/git-scraping">git-scraping GitHub topic</a> (now at 202 repos and counting).</p>
 Workshop: Raspando dados com o GitHub Actions e analisando com Datasette 
<p>The workshop I gave at the conference was live-translated into Portuguese, which is really exciting! I'm looking forward to watching the video when it comes out and seeing how well that worked.</p>
<p>The title translates to "Scraping data with GitHub Actions and analyzing with Datasette", and it was the first time I've given a workshop that combines Git scraping and Datasette - hence the development of the new git-history tool to help tie the two together.</p>
<p>I think it went really well. I put together four detailed exercises for the attendees, and then worked through each one live with the goal of attendees working through them at the same time - a method I learned from the Carpentries training course I took <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/26/weeknotes-software-carpentry-sqlite/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Four exercises turns out to be exactly right for 90 minutes, with reasonable time for an introduction and some extra material and questions at the end.</p>
<p>The worst part of running a workshop is inevitably the part where you try and get everyone setup with a functional development environment on their own machines (see <a href="https://xkcd.com/1987/">XKCD 1987</a>). This time round I skipped that entirely by encouraging my students to use <a href="https://gitpod.io/">GitPod</a>, which provides free browser-based cloud development environments running Linux, with a browser-embedded VS Code editor and terminal running on top.</p>

<p></p>

<p>(It's similar to <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>, but Codespaces is not yet available to free customers outside of the beta.)</p>
<p>I demonstrated all of the exercises using GitPod myself during the workshop, and ensured that they could be entirely completed through that environment, with no laptop software needed at all.</p>
<p>This worked so well. Not having to worry about development environments makes workshops massively more productive. I will absolutely be doing this again in the future.</p>
<p>The workshop exercises are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TCatZP5gQNfFjZJ5M77wMlf9u_05Z3BZnjp6t1SA6UU/edit">in this Google Doc</a>, and I hope to extract some of them out into official tutorials for various tools later on.</p>
 Datasette 0.58.2 
<p>Yesterday was Datasette's fourth birthday - the four year anniversary of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Nov/13/datasette/">the initial release announcement</a>! I celebrated by releasing a minor bug-fix, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.59.2">Datasette 0.58.2</a>, the release notes for which are quoted below:</p>
 
 Column names with a leading underscore now work correctly when used as a facet. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1506">#1506</a>) 
 Applying <code>?_nocol=</code> to a column no longer removes that column from the filtering interface. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1503">#1503</a>) 
 Official Datasette Docker container now uses Debian Bullseye as the base image. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1497">#1497</a>) 
 
<p>That first change was inspired by ongoing work on <code>git-history</code>, where I decided to use a <code>_id</code> underscoper prefix pattern for columns that were reserved for use by that tool in order <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/issues/14">to avoid clashing with column names</a> in the provided source data.</p>
 sqlite-utils 3.18 
<p>Today I released <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-18">sqlite-utils 3.18</a> - initially also to provide a feature I wanted for <code>git-history</code> (a way to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/339">populate additional columns</a> when creating a row using <code>table.lookup()</code>) but I also closed some bug reports and landed some small pull requests that had come in since 3.17.</p>
 s3-credentials 0.5 
<p>Earlier in the week I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/releases/tag/0.5">version 0.5</a> of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials">s3-credentials</a> - my CLI tool for creating read-only, read-write or write-only AWS credentials for a specific S3 bucket.</p>
<p>The biggest new feature is the ability to create temporary credentials, that expire after a given time limit.</p>
<p>This is achived using <code>STS.assume_role()</code>, where STS is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html">Security Token Service</a>. I've been wanting to learn this API for quite a while now.</p>
<p>Assume role comes with some limitations: tokens must live between 15 minutes and 12 hours, and you need to first create a role that you can assume. In creating those credentials you can define an additional policy document, which is how I scope down the token I'm creating to only allow a specific level of access to a specific S3 bucket.</p>
<p>I've learned a huge amount about AWS, IAM and S3 through developming this project. I think I'm finally overcoming my multi-year phobia of anything involving IAM!</p>

  <p>Summary: Consistent user experience is key enabler of digital embodiment and is critical to our ability to operationalize our digital lives.</p>



<p>
    The other day Lynne called me up and asked a seemingly innocuous question: "How do I share this video?" Ten years ago, the answer would have been easy: copy the URL and send it to them. Now...not so much. In order to answer that question I first had to determine which app she was using. And, since I wasn't that familiar with it, open it and search through the user interface to find the share button. 
</p>

<p>
    One of the features of web browsers that we don't appreciate as much as we should is the consistent user experience that the browser provides. Tabs, address bars, the back button, reloading and other features are largely the same regardless of which browser you use. There's a reason why <a href="https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/reback">don't break the back button!</a> was a common tip for web designers over the years. People depend on the web's consistent user experience. 
</p>

<p>
    Alas, apps have changed all that. Apps freed developers from the strictures of the web. No doubt there's been some excellent uses of this freedom, but what we've lost is consistency in core user experiences. That's unfortunate. 
</p>

<p>
    The web, and the internet for that matter, never had a consistent user experience for authentication. At least not one that caught on. Consequently, the user experience is very fragmented. Even so, Kim Cameron's <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">Seven Laws of Identity</a> speaks for consistent user experience in Law 7: Consistent Experience Across Contexts. Kim says:
</p>
<blockquote>The unifying identity metasystem must guarantee its users a simple, consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Think about logging into various websites and apps throughout your day. You probably do it way too often. But it's also made much more complex because it's slightly different everywhere. Different locations and modalities, different rules for passwords, different methods for 2FA, and so on. It's maddening.
</p>

<p>
    There's a saying in security: "Don't roll your own crypto." I think we need a corollary in identity: "Don't roll your own interface." But how do we do that? And what should the interface be? One answer is to adopt the user experience people already understand from the physical world: connections and credentials.
</p>

<p>
    Kim Cameron gave us a model back in 2005 when he introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>. Information cards are digital analogs of the credentials we all carry around in the physical world. People understand credentials. Information cards worked on a protocol-mediated identity metasystem so that anyone could use them and write software for them. 
</p>

<p>
    Information cards didn't make it, but the ideas underlying information cards live on in modern self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems. The user experience in SSI springs from the protocol embodied in the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.626726/full">identity metasystem</a>. In an SSI system, people use wallets that manage connections and credentials. They can create relationships with other people, organizations, and things. And they receive credentials from other participants and present those credentials to transfer information about themselves in a trustworthy manner. They don't see keys, passwords, authentication codes, and other artifacts of the ad hoc identity systems in widespread use today. Rather they use familiar artifacts to interact with others in ways that feel familiar because they are similar to how identity works in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>
    This idea feels simple and obvious, but I think that conceals its incredible power. Having a wallet I control where I manage digital relationships and credentials gives me a place to stand in the digital world and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">operationalize my digital life</a>. I think of it as digital embodiment. An SSI wallet gives me an interoperable way to connect and interact with others online as me. I can create both rich, long-lived relationships and service short-lived, ephemeral relationships with whatever degree of trustworthy data is appropriate for the relationship and its context. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Relationships and Interactions in SSI (click to enlarge)


<p>
    We have plenty of online relationships today, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Consistent user experience is a key enabler of digital embodiment. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so within some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. The SSI wallet is the platform upon which people can stand and become embodied online to operationalize their digital life as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.

<p>This article shows how scheduled tasks can be implemented in ASP.NET Core using <a href="https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/">Quartz.NET</a> and then displays the job info in an ASP.NET Core Razor page using SignalR. A concurrent job and a non concurrent job are implemented using a simple trigger to show the difference in how the jobs are run. Quartz.NET provides lots of scheduling features and has an easy to use API for implementing scheduled jobs.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreQuartz">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreQuartz</a></p>



<p>A simple ASP.NET Core Razor Page web application is used to implement the scheduler and the SignalR messaging. The Quartz Nuget package and the Quartz.Extensions.Hosting Nuget package are used to implement the scheduling service. The Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client package is used to send messages to all listening web socket clients. </p>


  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net6.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
  &lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;
  &lt;ImplicitUsings&gt;enable&lt;/ImplicitUsings&gt;
 &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client" Version="6.0.0" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting" Version="6.0.0" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Quartz" Version="3.3.3" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Quartz.Extensions.Hosting" Version="3.3.3" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The .NET 6 templates no longer use a Startup class, all this logic can now be implemented directly in the Program.cs file with no static main. The ConfigureServices logic can be implemented using a WebApplicationBuilder instance. The AddQuartz method is used to add the scheduling services. Two jobs are added, a concurrent job and a non concurrent job. Both jobs are triggered with a simple trigger every five seconds which runs forever. The AddQuartzHostedService method adds the service as a hosted service. The AddSignalR adds the SignalR services.</p>


  using AspNetCoreQuartz;
using AspNetCoreQuartz.QuartzServices;
using Quartz;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

builder.Services.AddSignalR();

builder.Services.AddQuartz(q =&gt;
{
    q.UseMicrosoftDependencyInjectionJobFactory();

    var conconcurrentJobKey = new JobKey("ConconcurrentJob");
    q.AddJob&lt;ConconcurrentJob&gt;(opts =&gt; opts.WithIdentity(conconcurrentJobKey));
    q.AddTrigger(opts =&gt; opts
        .ForJob(conconcurrentJobKey)
        .WithIdentity("ConconcurrentJob-trigger")
        .WithSimpleSchedule(x =&gt; x
            .WithIntervalInSeconds(5)
            .RepeatForever()));

    var nonConconcurrentJobKey = new JobKey("NonConconcurrentJob");
    q.AddJob&lt;NonConconcurrentJob&gt;(opts =&gt; opts.WithIdentity(nonConconcurrentJobKey));
    q.AddTrigger(opts =&gt; opts
        .ForJob(nonConconcurrentJobKey)
        .WithIdentity("NonConconcurrentJob-trigger")
        .WithSimpleSchedule(x =&gt; x
            .WithIntervalInSeconds(5)
            .RepeatForever()));

});

builder.Services.AddQuartzHostedService(
    q =&gt; q.WaitForJobsToComplete = true);
  


<p>The WebApplication instance is used to add the middleware like the Startup Configure method. The SignalR JobsHub endpoint is added to send the live messages of the running jobs to the UI in the client browser..</p>


  var app = builder.Build();

if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
{
    endpoints.MapHub&lt;JobsHub&gt;("/jobshub");
});

app.MapRazorPages();

app.Run();
  


<p>The ConconcurrentJob implements the IJob interface and logs messages before and after a time delay. A SignalR client is used to send all the job information to any listening clients. A seven second sleep was added to simulate a slow running job. The jobs are triggered every 5 seconds, so this should result in no change in behavior as the jobs can run in parallel.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using Quartz;

namespace AspNetCoreQuartz.QuartzServices
{
    public class ConconcurrentJob : IJob
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;ConconcurrentJob&gt; _logger;
        private static int _counter = 0;
        private readonly IHubContext&lt;JobsHub&gt; _hubContext;

        public ConconcurrentJob(ILogger&lt;ConconcurrentJob&gt; logger, 
            IHubContext&lt;JobsHub&gt; hubContext)
        {
            _logger = logger;
            _hubContext = hubContext;
        }

        public async Task Execute(IJobExecutionContext context)
        {
            var count = _counter++;

            var beginMessage = $"Conconcurrent Job BEGIN {count} {DateTime.UtcNow}";
            await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("ConcurrentJobs", beginMessage);
            _logger.LogInformation(beginMessage);

            Thread.Sleep(7000);

            var endMessage = $"Conconcurrent Job END {count} {DateTime.UtcNow}";
            await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("ConcurrentJobs", endMessage);
            _logger.LogInformation(endMessage);
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The NonConconcurrentJob class is almost like the previous job, except the DisallowConcurrentExecution attribute is used to prevent concurrent running of the job. This means that even though the trigger is set to five seconds, each job must wait until the previous job finishes.</p>


  [DisallowConcurrentExecution]
public class NonConconcurrentJob : IJob
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;NonConconcurrentJob&gt; _logger;
	private static int _counter = 0;
	private readonly IHubContext&lt;JobsHub&gt; _hubContext;

	public NonConconcurrentJob(ILogger&lt;NonConconcurrentJob&gt; logger,
		   IHubContext&lt;JobsHub&gt; hubContext)
	{
		_logger = logger;
		_hubContext = hubContext;
	}

	public async Task Execute(IJobExecutionContext context)
	{
		var count = _counter++;

		var beginMessage = $"NonConconcurrentJob Job BEGIN {count} {DateTime.UtcNow}";
		await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("NonConcurrentJobs", beginMessage);
		_logger.LogInformation(beginMessage);

		Thread.Sleep(7000);

		var endMessage = $"NonConconcurrentJob Job END {count} {DateTime.UtcNow}";
		await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("NonConcurrentJobs", endMessage);
		_logger.LogInformation(endMessage);
	}
}
  


<p>The JobsHub class implements the SignalR Hub and define methods for sending SignalR messages. Two messages are used, one for the concurrent job messages and one for the non concurrent job messages.</p>


  public class JobsHub : Hub
{
	public Task SendConcurrentJobsMessage(string message)
	{
		return Clients.All.SendAsync("ConcurrentJobs",  message);
	}

	public Task SendNonConcurrentJobsMessage(string message)
	{
		return Clients.All.SendAsync("NonConcurrentJobs", message);
	}

}
  


<p>The microsoft signalr Javascript package is used to implement the client which listens for messages.</p>


  {
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultProvider": "cdnjs",
  "libraries": [
    {
      "library": "microsoft-signalr@5.0.11",
      "destination": "wwwroot/lib/microsoft-signalr/"
    }
  ]
}
  


<p>The Index Razor Page view uses the SignalR Javascript file and displays messages by adding html elements.</p>


  @page
@model IndexModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}

&lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
            &lt;ul id="concurrentJobs"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
            &lt;ul id="nonConcurrentJobs"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src="~/lib/microsoft-signalr/signalr.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  


<p>The SignalR client adds the two methods to listen to messages sent from the Quartz jobs.</p>


  const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/jobshub")
    .configureLogging(signalR.LogLevel.Information)
    .build();

async function start() {
    try {
        await connection.start();
        console.log("SignalR Connected.");
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        setTimeout(start, 5000);
    }
};

connection.onclose(async () =&gt; {
    await start();
});

start();

connection.on("ConcurrentJobs", function (message) {
    var li = document.createElement("li");
    document.getElementById("concurrentJobs").appendChild(li);
    li.textContent = `${message}`;
});

connection.on("NonConcurrentJobs", function (message) {
    var li = document.createElement("li");
    document.getElementById("nonConcurrentJobs").appendChild(li);
    li.textContent = `${message}`;
});


  


<p>When the application is run and the hosted Quartz service runs the scheduled jobs, the concurrent jobs starts every five seconds as required and the non concurrent job runs every seven seconds due to the thread sleep.  Running concurrent or non concurrent jobs by using a single attribute definition is a really powerful feature of Quartz.NET.</p>







<p>Quartz.NET provides great documentation and has a really simple API. By using SignalR, it would be really easy to implement a good monitoring UI.</p>

<p>The purpose of Wikipedia is to help. Almost entirely, it does. It is a work of positive construction without equal or substitute. That some use it to hurt, or to spread false information, does not diminish Wikipedia’s worth as a resource.</p>
<p>The trick for researchers using Wikipedia as a resource is not a difficult one: don’t cite it. Dig down in references, make sure those are good, and move on from there. It’s not complicated.</p></blockquote>

  <p>My big project this week was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/3/s3-credentials/">s3-credentials, described yesterday</a> - but I also put together a fun expermiental Datasette plugin bundling JupyterLite and wrote up my PyGotham talk on Python packaging.</p>
 datasette-jupyterlite 
<p><a href="https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite">JupyterLite</a> is absolutely incredible: it's a full, working distribution of Jupyter that runs entirely in a browser, thanks to a Python interpreter (and various other parts of the scientific Python stack) that has been compiled to WebAssembly by the <a href="https://pyodide.org//">Pyodide</a> project.</p>
<p>Since it's just static JavaScript (and WASM modules) it's possible to host it anywhere that can run a web server.</p>
<p>Datasette runs a web server...</p>
<p>So, I built <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-jupyterlite">datasette-jupyterlite</a> - a Datasette plugin that bundles JupyterLite and serves it up as part of the Datasette instance.</p>
<p>You can try <a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/jupyterlite/">a live demo here</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here's some Python code that will retrieve data from the associated Datasette instance and pull it into a Pandas DataFrame:</p>
 import pandas, pyodide
pandas.read_csv(pyodide.open_url(
  "https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/github/stars.csv")
) 
<p>(I haven't yet found a way to do this with a relative rather than absolute URL.)</p>
<p>The best part of this is that it works in <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a>! You can install the plugin using the "Install and manage plugins" menu item to get a version of Jupyter running in Python running in WebAssembly running in V8 running in Chromium running in Electron.</p>
<p>The plugin implementation is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-jupyterlite/blob/0.1a0/datasette_jupyterlite/__init__.py">just 30 lines of code</a> - it uses the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlite/">jupyterlite</a> Python package which bundles a <code>.tgz</code> file containing all of the required static assets, then serves files directly out of that tarfile.</p>
 Also this week 
<p>My other projects from this week are already written about on the blog:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/3/s3-credentials/">s3-credentials: a tool for creating credentials for S3 buckets</a> introduces a new CLI tool I built that automates the process of creating new, long-lived credentials that provide read-only, read-write or write-only access to just a single specified S3 bucket.

  <p>At <a href="https://2021.pygotham.tv/talks/how-to-build-test-and-publish-an-open-source-python-library/">PyGotham</a> this year I presented a ten minute workshop on how to package up a new open source Python library and publish it to <a href="https://pypi.org/">the Python Package Index</a>. Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMnLXynUqys">the video</a> and accompanying notes, which should make sense even without watching the talk.</p>
 The video 

<p>PyGotham arrange for sign language interpretation for all of their talks, which is really cool. Since those take up a portion of the screen (and YouTube don't yet have a way to apply them as a different layer) I've also made available a copy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SPqMR08VWU">the original video</a> without the sign language.</p>
 Packaging a single module 
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vial/blob/5c5f7eb344d28afb91e947243a6f96b337ea0ce2/vaccinate/core/baseconverter.py">this code</a> which I've been copying and pasting between my own projects for over a decade.</p>
<p><code>BaseConverter</code> is a simple class that can convert an integer to a shortened character string and back again, for example:</p>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; pid = BaseConverter("bcdfghkmpqrtwxyz")
&gt;&gt;&gt; pid.from_int(1234)
"gxd"
&gt;&gt;&gt; pid.to_int("gxd")
1234  
<p>To turn this into a library, first I created a <code>pids/</code> directory (I've chosen that name because it's available on PyPI).</p>
<p>To turn that code into a package:</p>
 
 
<p><code>mkdir pids &amp;&amp; cd pids</code></p>
 
 
<p>Create <code>pids.py</code> in that directory with the contents of <a href="https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vial/blob/main/vaccinate/core/baseconverter.py">this file</a></p>
 
 
<p>Create a new <code>setup.py</code> file in that folder containing the following:</p>
 from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="pids",
    version="0.1",
    description="A tiny Python library for generating public IDs from integers",
    author="Simon Willison",
    url="https://github.com/simonw/...",
    license="Apache License, Version 2.0",    
    py_modules=["pids"],
) 
 
 
<p>Run <code>python3 setup.py sdist</code> to create the packaged source distribution, <code>dist/pids-0.1.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>(I've since learned that it's better to run <code>python3 -m build</code> here instead, see <a href="https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html"> Why you shouldn't invoke setup.py directly</a>).</p>
 
 
<p>This is all it takes: a <code>setup.py</code> file with some metadata, then a single command to turn that into a packaged <code>.tar.gz</code> file.</p>
 Testing it in a Jupyter notebook 
<p>Having created that file, I demonstrated how it can be tested in a Jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>Jupyter has a <code>%pip</code> magic command which runs <code>pip</code> to install a package into the same environment as the current Jupyter kernel:</p>
 <code>%pip install /Users/simon/Dropbox/Presentations/2021/pygotham/pids/dist/pids-0.1.tar.gz
</code> 
<p>Having done this, I could excute the library like so:</p>
 <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pids
&gt;&gt;&gt; pids.pid.from_int(1234)
'gxd'
</code> 
 Uploading the package to PyPI 
<p>I used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/twine/">twine</a> (<code>pip install twine</code>) to upload my new package to <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>.</p>
<p>You need to create a PyPI account before running this command.</p>
<p>By default you need to paste in the PyPI account's username and password:</p>
 <code>% twine upload dist/pids-0.1.tar.gz
Uploading distributions to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
Enter your username: simonw

View at:
https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/
</code> 
<p>The release is now live at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/">https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/</a> - and anyone can run <code>pip install pids</code> to install it.</p>
 Adding documentation 
<p>If you visit the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/">0.1 release page</a> you'll see the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The author of this package has not provided a project description</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To fix this I added a <code>README.md</code> file with some basic documentation, written in Markdown:</p>
  # pids

Create short public identifiers based on integer IDs.

## Installation

    pip install pids

## Usage

    from pids import pid
    public_id = pid.from_int(1234)
    # public_id is now "gxd"
    id = pid.to_int("gxd")
    # id is now 1234  
<p>Then I modified my <code>setup.py</code> file to look like this:</p>
 from setuptools import setup
import os

def get_long_description():
    with open(
        os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "README.md"),
        encoding="utf8",
    ) as fp:
        return fp.read()

setup(
    name="pids",
    version="0.1.1",
    long_description=get_long_description(),
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    description="A tiny Python library for generating public IDs from integers",
    author="Simon Willison",
    url="https://github.com/simonw/...",
    license="Apache License, Version 2.0",    
    py_modules=["pids"],
) 
<p>The <code>get_long_description()</code> function reads that <code>README.md</code> file into a Python string.</p>
<p>The following two extra arguments to <code>setup()</code> add that as metadata visible to PyPI:</p>
 long_description=get_long_description(),
long_description_content_type="text/markdown", 
<p>I also updated the version number to <code>0.1.1</code> in preparation for a new release.</p>
<p>Running <code>python3 setup.py sdist</code> created a new file called <code>dist/pids-0.1.1.tar.gz</code> - I then uploaded that file using <code>twine upload dist/pids-0.1.1.tar.gz</code> which created a new release with a visible README at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.1/">https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.1/</a></p>
 Adding some tests 
<p>I like using <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> for tests, so I added that as a test dependency by modifying <code>setup.py</code> to add the following line:</p>
     extras_require={"test": ["pytest"]}, 
<p>Next, I created a virtual environment and installed my package and its test dependencies into an "editable" mode like so:</p>
 <code># Create and activate environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Install editable module, plus pytest
pip install -e '.[test]'
</code> 
<p>Now I can run the tests!</p>
 <code>(venv) pids % pytest
============================= test session starts ==============================

============================ no tests ran in 0.01s =============================
</code> 
<p>There aren't any tests yet. I created a <code>tests/</code> folder and dropped in a <code>test_pids.py</code> file that looked like this:</p>
 import pytest
import pids

def test_from_int():
    assert pids.pid.from_int(1234) == "gxd"

def test_to_int():
    assert pids.pid.to_int("gxd") == 1234 
<p>Running <code>pytest</code> in the project directory now runs those tests:</p>
 <code>(venv) pids % pytest

</code> 
 Creating a GitHub repository 
<p>Time to publish the source code on GitHub.</p>
<p>I created a repository using the form at <a href="https://github.com/new">https://github.com/new</a></p>
<p>Having created the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pids">simonw/pids</a> repository, I ran the following commands locally to push my code to it (mostly copy and pasted from the GitHub example):</p>
 <code>git init
git add README.md pids.py setup.py tests/test_pids.py
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:simonw/pids.git
git push -u origin main
</code> 
 Running the tests with GitHub Actions 
<p>I copied in a <code>.github/workflows</code> folder from <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-explain/tree/main/.github/workflows">another project</a> with two files, <code>test.yml</code> and <code>publish.yml</code>. The <code>.github/workflows/test.yml</code> file contained this:</p>
  name: Test

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - uses: actions/cache@v2
      name: Configure pip caching
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/setup.py') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -e '.[test]'
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest  
<p>The <code>matrix</code> block there causes the job to run four times, on four different versions of Python.</p>
<p>The action steps do the following:</p>
 
 Checkout the current repository 
 Install the specified Python version 
 Configure GitHub's action caching mechanism for the <code>~/.cache/pip</code> directory - this avoids installing the same files from PyPI over the internet the next time the workflow runs 
 Install the test dependencies 
 Run the tests 
 
<p>I added and pushed these new files:</p>
 <code>git add .github
git commit -m "GitHub Actions"
git push
</code> 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pids/actions">Actions tab</a> in my repository instantly ran the test suite, and when it passed added a green checkmark to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pids/commit/93029ab191c00ab8274a1b88548d279b45411c3a">my commit</a>.</p>
 Publishing a new release using GitHub 
<p>The <code>.github/workflows/publish.yml</code> workflow is triggered by new GitHub releases. It tests them and then, if the tests pass, publishes them up to PyPI using <code>twine</code>.</p>
<p>The workflow looks like this:</p>
  name: Publish Python Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - uses: actions/cache@v2
      name: Configure pip caching
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/setup.py') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -e '.[test]'
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - uses: actions/cache@v2
      name: Configure pip caching
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-publish-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/setup.py') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-publish-pip-
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install setuptools wheel twine
    - name: Publish
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        twine upload dist/*  
<p>It contains two jobs: the <code>test</code> job the tests again - we should never publish a package without first ensuring that the test suite passes - and then the <code>deploy</code> job runs <code>python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel</code> followed by <code>twine upload dist/*</code> to upload the resulting packages.</p>
<p>(My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib/blob/6ca0a8fea6986f076d88cfcf9cb6dce782b53098/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.hyphenated%7D%7D/.github/workflows/publish.yml">latest version of this</a> uses <code>python3 -m build</code> here instead.)</p>
<p>Before publishing a package with this action, I needed to create a <code>PYPI_TOKEN</code> that the action could use to authenticate with my PyPI account.</p>
<p>I used the <a href="https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/">https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/</a> page to create that token:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I copied out the newly created token:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I used the "Settings -&gt; Secrets" tab on the GitHub repository to add that as a secret called <code>PYPI_TOKEN</code>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(I have since revoked the token that I used in the video, since it is visible on screen to anyone watching.)</p>
<p>I used the GitHub web interface to edit <code>setup.py</code> to bump the version number in that file up to <code>0.1.2</code>, then I navigated to the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pids/releases">releases tab</a> in the repository, clicked "Draft new release" and created a release that would create a new <code>0.1.2</code> tag as part of the release process.</p>
<p>When I published the release, the <code>publish.yml</code> action started to run. After the tests had passed it pushed the new release to PyPI: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.2/">https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.2/</a></p>
 Bonus: cookiecutter templates 
<p>I've published a lot of packages using this process - <a href="https://pypi.org/user/simonw/">143 and counting</a>!</p>
<p>Rather than copy and paste in a <code>setup.py</code> each time, a couple of years ago I switched over to using <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a> templates.</p>
<p>I have three templates that I use today:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib">python-lib</a> for standalone Python libraries 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">datasette-plugin</a> for <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> plugins 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">click-app</a> for CLI applications built using the <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> package 
 
<p>Back in August I figured out a way to make these available as GitHub repository templates, which I described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/28/dynamic-github-repository-templates/">Dynamic content for GitHub repository templates using cookiecutter and GitHub Actions</a>. This means you can create a new GitHub repository that implements the <code>test.yml</code> and <code>publish.yml</code> pattern described in this talk with just a few clicks on the GitHub website.</p>

<p>I just read a <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/on-the-horizon-ftcs-slaughter-maps-data-regulations-potential-future">wonderful piece</a> from Joseph Duball,<a>1</a> who reported on the U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter’s keynote at the IAPP’s “Privacy. Security. Risk 2021” event. According to Duball, Slaughter suggests that we need to change “the way people view, prioritize, and conceptualize their data.”</p>
<p>“Too many services are about leveraging consumer data instead of straightforwardly providing value. For even the savviest users, the price of browsing the internet is being tracked across the web.” – Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Commissioner, U.S. Federal Trade Commission 2021<a>2</a></p>
<p>According to Slaughter, privacy issues within data-driven markets stem from surveillance capitalism, which is fueled by indiscriminate data collection practices. She suggests that the remedy to curtail these practices is to focus on “purpose and use” restrictions and limitations rather than solely relying on the notice &amp; choice framework. In other words, in the future industry may no longer justify data practice with explanations like “they opted in” and “we got consent” or falling ba</p>
<p>“Collection and use limitations can help protect people’s rights. It should not be necessary to trade one’s data away as a cost of full participation in society and the modern information economy.” – Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Commissioner, U.S. Federal Trade Commission 2021<a>3</a></p>
 FTC Has Concerns Other Than Privacy 
<p>So that there is no uncertainty or doubt, however, Duball<a>4</a> reports that, while consumer privacy is a chief concern for the commission, it is not the primary concern to the exclusion of other concerns. The commission is also worried about algorithmic bias and “dark patterns” practices. In other words, it is not just about the data, it is about the methods used to “trick” people into giving it up and how it is processed and applied to business decision-making.</p>
 Takeaway 
<p>My takeaway is that it is time for organizations to take a serious look at revamping their end-to-end processes and tech-stacks. This is a c-suite leadership all-hands-on-deck moment. It will take years for the larger organizations to turn their flotilla in the right direction, and for the industry at large to sort everything out. However, rest asserted, the empowered person–the self-sovereign individual–is nigh and will sort it out for industry soon enough.</p>
<p>There is time, but not much, maybe three, five, or seven years, before the people will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to take back control of their data. It is already happening; just look at open banking in the UK. These new tools, aka personal information management systems, will enable people to granularly exchange data on their terms with their stated purpose of use, not the businesses. They will give them the power to process data in a way that protects them from bias or at least helps them know when it is happening.</p>
<p>Why should businesses care about all this? Well, I predict, as do many so I’m not too far out on a limb here, that in the not-too-distant future, the empowered, connected individual will walk with their wallet and only do business with those institutions that respect their sovereignty, both physically and digitally. So, to all out there, it is time, and it is time to prepare for the future.</p>

<p>No civilisation can exist or prosper without the rule of law. The rule of law cannot exist without a proper justice system. In India, criminals have a free reign as justice system is used as a tool to make victims succumb into unfair settlements or withdrawals. Unfortunately, the Indian justice system has gone caput and remains clogged with over 4+ crore cases pending in courts due to following core&nbsp;reasons.</p> Policy gap 1 — Only in India there is zero deterrence to&nbsp;perjury <p>a. In India, perjury law is taken very lightly. 99% of cases are full of lies, deceit and mockery of justice. Affidavits in India do not serve much purpose. There have been various judgments and cries from all levels of judiciary but in&nbsp;vain.</p><p>b. Perjury makes any case 10x more complex and consumes 20x more time to adjudicate. It is akin to allowing a bullock cart in the middle of express highway. It is nothing but an attack on justice delivery system. Historically, perjury used to be punished with death sentence and considered an equally serious crime as&nbsp;murder.</p><p>c. This is against the best international practices and does not make economic sense for&nbsp;India.</p> Policy gap 2 — India has no equivalent laws such as the U.S. Federal Rule 11 enacted in 1983 (as amendment in 1993) to curb the explosion of frivolous litigation. <p>The entire provision of rule 11 of U.S. federal rules can be summarized in the following manner:</p><p>It requires that a district court mandatorily sanction attorneys or parties who submit improper pleadings like pleadings with</p>  Improper purpose  Containing frivolous arguments  Facts or arguments that have no evidentiary support  Omissions and errors, misleading and crafty&nbsp;language  Baseless or unreasonable denials with non-application of&nbsp;mind  Negligence, failure to appear or unreasonable adjournments  <p>All developed countries like UK and Australia also have similar laws to combat frivolous litigation.</p> Police gap 3 — Only in India the lawyers are barred from contingent fee agreements under Bar council&nbsp;rules   Indian lawyers are incentivized to make cases go longer, add complexity and never end. Consequently, they super specialize and become innovators in creating alibis so that the case never&nbsp;ends.  Lawyers in India do not investigate or legally vet the case before&nbsp;filing.  There is no incentive to apply for torts claims or prosecute perjury and therefore there is no deterrence created.  Lawyers are supposed to be gate keepers to prevent frivolous litigation but in India it is actually opposite due to the perverse policy on contingent fee and&nbsp;torts.  <p>Economic modelling suggests that — contingent fee arrangements reduce frivolous suits when compared to hourly fee arrangements. The reasoning is simple: When an attorney’s compensation is based solely on success, as opposed to hours billed, there is great incentive to accept and prosecute only meritorious cases.</p><p>At least one empirical analysis concludes that — “hourly fees encourage the filing of low-quality suits and increase the time to settlement (i.e., contingency fees increase legal quality and decrease the time to settlement).”</p> Negative impact of the 3 policy&nbsp;gaps <p>1. Conviction rates in India are abysmally low below 10% whereas internationally between 60% — 100%.<a>[1]</a></p><blockquote>a. Japan — 99.97%</blockquote><blockquote>b. China — 98%</blockquote><blockquote>c. Russia — 90%</blockquote><blockquote>d. UK — 80%</blockquote><blockquote>e. US — between 65% and&nbsp;80%</blockquote><p>2. Globally the 80%-99% cases get settled before trial but India its actually opposite&nbsp;because</p>  There is absolutely no fear of law and perjury is a&nbsp;norm.  Lawyers have no interest in driving a settlement due to per appearance fee&nbsp;system.  There is an artificial limit of fee shifting (awarding costs), torts and there is no motivation of the part of judges to create deterrence.  <p>3. The contingent fee and tort cannot be enabled till such time the fraternity of lawyers can be relied upon for ethical and moral&nbsp;conduct.</p><p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&nbsp;—</p><blockquote>Easy solution to complex&nbsp;problem</blockquote><p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&nbsp;—</p> Policy 1 — Restricting perjury and making it a non-bailable offence will resolve 50% cases immediately <br>(i.e. 1.5 crore cases within 3&nbsp;months) <p>India must truly embrace “Satyam ev jayate” and make perjury a non-bailable offence. All lawyers and litigants should be given 3 month’s notice to refile their pleadings or settle the cases. They would have to face the mandatory consequences of false evidence or averments later found to be&nbsp;untrue.</p><p>There needs to be a basic expectation reset in Indian courts litigation — the filings are correct, and the lawyer is responsible for prima facie diligence and candor before courts. The role of judiciary is not to distinguish between truth and false but to determine the sequence of events, fix accountability and award penalties. Presenting false evidence or frivolous arguments must be seen as separate offence on its&nbsp;own.</p><blockquote>At a minimum IPC 195(1)(b)(i) must be removed that states the following –</blockquote><blockquote>“No Court shall take cognizance- of any offence punishable under any of the following sections of the IPC (45 of 1860), namely, sections 193 to 196 (both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any&nbsp;Court”</blockquote><p>Because:</p>  This necessarily makes the judges party to the complaint and therefore all judges are reluctant to prosecute perjury.  This estoppel opens up possibility of corruption in judiciary and public&nbsp;offices.  The intention of this provision has clearly backfired. This restriction is unique to india and against the international norms   Policy 2 — Sanctions on lawyers to streamline the perverse incentives that plague Indian justice&nbsp;system <p>The courts in USA are mandated to compulsorily sanction lawyers for various professional misconduct in litigation (Federal rule 11 of civil procedure) like:</p><p>Remedies and sanctions for lawyer’s misconduct can be categorized into three&nbsp;groups.</p>  Sanctions and remedies for attorney misconduct which are available to public authorities. Such sanctions include professional discipline, criminal liability of lawyers who assist their clients in committing criminal acts, and judicially imposed sanctions such as for contempt of court. Professional discipline is generally the best known sanction for attorney misconduct.  Sanctions which are available to lawyers’ clients. For example, damages for attorney malpractice, forfeiture of an attorney’s fee, and judicial nullification of gifts or business transactions that breach a lawyer’s fiduciary duty to a&nbsp;client.  Remedies that may be available to third parties injured by a lawyer’s conduct on behalf of a client. These include injunctions against representing a client in violation of the lawyer’s duty to a third party, damages for breach of an obligation the attorney assumes to a non-client, and judicial nullification of settlements or jury verdicts obtained by attorney misconduct.   Policy 3 — Contingent Fee and Tort Law making judiciary 3x efficient. <blockquote>(needs perjury law as discussed above to&nbsp;unlock)</blockquote><p>In India Lawyers spend more time in making the case complex and lengthy based on “dehari system” while the western counterparts earn far more money by genuinely solving cases and creating real values for the country. The market economics based on judicial policy on regulating legal profession and ethics in India is however geared towards permanently clogging the system. 3 of the 4 stakeholders benefit by making the litigation never&nbsp;end.</p><p>There is a dire need for the system to be re-incentivized wherein the legal profession can generate 10x more value for the country in catching and penalizing law abusers. This in turn will also attract and create more talented lawyers because then they will be investing more time in investigating and preparing the cases to&nbsp;win.</p><p>Making perjury a non-bailable offence and rules for mandatorily sanctioning lawyer mis-conduct will unlock the contingent fee and tort law in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Allowing contingent fee for lawyers have four principal policy justifications</p><p>Firstly, such arrangements</p>  enable the impecunious (having no money) to obtain representation. Such persons cannot afford the costs of litigation unless and until it is successful. Even members of the middle- and upper-socioeconomic classes may find it difficult to pay legal fees in advance of success and collection of judgment.  This is particularly so today as litigation has become more complex, often involving suits against multiple parties or multinational entities, and concerning matters requiring expert scientific and economic evidence.  <p>Secondly,</p>  Contingent fee arrangements can help align the interests of lawyer and client, as both will have a direct financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.  <p>Third</p>  By predicating an attorney’s compensation on the success of a suit, the attorney is given incentive to function as gatekeeper, screening cases for both merit and sufficiency of proof, and lodging only those likely to&nbsp;succeed.  This provides as an important and genuine signal for litigants to understand the merit of their&nbsp;case.  <p>Fourth</p>  And more generally, all persons of sound mind should be permitted to contract freely, and restrictions on contingent fee arrangements inhibit this&nbsp;freedom.  <p>Three other reasons to justify unlocking of contingent fee:-</p>  Clients, particularly unsophisticated ones, may be unable to determine when an attorney has underperformed or acted irresponsibly;15 in these instances, an attorney’s reputation would be unaffected, and thus the risk of reputational harm would not adequately protect against malfeasance.  Even when clients are aware of an attorney’s poor performance or irresponsibility, they may lack the means, media, or credibility to effectively harm the attorney’s reputation.  The interests of attorney and client are more closely aligned, ceteris paribus, when fee arrangements are structured so as to minimize perverse incentives.   Why contingent fees reduce caseload: <p>Lesser cases better&nbsp;filing</p><p>Complainants get genuine advice about chances of winning. They do not file unless they get lawyer’s&nbsp;buy-in.</p>  Lawyers screen cases for merit and sufficiency of proof before&nbsp;filing.  Lawyers don’t pick up bad cases to manage reputation.  Comprehensive evidence gathering happens before Lawyer decides to file a&nbsp;case.  <p>Lawyers simplify case and only allege charges that can be sustained.</p>  Use simple and concise arguments for the&nbsp;judges.  Lawyers spend more time working hard outside the courts. Thus increasing case&nbsp;quality.  <p>Faster case proceedings</p>  Less adjournments and&nbsp;hearings  They do better preparation and take less adjournments.  Multiple steps get completed in single hearings.  They create urgency for clients to show up at every&nbsp;hearing.  Lawyers do not unnecessarily appeal and stay matters because they do not get paid per hearing and want quick&nbsp;results.  <p>Case withdrawals</p>  There are less takers if a lawyer drops a case when there are surprises by client which will adversely impact the&nbsp;outcome.  Lawyers persuade complainants to settle when appropriate.   Conclusions <p>With 3+ crore cases pending and a dysfunctional justice delivery there is a mass exodus of Ultra High Net worth Individuals (UHNIs) from India. There is an absolute urgent need for above reforms before the situation turns into a complete banana republic.</p><p>It is an absolute embarrassment and national shame to allow Indians to be blatant liars even in courts. Business and survival in India today is a race to the bottom just because there is no bar on falsehood and having corrupt values, it is near impossible to survive without being part of the same&nbsp;culture.</p><p>It is prayed that even more stricter laws be enacted than just global norms such that Indians can be trusted globally to never lie. It’s not just about Indian courts but they could be counted as the most truthful race even in foreign lands and command high respect globally.</p> Restoring justice&nbsp;delivery  Economic benefits of reform in perjury, contingent fee and legal&nbsp;ethics <p>1. Higher quality of litigation work.</p><p>2. Attract better talent to the profession due to higher profitability.</p><p>3. Create more jobs in the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>4. Offer higher pool of qualified people for judiciary.</p><p>5. Drastic reduction in corrupt or criminal activity due to fear of&nbsp;law.</p><p>6. Unlocking of trillions of dollars of wealth/resources stuck in litigation.</p><p>7. Better investment climate due to more reliability in business transactions.</p><p>8. Higher reliability in products and services.</p><p>9. Access to justice for&nbsp;all.</p><p>10.

Critically you only have one go.&nbsp; &nbsp; Try it. Fill a pan with ice and set a target, say 38.4 degrees, use a thermometer and switch off the pan when you think the final temperature will be your target. Did you manage to get within 1.5 degrees of your target?&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a> forces us to think that we cannot optimise for one outcome, one goal, one target or for a one-dimensional framing. To do so would be to ignore other optimisations, visions, ideas or beliefs.&nbsp; When we optimise, for one thing, something else will not have an optimal outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In business, we are asked to articulate a single purpose, one mission, the single justification that sets out a reason to exist.&nbsp; The more we as a board or senior leadership team optimise for “performance”, the more we become directional. Performance itself, along with the thinking that drives the best allocation of resources, means we are framed to optimise for an outcome. &nbsp; In social sciences and economics, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence">path dependency</a>. &nbsp; The unintended consequences of our previous decisions that drive efficiency and effectiveness might not directly impact us, but another part of an interdependent system that, through several unconnected actions, will feed into our future decisions and outcomes.&nbsp; Complex system thinking highlights such causes and effects of positive and negative feedback loops.&nbsp;</p><p>By example. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher_detergent">Dishwasher tablets</a> make me more productive but make the water system less efficient by reducing the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/home-garden/shopping-guide/ethical-dishwasher-detergent">ecosystem</a>. However, I am framed by performance and my own efficiency; therefore, I have to optimise my time, and the dishwasher is a perfect solution.&nbsp; Indeed we are marketed that the dishwasher saves water and energy compared to other washing up techniques. The single narrow view of optimisation is straightforward and easy to understand.&nbsp; The views we hold on battery cars to mobile phones is framed as one of being more productive.&nbsp; Performance as a metric matters more than anything else, why because the story says performance creates economic activity that creates growth that means fewer people are in poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Performance” is a one-dimensional optimisation where economic activity based on financial outcomes wins.&nbsp; You and I are the agents of any increase in performance, and the losses in the equation of equilibrium are somewhere else in the system. We are framed and educated to doubt the long, complex link between the use of anti-bacterial wipes and someone else’s skin condition. Performance as a dimension for measurement creates an optimal outcome for one and a sub-optimal outcome for someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>Performance as a measure creates an optimal outcome for one and a sub-optimal outcome for someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>If it was just me, then the cause and effect relationship are hard to see, but when more of humanity optimises for performance, it is the scale at which we all lose that suddenly comes into effect. Perhaps it is time to question the simple linear ideas of one purpose, one measure, one mission, and try to optimise for different things simultaneously; however, that means simple political messages, tabloid headlines, and social-media-driven advertising will fail.&nbsp; Are leaders ready to lead, or do they enjoy too much power to do the right thing?</p> <br>

  <p>Summary:      The future of computing is moving from the cloud to the edge. How can we create a decentralized, general-purpose computing mesh? Picos provide a model for exploration.</p>



<p>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004M8SR2O/windleyofente-20">Rainbow's End</a> is one of my favorite books. A work of fiction, Rainbow's End imagines life in a near future world where augmented reality and pervasive IoT technology are the fabric within which people live their lives. This book, from 2006, is perhaps where I first began to understand the nature and importance of computing at the edge. A world where computing is ambient and immersive can't rely only on computers in the cloud.
</p>

<p>
    We have significant edge computing now in the form of powerful mobile devices, but that computing is not shared without roundtrips to centralized cloud computing. One of the key components of 5G technology is <a href="https://stlpartners.com/edge_computing/5g-edge-computing/">compute and storage at the edge</a>—on the cell towers themselves— that distributes computing and reduces latency. Akamai, CloudFront, and others have provided these services for years, but still in a data center somewhere. 5G moves it right to the pole in your backyard.
</p>

<p>
    But the vision I've had since reading Rainbow's End is not just distributed, but decentralized, edge computing. Imagine your persistent compute jobs in interoperable containers moving around a mesh of compute engines that live on phones, laptops, servers, or anywhere else where spare cycles exist.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> does this for storage, decentralizing file storage by putting files in shared spaces at the edge. With IPFS, people act as user-operators to host and receive content in a peer-to-peer manner. If a file gets more popular, IPFS attempts to store it in more places and closer to the need.
</p>

<p>
    You can play with this first hand at <a href="https://nofilter.org">NoFilter.org</a>, which brands itself as a "the world's first unstoppable, uncensorable, undeplatformable, decentralized freedom of speech app." There's no server storing files, just a set of Javascript files that run in your browser. Identity is provided via <a href="https://metamask.io">Metamask</a> which uses an Ethereum address as your identifier. <a href="https://nofilter.org/#/0xdbca72ed00c24d50661641bf42ad4be003a30b84">I created some posts on NoFilter</a> to explore how it works.

    As far as I can tell, this is completely decentralized. The identity is just an Ethereum address that anyone can create using Metamask, a Javascript application that runs in the browser. The files are stored on IPFS, decentralized on storage providers around the net. They are rendered using Javascript that runs in the browser. So long as you have access to the Javascript files from somewhere you can write and read articles without reliance on any central server.

 Decentralized Computing 
<p>
    My vision for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/ten_reasons_to_use_picos_for_your_next_decentralized_programming_project.shtml">picos</a> is that they can operate on a decentralized mesh of pico engines in a similar decentralized fashion. Picos are already encapsulations of computation with isolated state and programs that control their operation. There are two primary problems with the <a>current pico engine</a> that have to be addressed to make picos independent of the underlying engine:
</p>
 
     Picos are addressed by URL, so the pico engine's host name or IP address becomes part of the pico's address 
     Picos have a persistence layer that is currently provided by the engine the pico is hosted on.  
 
<p>
    The first problem is solvable using <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDs and DIDComm</a>. We've made progress in this area. You can create and use DIDs in a pico. But they are not, yet, the primary means of addressing and communicating with the pico.
</p>

<p>
    The second problem could be addressed with IPFS. We've not done any work in this area yet. So I'm not aware of the pitfalls or problems, but it looks doable.
</p>

<p>
    With these two architectural issues out of the way, implementing a way for picos to move easily between engines would be straightforward. We have import and export functionality already. I'm envisioning something that picos could control themselves, on demand, programatically. Ultimately, I want the pico to chose where it's hosted based on whatever factors the owner or programmer deems most important. That could be hosting cost, latency, availability, capacity, or other factors. The decentralized directory to discover engines advertising certain features or factors, and a means to pay them would have to be built—possibly as a smart contract. 
</p>

<p>
    A trickier problem is protecting picos from malevolent engines. This is the hardest problem, as far as I can tell. Initially, collections of trusted engines, possibly using staking, could be used.
</p>

<p>
    There are plenty of fun, interesting problems if you'd like to help.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>Long ago a person dear to me disappeared for what would become eight years. When this happened I was given comfort and perspective by his maternal grandfather, a professor of history whose study concentrated on the American South after the Civil War.</p>
<p>“You know what the most common record of young men was, after the Civil War?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You mean census records?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and church records, family histories, all that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Two words:&nbsp;Went west.”</p>
<p>He went on to explain that that, except for the natives here in the U.S., nearly all of our ancestors had gone west. Literally or metaphorically, voluntarily or not, they went west.</p>
<p>More importantly, most were not going back. Many, perhaps most, were hardly heard from again in the places they left. The break from the past in countless places was sadly complete for those left behind. All that remained were those two words.</p>
<p>Went west.</p>
<p>This fact, he said, is at the heart of American rootlessness.</p>
<p>“We are the least rooted civilization on Earth,” he said. “This is why we have weaker family values than any other country.”</p>
<p>This is also why he also thought political talk about “family values” was especially ironic. We may have those values, but they tend not to keep us from going west anyway.</p>
<p>This comes to mind because I am haunted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Chapin">Harry Chapin</a>‘s song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etundhQa724">Cat’s in the Cradle</a>.” It’s hard not to be moved by it.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Token-based identity systems move us from talking about who, to thinking about what, so that people can operationalize their digital lives. Token-based identity systems support complex online interactions that are flexible, ad hoc, and cross-domain.</p>


<p>
    I've spent some time thinking about this article from PeterVan on <a href="https://petervan.wordpress.com/2021/08/29/programmable-money-and-identity/">Programmable Money and Identity</a>. Peter references a <a href="https://www.tbstat.com/wp/uploads/2020/08/The-Block-Research-CBDC-Report-From-Iteration-to-Implementation_v1.04.pdf">white paper on central bank digital currencies</a> and one on <a href="https://ath.mirror.xyz/mDu_nGsWpjvF-KaPLADwxeAMfze3UJOtTAQi2CwPwWc">identity composability by Andrew Hong</a> to lead into a discussion of account- and token-based1 identity. In his article, Peter says:
</p>
<blockquote>
    For Account-based identity, you need to be sure of the identity of the account holder (the User ID / Password of your Facebook-account, your company-network, etc.). For Token-based identity (Certified claim about your age for example) you need a certified claim about an attribute of that identity.
</blockquote>

<p>
    In other words, while account-based identity focuses on linking a person in possession of authentication factors to a trove of information, token-based identity is focused on claims about the subject's attributes. More succinctly: account-based identity focuses on who you are whereas token-based identity is focused on what you are. 
</p>

<p>
    One of my favorite scenarios for exploring this is meeting a friend for lunch. You arrive at the restaurant on time and she’s nowhere to be found. You go to the hostess to inquire about the reservation. She tells you that your reservation is correct, and your friend is already there. She escorts you to the table where you greet your friend. You are seated and the hostess leaves you with a menu. Within a few moments, the waitress arrives to take your order. You ask a few questions about different dishes. You both settle on your order and the waitress leaves to communicate with the kitchen. You happily settle in to chat with your friend, while your food is being prepared. Later you might get a refill on a drink, order dessert, and eventually pay.
</p>

<p>
    While you, your friend, the host, and waitstaff recognized, remembered, and interacted with people, places, and things countless times during this scenario, at no time were you required to be identified as a particular person. Even paying with a credit card doesn't require that. Credit cards are a token-based identity system that says something about you rather than who you are. And while you do have an account with your bank, the brilliance of the credit card is that you no longer have to have accounts with every place you want credit. You simply present a token that gives the merchant confidence that they will be paid. Here are a few of the "whats" in this scenario:
</p>
 
     My friend 
     The person sitting at table 3 
     Over 21 
     Guest who ordered the medium-rare steak 
     Someone who needs a refill 
     Excellent tipper 
     Person who owes $179.35 
     Person in possession of a MasterCard 
 

<p>
    You don't need an account at the restaurant for any of this to work. But you do need <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationships</a>. Some, like the relationship with your friend and MasterCard, are long-lived and identified. Most are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/08/ephemeral_relationships.shtml">ephemeral and pseudonymous</a>. While the server at the restaurant certainly "identifies" patrons, they usually forget them as soon as the transaction is complete. And the identification is usually pseudonymous (e.g. "the couple at table three" rather than "Phillip and Lynne Windley").
</p>

<p>
    In the digital realm, we suffer from the problem of not being in proximity to those we're interacting with. As a result, we need a technical means to establish a relationship. Traditionally, we've done that with accounts and identifying, using authentication factors, who is connecting. As a result, all online relationships tend to be long-lived and identified in important ways—even when they don't need to be. This has been a boon to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/life-like_anonymity_and_the_poison_web.shtml">surveillance capitalism</a>.  
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, SSI <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">establishes peer-to-peer relationships using peer DIDs</a> (<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identifiers</a>) that can be forgotten or remembered as needed. These <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">relationships allow secure communication for issuing and presenting credentials</a> that say something about the subject (what) without necessarily identifying the subject (who). This token-based identity system more faithfully mirrors the way identity works in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>
    Account- and token-based identity are not mutually exclusive. In fact, token-based identity often has its roots in an account somewhere, as we discovered about MasterCard. But the key is that you're leveraging that account to avoid being in an administrative relationship in other places. To see that, consider the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">interactions that happen after an automobile accident</a>.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Account and token interactions after an automobile accident  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this scenario, two drivers, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">Alice and Bob, have had an accident</a>. The highway patrol has come to the scene to make an accident report. Both Alice and Bob have a number of credentials (tokens) in their digital wallets that they control and will be important in creating the report:
</p>
 
     Proof of insurance issued by their respective insurance companies 
     Vehicle title issued by the state founded on a vehicle original document from the vehicle's manufacturer. 
     Vehicle registration issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) 
     Driver's license issued by the Department of Public Safety (DPS) in Alice's case and the DMV in Bob's 
     In addition, the patrol officer has a badge from the Highway Patrol.  
 
<p>
    Each of these credentials is the fruit of an account of some kind (i.e. the person was identified as part of the process). But the fact that Alice, Bob, and the patrol officer have tokens of one sort or another that stem from those accounts allows them to act autonomously from those administrative systems to participate in a complex, ad hoc, cross-domain workflow that will play out over the course of days or weeks.
</p>

<p>
    Account-based and token-based identity system co-exist in any sufficiently complex ecosystem. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) doesn't replace administrative identity systems, it gives us another tool that enables better privacy, more flexible interactions, and increased autonomy. In the automobile scenario, for example, Alice and Bob will have an ephemeral relationship that lasts a few weeks. They'll likely never see the patrol officer after the initial encounter. Alice and Bob would make and sign statements that everyone would like to have confidence in. The police officer would create an accident report. All of this is so complex and unique that it is unlikely to ever happen within a single administrative identity system or on some kind of platform. 
</p>

<p>
    Token-based identity allows people to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">operationalize their digital lives</a> by supporting online interactions that are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">multi-source</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/09/fluid_multi-pseudonymity.shtml">fluid multi-pseudonymous</a>, and decentralized. Ensuring that the token-based identity system is also <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign</a> ensures that people can act autonomously without being within someone else's administrative identity system as they go about their online lives. I think of it as digital embodiment—giving people a way to be peers with other actors in online interactions. 
</p>

 
<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     I'm using "token" in the general sense here.  I'm not referring to either cryptocurrency or hardware authentication devices specifically.

<p>Art- A call for New Industry Data Exchange Models, The Trust Chain, and A Connected Individual Transaction And Identity Scoring Scheme: An Interview with Virginie Debris of GMS</p>
<p>I recently sat down with Virginie Debris, the Chief Product Officer for <a href="https://www.gms-worldwide.com/">Global Messaging Service</a> (GMS) and Board Member of the <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/about/global-board/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a>, to talk about personal data and identity (PD&amp;I). We had an enlightening discussion (<a href="https://youtu.be/ftJ_4800W2Y">see video of the interview: 46:16 min)</a>). The conversation took us down unexpected paths and brought several insights and recommendations to light.</p>
<p>In our interview, we discussed the role of personal data and identity and how enterprises use it to know and serve their customers and protect the enterprises’ interests. To my delight, we uncovered three ideas that could help us all better protect PD&amp;I and improve the market’s efficiency.</p>
 
 Idea One: Build out and refine “The Trust Chain”, or “chain of trust,” a PD&amp;I industry value chain framework envisioned by Virginie. 
 Idea Two: Refine PD&amp;I industry practices, optimize all of the data that mobile operators are holding on to, and ensure that appropriate technical, legal, and ethical exchange mechanisms are in place to ensure responsible use of PD&amp;I. 
 Idea Three: Standardize a connected individual identity scoring scheme, i.e., a scheme for identity and transaction verification, often centralized around mobile data. This scheme is analogous to credit scoring for lending and fraud detection for credit card purchases. It would help enterprises simultaneously better serve their customers, protect PD&amp;I, mitigate fraud, and improve their regulatory compliance efforts. 
 
<p>According to Virginie, a commercial imperative for an enterprise is knowing their customer–verifying the customer’s identity prior to and during engagements. Knowing the customer helps enterprises not only better serve the customer, but also manage costs, reduce waste, mitigate fraud, and stay on the right side of the law and regulations. Virginie remarked that her customers often say, “I want to know who is my end user. Who am I talking to? Am I speaking to the right person in front of me?” This is hard enough in the physical realm, and in the digital realm it is even more difficult. The ideas discussed in this interview can help enterprises answer these questions.</p>
 Consumer Identity and the Enterprise 
<p>The mobile phone has become a cornerstone for digital identity management and commerce. In fact, Cameron D’Ambrosi, Managing Director of Liminal, has gone as far as to suggest <a>mobile has an irreplaceable role in the digital identity ecosystem</a>.<a>1</a> Mobile can help enterprises be certain whom they are dealing with, and with this certainty help them, with confidence, successfully connect, communicate, and engage people in nearly any transactions.</p>
<p>To successfully leverage mobile as a tool for customer identity management, which is an enabler of what is known as “know your customer” or KYC, enterprises work with organizations like GMS to integrate mobile identity verification into their commercial workflow. In our interview, Virginie notes that GMS is a global messaging aggregator, the “man in the middle.” It provides messaging and related services powered by personal data and identity to enterprises and mobile operators, including KYC services.</p>
 Benefits gained from knowing your customer 
<p>There is a wide range of use cases for why an enterprise may want to use services provided by players like GMS. They can:</p>
 
 Improve customer experience: Knowing the customer and the context of a transaction can help improve the customer experience. 
 Maintain data hygiene: Ensuring data in a CRM or customer system of record that is accurate can improve marketing, save money, reduce fraud, and more. 
 Effectively manage data: Reducing duplicate records, tagging data, and more can reduce costs, create efficiency, and generate new business opportunities (side note: <a>poor data management costs enterprises billions annually</a>).<a>2</a> 
 Ensure regulatory compliance: Industry and government best practices, legislation, and regulation is not just nice to have; it is a business requirement. Staying compliant can mitigate risk, build trust, and help organizations differentiate themselves in the market. 
 Mitigate cybercrime: Cybercrime is costing industry trillions of dollars a year (<a>Morgan (2020) predicts the tally could be as much as $10.5 trillion annually by 2025</a>).<a>3</a>These losses can be reduced with an effective strategy. 
 
 The connected individual identity scoring scheme 
<p>When a consumer signs up for or buys a product or service, an enterprise may prompt them to provide a mobile number and other personal data as part of the maintenance of their profile and to support the transaction. An enterprise working with GSM, in real-time, can ping GMS’s network to verify if the consumer-provided mobile number is real, i.e., operational. Moreover, they can ask GMS to predict, with varying levels of accuracy, if a mobile number and PD&amp;I being used in a transaction is associated with a real person. They can also ask if the presumed person conducting the transaction can be trusted or if they might be a fraudster looking to cheat the business. This is a decision based on relevant personal information provided by the individual prior to or during the transaction, as well as data drawn from other sources.</p>
<p>This type of real-time identity and trust verification is made possible by a process Virginie refers to as “scoring.” I refer to it as “the connected individual identity scoring scheme.” Scoring is an intricate and complex choreography of data management and analysis, executed by GMS in milliseconds. This dance consists of pulling together and analyzing a myriad of personal data, deterministic and probabilistic identifiers, and mobile phone signals. The actors in this dance include GMS, the enterprise, the consumer, and GMS’s strategic network of mobile network operators and PD&amp;I aggregator partners.</p>
<p>When asked by an enterprise to produce a score, GMS, in real-time, combines and analyzes enterprise-provided data (e.g., customer name, addresses, phone number, presumed location, etc.), mobile operator signal data (e.g., the actual location of a phone, SIM card, and number forwarding status), and PD&amp;I aggregator supplied data. From this information, it produces a score. This score is used to determine the likelihood a transaction being initiated by “someone” is legitimate and can be trusted, or not. A perfect score of 1 would suggest that, with one hundred percent certainty, the person is who they say they are and can be trusted, and a score of zero would suggest they are most certainly a cybercriminal.</p>
<p>In our interview, Virginie notes, “nothing is perfect, we need to admit that,” thus suggesting that one should never expect a perfect score. The more certain a business wants to be, i.e.&nbsp;the higher score they require to confirm a transaction, the more the business should expect the possibility of increased transactional costs, time, and friction in the user experience. Keeping this in mind, businesses should develop a risk tolerance matrix, based on the context of a transaction, to determine if they want to accept the current transaction or not. For example, for lower risk or lower cost transactions (e.g., an online pizza order) the business might have a lower assurance tolerance and will accept a lower score. For higher-risk or higher-cost transactions (e.g., a bank wire transfer), they might need a higher assurance tolerance and accept only higher scores.</p>
 Example: Detecting fraud in a banking experience 
<p>Virginie used a bank transaction as an example. She explained that a bank could check if a customer’s mobile phone is near the expected location of a transaction. If it was not, this might suggest there is a possibility of fraud occurring, which would negatively impact the score.</p>
<p>Mobile scoring happens every day, but not always by this name–others refer to it as mobile signaling or mobile device intelligence. However, Virginie alluded to a challenge. There is no industry standard for scoring, which may lead to inconsistencies in execution and bias across the industry. She suggested that more industry collaboration is needed to prevent this.</p>
 The Trust Chain 
<p>During our conversation, Virginie proposed a novel idea which frames what we in the industry could do to optimize the PD&amp;I value and use it responsibly. Virginie said we need to build a chain of trust amongst the PD&amp;I actors, “The Trust Chain”.</p>
<p>I have taken poetic license, based on our conversation, and have illustrated The Trust Chain in the figure below. The figure depicts connected individuals* at the center, resting on a bed of industry players linked to enterprises. A yellow band circles them all to illustrate the flow of personal data and identity throughout the chain.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Defining the connected individual and being phygital: It is so easy in business to get distracted by our labels. It is important to remember the terms we use to refer to the people we serve—prospect, consumer, patient, shopper, investor, user, etc.—are contrived and can distract. These terms are all referring to the same thing: a human, an individual, and more importantly, a contextual state or action at some point along the customer journey, i.e., sometimes I am a shopper considering a product, other times I am a consumer using the product. The shopper and the consumer are not always the same person. Understanding this is important to ensure effective engagement in the connected age. In the context of today’s world and this discussion, the individual is connected. They are connected with phones, tablets, smartwatches, cars, and more. These connections have made us “phygital” beings, merging the digital and physical self. Each and every one of these connections is producing data. 
 
<p>According to Virginie, the key to making the industry more effective and efficient is to tap into more and more of the connected individual data held and managed by mobile network operators. This is because, in her own words, “they know everything.” To tap into this data, Virginie said a number of technical, legal, and ethical complexities must be overcome. In addition, an improved model for data exchange amongst the primary actors of the industry—mobile network operators, enterprises, messaging aggregators (like GMS), and PD&amp;I aggregators—needs to be established. In other words, “The Trust Chain” needs to be refined and built. The presumption behind all of this is that the current models of data exchange can be found wanting.</p>
 What we need to do next 
<p>In summary, the conclusion I draw from my interview with Virginie are that we should come together to tackle:</p>
 
 The technical, legal, and ethical complexities to enable more effective access to the treasure trove of data held by the mobile network operators 
 The standardization of a connected individual scoring scheme 
 The development and integrity for “The Trust Chain” 
 
<p>My takeaway from our discussion is simple, I agree with her ideas. These efforts and more are needed. The use of personal data and identity throughout the industry is accelerating at an exponential rate. To ensure all parties can safely engage, transact, and thrive, it is critical that industry leaders develop a sustainable and responsible, marketplace.</p>

<p>This article shows how Azure AD verifiable credentials can be issued and used in an ASP.NET Core application. An ASP.NET Core Razor page application is used to implement the credential issuer. To issue credentials, the application must manage the credential subject data as well as require authenticated users who would like to add verifiable credentials to their digital wallet. The Microsoft Authenticator mobile application is used as the digital wallet.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/AzureADVerifiableCredentialsAspNetCore">https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/AzureADVerifiableCredentialsAspNetCore</a></p>



<p>Blogs in this series</p>



  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/29/getting-started-with-self-sovereign-identity-ssi/">Getting started with Self Sovereign Identity SSI</a>  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/10/11/challenges-to-self-sovereign-identity/">Challenges to Self Sovereign Identity</a>  



<p>Setup</p>



<p>Two ASP.NET Core applications are implemented to issue and verify the verifiable credentials. The credential issuer must administrate and authenticate its identities to issue verifiable credentials. A verifiable credential issuer should never issue credentials to unauthenticated subjects of the credential. As the verifier normally only authorizes the credential, it is important to know that the credentials were at least issued correctly. We do not know as a verifier who or and mostly what sends the verifiable credentials but at least we know that the credentials are valid if we trust the issuer. It is possible to use private holder binding for a holder of a wallet which would increase the trust between the verifier and the issued credentials.</p>



<p>The credential issuer in this demo issues credentials for driving licenses using Azure AD verifiable credentials. The ASP.NET Core application uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to authenticate all identities. In a real application, the application would be authenticated as well requiring 2FA for all users. Azure AD supports this good. The administrators would also require admin rights, which could be implemented using Azure security groups or Azure roles which are added to the application as claims after the OIDC authentication flow.</p>



<p>Any authenticated identity can request credentials (A driving license in this demo) for themselves and no one else. The administrators can create data which is used as the subject, but not issue credentials for others.</p>



<p>Azure AD verifiable credential setup</p>



<p>Azure AD verifiable credentials is setup using the Azure Docs for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/verifiable-credentials/get-started-request-api">Rest API</a> and the Azure verifiable credential ASP.NET Core sample <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials-dotnet">application</a>. </p>







<p>Following the documentation, a display file and a rules file were uploaded for the verifiable credentials created for this issuer. In this demo, two credential subjects are defined to hold the data when issuing or verifying the credentials. </p>


  {
  "default": {
    "locale": "en-US",
    "card": {
      "title": "National Driving License VC",
      "issuedBy": "Damienbod",
      "backgroundColor": "#003333",
      "textColor": "#ffffff",
      "logo": {
        "uri": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiss-ssi-group/TrinsicAspNetCore/main/src/NationalDrivingLicense/wwwroot/ndl_car_01.png",
        "description": "National Driving License Logo"
      },
      "description": "Use your verified credential to prove to anyone that you can drive."
    },
    "consent": {
      "title": "Do you want to get your Verified Credential?",
      "instructions": "Sign in with your account to get your card."
    },
    "claims": {
      "vc.credentialSubject.name": {
        "type": "String",
        "label": "Name"
      },
      "vc.credentialSubject.details": {
        "type": "String",
        "label": "Details"
      }
    }
  }
}

  


<p>The rules file defines the attestations for the credentials. Two standard claims are used to hold the data, the given_name and the family_name. These claims are mapped to our name and details subject claims and holds all the data. Adding custom claims to Azure AD or Azure B2C is not so easy and so I decided for the demo, it would be easier to use standard claims which works without custom configurations. The data sent from the issuer to the holder of the claims can be sent in the application. It should be possible to add credential subject properties without requiring standard AD id_token claims, but I was not able to set this up in the current preview version.</p>


  {
  "attestations": {
    "idTokens": [
      {
        "id": "https://self-issued.me",
        "mapping": {
          "name": { "claim": "$.given_name" },
          "details": { "claim": "$.family_name" }
        },
        "configuration": "https://self-issued.me",
        "client_id": "",
        "redirect_uri": ""
      }
    ]
  },
  "validityInterval": 2592001,
  "vc": {
    "type": [ "MyDrivingLicense" ]
  }
}
  


<p>The rest of the Azure AD credentials are setup exactly like the documentation. </p>



<p>Administration of the Driving licenses</p>



<p>The verifiable credential issuer application uses a Razor page application which accesses a Microsoft SQL Azure database using Entity Framework Core to access the database. The administrator of the credentials can assign driving licenses to any user. The DrivingLicenseDbContext class is used to define the DBSet  for driver licenses.</p>


  ublic class DrivingLicenseDbContext : DbContext
{
	public DbSet&lt;DriverLicense&gt; DriverLicenses { get; set; }

	public DrivingLicenseDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;DrivingLicenseDbContext&gt; options)
		: base(options)
	{
	}

	protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
	{
		builder.Entity&lt;DriverLicense&gt;().HasKey(m =&gt; m.Id);

		base.OnModelCreating(builder);
	}
}
  


<p>A DriverLicense entity contains the infomation we use to create verifiable credentials.</p>


  public class DriverLicense
{
	[Key]
	public Guid Id { get; set; }
	public string UserName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public DateTimeOffset IssuedAt { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public string FirstName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public DateTimeOffset DateOfBirth { get; set; }
	public string Issuedby { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public bool Valid { get; set; }
	public string DriverLicenseCredentials { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public string LicenseType { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Issuing credentials to authenticated identities</p>



<p>When issuing verifiable credentials using Azure AD Rest API, an IssuanceRequestPayload payload is used to request the credentials which are to be issued to the digital wallet. Verifiable credentials are issued to a digital wallet. The credentials are issued for the holder of the wallet. The payload classes are the same for all API implementations apart from the CredentialsClaims class which contains the subject claims which match the rules file of your definition.</p>


  public class IssuanceRequestPayload
    {
        [JsonPropertyName("includeQRCode")]
        public bool IncludeQRCode { get; set; }

    /// Application specific claims used in the payload of the issue request.

    /// The claims can be mapped to anything then.
    public class CredentialsClaims
    {
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// attribute names need to match a claim from the id_token
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        [JsonPropertyName("given_name")]
        public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        [JsonPropertyName("family_name")]
        public string Details { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }
  


<p>The GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync method sets the data for each identity that requested the credentials. Only a signed in user can request the credentials for themselves. The context.User.Identity is used and the data is selected from the database for the signed in user. It is important that credentials are only issued to authenticated users. Users and the application must be authenticated correctly using 2FA and so on. Per default, the credentials are only authorized on the verifier which is probably not enough for most security flows. </p>


  public async Task&lt;IssuanceRequestPayload&gt; GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync(HttpRequest request, HttpContext context)
{
	var payload = new IssuanceRequestPayload();
	var length = 4;
	var pinMaxValue = (int)Math.Pow(10, length) - 1;
	var randomNumber = RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32(1, pinMaxValue);
	var newpin = string.Format("{0:D" + length.ToString() + "}", randomNumber);

	payload.Issuance.Pin.Length = 4;
	payload.Issuance.Pin.Value = newpin;
	payload.Issuance.CredentialsType = "MyDrivingLicense";
	payload.Issuance.Manifest = _credentialSettings.CredentialManifest;

	var host = GetRequestHostName(request);
	payload.Callback.State = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
	payload.Callback.Url = $"{host}:/api/issuer/issuanceCallback";
	payload.Callback.Headers.ApiKey = _credentialSettings.VcApiCallbackApiKey;

	payload.Registration.ClientName = "Verifiable Credential NDL Sample";
	payload.Authority = _credentialSettings.IssuerAuthority;

	var driverLicense = await _driverLicenseService.GetDriverLicense(context.User.Identity.Name);

	payload.Issuance.Claims.Name = $"{driverLicense.FirstName} {driverLicense.Name}  {driverLicense.UserName}";
	payload.Issuance.Claims.Details = $"Type: {driverLicense.LicenseType} IssuedAt: {driverLicense.IssuedAt:yyyy-MM-dd}";

	return payload;
}
  


<p>The IssuanceRequestAsync method gets the payload data and request credentials from the Azure AD verifiable credentials REST API and returns this value which can be scanned using a QR code in the Razor page. The request returns fast. Depending on how the flow continues, a web hook in the application will update the status in a cache. This cache is persisted and polled from the UI. This could be improved by using SignalR.</p>


  [HttpGet("/api/issuer/issuance-request")]
public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; IssuanceRequestAsync()
{
	try
	{
		var payload = await _issuerService.GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync(Request, HttpContext);
		try
		{
			var (Token, Error, ErrorDescription) = await _issuerService.GetAccessToken();
			if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(Token))
			{
				_log.LogError($"failed to acquire accesstoken: {Error} : {ErrorDescription}");
				return BadRequest(new { error = Error, error_description = ErrorDescription });
			}

			var defaultRequestHeaders = _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders;
			defaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", Token);

			HttpResponseMessage res = await _httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync(
				_credentialSettings.ApiEndpoint, payload);

			var response = await res.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync&lt;IssuanceResponse&gt;();

			if(response == null)
			{
				return BadRequest(new { error = "400", error_description = "no response from VC API"});
			}

			if (res.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Created)
			{
				_log.LogTrace("succesfully called Request API");
	 
				if (payload.Issuance.Pin.Value != null) 
				{
					response.Pin = payload.Issuance.Pin.Value; 
				}

				response.Id = payload.Callback.State;

				var cacheData = new CacheData
				{
					Status = IssuanceConst.NotScanned,
					Message = "Request ready, please scan with Authenticator",
					Expiry = response.Expiry.ToString()
				};
				_cache.Set(payload.Callback.State, JsonSerializer.Serialize(cacheData));

				return Ok(response);
			}
			else
			{
				_log.LogError("Unsuccesfully called Request API");
				return BadRequest(new { error = "400", error_description = "Something went wrong calling the API: " + response });
			}
		}
		catch (Exception ex)
		{
			return BadRequest(new { error = "400", error_description = "Something went wrong calling the API: " + ex.Message });
		}
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		return BadRequest(new { error = "400", error_description = ex.Message });
	}
}
  


<p>The IssuanceResponse is returned to the UI.</p>


  public class IssuanceResponse
{
	[JsonPropertyName("requestId")]
	public string RequestId { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	[JsonPropertyName("url")]
	public string Url { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	[JsonPropertyName("expiry")]
	public int Expiry { get; set; }
	[JsonPropertyName("pin")]
	public string Pin { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	[JsonPropertyName("id")]
	public string Id { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
  


<p>The IssuanceCallback is used as a web hook for the Azure AD verifiable credentials. When developing or deploying, this web hook needs to have a public IP. I use ngrok to test this. Because the issuer authenticates the identities using an Azure App registration, everytime the ngrok URL changes, the redirect URL needs to be updated. Each callback request updates the cache. This API also needs to allow anonymous requests if the rest of the application is authenticated using OIDC. The AllowAnonymous attribute is required, if you use an authenticated ASP.NET Core application.</p>

[HttpPost("/api/issuer/issuanceCallback")]
public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; IssuanceCallback()

<p>Testing and running the applications</p>



<p>Ngrok is used to provide a public callback for the Azure AD verifiable credentials callback. When the application is started, you need to create a driving license. This is done in the administration Razor page. Once a driving license exists, the View driver license Razor page can be used to issue a verifiable credential to the logged in user. A QR Code is displayed which can be scanned to begin the issue flow. </p>







<p>Using the Microsoft authenticator, you can scan the QR Code and add the verifiable credentials to your digital wallet. The credentials can now be used in any verifier which supports the Microsoft Authenticator wallet. The verify ASP.NET Core application can be used to verify and used the issued verifiable credential from the Wallet.</p>

<p>Prelude: First off, if you haven’t already read <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2012-BonneauHerOorSta-password--oakland.pdf">The Quest to Replace the Password</a> stop reading this and give that a read first. To paraphrase my computer security professor, If you haven’t read this paper before you design an authentication system you’re probably just reinventing something already created or missing a piece of the puzzle. So go ahead take a read of that paper first before you continue on. In fact, I just re-read this paper before I started working on it because it does an excellent job of framing the problem.</p>

 

<p>Over the past few years, I’ve spent a fair amount of time thinking about what the next generation of authentication and authorization systems will look like from a variety of different perspectives. I started out looking at the problem from a user’s perspective originally just looking to get rid of passwords. Then I looked at it as an attacker working as an intern penetration tester which gave me a unique eye into understanding the attacker mindset. Unfortunately, I didn’t find myself enjoying the red team side of security too much (combined with having a 2-year non-compete as an intern - that was a joke in hindsight) so by happenstance, I found myself into the standards community where the next generation of authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) systems have been being built. Combine this with the view of a software engineer attempting to build the standards that are being written by some world-class experts with centuries of combined experience. Throughout this experience, I’ve gotten to view the state of the art while also getting to keep the naiveness that comes with being a fairly new engineer relative to some of the experts I get to work with. During this time I’ve become a bit more opinionated on what makes a good authentication system and this time around I’m going to jot down my current thoughts on what makes something useful.</p>

<p>However, one aspect that I think that paper lacks is that it frames the problem of authentication on the web as something where the next goal is to move to something different other than passwords, but we just haven’t found that better thing yet. While I think this is probably true for some aspects of low-security systems I think that fundamentally passwords or more generally, “Things I know” are here to stay. The problem is that we haven’t done a good enough job of understanding the requirements that the user needs to intuitively use the system as well as making sure that the system sufficiently gets out of the way of the user. As the paper does point out though, this is likely due to our specialization bias which doesn’t allow us to take into considerations the holistic view points necessary to approach the problem. What I’m proposing I think is a way in which we can jump this hurdle through the usage of hard data. Read on and let me know if you think this can solve this issue or if I’m just full of my own implicit biases.</p>

<p>So what’re the important insights that I’ve been thinking about lately? First off, the user experience of authenticating on the web has to be joyful first and foremost. If the user doesn’t have a better experience than what they do with passwords, which is a very low bar to beat when considering all the passwords they have to remember, then it’s simply unacceptable and won’t achieve the uptake that’s needed to overtake passwords.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think it’s important that we recognize that the security of any authentication system is probabilistic, not deterministic. By reframing the problem to understand that with each additional security check we do under the classifications of “what I know”, “what I am”, and “what I have” it allows us to better understand the problem we’re actually trying to solve with security. To put this idea in perspective think about the problem this way. What’s the probability that a security system will be broken for any particular user during a particular period? For example, a user who chooses to reuse their password that’s set to “#1password” for every website is a lot less likely (my intuition - happy to be proven wrong) than a user who can memorize a password like “p2D16U$nClNjqLseKTtnjw” for every website. However, there’s a significant tradeoff on the user’s experience which is why the case where a user reuses an easy to remember is a lot more likely to occur when studying users than the latter case even though we know it’s less secure.</p>

<p>So what gives? This all sounds obvious to a semi-well thought-out engineer, right? The difference is we simply don’t know the probability of a security system failing in an ideal scenario over a pre-determined period. To put this in perspective - can anyone point me to an academic research paper or even some user research that tells me the probability that a user’s password will be discovered by an attacker in the next year? What about the probability that the user shares their password with a trusted person because the system wasn’t deployed with a delegation system? Or how about how the probability will drop as the user reuses their password across many websites? Simply put I think we’ve been asking the wrong question here and until we can have hard data on this we can’t make rigorous choices on the acceptable UX/security tradeoffs that are so hard to decide today.</p>

<p>This isn’t relevant for just passwords either, this extends to many different forms of authentication that fall under the other two authentication classes as well. For example, what’s the probability that a user’s account will be breached when relying on the Open ID Connect protocol rather than a password? Furthermore, what’s the likelihood that the user prefers the Open ID Connect system rather than a password for each website, and is that likelihood worth the increase or decrease in probabilistic security under one or many attack vectors?</p>

<p>The best part of this framing is that it changes how we look at security on the web from the user’s perspective, but that’s not the only part that has to be considered as is rightly pointed in the paper. There’s a very important third factor that has to be considered as well which is deployability, which I like to reframe as “developer experience” or DevX.</p>

<p>By evaluating a constraint of a system in this way we reframe the problem into a measurable outcome that becomes far more tractable and measurable between the variety of constraints that need to be considered including the developer deploying or maintaining the system, the user who’s using it, and the resistance to common threats (Don’t worry about unrealistic threat models for now - mature them over time) which the user expects the designers of the system to protect them from.</p>

<p>Once we’ve got that data let’s sit down and re-evaluate what are the most important principles of designing the system. I’ll make a few predictions to wrap this up as well.</p>

<p>First prediction: I think once we have this data we’ll see a few different things which will be obvious in hindsight. A system that doesn’t prioritize UX over DevX over probabilistic security resilience will be dead in the water since it goes against the “user should enjoy the authentication experience principle”. Additionally, DevX has to come before security because without a good devX it’s less likely to be implemented at all let alone properly.</p>

<p>Second prediction: I’d venture to guess that we’ll learn a few things about the way we frame security on the web with the clear winner being that we should be designing for MFA systems by default, but “what I have” categories need to be the basis of the majority of experiences for the user with the “what I know” categories being an escalated approach with “what I am” categories only being needed in the highest assurance use cases or at the time of more red flags having been raised (e.g. new IP address, new device, etc) and being enforced on-device rather than handled by a remote server.</p>

<p>Final prediction: Recovery is going to be the hardest part of the system to figure out with multi-device flows being only slightly easier to solve. I wouldn’t be surprised if the solution to recovery was actually to not recover and instead make it super easy to “burn and recreate” (as John Jordan has advocated in the decentralized identity community) an account on the web because that’s how hard recovery actually is to get right.</p>

<p>So that’s what I’ve got for now. I’m sure I’m missing something here and I’m sure I’m wrong in a few other cases. Share your comments on this down below or feel free to send me an email and tell me I’m wrong. I do appreciate the thoughtfulness that others put into pointing these things out so let me know what you think and let’s discuss it further. Thanks for reading!</p>

    We spend most of our waking hours being held to account between the guardrails of risk-informed and responsible decision making.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, we often climb over the guardrails and make ill-informed, irresponsible and irrational decisions, but that is human agency. It is also true that we would not innovate, create or discover if we could not explore the other side of our safety guardrails.&nbsp; <p>Today’s perception of responsible decision making is different to that our grandparents held.&nbsp; Our grandchildren will look back at our “risk-informed” decisions with the advantage of hindsight and question why our risk management frameworks were so short-term-focused.&nbsp; However, we need to recognise that our guardrails are established by current political, economic and societal framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What are we optimising for?”</p><p>I often ask the question, “what are we optimising for?” The reason I ask this question is to draw out different viewpoints in a leadership team.&nbsp; The viewpoints that drive individual optimisation is framed by their experience, ability to understand time-frames and incentives.&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Paradox is a non-confrontational framework to explore our different perceptions of what we are optimising for.&nbsp; We need different and diverse views to ensure that our guardrails don’t become so narrow they look like rail tracks, and we repeat the same mistakes because that is what the process determines.&nbsp; Equally, we must agree together boundaries of divergence which means we can optimise as a team for something that we believe in and has a shared purpose of us and our stakeholders.&nbsp; Finding this dynamic area of alignment is made easier with the Peak Paradox framework.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our model of risk-informed responsible decision making is based on the idea that the majority decides, essentially democracy.&nbsp; If the “majority” is a supermajority, we need 76%; for a simple majority, we need 51%, and for minority protections less than 10%.&nbsp; What we get depends on how someone has previously set up the checks, balances, and control system. And then there is the idea of monarchy or the rich and powerful making the decisions for everyone else, the 0.001%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, our guardrails for democratic decision making breaks down when there is a need for choices, decisions, judgement that has to be made that people do not like.&nbsp; How do we enable better decisions when hard decisions mean you will lose the support of the majority?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>We do not all agree with vaccines (even before covid), eating meat, climate change, our government or authority.&nbsp; Vaccines in the current global pandemic period are one such tension of divergence.&nbsp; We see this every day in the news feeds; there is an equal and opposite view for every side.&nbsp; Humanity at large lives at Peak Paradox, but we don’t equally value everyone views. Why do we struggle with the idea that individual liberty of choice can be taken away in the interests of everyone?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Climate change is another.&nbsp; Should the government act in the longer term and protect the future or act in the short term persevering liberty and ensure re-election?&nbsp; Protestors with a cause may fight authority and are portrayed as mavericks and disruptors, but history remembers many as pioneers, martyrs and great leaders.&nbsp; Those who protested in the 1960 and 1970s against nuclear energy may look back today and think that they should have been fighting fossil fuels.&nbsp; Such pioneers are optimising for something outside of the normal guardrails. Whilst they appear to be living outside of the accepted guardrails, they can see they should be adopted.</p><p>Our guardrails work well when we can agree on the consequences of risk-informed and responsible decision making; however, in an age when information is untrusted and who is responsible is questioned, we find that we all have different guardrails.&nbsp; Living at Peak Paradox means we have to accept we will never agree on what is a responsible decision and we are likely to see that our iteration of democracy that maintains power and control is going to end in a revolution if we could only agree on what to optimise for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>

    Are the consequence of a ½ baked decision that we created (the mess we are in)squared <br><p>This article joins how the #climate outcomes we get may be related to the evidence requirements we set.&nbsp; The audience for this viewpoint is those who are thinking about the long term consequences of our current decisions and the evidence we use to support those decisions. We are hoping to bring a sense of clarity to our community on why we feel frustrated and lost. You should read this because it will make you think and it will raise questions we need to debate over coffee as we search to become better versions of ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>@yaelrozencwajg @yangbo @tonyfish </p><p>The running order is: Which camp are you in for positioning of the crisis: know and accepted, still questioning or denial. &nbsp; What are the early approaches to solutions?&nbsp; What are policymakers doing and what is their perspective.&nbsp; The action is to accept the invitation to debate at the end.</p><br><p>Part 1. Sustainability set up</p><p>The world appears more opinionated and divided about everything.&nbsp; Climate change: real or not.&nbsp; Vaccination for COVID19 conspiracy and control or in the public best interest.&nbsp; Space travel for billionaires or feeding those in need. Universal basic income policy vs ignoring those aspects of society we find uncomfortable. Equality creates a more fair society or leaves us alone. So many votes are for self-interest, “it is fairer to me.”&nbsp; Transparency will hold those in power to account or it will only make or worse. Open networks might create new business models on the web, but will they be sustainable? Sustainability is a false claim or it is our only option. Like books, and publications it is now complexity that is the tool that ensures power remains with the few.</p><p>We need to unpack the conflictual and tension-filled gaps in our beliefs, opinions and judgment because we depend on evidence to change our views. How evidence is presented and the systematic squeezing out of curiosity frames us and our current views.&nbsp;</p><p>Evidence, in this context, is actually a problem as we have a very divided idea of what evidence is.&nbsp; For some, evidence is a social media post from an influencer with 10 million followers (how can everyone else be wrong).&nbsp; For others a headline on the front of a tabloid newspaper is truth (is it printed.)&nbsp; For others, a statistical peer-reviewed leading journal publication that is cited 100 times is evidence.&nbsp; In terms of evidence for decision making, there is a gap between the evidence requirements for research and the evidence requirements for business decisions.&nbsp; To be clear, it is not that either is better; it is how we frame evidence that matters. The danger is being framed to believe something because there is a mismatch in the evidence requirements for a decision.&nbsp; A single 100% influencer claim without statistical proof say about “fertility” vs a statistical trial with probability highlights both how a claim is only a claim but many will not understand what evidence is.</p><p>Why is this important? Because the evidence we see in journals, TV, media, books and publications have different criteria and credentials to those that inform business decisions.&nbsp; Where is the environmental action being decided; in the board rooms!&nbsp; Is this gap in evidence leading to a sustainability gap?</p><p></p><br><p>Part 2. Analysis from Kahan&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the rub, it turns out that how scientific evidence is presented matters as its very presentation creates division.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, a Yale behavioural economist, has spent the last decade studying whether the use of reason aggravates or reduces “partisan” beliefs. His research papers are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=45442">here</a>. His research shows that aggravation and alienation easily win, irrespective of being more liberal or conservative. The more we use our faculties for scientific thought, the more likely we will take a strong position that aligns with our (original) political group (or thought).</p><p>A way through this could be to copy “<a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">solution journalism</a>”, which reports on ways people and governments meaningfully respond to difficult problems and not on what the data says the problem is. Rather than use our best insights, analysis and thinking to reach the version of the “truth”, we use data to find ways to agree with others opinions in our communities. We help everyone to become curious. Tony Fish has created the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a> as an approach to remaining curious by identifying where we are aligned and where there is a delta in views without conflict.</p><p>When we use data and science in our arguments and explain the problem, the individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values. They (we) (I) assimilate what they (we)(I) want.</p><p>Kahan, in 2014, asked over <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459057">1,500 respondents</a> whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “There is solid evidence of recent global warming due mostly to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.” They collected information on individuals' political beliefs and rated their science intelligence.” The analysis found that those with the least science intelligence actually have less partisan positions than those with the most. A Conservative with strong science intelligence will use their skills to find evidence against human-caused global warming, while a Liberal will find evidence for it (cognitive bias.)</p><p></p><p>In the chart above, the y-axis represents the probability of a person agreeing that human activity caused climate change. The x-axis represents the percentile a person scored on the scientific knowledge test. The width of the bars shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for that probability.</p><br><p>Part 3. Are our policies being formed by the evidence we like or evidence we have?</p><p>Governments, activists, and the media have gotten better at holding corporations accountable for the societal repercussions of their actions. A plethora of groups score businesses based on their ESG&nbsp; performance, and despite often dubious methodology, these rankings are gathering a lot of attention. As a result, ESG has emerged as an unavoidable concern for corporate executives worldwide. ESG should be for boards for “purpose” or “are we doing the right thing” camp, but instead has ended up in the compliance camp, do the min, tick box.</p><p>For decades businesses have addressed sustainability as an end of pipe problem or afterthought. Rather than fundamentally altering their models to recognise that sustainability and wellbeing are critical parts for long term success, boards have typically delegated social issues to corporate social responsibility, compliance policies, or charitable foundations and associations, thus they publish their findings (which is not evidence) in annual reports. The issue becomes that neither investors nor stakeholders read these sustainability reports. Actually, they shouldn’t either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although investors' thinking on sustainability has evolved substantially over the past few decades, sustainability and efficiency leaders have used strategies to pressure corporations to advance a wide range of social concerns such as the SDGs across industries and supply chains, regardless of the financial considerations. As ESG assessments, sustainability reports or guidelines have become more rigorous; this accountability raises essential biases. This “pressure” has resulted in many types of actions and raised many concerns, including in the operational efficiencies supposed to reduce the use of energy and natural resources at the expense of their profitability.</p><p>Whilst it is still unclear if most investors utilise ESGs factors in their investment selection process based on evidence, it is clear that we do side with what we want to hear and not with the science, <a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, in part 2 above, was right.</p><br><p>Part 4. Null Hypothesis H(0) A lack of headspace for most people to think about the complexity of these issues due to meeting performance targets means leadership has to make time. And if it does not, we become the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At what point do people care about something bigger than themselves? This means you as a person have the headspace to move from survival towards thriving. (PeakParadox.com)</p><p>If ⅓ of the world don’t know where the next meal today comes from, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next additional ⅓ of the world don’t know where the food will come from for tomorrow, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next ⅙ of the world will run out of food and money in 4 weeks - worrying about sustainability is not their most significant concern.</p><p>Less than ⅙ of the world can survive and think beyond four weeks - is that enough to make a difference, and are these people in roles that count?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Between than 0.01% and 0.001%&nbsp; (8m and 80m) people should be able to consider global complexity on the basis that they will never have money or food issues (over $1m in assets), but are they acting together and is their voice enough to make a difference?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Is leadership's first priority to ensure that first ⅚ have enough to survive and worry for them, but are they able to manage this conflict?&nbsp; Which group has the headspace to cope with recycling?&nbsp; What is amazing and worthy of note is that the majority of those who care about the environment, sustainability, recycling have created headspace irrespective of their situation. The argument above was designed to frame your thinking, the reality is we don’t create headspace because we are too busy.</p><p>Part 5.&nbsp; The imposter syndrome: followers are not followers</p><p>Politics (leadership), Business (leadership), Quango/ NGO (leadership), individuals (leadership), influencers (leadership) - all have different agendas, and demands for different outcomes as incentives drive in different directions. &nbsp; We lack sustainable leadership that drives in one direction.&nbsp;</p><p>As a Leader and opinion former, the most troubling finding should be that individuals with more “scientific intelligence” are the quickest to align themselves on subjects they don’t know anything about. In one experiment, Kahan analysed how people’s opinions on an unfamiliar subject are affected when given some basic scientific information, along with details about what people in their self-identified political group tend to believe about that subject. It turned out that those with the strongest scientific reasoning skills were most likely to use the information to develop partisan opinions.</p><p>Critically Kahan’s research shows that people that score well on a measure called “scientific curiosity” actually show less partisanship, and it is this aspect we need to use.</p><p>Do we need to move away from “truth”, “facts”, “data”, and “right decisions” if we want to have a board and senior team who can become aligned? We need to present ideas, concepts, how others are finding solutions and make our teams more curious. Being curious appears to be the best way to bring us together — however counterintuitive that is.&nbsp; But to do that, we have to give up on filling time, productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, keeping people busy and giving more people time to escape survival and work together for the better good.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a systematic squeezing out of curiosity in our current system.&nbsp; Are we to blame through schooling and education, and search engines? Have we lost how to be curious if the fact and truth presented to us is one that just aligns to our natural bias or one that challenges us? &nbsp; Do we spend sufficient time with others' views to be able to improve our own?&nbsp; Has individualism and personalisation created and reinforced our self opinions of our own views are correct?&nbsp; Does the advertising model depend on this divide?<br><br></p><p>Part 6. Conclusion, rationality and irrationality&nbsp; <br><br></p><p>There is a clear message to those in leadership; stop using evidence to create division, push people away or sure up your own camp. How do we take (all) evidence in and use it to ask questions which mean we come together for a common purpose?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Politics becomes irrational as we focus more on the individual and less on society and community. Politicians and policy formation need to be voted in, which means they have to mislead and misrepresent their populations who are acting in their own interests: therefore, we find evidence for decisions for short term gain based on individual preferences and not long term community - this is obvious but has to be said.&nbsp; The same is happening in many corporations.</p><p>Anger is often seen as a rational emotion, but that is because we focus on the evidence we want to justify the action. When you feel under-represented, threatened, or in harm's way - the evidence you want will fit the glove. Understanding how the evidence frames us is what brings value to the process.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Part 7. Call to action: The Road to Sustainability webinar series</p><p>We believe we have to communicate better, talk openly, listen to more, debate to appreciate, be curious and find a route to collaborate. The best way is to do something small.&nbsp; Sign up for the sessions below and bring your evidence, but be prepared to take away different evidence so we can make better decisions together.&nbsp;</p><p>The Road to Sustainability is a content and tool platform and initiative launched in October 2020 that started as a weekly email newsletter providing approaches and strategies to plan sustainability and innovation. We are launching the third edition of our webinar series, following up on the successful two previous versions, “From chaos to recovery: gateway to sustainability”.<br><br>This new series will take place every Monday through 5 meetings from October 4th to November 8th, with a possible extension of the plan.<br><br>The following schedule is based on our approach "<a href="https://event.theroadtosustainability.com.">Roadmap and product management - the new framework for sustainability conversations</a>". The sessions have an informative purpose and constitute sets of criteria to help organisations in their operations towards sustainability:</p><p>Please register here: <a href="https://event.theroadtosustainability.com">https://event.theroadtosustainability.com</a>.</p> <br>

<blockquote>"It was hard to write, it should be hard to use" </blockquote><p>The quote above was something a programmer friend of mine used to say in the '90s and, despite all the advances in user experience or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">UX design</a>, it appears to remain effectively true. Let's look at the experience over this past weekend with the newly rolled out <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/proof-covid-19-vaccination">enhanced vaccine certificate</a> in Ontario.</p><p>Let me preface this by saying that I appreciate that this may be version 1 of a certificate with a QR code and that my comments are intended for an improved version 1.x or 2 of the proof of vaccination. I should also note that CBC has already pointed out that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vaccine-certificate-accessibility-1.6213934">Ontario's enhanced vaccine certificate system is not accessible to marginalized people</a>.</p> Downloading the Certificate <p>You will need to go to <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/get-proof/">https://covid-19.ontario.ca/get-proof/</a> and answer the following questions:</p>  How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine do you currently have? (required)   Did you get all your doses in Ontario? (required)  Select which health card you have (required)  Do you identify as First Nations, Inuit, or Métis? (required) If you are a non-Indigenous partner or household member of someone in this group, select "Yes."  A couple of more clicks (get the certificate through the website or get it by mail or print it at a local library, ServiceOntario location, or call a friend and you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://covid19.ontariohealth.ca/app-terms">Terms of Service</a> which includes the following:  <blockquote>By inputting your personal information and personal health information into the COVID-19 Vaccination Services you are agreeing to the ministry's collection, use and disclosure of this information for the purpose of researching, investigating, eliminating or reducing the current COVID-19 outbreak and as permitted or required by law in accordance with PHIPA as set out above. You also agree that your information will be made available to the Public Health Unit(s) in Ontario responsible for your geographic area for the same purpose.</blockquote><blockquote>More specifically, by using COVID-19 Vaccination Services, you consent to the ministry collecting identifying information, including personal health information, about you that you submit through the patient verification page so that the Ministry can ensure that it correctly identifies you for the purpose of administering the COVID-19 vaccination program.</blockquote><blockquote>Neither the ministry nor the Public Health Unit(s) in Ontario will further use or disclose your personal information or personal health information except for the purposes set out above.</blockquote><p>When you click on the "Get a copy" button you may be asked to wait because a virtual queue is being used to throttle traffic. When you get through you will be asked to provide information from your health card. I have a green OHIP card with a photo so I get this screen:</p><p>Assuming the information is correct you will be shown your new certificate, including a QR code (more on this later) as a PDF. At this point, it is on you to print out copies of the two-page certificate and carry them with you. I took it upon myself to crop the certificate to include just my name, birth date &amp; the QR code and print it out small enough that I could put it in a laminating pouch and carry it in my wallet. This enables me to go to my wallet, pull out the laminate and my driving license, and have both ready for presentation. For me, that is the simplest and easiest way. Your mileage may vary since my approach requires being comfortable with basic pdf or graphic editing and having access to a printer. I also put electronic copies on my phone so that I could use that option </p> Verifying the certificate <p>Here is what I observed at brunch (shout out to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d796688-Reviews-Sunset_Grill-Toronto_Ontario.html">Sunset Grill on the Danforth</a>).</p>  Staff person asks for Proof of Vaccine  Customer digs out their phone or paper copy of the certificate  The staff person looks at it (or uses the Ontario Verify App)  Staff person asks for a government-issued ID  Customer digs out their driver's license  The staff person looks at the ID and verifies the name   We can do better <p>What I oberved is NOT a user-friendly experience for either the customer or the business. For the experience to be improved it needs to be a single presentation operation of either a paper or digital certificate that the business can verify in one step. Here's an example that I mocked up some months ago (the picture is from <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/</a>)</p><p>This provides the following functionality:</p>  The existing QR code will return the same (i.e. green checkmark in the event of a good code)  The verifier (staff person) can compare the photo on the card with the person in front of them rather than asking for a government ID.  Digital verification may have the option of showing the verifier the picture on the verify app for increased assurance. Note that the Ministry of Health is already authorized to have pictures for the current health card.   Privacy and Security <p>The advantage of a paper and ID card presentation ritual is that it is difficult to hack. So if we are going to improve the presentation with a single credential as above, privacy and security MUST be protected. This is why a version 1 that is paper/PDF only is not a bad security and privacy choice. On the <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify">Verify Ontario </a>app side, both the <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify-terms-of-use">terms of use</a> and <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify-privacy">privacy statement</a> are reasonably clear (although the choice to use Google Analytics could be questioned) and make the right commitments &nbsp;</p> Recommendations  Provide retailers with a verifier <p>It's nice that the Ontario Verify app is freely downloadable. I used it to check that the laminated cards that I made from my own certificate were readable. But this puts the burden on the retailer and their staff. When I saw someone come in with their QR code, the waitress had to dig out her personal phone and use that. Not a good solution. Either the provincial government or public health should provide retailers with a low to zero cost option to procure their own tablets for use on entry to the store.</p> Provide Ontarians with options <p>For example:</p>  I'm relatively tech-savvy so I'd be happy with a QR code/certificate I could add to a wallet app on my phone for easy display without fumbling around.  ServiceOntario should provide a service to produce laminated wallet cards WITH photos to any Ontarian who shows up at a ServiceOntario site.  On a go-forward basis, ensure that people attending vaccination clinics get printouts of their QR code based certificates WHEN they get vaccinated since the certificate includes the date of vaccination and presumably the QR code won't return a "Green" until the appropriate dated  <p>With all of the above said, I have to say I'm happy that Ontario's first steps for vaccine certificates appear to have respected Ontarians' privacy and look to be built securely. I look forward to the next couple of weeks because I'm sure that security people will be pounding on the service to find flaws. WHEN they find flaws, let's hope that the province is responsive so that we can all benefit. &nbsp;</p>

This is useful if you have a designated account to manage or create meetings, send emails or would like to provide a service for users without an office account to create meetings. This is a follow up post to part one in this series which creates Teams meetings using delegated permissions. </p>

  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/09/20/creating-microsoft-teams-meetings-in-asp-net-core-using-microsoft-graph/">Creating Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph</a> (delegated)  



<p>Setup Azure App registration</p>



<p>A simple ASP.NET Core application with no authentication was created and implements a form which creates online meetings on behalf of a designated account using Microsoft Graph with application permissions. The Microsoft Graph client uses an Azure App registration for authorization and the client credentials flow is used to authorize the client and get an access token. No user is involved in this flow and the application requires administration permissions in the Azure App registration for Microsoft Graph. </p>



<p>An Azure App registration is setup to authenticate against Azure AD. The ASP.NET Core application will use application permissions for the Microsoft Graph. The listed permissions underneath are required to create the Teams meetings OBO and to send emails to the attendees using the configuration email which has access to office.</p>



<p>Microsoft Graph application permissions:</p>



  User.Read.All  Mail.Send   Mail.ReadWrite   OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All  



<p>This is the list of permissions I have activate for this demo. </p>







<p>Configuration</p>



<p>The Azure AD configuration is used to get a new access token for the Microsoft Graph client and to define the email of the account which is used to create Microsoft Teams meetings and also used to send emails to the attendees. This account needs an office account.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"TenantId": "5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244",
	"ClientId": "b9be5f88-f629-46b0-ac4c-c5a4354ac192",
	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
	"MeetingOrganizer": "--your-email-for-sending--"
},
  


<p>Setup Client credentials flow to for Microsoft Graph</p>



<p>A number of different ways can be used to authorize a Microsoft Graph client and is a bit confusing sometimes. Using the DefaultCredential is not really a good idea for Graph because you need to decide if you use a delegated authorization or a application authorization and the DefaultCredential will take the first one which works and this depends on the environment. For application authorization, I use the  ClientSecretCredential Identity to get the service access token. This requires the .default scope and a client secret or a client credential. Using a client secret is fine if you control both client and server and the secret is stored in an Azure Key Vault. A client certificate could also be used.</p>


  private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClient()
{
	string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
	var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
	var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

	// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
	var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

	return new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
}
  


<p>The IConfidentialClientApplication interface could also be used to get access tokens which is used to authorize the Graph client. A simple in memory cache is used to store the access token. This token is reused until it expires or the application is restart. If using multiple instances, maybe a distributed cache would be better. The client uses the “<a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/.default&amp;#8221">https://graph.microsoft.com/.default&amp;#8221</a>; scope to get an access token for the Microsoft Graph client. A GraphServiceClient instance is returned with a value access token. </p>


  public class ApiTokenInMemoryClient
{
	private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
	private readonly ILogger&lt;ApiTokenInMemoryClient&gt; _logger;

	private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
	private readonly IConfidentialClientApplication _app;
	private readonly ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, AccessTokenItem&gt; _accessTokens = new();

	private class AccessTokenItem
	{
		public string AccessToken { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public DateTime ExpiresIn { get; set; }
	}

	public ApiTokenInMemoryClient(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
		IConfiguration configuration, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
	{
		_clientFactory = clientFactory;
		_configuration = configuration;
		_logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger&lt;ApiTokenInMemoryClient&gt;();
		_app = InitConfidentialClientApplication();
	}

	public async Task&lt;GraphServiceClient&gt; GetGraphClient()
	{
		var result = await GetApiToken("default");

		var httpClient = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
		httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result);
		httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

		var graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(httpClient)

				await Task.FromResult&lt;object&gt;(null);

		};

		return graphClient;
	}

		{
			var accessToken = _accessTokens.GetValueOrDefault(api_name);
			if (accessToken.ExpiresIn &gt; DateTime.UtcNow)
			{
				return accessToken.AccessToken;
			}
			else
			{
				// remove
				_accessTokens.TryRemove(api_name, out _);
			}
		}

		_logger.LogDebug($"GetApiToken new from STS for {api_name}");

		// add
		var newAccessToken = await AcquireTokenSilent();
		_accessTokens.TryAdd(api_name, newAccessToken);

		return newAccessToken.AccessToken;
	}

	{
		//var scopes = "User.read Mail.Send Mail.ReadWrite OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All";
		var authResult = await _app
			.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes: new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" })
			.WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"])
			.ExecuteAsync();

		return new AccessTokenItem
		{
			ExpiresIn = authResult.ExpiresOn.UtcDateTime,
			AccessToken = authResult.AccessToken
		};
	}

	private IConfidentialClientApplication InitConfidentialClientApplication()
	{
		return ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
			.Create(_configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"])
			.WithClientSecret(_configuration["AzureAd:ClientSecret"])
			.Build();
	}
}
  


<p>OnlineMeetings Graph Service</p>



<p>The AadGraphApiApplicationClient service is used to send the Microsoft Graph requests. This uses the graphServiceClient client with the correct access token. The GetUserIdAsync method is used to get the Graph Id using the UPN. This is used in the Users API to run the requests with the application scopes. The Me property is not used as this is for delegated scopes. We have no user in this application. We run the requests as an application on behalf of the designated user.</p>


  public class AadGraphApiApplicationClient
{
	private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

	public AadGraphApiApplicationClient(IConfiguration configuration)
	{
		_configuration = configuration;
	}

	private async Task&lt;string&gt; GetUserIdAsync()
	{
		var meetingOrganizer = _configuration["AzureAd:MeetingOrganizer"];
		var filter = $"startswith(userPrincipalName,'{meetingOrganizer}')";
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var users = await graphServiceClient.Users
			.Request()
			.Filter(filter)
			.GetAsync();

		return users.CurrentPage[0].Id;
	}

	public async Task SendEmailAsync(Message message)
	{
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var saveToSentItems = true;

		var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

		await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
			.SendMail(message, saveToSentItems)
			.Request()
			.PostAsync();
	}

	public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; CreateOnlineMeeting(OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting)
	{
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

		return await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
			.OnlineMeetings
			.Request()
			.AddAsync(onlineMeeting);
	}

	public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; UpdateOnlineMeeting(OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting)
	{
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

		return await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
			.OnlineMeetings[onlineMeeting.Id]
			.Request()
			.UpdateAsync(onlineMeeting);
	}

	public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; GetOnlineMeeting(string onlineMeetingId)
	{
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

		return await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
			.OnlineMeetings[onlineMeetingId]
			.Request()
			.GetAsync();
	}

	private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClient()
	{
		string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
		var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

		// Values from app registration
		var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
		var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

		var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
		{
			AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
		};

		// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
		var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
			tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

		return new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
	}
}


  


<p>The startup class adds the services as required. No authentication is added for the ASP.NET Core application.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddScoped&lt;AadGraphApiApplicationClient&gt;();
	services.AddSingleton&lt;ApiTokenInMemoryClient&gt;();
	services.AddScoped&lt;EmailService&gt;();
	services.AddScoped&lt;TeamsService&gt;();
	services.AddHttpClient();
	services.AddOptions();

	services.AddRazorPages();
}
  


<p>Azure Policy configuration</p>



<p>We need to allow applications to access online meetings on behalf of a user with this setup. This is implemented using the following documentation:</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy</a></p>



<p>Testing</p>



<p>When the application is started, you can create a new Teams meeting with the required details. The configuration email must have an account with access to Office and be on the same tenant as the Azure App registration setup for the Microsoft Graph application permissions. The Email must have a policy setup to allow the Microsoft Graph calls. The Teams meeting is organized using the identity that signed in because we used the applications permissions. </p>







<p>This works really well and can be used for Azure B2C solutions as well. If possible, you should only use delegated scopes in the application, if possible. By using application permissions, the ASP.NET Core is implicitly an administrator of these permissions as well. It would be better if user accounts with delegated access was used which are managed by your IT etc. </p>

<p><br>
The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=worldwide+shipping+crisis">worldwide shipping crisis</a> is bad. Here are some reasons:</p>
 
 “Just in time” manufacturing, shipping, delivery, and logistics. For several decades, the whole supply system has been optimized for “lean” everything. On the whole, no part of it fully comprehends breakdowns outside the scope of immediate upstream or downstream dependencies. 
 The pandemic, which has been depriving nearly every sector of labor, intelligence, leadership, data, and much else, since early last year. 
 Catastrophes. The largest of these was the <a>2021 Suez Canal Obstruction</a>, which has had countless effects upstream and down. 
 Competing narratives. Humans can’t help reducing all complex situations to stories, all of which require protagonists, problems, and movement toward resolution. It’s how our minds are built, and why it’s hard to look more deeply and broadly at any issue and why it’s here. (For more on that, see <a>Where Journalism Fails</a>.) 
 Corruption. This is endemic to every complex economy: construction, <a href="http://j.mp/adbwars">online advertising</a>, high finance, whatever. It happens here too. (And, like incompetence, it tends to worsen in a crisis.) 
 Bureacracies &amp; non-harmonized regulations. More about this below*. 
 Complicating secondary and tertiary effects. The most obvious of these is inflation. Says <a href="https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/supply-chain-breakdown-its-causes-and-effects>">here</a>, “the spot rate for a 40-foot shipping container from Shanghai to Los&nbsp;Angeles rising from about $3,500 last year to $12,500 as of the end of&nbsp;September.” I’ve since heard numbers as high as $50,000. And, of course, inflation also happens for other reasons, which further complicates things. 
 
<p>To wrap one’s head around all of those (and more), it might help to start with Aristotle’s four “causes” (which might also be translated as “explanations”). Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes">illustrates these</a> with a wooden dining table:</p>
 
 Its material cause is wood. 
 Its efficient cause is carpentry. 
 Its final cause is dining. 
 Its formal cause (what gives it form) is design. 
 
<p>Of those, formal cause is what matters most. That’s because, without knowledge of what a table is, it wouldn’t get made.</p>
<p>But the worldwide supply chain (which is less a single chain than braided rivers spreading outward from many sources through countless deltas) is impossible to reduce to any one formal cause. Mining, manufacturing, harvesting, shipping on sea and land, distribution, wholesale and retail sales are all involved, and specialized in their own ways, dependencies withstanding.</p>
<p>I suggest, however, that the most formal of the supply chain problem’s causes is also what’s required to sort out and solve it: digital technology and the Internet. From <a href="https://bit.ly/make_us">What does the Internet make of us?</a>, sourcing the McLuhans:</p>
<blockquote><p>“People don’t want to know the cause of anything”, Marshall said (and Eric quotes, in&nbsp;Media and Formal Cause). “They do not want to know why radio caused Hitler and Gandhi alike. They do not want to know that print caused anything whatever. As users of these media, they wish merely to get inside…”</p></blockquote>
<p>We are all inside a digital environment that is making each of us while also making our systems. This can’t be reversed. But it can be understood, at least to some degree. And that understanding can be applied.</p>
<p>How? Well, Marshall McLuhan—who died in 1980—saw in the rise of computing the retrieval of what he called “perfect memory—total and exact.” (Laws of Media, 1988.) So, wouldn’t it be nice if we could apply that power to the totality of the world’s supply chains,&nbsp;subsuming and transcending the scope and interests of any part, whether those parts be truckers, laws, standards, and the rest—and do it in real time? Global aviation has some of this, but it’s also a much simpler system than the braided rivers between global supply and global demand.</p>
<p>Is there something like that? I don’t yet know. Closest I’ve found is the UN’s <a href="https://www.imo.org/">IMO (International Maritime Organizaiton)</a>, and that only covers “the safety and security of shipping and the&nbsp;prevention of marine and atmospheric pollution&nbsp;by ships.” Not very encompassing, that. If any of ya’ll know more, fill us in.</p>
<p>[*Added 18 October]&nbsp;Just attended a talk by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oswaldkuyler/">Oswald Kuyler</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/international-chamber-icc-leader-for-digital-standards">Managing Director</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="https://iccwbo.org/">International Chamber of Commerce</a>‘s <a href="https://iccwbo.org/media-wall/news-speeches/icc-digital-initiatives-that-will-equip-business-for-the-next-century-of-global-trade/">Digital Standards initiative</a>, on an “Integrated Approach” by his and allied organizations that addresses “digital islands,” “no single view of available standards” both open and closed, “limited investments into training, change management and adoption,” “lack of enabling rules and regulations,” “outdated regulation,” “privacy law barriers,” “trade standard adoption gaps,” “costly technical integration,” “fragmentation” that “prevents paperless trade,” and other factors. Yet he also says the whole thing is “bent but not broken,” and that (says one slide) “trade and supply chain prove more resilient than imagined.”</p>
<p>Another relevant .org is the <a href="https://www.ics-shipping.org/">International Chamber of Shipping</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, Heather Cox Richardson (whose <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/">newsletter</a> I highly recommend) <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/october-13-2021">yesterday</a> summarized what the Biden administration is trying to do about all this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Biden also announced today a deal among a number of different players to try to relieve the&nbsp;supply chain slowdowns that have built up as people turned to online shopping during the&nbsp;pandemic. Those slowdowns threaten the delivery of packages for the holidays, and Biden has&nbsp;pulled together government officials, labor unions, and company ownership to solve the&nbsp;backup.</p>
<p>The Port of Los Angeles, which handles 40% of the container traffic coming into the U.S., has&nbsp;had container ships stuck offshore for weeks. In June, Biden put together a Supply Chain&nbsp;Disruption Task Force, which has hammered out a deal. The port is going to begin operating&nbsp;around the clock, seven days a week. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union has&nbsp;agreed to fill extra shifts. And major retailers, including Walmart, FedEx, UPS, Samsung,&nbsp;Home Depot, and Target, have agreed to move quickly to clear their goods out of the dock&nbsp;areas, speeding up operations to do it and committing to putting teams to work extra hours.</p>
<p>“The supply chain is essentially in the hands of the private sector,” a White House official told&nbsp;Donna Littlejohn of the&nbsp;Los Angeles Daily News, “so we need the private sector…to help solve&nbsp;these problems.” But Biden has brokered a deal among the different stakeholders to end what&nbsp;was becoming a crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully helpful, but not sufficient.</p>

  <br>For the past 50 years, most business leaders in free market-based economies have been taught or trained in a core ideology; "that the purpose of business is to serve only the shareholder". The source was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman">#MiltonFriedman</a>. Whilst shareholder primacy is simple and allows businesses to optimise for one thing, which has an advantage in terms of decision making, it has also created significant damage. It does not stand up to modern critique and challenges such as ESG. Importantly there is an assumption that a shareholder group was a united and unified collective. <br> There is an assumption: shareholders are united and unified  <br>The reality is that in a public or investor-led company, the shareholders are as diverse in terms of vision, rationale, purpose and expectation as any standard group of associated parties. Shareholders as a group rarely have an entirely homogeneous objective. Given the dominance of shareholder primacy, how do we know this concept of non-homogeneous actors is genuine. Because there are conflicts among shareholders, which is so large, it constitutes a topic of high practical relevance for academic interest. Two areas dominate research in this area, board performance and board dynamics. Particular attention has been given to conflict that arises when ownership is shared between a dominant, controlling shareholder and minority shareholders. <br><br><br><br><br>The majority and dominant shareholders have incentives to pursue personal goals through the business as they disproportionately gain the benefits but do not fully bear the economic risks and can misuse their power to exploit minority shareholders. That is, the majority shareholder may push management and the board to pursue objectives that align with their own priorities but that are detrimental for the minority shareholder. Studies have shown that such conflicts negatively affect a firm's performance, valuation, and innovation. In listed companies, market regulators, using minority protection clauses, try to avoid this abuse of power, but in private equity markets, there is no regulator to prevent this conflict.<br><br>Surprisingly, however, far less research has examined whether and how different types of shareholders (even stakeholders) can complement each other so that mutual benefits arise. <br><br>In a recent study examining shareholder relationships in privately held firms, the outcomes of private equity investments in privately held family businesses were compared. This research hypothesis was to test if the objectives of professional investors and family owners differ. PE investors focus on maximising financial returns through a medium-term exit and generally have lower levels of risk aversion. Family shareholders, in contrast, generally have most of their wealth concentrated in a single firm, hold longer time horizons, and are often particularly concerned about non-economic benefits the firm brings to the family (e.g., reputation in the community). What is clear is that the reason to trade and have a purpose is critical for any alignment to emerge. <br><br>We know that boards and management need to be informed and review shareholders' objectives. Shareholders need to be informed and review the extent to which they are still aligned in terms of time horizons, risk preferences, need for cash, prioritising financial goals, and whether control or dominance of an agenda is constructive or destructive. Which is the segway to the Peak Paradox mapping above. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fundamental issue is that we <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">cannot make decisions at Peak Paradox</a> and have to move towards a Peak to determine what we are optimising for. For shareholders who optimise for Peak Individual Purpose will want to use a dominant position or minority protection to force an agenda to their own goals. A high performing board, perceived, will optimise towards Peak Work Purpose. This included commercial and noncommercial, where commercial boards will optimise for a single objective such as shareholder primacy. What becomes evident at this point is the question about diversity. Dominant shareholders can create environments where the lack of diversity or thinking, experience, motivation, purpose and incentives serves them and their objectives. This will also be seen as a board that does not ask questions, cannot deal with conflict and avoids tension. Finally, if we move towards optimising for a better society (Peak Social Purpose), we find that we move towards serving stakeholders. <br><br> Will society be better off because this business exists? <br>The critical point here is that stakeholders cannot live with Peak Paradox's decision-making and have to find something to optimise for and align to. This will not be a three or five-year plan but a reason for the business to exist. At Peak Paradox, the most important questions get asked, such as "Will society be better off because this business exists?" Because the same data should present a yes and no answer, and the board needs to justify why it believes it should.

<p>History</p>



<p>2021-12-11 Added video explaining SSI phishing </p>



<p>2021-10-31 Updated phishing section after feedback.</p>



<p>SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) is very new and a lot of its challenges will hopefully get solved and help to  improve identity management solutions.</p>



<p>Some definitions:</p>



  Digital Identity: This is the ID which represents a user, for example an E-ID issued by the state, this could be a certificate, hardware key, verifiable credential etc.  Identity: This is the user + application trying to access something which usually needs to be authenticated when using a protected user interactive resource.  Authentication: verifying the “Identity” i.e. application + user for user interactive flows.  Authorization: verify that the request presents the required credentials, specifying access rights/privileges to resources. This could mean no verification of who or what sent the request, although this can be built in with every request if required. Solutions exist for this in existing systems.  



<p>The following diagram from the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> shows a good overview of verifiable credentials with issuers, holders and verifiers. The holder is usually represented through a wallet application which can be any application type, not just mobile applications.</p>







<p>Level of security for user interaction authentication with SSI</p>



<p>Authentication using SSI credentials would have to same level of security as the authenticator apps which you have for existing systems. This is not as safe as using FIDO2 in your authentication process as FIDO2 is the only solution which protects against phishing. The SSI Authentication is also only as good as the fallback process, so if the fallback process, recovery process allows a username or password login, then the level would be passwords. </p>







<p>See this post for more details: </p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/17/the-authentication-pyramid/">The authentication pyramid</a></p>



<p>Authentication Issuer</p>



<p>The authentication process is not any better than previous systems, every issuer needs to do this properly. Trust quality of the issuer depends on this. If a verifier wants to use verifiable credentials from a certain issuer, then a trust must exist between the verifier and the issuer. If the issuer of the credentials makes mistakes or does this in a bad way, then the verifier has this problem as well. It is really important that the credential issuer authenticates correctly and only issues credentials to correctly authenticated identities. </p>



<p>SIOP (Self-Issued OpenID Provider) provides one solution for this. With this solution, every issuer requires its own specific IDP (identity provider) clients and OIDC (OpenID Connect) profiles for the credentials which are issued.</p>



<p>When a credential issuer has a data leak or a possible security bug, maybe all credentials issued from this issuer would need to be revoked. This might mean that all data in any verifier applications created from this issuer also needs to be revoked or deleted. This is worse than before where we have many isolated systems. With SSI, we have a chain of trust. A super disaster would be if a government which issues verifiable credentials had to revoke credentials due to a security leak or security bug, then all data, processes created from this would have to evaluate and process the data again, worse case delete and require new proofs.</p>



<p>Authentication/Authorization Verifier</p>



<p>Every verifier application/process has a responsibility for it’s own authorization and the quality of its verification. Depending on what the verifier needs to do, a decision on the required verifiable credentials needs to be taken. A verifier must decide, if it needs only to authorize the verifiable credential it receives from the wallet application, or if it needs to authenticate the digital identity used in the subject of the verifiable credential. If you only authorize a verifiable credential when you should be authenticating the digital identity used in the verifiable credential, this will probably result in false identities in the verifier application or processes run for the wrong user.  Once the verifiable credential is accepted as trustworthy, an identity could be created from the verifiable credential and the digital identity if contained in the subject. </p>



<p>Some solutions move the authentication of the digital identity to the wallet and the verifiers accept verifiable credentials from the wallet without authentication of the digital identity. This would mean that the wallet requires specific authentication steps and restrictions. Another solution would be to use a certificate which is attached to the digital identity for authentication on the verifier and on the wallet. SIOP and OpenID Connect would also provide a solution to this.</p>



<p>Access to Wallets, Authentication &amp; Authorization of the holder of the Wallet</p>



<p>One of the biggest problems is to manage and define what verifiable credentials can be loaded into a wallet. Wallets also need to possibility to import and export backups and also share credentials with other wallets using DIDComm or something like this. Enterprise wallets will be used by many different people. This means that solutions which fix the identity to a specific wallet will not work if shared wallets or backups are to be supported. Wallets would also need to support or load verifiable credentials for other people who are not able to do this themselves or do not have access to a wallet. With these requirements it is very hard to prove that a verifiable credential belongs to the person using the wallet. Extra authentication is required on the wallet and also the issuers and the verifier applications cannot know that the credential issued to wallet x, really belongs to person x, which is the subject of the verifiable credential. Extra authentication would be required. Solutions with certificates, or wallet authentication can help solve this but no one solution will fit all solutions. </p>



<p>If a relationship between the person using the wallet, the credentials in the wallet and how the verifiers use and trust the credentials is managed badly, many security problems will exist. People are people and will lose wallets, share wallets when they should not and so on. This needs to be planned for and the issuer of verifiable credentials and the verifier of these credentials need to solve this correctly. This would probably mean when using verifiable credentials from a wallet, the issuer application and the verifier application would need to authenticate the user as well as the credentials being used. Depending on the use case, the verifier would not always need to do this.</p>



<p>Interoperability between providers  &amp; SSI solutions</p>



<p>At present it is not possible to use any wallet with any SSI solution. Each solution is locked to its own wallet. Some solutions provide a way of exporting verifiable credentials and importing this again in a different vendor wallet but not using wallet vendor 1 together solution vendor 2. Solutions are also not supporting the same specifications, standards. Each implementation I tried supports different standards and have vendor specific solutions which are not compatible to other vendors. </p>



<p>I have a separate wallet installed now for each solution I tried. It cannot be expected that users install many different wallets to use SSI. Also, if a government issues a verifiable credential with a certain wallet, it would be really bad if all verifiers and further credential issuers must use the same wallet. </p>



<p>With JSON-LD and BBS+, the APIs between the wallets and the SSI services should work together but vendor specific details seem to be used in the payloads. If SSI is to work, I believe any wallet which conforms to a standard x must work with any SSI service. Or the services, vendor implementations needs a common standard for issuing and verifying credentials with wallets and the agents used in the wallets. Some type of certification process would probably help here.</p>



<p>Phishing</p>



<p>Users authenticating on HTTPS websites using verifiable credentials stored on your wallet are still vulnerable to phishing attacks. This can be improved by using FIDO2 as a second factor to the SSI authentication. The DIDComm communication between agents has strong protection against phishing.</p>



<p>Self sovereign identity phishing scenario using HTTPS websites:</p>



  User opens a phishing website in the browser using HTTPS and clicks the fake sign-in  Phishing service starts a correct SSI sign-in on the real website using HTTPS and gets presented with a QR Code and the start link for a digital wallet to complete.  Phishing service presents this back on the phishing website to the victim on the phishing website.  Victim scans the QR Code using the digital wallet and completes the authentication using the agent in the digital wallet, DIDComm etc.  When the victim completes the sign-in using the out of band digital wallet and agent, the HTTPS website being used by the attacker gets updated with the session of the victim.  



<p>This can only be prevented by using the browser client-side origin as part of the flow, signing this and returning this back to the server to be validated, thus preventing this type of phishing attack. This cannot be prevented unless the origin from the client browser is used and validated in the authentication process. The browser client-side origin is not used in the SSI login.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Here’s the same problem description: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tpmyLf88pU&amp;t=1496s">Risk Mitigation for Cross Device Flows</a></p>



<p>PII databases will still be created</p>



<p>Credential Issuers require PII data to create a verifiable credentials. This data is persisted and can be leaked like we see every day on the internet. Due to costs/laws/charges, verifiers will also copy credentials and create central PII databases as well. The applications doing verifications also will save data to a local database. For example, if an insurance company uses verifiable credentials to create a new account, it will save the data from the verifiable credential to a local database as this is required for its requirements. This will have the PII data as well. So even with SSI solutions we will still share and have many databases of PII data. </p>



<p>If BBS+ ZKP is used which does not share the data with the verifier, just a verification, this is a big improvement compared to existing solutions. At the time of testing, this is not supported yet with any of the solutions I tried, but the specifications exist. Most solutions only support selective or compound proofs. If the verifier does not save this data, then SSI has added a big plus compared to existing solutions. A use case for this would be requesting a government document which only requires proof of the digital identity and this can be issued then without storing extra PII data or requiring a shared IDP with the digital identity issuer.</p>



<p>Complexity of the Self Sovereign Identity</p>



<p>I find the complexity when implementing SSI solutions still very high. Implementation of a basic issue credential, verify credential process requires many steps. Dev environments also require some type of callback, webhooks. ngrok solves this good but this is different after each start and needs to be re-configured regularly, which then requires new presentation templates which adds extra costs and so on. If integrating this in DevOps processes with integration testing or system testing, this would become more complex. Due to the overall complexity to set this up and implement this, developers will make mistakes and this results in higher costs. IDP or PKI solutions are easier to implement in a secure way.</p>



<p>Trust</p>



<p>When using the provided solutions, some of these systems are closed source and you have no idea how the solutions manage their data, or handle the secrets in their infrastructure, or how the code is implemented (closed source). For some solutions, I had to share my OpenID Connect client secret for a flow to complete the SSI SIOP credential issuer flow. This was persisted somewhere on the platform which does not feel good. You also don’t know who they share their secrets with and the company provider has different law requirements depending on your country of origin. Implementing a “full” SSI solution does not seem like a good option for most use cases. Open source software improves this trust at least but is not the only factor.</p>



<p>Notes:</p>



<p>I would love feedback on this and will correct, change anything which is incorrect or you believe I should add something extra. These challenges are based on my experiences implementing the solutions and reading the specifications. I really look forward to the new SSI world and how this develops. I think SSI is cool, but people need to know when and how to use it and it is not the silver bullet to identity but does add some super cool new possibilities.</p>

  <p>Today’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">Project VRM</a> meeting marks
the project’s 15 years anniversary. A good opportunity to list the uses cases that have
emerged over the years. To make them more manageable, I categorize them by the stage of
the relationship between customer and vendor:</p>
 Category 1: Establishing the relationship 
<p>What happens when a Customer or a Vendor wishes to initiate a relationship, or wishes to modify the
terms of the relationship.</p>
 1.1 Customer initiates a new relationship with a Vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to offer initiating a new relationship with a Vendor.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer encounters the Vendor’s electronic presence (e.g. their website) 
 The Customer performs a gesture on the Vendor’s site that indicates their interest of establishing
a relationship 
 As part of the gesture, the Customer’s proposed terms are conveyed to the Vendor 
 In response, the Vendor provides acceptance of the proposed relationship and offered terms,
or offers alternate terms in return. 
 If the offered terms are different from the proposed terms, the Customer has the opportunity
to propose alternate terms; this continues until both parties agree on the terms or
abort the initiation. 
 Once the terms have been agreed on, both sides record their agreement. 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 To make this “consumer-grade”, much of the complexity of such concepts as
“proposed terms” needs to be hidden behind reasonable defaults. 
 
 1.2 Vendor initiates a new relationship with a Customer 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to offer initiating a new relationship with a Customer.”</p>
<p>Similar as for “Customer initiates a new relationship with a Vendor”, but with reversed roles.</p>
 1.3 Customer and Vendor agree on a closer relationship 
<p>“The Customer and the Vendor agree on a closer relationship.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer and the Vendor have been in a relationship governed by certain terms for some time. 
 Now, either the Customer or the Vendor propose new terms to the other party, and the other party
accepts. 
 The new terms permit all activities permitted by the old terms, plus some additional
ones. 
 
<p>Example:</p>
 
 The Customer has agreed with the Vendor that the Vendor may send the Customer product updates once a month.
For that purpose, the Customer has provided Vendor an e-mail address (but no physical address). 
 Now, the Customer has decided to purchase a product from Vendor. To ship it, the Vendor needs to have
the Customer’s shipping address. New terms that also include the shipping address are being
negotiated. 
 
 1.4 A Customer wants a more distant relationship 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to limit the Vendor to more restrictive terms.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer and the Vendor have been in a relationship governed by certain terms for some time. 
 Now, the Customer wishes to disallow certain activities previously allowed by the terms, without
terminating the relationship. 
 The Customer offers new terms, which the Vendor may or may not accept. The Vendor may offer alternate
terms in turn. This negotiation continues until either mutually acceptable terms are
found, or the relationship terminates. 
 
<p>Examples:</p>
 
 The Customer has agreed with the Vendor that the Vendor may send the Customer product updates. Now the Customer
decides that they do not wish to receive product updates more frequently than once
a quarter. 
 The Customer has agreed to behavioral profiling when visiting Vendor’s website. Now, while the Customer
still wishes to use the website, they do no longer consent to the behavioral profiling. 
 
 2. Category: Ongoing relationship 
<p>What happens during a relationship after it has been established and while no
party has the intention of either modifying the strength of, or even leaving
the relationship.</p>
 2.1 Intentcasting 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to publish, to a selection of Vendors that I trust, that I wish to purchase a
product with description X”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 Potential for a non-standard deal (e.g. I am a well-known influencer, and the seller
makes Customer a special deal) 
 
<p>Features:</p>
 
 It’s basically a shopping list
 
 free-form text 
 plus “terms” (FIXME: open issue) 
 
 
 Retailers can populate product alternatives for each item in the list
 
 might simply be a search at the retailer site 
 but terms need to be computable 
 
 
 
<p>Issues:</p>
 
 what if a retailer lies and spams with unrelated products, or unavailable products? 
 
 2.2 Automated intentcasting on my behalf 
<p>“As a Customer, I want an ‘AI’ running on my behalf to issue Intentcasts when it is in my interest”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is similar to functionality deployed by some retailers today: “We noticed you have
not bought diapers in the last 30 days. Aren’t you about to run low? Here are some offers”.
But this functionality runs on my behalf, and takes data from all sorts of places into
account. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience, time savings 
 
 2.3 Contextual product reviews and ratings 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to see reviews and ratings of the product and seller alternatives for any
of my shopping list items.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Same as product reviews in silos, but without the silos: have access to more reviews
and ratings by more people 
 Seller alternatives give Customer more choice 
 
 2.4 Filter offers by interest 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to receive offers that match my implicitly declared interest”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 In Intentcasting, I actively publish my intent to meet a need I know I have by
purchasing a product 
 This is about offers in response to needs, or benefits, that I have not explicitly
declared but that can be inferred. Example: if I have purchased a laser printer
6 months ago, and I have not purchased replacement toner cartridges nor have I declared
an intent to purchase some, I would appreciate offers for such toner cartridges (but
not of inkjet cartridges) 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 Better response rate for Vendor 
 
 2.5 Full contact record 
<p>“As a Customer, I want a full record of all interactions between Customer and each Vendor accessible in a single place.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This should cover all modes of communication, from e-mail to trouble tickets,
voice calls and home visits. 
 
 2.6 Manage trusted Vendor’s in a single place 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to see and manage my list of trusted Vendors in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity 
 Transparency (to Customer) 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Probably should also have a non-trusted Vendor’s: so my banned vendors are maintained
in the same place — which subset is being displayed is just a filter function 
 Probably should have a list of all Vendor’s ever interacted with 
 
 2.7 Notify of changes about products I’m interested in 
<p>“As a Customer, I want be notified of important changes (e.g. price) in products that I’m interested in.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 can use my shopping cart as a “price watch list” and purchase when I think the
price is right 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This should apply to items in my shopping cart, but also items in product lists that
I might have created (“save for later” lists) 
 
 2.8 Personal wallet 
<p>“As a Customer, I want my own wallet that I can use with any Vendor”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Unified billing 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Unified ceremony 
 Should be able to delegate to the payment network of my choice 
 
 2.9 Preventative maintenance 
<p>“As a Customer, I would like to be notified of my options when a product I own needs maintenance”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 If I have a water heater, and it is about to fail, I would like to be notified that
it is about to fail, with offers for what to do about it. It’s a kind of
<a>intentcasting</a>
but the intent is inferred from the fact that I own the product, the product is about
to fail, that I don’t want it to fail and I am willing to entertain offers from
the vendor I bought it from and others. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 No service interruption 
 
 2.10 Product clouds 
<p>“Each product instance has its own cloud”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Collects information over the lifetime of the product instance 
 Product instance-specific 
 Can change ownership with the product 
 Does not disappear with the vendor 
 
<p>Example:</p>
 
 My water heater has its own cloud. It knows usage, and maintenance events.
It continues to work even if the vendor of the water heater goes out of business. 
 
 2.11 Product info in context 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to access product documentation, available instruction manuals etc in the
context of the purchase that I made”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Updated documentation, new materials etc show up automatically 
 
 2.12 Set and monitor terms for relationships 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to set terms for my relationship with a Vendor in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Privacy &amp; Agency 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Originally this was only about terms for provided personal data, but it appears
this is a broader issue: I also want to set terms for, say, dispute resolution
(“I never consent to arbitration”) or customer support (“must agree to never let
Customer wait on the phone for more than 30min”) 
 
 2.13 Update information in a single place only 
<p>“As a Customer, I (only) want to update my personal contact information in one place that I control”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 for Customer: convenience 
 for Vendor: more accurate information 
 
<p>Issues:</p>
 
 Should that be a copy and update-copy process (push), or a copy and update-on-need
process (pull with copy) or a fetch-and-discard process (pull without copy)? 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Originally phrased as only about contact info (name, married name, shipping address,
phone number etc) this probably applies to other types of information was well, such
as, say, credit card numbers, loyalty club memberships, even dietary preferences or
interests (“I gave up stamp collecting”) 
 
 2.14 Single shopping cart 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to use a single shopping cart for all e-commerce sites on the web.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 I don’t need to create accounts on many websites, or login into many websites 
 I decide when the collection of items in the cart expires and I don’t lose work 
 It makes it easier for Customer to shop at more sites, and I can more easily buy from the long tail of sites 
 
<p>Features:</p>
 
 It shows product and seller 
 It may show alternate sellers and difference in terms (e.g. price, shipping, speed) 
 We may also want to have product lists that aren’t a shopping cart (“save for later”
lists) 
 
 2.15 Unified communications/notifications preferences 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to manage my communication/notification preferences with all Vendors
in a single place”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 In a single place, and in a single manner. I should not have to do things differently
to unsubscribe from the product newsletter of vendors X and Y. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 
 2.16 Unified product feedback 
<p>“As a Customer, I want a uniform way to submit (positive and negative) product feedback (and
receive responses) with any Vendor”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Should be easy to do this either privately or publicly 
 
 2.17 Unified purchase history 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to have a record of all my product purchases in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 If I wish to re-order a product I purchased before, I can easily find it and the
vendor that I got it from 
 
 2.18 Unified subscriptions management 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to manage all my ongoing product subscriptions in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Expense management 
 
<p>Note:</p>
 
 This is implied by the source, not explicitly mentioned. 
 
<p>Future:</p>
 
 Opens up possibilities for subscription bundle business models 
 
 2.19 Unified support experience 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Should be multi-modal: trouble tickets, chat, e-mail, voice etc 
 
 3. Category: Beyond binary relationships 
<p>Use cases that involve more than one Customer, or more than one Vendor, or both.</p>
 3.1 Proven capabilities 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to give another party (Customer or Vendor) the capabilities to perform certain operations”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is SSI Object Capabilities 
 Example: I want to give my customer the ability to open a locker 
 The scenario should be robust with respect to confidentiality and accuracy. 
 
 3.2 Silo-free product reviews 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to publish my reviews and ratings about products I own so they can be
used by any other Customer at any point of purchase”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Same as product reviews in silos, but without the silos: broader distribution of
my review for more benefit by more people 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Rephrased from “express genuine loyalty” 
 
 3.3 Monitoring of terms violation 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to be notified if other Customer’s interacting with a Vendor report a violation of their terms”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 I have a relationship with a Vendor, and we have agreed to certain terms. If the Vendor breaks
those terms, and other Customer’s in a similar relationship with the Vendor notice that, I want
to be notified. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Trust, security, safety 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This can of course be abused through fake reports, so suitable measures must be taken. 
 
 3.4 Unified health and wellness records 
<p>“As a Customer, I want my health and wellness records from all sources to be aggregated in a
place that I control.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Survives disappearance of the vendor 
 Privacy 
 Allows cross-data-source personal analytics and insights 
 Integration across healthcare (regulated industry) and wellness (consumer) 
 
 3.5 Verified credentials 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to be able to tell Vendor 1 that Vendor 2 makes a claim about Customer.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is the SSI verified credential use case 
 Example: I want to tell a potential employer that I have earned a certain degress
from a certain institution 
 The scenario should be robust with respect to confidentiality and accuracy. 
 
 4. Category: Ending the relationship 
<p>What happens when one of the parties wishes to end the relationship.</p>
 4.1 Banning the vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to permanently ban a Vendor from doing business with Customer ever again.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This form of ending the relationship means that I don’t want to be told of offers
or responses to Intentcasts etc. by this vendor ever again. 
 
 4.2 Disassociating from the vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to stop interacting with a vendor at this time but I am open to
future interactions.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This probably means that data sharing and other interaction reset to the level of
how it was before the relationship was established. However, the Customer and the Vendor do not
need to go through the technical introduction ceremony again when the relationship
is revived. 
 
 4.3 Firing the customer 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to stop interacting with a particular Customer.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 For customers (or non-customers) that the Vendor does not wish to serve (e.g. because of
excessive support requests), the VendorVendor may unilaterally terminate the relationship with
the Customer.

<p>テーマはデジタルアイデンティティなのですが、対談がちょうどJR東日本の駅構内カメラ設置問題の話題が盛り上がっていたときだったので、そこから話はいろいろと広く深く進んでいきました。</p>



<p>たいへん丁寧にまとめていただいたので、デジタルアイデンティティやプライバシーに対するクロサカさんと私の考え方や問題意識も、楽しみながら読んで理解していただけるのではないかと思います。結構ボリュームが有って、２回に分けての公開になっています。</p>

   Mark Zuckerberg recently dedicated a
long interview
to the subject, so the metaverse must be a thing. Promptly, the
chatter is exploding. Personally
I believe the metaverse is currently underhyped: it will be A Really Big Thing,
for consumers, and for businesses, and in particular for commerce and
collaboration, far beyond what we can grasp in video games and the likes today. 
 So what is it, this

  <p>Mark Zuckerberg recently dedicated a
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">long interview</a>
to the subject, so the metaverse must be a thing. Promptly, the
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=metaverse">chatter</a> is exploding. Personally
I believe the metaverse is currently underhyped: it will be A Really Big Thing,
for consumers, and for businesses, and in particular for commerce and
collaboration, far beyond what we can grasp in video games and the likes today.</p>
<p>So what is it, this metaverse thing? I want to share my definition, because I
think it is simple, and useful.</p>
<p>It’s best expressed in a two-by-two table:</p>

 
  
  
   How you access it:
   <br>
   physically vs. virtually
 
 
  
   Where it is:
   <br>
   in physical or virtual space
  
  
   The virtual world, accessed physically:
   <br>
   Augmented Reality
  
  
   The virtual world, accessed virtually:
   <br>
   today's internet and future virtual worlds
  
 
 
  
   The physical world, accessed physically:
   <br>
   our ancestors exclusively lived here
  
  
   The physical world, accessed virtually:
   <br>
   the Internet of Things
  
 

<p>By way of explanation:</p>
 
 
<p>There is physical space – the physical world around us – and
virtual space, the space of pure information, that only exists on computers.</p>
 
 
<p>Our ancestors, and we so far, have mostly been interacting with physical space
by touching it physically.
But in recent decades, we have learned to access it from the information
sphere, and that’s usually described as the Internet of Things:
if you run an app to control your lights, or open your garage door, that’s
what I’m talking about.</p>
 
 
<p>So far, we have mostly interacted with virtual space through special-purpose
devices that form the gateway to the virtual space: first computers,
now phones and in the future: headsets. I call this accessing virtual space
virtually.</p>
 
 
<p>And when we don our smart glasses, and wave our arms, we interact with
virtual space from physical space, which is the last quadrant.</p>
 
 
<p>In my definition, those four quadrants together form the metaverse:
the metaverse is a superset of both meatspace and cyberspace, so to speak.</p>
<p>This definition has been quite helpful for me to understand what various
projects are working on.</p>

    What are we asking the questions for? <p>This <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/archive">link gives you access to all the articles and archives</a> for &lt;/Hello CDO&gt;</p><p>This article unpacks questions and framing as I tend to focus on the conflicts, tensions, and compromises that face any CDO in the first 100 days — ranging from the effects of a poor job description to how a company’s culture means that data-led decisions are not decisions.</p><br><br><p></p><p><br></p><p>I love this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dana_kanze_the_real_reason_female_entrepreneurs_get_less_funding">TED talk</a> from <a href="https://www.london.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/d/dana-kanze">Dana Kanze</a> at LSE.&nbsp; Dana’s talk builds on the research of <a href="https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/529/HIGGINSADVANCES_1998REG_FOC_.pdf">Tory Higgins</a> who is credited with creating the social theory “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_focus_theory">Regulatory Focus</a>”&nbsp; This is a good <a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Regulatory_Focus_Theory">summary</a> if you have not run into it before.</p><p>Essentially the idea behind “Regulatory Focus” is to explore motivations and routes to getting the outcome you want. The context in this article is to explore how a framed approach to questions creates biased outcomes. One framing in Regulatory Focus centres on a “Promotion Focus” which looks for “gain” which can be translated as finding or seeking hope, advancement and accomplishment.&nbsp; The counter is a prevention focus that centres on losses that looks to find safety, responsibility and security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In Dana’s research, which is the basis for her talk about why women get less venture funding, she categorises “Promotion” questions as ones that will ask the following questions as they seek to focus on GAIN. When talking about: customers seeks data about acquisition, income looking for data to confirm sales, Market seeking to understand the size,&nbsp; Balance Sheet will want to know data on assets, projections should focus on growth and questions on strategy will want to understand the vision.&nbsp;</p><p>Dana’s research shows that “Prevention” questions will be framed as LOSSES, therefore a focus on customers would seek data on retention, income questions look for data on margin, market questions would focus on shape, balance sheet questions will centre on liability, projection data wants to confirm stability, and strategy to ensure execution capability.</p><p>Whilst Dana has collected this data as part of a noble and useful study on why women get less funding from venture capital, investors tend to bias and ask women prevention questions with a framing away from gain towards losses and downside risk.&nbsp; However, we should reflect on this data and research for a little longer.</p><p>Does your executive team tend to focus on promotion or prevention questions? &nbsp;Do different executive roles tend to frame their questions based on gain (upside) or loss prevention (risk)?&nbsp; Is the person leading the questions critical to the decision-making unit and will their questions frame promotion or prevention for the company.&nbsp; Whilst a rounded team should ask both, do they?</p><p>As the CDO, our role is to find “all data.” and not data to fit a question. Data that shows your company's approach to how they frame questions for Prevention or Promotion is just data,&nbsp; but this data will help you as a team make better decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>A specific challenge in the first 100 days is to determine what questions we, as a leadership team, ask ourselves and how our framing is biasing our choices and decisions.&nbsp; We are unlikely to like this data and how power aligns with those who prevent or promote a proposal or recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Based on listening to questions and those in communications, I have been building an ontology of questions and been categorising them for a while now.&nbsp; I am interested both in the absolute bias, the bias to people, the bias to project types and also how bais changes depending on who is leading the project and questions.&nbsp; Based on a sample size that is not statistical, I believe that Dana’s work has far wider implications than just venture funding.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about.

<p>The latest version of the â€œOAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)â€ specification adds an option for servers to supply a nonce value to be included in the DPoP proof.  Both authorization servers and resource servers can provide nonce values to clients.</p>
<p>As described in the updated Security Considerations, the nonce prevents a malicious party in control of the client (who might be a legitimate end-user) from pre-generating DPoP proofs to be used in the future and exfiltrating them to a machine without the DPoP private key.  When server-provided nonces are used, actual possession of the proof-of-possession key is being demonstrated — not just possession of a DPoP proof.</p>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>

  <p>Summary: Interoperability is a fundamental property of tech systems that are generative and respect individual privacy and autonomy. And, as a bonus, it makes people's live easier!</p>





<p>
    I traveled to Munich for European Identity Conference several weeks ago—my first international trip since before the pandemic. Post-pandemic travel can be confusing, international travel even more so. To get into Germany, I needed to prove I had been vaccinated. To get back in the US, I had to show evidence of a negative Covid-19 test conducted no more than three days prior to my arrival in the US. Figuring out how to present these, which forms to fill out, and who cared led to a bit of stress. 
</p>

<p>
    Once in Munich, venturing out of the hotel had its own surprises. Germany, or maybe just Munich, has implemented a contract tracing system. Apparently there's one or more apps you can use, but I had a tough time figuring that out. Restaurants were spotty in their demands and enforcement. After showing them my US vaccination card, one small place just threw up their hands and said "just come in and eat!"
</p>

<p>
    You'd think all this would have been a perfect opportunity for me to use a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_health_passes_and_the_design_of_an_ecosystem_of_ecosystems.shtml">health pass app</a>, but whose? None of the ones I knew about had a way for me to get my vaccination status into them. Delta airlines didn't accept any that I could tell. Munich has its own—or three. In short, it's an interoperability nightmare. 
</p>

<p>
    Apple recently <a href="https://www.imore.com/you-can-now-store-your-covid-19-vaccination-health-app">announced</a> that you can store your Covid-19 vaccination card in the Health app. And soon you'll be able to put it in the phone's wallet app. Android users have similar options. But there's also hundreds (really) of apps for doing the same thing and each has its own tiny ecosystem. PC Magazine even wrote a guide with <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/does-my-state-have-a-covid-19-vaccine-app">every US state's chosen app</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The size of Apple and Android may help solve this problem since they already represent huge ecosystems. But then we're stuck with whatever solutions they provide and we may not like what we get. You don't have to look far to see <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-icloud-photo-scan-csam-pause-backlash/">BigTech solutions that have left people scratching their head.</a> We can't continue to count on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship">benevolence of our erstwhile dictators</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/10/255710-competitive-compatibility/fulltext">Writing in Communications of the ACM</a>, Cory Doctorow discusses what can be done and hits upon a conceptually simple answer: enforce interoperability.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>[Interoperability] is the better way. Instead of enshrining Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft as the Internet's permanent overlords and then striving to make them as benign as possible, we can fix the Internet by making Big Tech less central to its future.</p>
    <p>It's possible that people will connect tools to their BigTech accounts that do ill-advised things they come to regret. That is kind of the point, really. After all, people can plug weird things into their car's lighter receptacles, but the world is a better place when you get to decide how to use that useful, versatile ANSI/SAE J56-compliant plug—not GM or Toyota.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    By enforcing interoperability, we avoid empowering Apple, Google, or anyone else as the sole trusted repositories of health data and then hoping they'll not only do the right thing, but also have all the best ideas. We can let the hundreds of Covid-19 health pass apps thrive (or not), secure in the knowledge that people can pick the app they like from a company they trust and still have it work when they travel across borders—or just across town.
</p>

<p>
    People with decision making authority can help this process by choosing the interoperable solution and avoiding closed, proprietary technology. Why are organizations like <a href="https://www.nascio.org/">NASCIO (National Association of State CIOs)</a>, for example, not doing more to help states find, chose, and use interoperable solutions to common state IT problems? Beyond health pass applications, things like mobile drivers licenses need to be interoperable to be useful.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately, we have <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.626726/full">open-source technology, with multiple commercial providers</a>, that can provide interoperable credentials. Verifiable credential technology and SSI tick all the checkboxes for interoperable data exchange. Several <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/use+cases">production use cases</a> exist that can inform new projects. 
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_health_passes_and_the_design_of_an_ecosystem_of_ecosystems.shtml">Health Passes and the Design of an Ecosystem of Ecosystems</a>, I wrote about efforts to create interoperable health passes on principles that respect individual privacy and autonomy. Those efforts have created real apps, with real interoperability. But too many decision makers jettison interoperability in search of profit, dominance, or simply time to market. The lesson of the internet was not that it was the cheapest, easiest way to build global network. We had CompuServe for that. The lesson of the internet was that it was the best way to build a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/01/generative_identity.shtml">network that was generative</a> and provided the most utility for the greatest number of people. Interoperability was the key—and still is.

U.S., Canadian, and European Governments see how this technology can provide superior data protection for its citizens, while enabling global data sharing — that’s why they have invested more than $16 million USD into this space over the past several&nbsp;years.</p><p>On September 15, 2021, I moderated a panel with representatives from the United States Government, the Canadian Government, and the European Commission. Below is an edited excerpt from the panel that included:</p>  Anil John, Technical Director of the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> which has invested $8 million on R&amp;D, proof of concepts, product development, refinement, and a digital wallet UI competition.  Tim Bouma, Senior Policy Analyst for identity management at the Treasury Board secretariat at of the Government of Canada. The <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/ucvdcc">User-centric Verifiable Digital Credentials Challenge</a> has awarded $4 million CAD in two&nbsp;phases.  Olivier Bringer, Head of the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next-Generation Internet</a> at the European commission and under his program, he has awarded about € 6 million euros through three open calls for EID and SSI solutions.  Heather Vescent, Co-Chair of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a> which incubates many of the open standards in this space &amp; an author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Guide-Self-Sovereign-Identity-ebook/dp/B07Q3TXLDP/">The Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity</a>.   Policy and Technology <p>Heather Vescent: Policy tends to be squishy while technology and especially technology standards must be precise. What challenges do you face implementing policy decisions into technology?</p><p>Anil John: Our two primary work streams come out of the oldest parts of the U.S. government: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>Immigration credentials must be available to anyone regardless of their technical savvy or infrastructure availability. The USCIS team is focused on leaving nobody behind, and do not have the luxury of pivoting to a digital only model. Technology has to provide credentials in electronic format, as well as on paper — each with a high degree of verification validation.</p><p>U.S. Customs has to deal with every single entity that is shipping goods into the U.S. We don’t have any choice but to be globally interoperable, because while we may be the largest customs organization on the planet, we do not want to mandate a single platform or technology stack. Interoperability is critical so that everybody has a choice in the technology that they are&nbsp;using.</p><p>It is easy to get pushback about why we are doing this long public process, rather than put money into a vendor and buy their technology. One of the reasons we made the decision to work in public, under the remit of a global standards organization, was to ensure that we were not repeating past mistakes where we were locked into particular vendors or platforms. In the past, we were locked into proprietary APIs, with high switching costs, left with the care and feeding of legacy systems that were very uniquely government centric. There are benefits to develop technology in the public from a solution choice and a public interest perspective.</p><p>Tim Bouma: The challenge is that you have to deal with short term exigencies, and combine that with a long-term vision to come up with requirements that are fairly timeless. Because once you develop the requirements, they have to last for a decade or more. This forces you to think of what the timeless requirements might be. In order to do that, you have to understand the technology very deeply. You have to understand the abstraction, so you can come up with language that can serve the test of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Olivier Bringer: I agree that it can be a challenge to implement policy choices into technology; but it can also be an opportunity. Innovators have not waited for the European General Data Protection Regulation before developing privacy preserving technologies. This is an opportunity for companies, an opportunity for administration, an opportunity for innovators to develop new technologies and new business&nbsp;models.</p><blockquote>“Policy is an opportunity to implement fundamental rights into technology.” — Olivier&nbsp;Bringer</blockquote><p>In NGI we try to take the policy development, the regulations that we have, as an opportunity to implement our fundamental rights, an opportunity to implement the law into technology. Our program supports innovators, the adoption of their technologies, their solutions, and their integration into standards. We do that firstly in Europe, but our ambition is to link to the global environment and work in cooperation with&nbsp;others.</p> A Benefit to&nbsp;Citizens <p>Vescent: What would you tell your citizens is the most important reason to invest in this infrastructure and businesses that use&nbsp;it?</p><p>Bringer: First that we are funding technologies, which are, this is our motto, human centric. So returning to your first question, going beyond pure policy development, we think it’s really important to develop the technology. So next to the regulation that we put in place in the field of electronic identity, in the field of AI, in the field of data protection, it’s important to fund the technologies that will implement these policies and regulation. This is really what we try to do when we build an internet that’s more trustworthy, that gives more control to the users in terms of the data they disclose, in terms of control of their identity online, in terms of including everyone in this increasingly important digital environment. It is technology geared towards the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>John: I’m going to answer for myself, rather than speak for my organization. Having said that, I think what I would tell [citizens] would be that we want to make your life more secure, and more privacy-respecting, without leaving anybody behind. These are the first technologies that have come along that give us a hope in ensuring that we’re not trapped by nefarious or corporate or money interests. That there is a choice in the marketplace in what is available to our citizens in how they access it. And we absolutely are not ignoring the people who may not have a level of comfort with digital technologies and leaving them behind, but ensuring that there is a clear bridge with this technology to what their level of comfort&nbsp;is.</p><p>Bouma: We are moving to a notion of a digital economy, and it’s more than some slogan. We are building a digital infrastructure that is becoming a critical infrastructure. It is important that we understand that we develop the capabilities that ensure that the citizens actually feel safe. This is as fundamental as having safe drinking water and a regulated electricity supply. So now we need to start thinking about the digital capabilities, verifiable credentials included, as part of the national and international infrastructure.</p><p>We’re doing proof of concepts and pilots on national digital infrastructure, to understand what it means, to use a Canadian metaphor, create a “set of rails” that goes across the country. What would that look like? What are the capabilities? At the end of the day, we need to build services that can be trusted by Canadians and everyone. And there’s a lot of engineering and a lot of policy work that has to go into&nbsp;that.</p> Most Surprising Lesson <p>Vescent: What’s the most surprising thing you’ve learned since the inception of your investment programs.?</p><p>Bouma: I had a major shift in perspective. There are other technical ecosystems we have to take into account, like the mobile driver’s license, the digital travel credentials, and others. So, we have to figure out how to incorporate all those requirements. The mantra I’ve been using is, we’ve got these different technical ecosystems but we have to focus on the human being — the point of integration is at the digital wallet. So that’s reframed my policy thinking — there’s a multiplicity of technical ecosystems that we have to account from a policy point of&nbsp;view.</p><p>Bringer: I’m impressed by the quality of the innovators. We have people who are very good in technology who understand the political challenges, the policy context in which they intervene and who are able to make excellent contribution to our own policy, and who are really dedicated to our human centric&nbsp;vision.</p><p>John: I’ll give you one positive one, one negative. On the positive side, I am happy there is a community of people that understands there is value in working together to ensure the shared infrastructure that we are all using has a common foundation of security, privacy, and interoperability — that it is not a zero-sum game. They can compete on top of a common foundation.</p><p>On the negative side, I’m fascinated by the shenanigans being pulled by people who use the theater of interoperability in order to pedal proprietary solutions. Fortunately, I think a lot of the public sector entities are getting more educated so that they can see through the interoperability theater.</p><p>Curious for more? Watch the full panel.

<p>I’ve just rediscovered two digital assets that I’d forgotten about.</p>
<p>1. The Reddit username judell, which I created in 2005 and never used. When you visit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/judell">the page</a> it says “hmm… u/judell hasn’t posted anything” but also reports, in my Trophy Case, that I belong to the 15-year club.</p>
<p>2. The Amazon AWS S3 bucket named simply jon, which I created in 2006 for an <a href="http://jonudell.net/udell/2006-03-22-towards-politically-neutral-infrastructure-amazons-s3.html">InfoWorld blog post</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060330221659/https://www.infoworld.com/article/06/03/22/76555_13OPstrategic_1.html">companion column</a> about the birth of Amazon Web Services. As Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Amazon_Web_Services#Full_timeline">timeline</a> shows, AWS started in March of that year.</p>
<p>Care to guess the odds that I could still access both of these assets after leaving them in limbo for 15 years?</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: it was a coin flip.</p>
<p>I’ve had no luck with Reddit so far. The email account I signed up with no longer exists. The support folks kindly switched me to a current email but it’s somehow linked to Educational_Elk_7869 not to judell. I guess we may still get it sorted but the point is that I was not at all surprised by this loss of continuity. I’ve lost control of all kinds of digital assets over the years, including the above-cited InfoWorld article which only Wayback (thank you as always!) now remembers. </p>
<p>When I turned my attention to AWS S3 I was dreading a similar outcome. I’d gone to Microsoft not long after I made that AWS developer account; my early cloud adventures were all in Azure; could I still access those long-dormant AWS resources? Happily: yes. </p>
<p>Here’s the backstory from that 2006 blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Naming</p>
<p>The name of the bucket is jon. The bucket namespace is global which means that as long as jon is owned by my S3 developer account, nobody else can use that name. Will this lead to a namespace land grab? We’ll see. Meanwhile, I’ve got mine, and although I may never again top Jon Stewart as Google’s #1 Jon, his people are going to have to talk to my people if they want my Amazon bucket.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not holding my breath waiting for an offer. Bucket names never mattered in the way domain names do. Still, I would love to be pleasantly surprised!</p>
<p>My newfound interest in AWS is, of course, because Steampipe wraps SQL around a <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables">whole bunch of AWS APIs</a> including <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_s3_bucket">the one for S3 buckets</a>. So, for example, when exactly did I create that bucket? Of course I can log into the AWS console and click my way to the answer. But I’m all about SQL lately so instead I can do this.</p>

<p>Oh, and there’s the other one I made for <a href="https://www.luannudell.com/">Luann</a> the following year. These are pretty cool ARNs (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Names</a>)! I should probably do something with them; the names you can get nowadays are more like Educational_Elk_7869. </p>
<p>Anyway I’m about to learn a great deal about the many AWS APIs that Steampipe can query, <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_compliance">check for policy compliance</a>, and join with <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">the APIs of other services</a>. Meanwhile it’s fun to recall that I wrote one of the first reviews of the inaugural AWS product and, in the process, laid claim to some very special S3 bucket names.</p>

<p>There’s an economic theory here:&nbsp;Free customers are more valuable than captive ones—to themselves, to the companies they deal with, and to the marketplace. If that’s true, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">the intention economy</a> will prove it. If not, we’ll stay stuck in the attention economy, where the belief that captive customers are more valuable than free ones prevails.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22attention+economy%22">attention economy</a> is not native to human attention. It’s native to businesses that&nbsp; seek to grab and manipulate buyers’ attention. This includes the businesses themselves and their agents. Both&nbsp;see human attention as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">resource</a>” as passive and ready for extraction as oil and coal. The primary actors in this economy—purveyors and customers of marketing and advertising services—typically talk about human beings not only as mere “users” and “consumers,” but as “targets” to “acquire,” “manage,” “control” and “lock in.” They are also oblivious to the irony that this is the same language used by those who own cattle and slaves.</p>
<p>While attention-grabbing has been around for as long as we’ve had yelling, in our digital age the fields of practice (abbreviated&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=martech">martech</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=adtech">adtech</a>) have become so vast and varied that nobody (really, nobody) can get their head around everything that’s going on in them. (Examples of attempts are <a href="https://informationsciencejournal.org/2021/01/10/fueling-the-adtech-machine-google-analytics-and-the-commodification-of-online-personal-data/">here</a>, <a href="https://cdn.chiefmartec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/martech-landscape-2020-martech5000-slide.jpg">here</a> and <a href="https://lumapartners.com/content/lumascapes/display-ad-tech-lumascape/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>One thing we know for sure is that martech and adtech rationalize taking advantage of absent&nbsp;<a href="http://In%20this%20economy,%20human%20attention%20is%20a%20scarce%20%22resource,%22%20ready%20for%20extraction.%20And%20the%20extraction%20business%20typically%20talks%20about%20human%20beings%20not%20just%20as%20mere%20%22users%22%20or%20%22consumers,%22%20but%20as%20%22targets%22%20to%20%22acquire,%22%20%22manage,%22%20%22control%22%20and%20%22lock%20in%22—oblivious%20to%20the%20irony%20that%20this%20is%20the%20same%20language%20used%20by%20those%20owning%20cattle%20and%20slaves.">personal privacy</a>&nbsp;tech in the hands of their targets. What we need there are the digital equivalents of the privacy tech we call clothing and shelter in the physical world. We also need means to signal our privacy preferences, to obtain agreements to those, and to audit compliance and resolve disputes. As it stands in the attention economy, privacy is a weak promise made separately by websites and services that are highly incentivised not to provide it. Tracking prophylaxis in browsers is some help, but itworks differently for every browser and it’s hard to tell what’s actually going on.</p>
<p>Another thing we know for sure is that the attention economy is thick with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/08/14/my-review-of-ad-fraud-detection-technology-companies/?sh=7314bf2d7172">fraud</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=malware+adtech">malware</a>, and worse. For a view of how much worse, look at any adtech-supported website&nbsp;through <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com">PageXray</a>&nbsp;and see the hundreds or thousands of ways sthe site and its invisible partners are trying to track you. (For example, <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/smithsonianmag.com">here’s what Smithsonian Magazine‘s site does</a>.)</p>
<p>We also know that lawmaking to stop adtech’s harms (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>) has thus far mostly caused inconvenience for you and me (how many “consent” notices have interrupted your web surfing today?)—while creating a vast new industry devoted to making tracking as easy as legally possible. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance">Look up GDPR+compliance</a> and you’ll get way over 100 million results. Almost all of those will be for companies selling other companies ways to obey the letter of privacy law while violating its spirit.</p>
<p>Yet all that bad shit is also a red herring, misdirecting attention away from the inefficiencies of an economy that depends on unwelcome surveillance and algorithmic guesswork about what people might want.</p>
<p>Think about this: even if you apply all the machine learning and artificial intelligence in the world to all the personal data that might be harvested, you still can’t beat what’s possible when the targets of that surveillance have their own ways to contact and inform sellers of what they actually want and don’t want, plus ways to form genuine relationships and express genuine (rather than coerced) loyalty, and to do all of that at scale.</p>
<p>We don’t have that yet. But when we do, it will be an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">intention economy</a>. Here are the opening paragraphs of&nbsp;The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge (Harvard Business Review Press, 2012):</p>
<blockquote><p>This book stands with the customer. This is out of necessity, not sympathy. Over the coming years, customers will be emancipated from systems built to control them. They will become free and independent actors in the marketplace, equipped to tell vendors what they want, how they want it, where and when—even how much they’d like to pay—outside of any vendor’s system of customer control. Customers will be able to form and break relationships with vendors, on customers’ own terms, and not just on the take-it-or-leave-it terms that have been pro forma since Industry won the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Customer power will be personal, not just collective.&nbsp; Each customer will come to market equipped with his or her own means for collecting and storing personal data, expressing demand, making choices, setting preferences, proffering terms of engagement, offering payments and participating in relationships—whether those relationships are shallow or deep, and whether they last for moments or years. Those means will be standardized. No vendor will control them.</p>
<p>Demand will no longer be expressed only in the forms of cash, collective appetites, or the inferences of crunched data over which the individual has little or no control. Demand will be personal. This means customers will be in charge of personal information they share with all parties, including vendors.</p>
<p>Customers will have their own means for storing and sharing their own data, and their own tools for engaging with vendors and other parties.&nbsp; With these tools customers will run their own loyalty programs—ones in which vendors will be the members. Customers will no longer need to carry around vendor-issued loyalty cards and key tags. This means vendors’ loyalty programs will be based on genuine loyalty by customers, and will benefit from a far greater range of information than tracking customer behavior alone can provide.</p>
<p>Thus relationship management will go both ways. Just as vendors today are able to manage relationships with customers and third parties, customers tomorrow will be able to manage relationships with vendors and fourth parties, which are companies that serve as agents of customer demand, from the customer’s side of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Relationships between customers and vendors will be voluntary and genuine, with loyalty anchored in mutual respect and concern, rather than coercion. So, rather than “targeting,” “capturing,” “acquiring,” “managing,” “locking in” and “owning” customers, as if they were slaves or cattle, vendors will earn the respect of customers who are now free to bring far more to the market’s table than the old vendor-based systems ever contemplated, much less allowed.</p>
<p>Likewise, rather than guessing what might get the attention of consumers—or what might “drive” them like cattle—vendors will respond to actual intentions of customers. Once customers’ expressions of intent become abundant and clear, the range of economic interplay between supply and demand will widen, and its sum will increase. The result we will call the Intention Economy.</p>
<p>This new economy will outperform the Attention Economy that has shaped marketing and sales since the dawn of advertising. Customer intentions, well-expressed and understood, will improve marketing and sales, because both will work with better information, and both will be spared the cost and effort wasted on guesses about what customers might want, and flooding media with messages that miss their marks. Advertising will also improve.</p>
<p>The volume, variety and relevance of information coming from customers in the Intention Economy will strip the gears of systems built for controlling customer behavior, or for limiting customer input. The quality of that information will also obsolete or re-purpose the guesswork mills of marketing, fed by crumb-trails of data shed by customers’ mobile gear and Web browsers. “Mining” of customer data will still be useful to vendors, though less so than intention-based data provided directly by customers.</p>
<p>In economic terms, there will be high opportunity costs for vendors that ignore useful signaling coming from customers. There will also be high opportunity gains for companies that take advantage of growing customer independence and empowerment.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this hasn’t happened yet. Why?</p>
<p>Let’s start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand">supply and demand</a>, which is roughly about price. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp">Wikipedia</a>: “the relationship between the price of a given good or product and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it.” But that wasn’t the original idea. “Supply and demand” was first expressed as “demand and supply” by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Steuart_%28economist%29">Sir James Denham-Steuart</a> in An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy, written in 1767. To Sir James, demand and supply wasn’t about price. Specifically, “it must constantly appear reciprocal. If I demand a pair of shoes, the shoemaker either demands money or something else for his own use.” Also, “The nature of demand is to encourage industry.”</p>
<p>Nine years later, in The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith, a more visible bulb in the Scottish Enlightenment, wrote, “The real and effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman is that of his customers. It is the fear of losing their employment which restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence.” Again, nothing about price.</p>
<p>But neither&nbsp;of those guys lived to see the industrial age take off. When that happened, demand became an effect of supply, rather than a cause of it. Supply came to run whole markets on a massive scale, with makers and distributors of goods able to serve countless customers in parallel. The industrial age also ubiquitized standard-form&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adhesion_contract_%28contract_of_adhesion%29">contracts of adhesion</a> binding all customers to one supplier with a single “agreement.”</p>
<p>But, had Sir James and Adam lived into the current millennium, they would have seen that it is now possible, thanks to digital technologies and the Internet, for customers to achieve scale across many companies, with efficiencies not imaginable in the pre-digital industrial age.</p>
<p>For example, it should be possible for a customer to express her intentions—say, “I need a stroller for twins downtown this afternoon”—to whole markets, but without being trapped inside any one company’s walled garden. In other words, not only inside Amazon, eBay or Craigslist. This is called <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Intentcasting">intentcasting</a>,&nbsp;and among its virtues is what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)">Kim Cameron</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/01/the_laws_of_identity.shtml">calls</a> “minimum disclosure for constrained purposes” to “justifiable parties” through a choice among a “plurality of operators.”</p>
<p>Likewise, there is no reason why websites and services can’t agree to&nbsp;your&nbsp;privacy policy, and your&nbsp;terms of engagement. In legal terms, you should be able to operate as the first party, and to proffer your own terms, to which sites and services can agree (or, as privacy laws now say, consent) as second parties. That this is barely thinkable is a legacy of a time that has sadly not yet left us: one in which only companies can enjoy that kind of scale. Yet it would clearly be a convenience to have privacy as normalized in the online world as it is in the offline one. But we’re slowly getting there; for example with Customer Commons’ <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">P2B1, aka #NoStalking</a> term, which readers can proffer and publishers can agree agree to. It says “Just give me ads not based on tracking me.” Also with the IEEE’s <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/7012.html">P7012&nbsp;Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms</a>&nbsp;working group.</p>
<p>Same with <a href="https://customercommons.org/solving-subscriptions/">subscriptions</a>. A person should be able to keep track of all her regular payments for subscription services, to keep track of new and better deals as they come along, to express to service providers her intentions toward those new deals, and to cancel or unsubscribe. There are lots of tools for this today, for example&nbsp;<a href="https://zdcs.link/Truebill?_ga=2143292681.1599871823&amp;t=lineup-page&amp;el=Truebill&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fhow-to%2Fhow-to-track-and-manage-your-paid-subscriptions&amp;cd2=Story%20Slideshow&amp;cd61=lineup&amp;cd62=04H2Trg3sEkVXbHd1PljSHY">Truebill</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bobbyapp.co/">Bobby</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moneydashboard.com/">Money Dashboard</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://mint.intuit.com/">Mint</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subscriptme-personal-finance/id963594756">Subscript Me</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bill-tracker-pro/id1059461492">BillTracker Pro</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.asktrim.com/">Trim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://subby.online/">Subby</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/card-due-credit-card-bill-tracker/id1073417260">Card Due</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.siftwallet.com/">Sift</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tilicho.subman&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">SubMan</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subscriptme-bill-tracker/id963594756">Subscript Me</a>. There are also subscription management systems offered by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/how-paypal-works">Paypal</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/magazines-subscription-manager">Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039">Apple</a>&nbsp;and Google (e.g. with&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/">Google Sheets</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yq4KbccszG71lj0QTStMciiGdFVSgMlspAi4gAomDAY/template/preview">Google Doc templates</a>). But all of them to one degree or another are based more on the felt need by those suppliers for customer captivity than for customer independence.</p>
<p>As Customer Commons unpacks it <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/">here</a>, there are many largely or entirely empty market spaces that are wide open for free and independent customers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">identity</a>, shopping (e.g. with shopping carts of your own to take from site to site), loyalty (of the genuine kind), property ownership (the real Internet of Things), and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">payments</a>, for example.</p>
<p>It is possible to fill all those spaces if we have the capacity to—as Sir James put it—encourage industry, restrain fraud and correct negligence. While there is some progress in some of those areas, the going is still slow on the global scale. After all,&nbsp;The Intention Economy is nine years old and we still don’t have it yet. Is it just not possible, or are we starting in the wrong places?</p>
<p>I think it’s the latter.</p>
<p>Way back in 1995, when the Internet first showed up on both of our desktops, my wife Joyce said, “The sweet spot of the Internet isn’t global. It’s local.” That was the gist of my <a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">TEDx Santa Barbara talk in 2018</a>. It’s also why Joyce and I are now in Bloomington, Indiana, working&nbsp;with the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a> at Indiana University on deploying a new way for demand and supply to inform each other and get business rolling—and to start locally. It’s called the <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Byway</a>, and it works outside of the old supply-controlled industrial model.&nbsp;<a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/intention-byway/intention-byway-faq/">Here’s an FAQ</a>. Please feel free to add questions in the comments <a href="https://customercommons.org/the-intention-byway-has-an-faq/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The article shows how an ASP.NET Core API and a Blazor BBF application can be implemented in the same project and secured using Azure AD with Microsoft.Identity.Web. The Blazor application is secured using the BFF pattern with its backend APIs protected using cookies with anti-forgery protection and same site. The API is protected using JWT Bearer tokens and used from a separate client from a different domain, not from the Blazor application. This API is not used for the Blazor application. When securing Blazor WASM hosted in an ASP.NET Core application, BFF architecture should be used for the Blazor application and not JWT tokens, especially in Azure where it is not possible to logout correctly.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The Blazor application consists of three projects. The Server project implements the OpenID Connect user interaction flow and authenticates the client as well as the user authentication. The APIs created for the Blazor WASM are protected using cookies. A second API is implemented for separate clients and the API is protected using JWT tokens. Two separate Azure App registrations are setup for the UI client and the API. If using the API, a third Azure App registration would be used for the client, for example an ASP.NET Core Razor page, or a Power App.</p>



<p>API </p>



<p>The API is implemented and protected with the MyJwtApiScheme scheme. This will be implemented later in the Startup class. The API uses swagger configurations for Open API 3 and a simple HTTP GET is implemented to validate the API security.</p>


  [Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "MyJwtApiScheme")]
[Produces("application/json")]
[SwaggerTag("Using to provide a public api for different clients")]
public class MyApiJwtProtectedController : ControllerBase
{
	[HttpGet]
	[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK, Type = typeof(string))]
	[SwaggerOperation(OperationId = "MyApiJwtProtected-Get", 
		Summary = "Returns string with details")]
	public IActionResult Get()
	{
		return Ok("yes my public api protected with Azure AD and JWT works");
	}
}
  


<p>Blazor BFF</p>



<p>The Blazor applications are implemented using the backend for frontend security architecture. All security is implemented in the backend and the client requires a secret or a certificate to authenticate. The security data is stored to an encrypted cookie with same site protection. This is easier to secure than storing tokens in the browser storage, especially since Blazor does not support strong CSPs due to the generated Javascript and also that AAD does not support a proper logout for access tokens, refresh tokens stored in the browser. The following blog post explains this in more details.</p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/08/securing-blazor-web-assembly-using-cookies/">Securing Blazor Web assembly using&nbsp;cookies</a></p>



<p>Microsoft.Identity.Web</p>



<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package is used to implement the Azure AD clients. This setup is different to the documentation. The default schemes need to be set correctly when using Cookie (App) authentication and also API Auth together. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp method sets up the Blazor authentication for one Azure App registration using configuration from the AzureAd settings. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi method implements the second Azure App registration for the JWT Bearer token Auth using the AzureAdMyApi settings and the MyJwtApiScheme scheme.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt; 
{
	options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration, "AzureAd", 
	OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
   .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
   .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/beta",
		"User.ReadBasic.All user.read")
   .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

services.AddAuthentication("MyJwtApischeme")
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(
		Configuration, "AzureAdMyApi", "MyJwtApiScheme");
  


<p>app.settings</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core project uses app.settings and user secrets in development to configure the Azure AD clients. The two Azure App registrations values are added here.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
	"TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
	"ClientId": "46d2f651-813a-4b5c-8a43-63abcb4f692c",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
},
"AzureAdMyApi": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
	"TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
	"ClientId": "b2a09168-54e2-4bc4-af92-a710a64ef1fa"
},
  


<p>Swagger</p>



<p>Swagger is added to make it easier to view and test the API. A simple UI is created so that you can paste your access token into the UI and test the APIs manually if required. You could also implement a user flow directly in the Swagger UI but then you would have to open up the security headers protection to allow this. </p>


  services.AddSwaggerGen(c =&gt;
{
	c.EnableAnnotations();

	// add JWT Authentication
	var securityScheme = new OpenApiSecurityScheme
	{
		Name = "JWT Authentication",
		Description = "Enter JWT Bearer token **_only_**",
		In = ParameterLocation.Header,
		Type = SecuritySchemeType.Http,
		Scheme = "bearer", // must be lower case
		BearerFormat = "JWT",
		Reference = new OpenApiReference
		{
			Id = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
			Type = ReferenceType.SecurityScheme
		}
	};
	c.AddSecurityDefinition(securityScheme.Reference.Id, securityScheme);
	c.AddSecurityRequirement(new OpenApiSecurityRequirement
	{
		{securityScheme, Array.Empty&lt;string&gt;() }
	});
	c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
	{
		Title = "My API",
		Version = "v1",
		Description = "My API"
	});

});
  


<p>The Swagger middleware is added after the security headers middleware. Some people only add this to dev and not production deployments.</p>


  app.UseSwagger(); 
app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;
{
	c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "MyApi v1");
});

  


<p>Testing</p>



<p>The UITestClientForApiTest Razor Page application can be used to login and get an access token to test the API. Before starting this application, the AzureAD configuration in the settings need to be updated to match your Azure App registration and your tenant. The access token can be used directly in the Swagger UI. The API only accepts delegated access tokens and no CC tokens etc. The configuration in the Blazor server application also needs to match the Azure App registrations in your tenant. </p>







<p>This setup is good for simple projects where you would like to avoid creating a second deployment or you want to re-use a small amount of business logic from the Blazor server. At some stage, it would probably make sense to split the API and the Blazor UI into two separate projects which would make this security setup more simple again but result in more infrastructure.</p>

<p>I’ve been building and working with REST APIs for many years now. Recently, however, I’ve been spending more and more of my time working with (and building) GraphQL-based APIs.</p>

<p>While GraphQL has generally made my life easier, especially as I’ve been building and consuming more data-heavy APIs, there is still one extremely annoying problem I’ve run into over and over again: lack of GraphQL support for third-party APIs I need to consume.</p>

<p>If I’m trying to use a third-party API service that doesn’t have a GraphQL endpoint, I either need to:</p>

 
 Download, install, configure, and learn how to use their custom REST API clients (which takes a lot of time and means my codebase is now a bit cluttered), or 
 Build my own GraphQL proxy for their service… But this is a big task. I’ve got to read through all their REST API docs and carefully define GraphQL schemas for everything, learning all the ins and outs of their API as I go. 
 

<p>In short: it’s a lot of work either way, but if I really want to use GraphQL everywhere I have to work for it.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, every API service would have a GraphQL endpoint, this way I could just use a single GraphQL library to query all the API services I need to talk to.</p>

<p>Luckily, one of my favorite developer tools, <a href="https://stepzen.com/" title="StepZen">StepZen</a> (disclaimer: I advise them), has made this problem a lot less painful.</p>

 What StepZen Does 

<p>StepZen is a platform that lets you host a GraphQL endpoint to use in your applications. But, more importantly, they’ve designed a schema system that lets you import (or build your own) GraphQL wrappers for just about anything: REST APIs, databases, etc. It’s really neat!</p>

<p>Using the StepZen CLI, for example, I can create a new GraphQL endpoint that allows me to talk with the <a href="https://www.airtable.com/" title="Airtable">Airtable</a> and <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html" title="FedEx">FedEx</a> APIs, neither of which support GraphQL natively. The beautiful thing is, I don’t even need to write a GraphQL wrapper for this myself since someone else already did!</p>

<p>Here’s what this looks like (assuming you’ve already got the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/cli" title="StepZen CLI">StepZen CLI</a> installed and initialized):</p>

 <code>$ stepzen import airtable
$ stepzen import fedex
$ stepzen start
</code> 

<p>Using the <code>import</code> command, StepZen will download the publicly available GraphQL schemas for these services (Airtable and FedEx) to your local directory. The <code>start</code> command then launches a GraphQL explorer on localhost, port 5000, which you can use to interactively query the Airtable and FexEx APIs using GraphQL! Pretty neat!</p>

<p></p>

 How to Access Public GraphQL Schemas 

<p>So, let’s say you want to use GraphQL to query an API service that doesn’t support GraphQL. If you’re using StepZen, you can find all the publicly available (official) schemas on the <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Schemas on GitHub">StepZen Schemas repo</a> on GitHub. This repo is namespaced, so if you see a folder in the project, you can use the <code>stepzen import</code> command on it directly. At the time of writing, there are 24 publicly available GraphQL schemas you can instantly use.</p>

<p>StepZen currently has support for lots of popular developer services: <a href="https://disqus.com/api/docs/" title="Disqus API">Disqus</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest" title="GitHub API">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/admin/rest/reference" title="Shopify API">Shopify</a>, etc.</p>

<p>You can, of course, create your own GraphQL schemas as well.</p>

 The Problem I Ran Into with GraphQL 

<p>Several months ago I was working on a simple user-facing web app. The entire backend of the app was using GraphQL and I was trying to keep the codebase as pure as possible, which meant not using any REST APIs directly.</p>

<p>In all my years of building web apps, I’ve always used a REST API at some point. So this was a bit of an experiment to see whether or not I could build my app without cluttering my codebase with REST API clients or requests.</p>

<p>As I was working on the app, I went to use one of my favorite free API services, <a href="https://randomuser.me/" title="Random User">Random User</a>. If you haven’t heard of it before, it’s a publicly available REST API you can hit to generate realistic-looking fake users. It’s incredible for building a development environment, using seed data in an app, or creating real-world-looking MVPs. I use it all the time.</p>

<p>I knew going into this process that the Random User API didn’t have a GraphQL endpoint, so I figured I’d spend some time creating one for them.</p>

 How to Convert a REST API to GraphQL 

<p>My goal, as I mentioned above, was to build a GraphQL endpoint for the Random User REST API.</p>

<p>In order to make this work, what you have to do is translate your REST API so the <a href="https://stepzen.com/" title="StepZen">StepZen service</a> can understand which endpoints you are hitting and what types of inputs and outputs they require.</p>

<p>Once you’ve defined all this, StepZen will be able to create a GraphQL endpoint for your app. When your app queries the StepZen GraphQL endpoint, StepZen will translate your GraphQL request into the proper REST API call, execute the request, then translate the response and send it back to your app in standard GraphQL format.</p>

<p>Here’s how you can convert any REST API to GraphQL using StepZen, step-by-step.</p>

 Step 1: Read Through the REST API Docs and Identify Endpoints to Convert 

<p>The first part of converting any REST API to GraphQL is to fully understand what endpoints you want to convert from REST to GraphQL.</p>

<p>In my case, the Random User API only has a single endpoint, so this isn’t complicated. But, let’s say you’re converting a large, popular API like <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api" title="Twilio API">Twilio</a> that has many endpoints… This can be much more difficult.</p>

<p>To make things simpler, here’s what I recommend: when converting a REST API to GraphQL, identify the endpoints you actually need and ignore the rest. Trying to build an entire abstraction layer for a massive API like Twilio would be difficult, so instead, focus only on the key endpoints you need to use. In the future, if you need to use additional endpoints, you can always add support for them.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is especially true if you’re using StepZen. It’s incredibly easy to support additional endpoints in StepZen once you have a basic schema going, so don’t feel bad about focusing on the important ones and ignoring the rest.</p>

<p>Following this just-in-time pattern will help save you time and get you back to working on the important stuff.</p>

 Step 2: Understand the REST Endpoint’s Schema 

<p>Every API endpoint has some sort of schema. For example, the Random User API, when queried, returns a blob of JSON similar to the following:</p>

 <code>{
  "results": [
    {
      "gender": "male",
      "name": {
        "title": "mr",

<p>Since the purpose of the Random User API is to return random user data, I can clearly see in the JSON data many of the fields I might be interested in working with: <code>email</code>, <code>cell</code>, <code>username</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Once you’ve clearly identified the fields you want to make use of, move on to the next step.</p>

 Step 3: Create a Corresponding GraphQL Schema 

<p>Once you’ve figured out which fields you want to make use of, you need to define a <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/" title="GraphQL Schema">GraphQL schema</a> that will tell the StepZen service how to understand the endpoint’s response.</p>

<p>You don’t need to be a wizard to do this, just pick out the important fields (and their types) from a REST API response, then build a corresponding GraphQL type.</p>

<p>For example, here’s the <code>RandomUser</code> type I defined based on the REST API output above:</p>

 <code>type RandomUser {
  gender: String!
  title: String!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  streetNumber: Int!
  streetName: String!
  city: String!
  state: String!
  country: String!
  postcode: String!
  latitude: String!
  longitude: String!
  timezoneOffset: String!
  timezoneDescription: String!
  email: String!
  uuid: String!
  username: String!
  password: String!
  salt: String!
  md5: String!
  sha1: String!
  sha256: String!
  dateOfBirth: Date!
  age: Int!
  registeredDate: DateTime!
  registeredAge: Int!
  phone: String!
  cell: String!
  largePicture: String!
  mediumPicture: String!
  thumbnailPicture: String!
  nationality: String!
}
</code> 

<p>As you can see, I simply defined the fields I care about from the REST response, along with their type.</p>

<p>NOTE: The exclamation point after many of these fields is to mark these fields as non-nullable. This means that no matter what, these fields should always be present in a response.</p>

<p>What you’ll want to do is create a new folder in your project and put this code into a file named <code>&lt;servicename&gt;.graphql</code>. In my case, I created the following directory tree and put the code into the <code>randomuser.graphql</code> file.</p>

 <code>randomuser
└─ randomuser.graphql
</code> 

 Step 4: Define a GraphQL Query 

<p>Once your data modeling is complete and you’ve defined your type(s), it’s time to define a special <code>Query</code> type that will tell the StepZen service how to communicate with the REST API you’re converting.</p>

<p>To get started, edit the <code>&lt;servicename&gt;.graphql</code> file and add the following <code>Query</code> definition:</p>

 <code>type Query {
  randomUser: RandomUser
    @rest(
      endpoint: "https://randomuser.me/api"
      resultroot: "results[]"
    )
}
</code> 

<p>This is a barebones query that essentially tells StepZen the <code>randomUser</code> query will return data of type <code>RandomUser</code> (which we defined in the previous step) and will get data by hitting the <code>https://randomuser.me/api</code> endpoint, then parsing the data out of the <code>results</code> JSON array field.</p>

<p>But… That’s not all! We still have more work to do.</p>

<p>When I defined the <code>RandomUser</code> type above, I decided to make all the data flat, and not nested like it was in the original REST API. This is because I don’t need any special nested fields when I generate a random user, I just want the data!</p>

<p>So, the next thing we need to do is explain to StepZen how to convert the nested JSON key/values into the custom schema I defined. To do this, we’ll use the <code>setters</code> REST directive StepZen provides:</p>

 <code>type Query {
  randomUser: RandomUser
    @rest(
      setters: [
        { field: "title", path: "name.title" }
        { field: "firstName", path: "name.first" }
        { field: "lastName", path: "name.last" }
        { field: "streetNumber", path: "location.street.number" }
        { field: "streetName", path: "location.street.name" }
        { field: "city", path: "location.city" }
        { field: "state", path: "location.state" }
        { field: "country", path: "location.country" }
        { field: "postcode", path: "location.postcode" }
        { field: "latitude", path: "location.coordinates.latitude" }
        { field: "longitude", path: "location.coordinates.longitude" }
        { field: "timezoneOffset", path: "location.timezone.offset" }
        { field: "timezoneDescription", path: "location.timezone.description" }
        { field: "uuid", path: "login.uuid" }
        { field: "username", path: "login.username" }
        { field: "password", path: "login.password" }
        { field: "salt", path: "login.salt" }
        { field: "md5", path: "login.md5" }
        { field: "sha1", path: "login.sha1" }
        { field: "sha256", path: "login.sha256" }
        { field: "dateOfBirth", path: "dob.date" }
        { field: "age", path: "dob.age" }
        { field: "registeredDate", path: "registered.date" }
        { field: "registeredAge", path: "registered.age" }
        { field: "largePicture", path: "picture.large" }
        { field: "mediumPicture", path: "picture.medium" }
        { field: "thumbnailPicture", path: "picture.thumbnail" }
        { field: "nationality", path: "nat" }
      ]
      endpoint: "https://randomuser.me/api"
      resultroot: "results[]"
    )
}
</code> 

<p>Using the <code>setters</code> directive, we’re able to tell StepZen which fields in our <code>RandomUser</code> type can be supplied by which nested paths from the raw REST API JSON data. Neat!</p>

<p>There are lots of other things you can define using StepZen, so even if you have an incredibly complex endpoint there are always ways to support it. To learn more about this, you might want to read through the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/connecting-backends/how-to-connect-a-rest-service">StepZen docs</a> on the subject.</p>

 Step 5: Define the API Metadata 

<p>Once you’ve finished defining the data model and query, the next thing you’ll want to do is prepare your GraphQL API schema for production!</p>

<p>In my case, I wanted to contribute my schema back to the StepZen developer community, so I forked the <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Schemas Repo">stepzen-schemas repo</a> and created a new top-level folder named <code>randomuser</code> in which I put my query/data model from above.</p>

<p>I then wrote up a README and created  a <code>stepzen.config.json</code> file which provides details about this schema:</p>

 <code>{
  "name": "RandomUser",
  "description": "Generates random users for testing purposes using the randomuser.me API.",
  "categories": ["Dev Tools"]
}
</code> 

<p>Notice how all I’m providing is a <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, and any relevant <code>categories</code> this schema fits into.</p>

<p>Finally, I opened a pull request to the StepZen repo and the maintainers tested and merged my schema into the repo so anyone could use it!</p>

<p>Now, if you have no interest in creating a public GraphQL schema for the REST API you’re converting, you can obviously skip this step. So long as you have a folder with your service name and your data model/queries defined, you can use StepZen to run your endpoint regardless of whether or not your schema is publicly available to the world.</p>

 Using Your Converted REST API 

<p>Once you’ve built a schema that teaches StepZen how to talk to the REST API, how do you actually use it?</p>

<p>Well, in the example above, I built a public-facing StepZen schema and contributed it back to the community. In this case, I can simply use this schema like I would any other:</p>

 <code>$ stepzen import randomuser
$ stepzen start
</code> 

<p>This will download and install the schema I built, then deploy the code in the current directory to my personal StepZen GraphQL endpoint. It’ll also watch the directory for changes and automatically deploy them if I tweak any of the schema code, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the <code>start</code> command will open a browser window with the StepZen Schema Explorer that will allow you to test your API by exploring the queries and types available and querying the API running on StepZen.</p>

<p>If you want to start querying your new GraphQL endpoint directly from an application, read through the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/connecting-frontends/connecting-to-stepzen" title="Connecting to Your StepZen API">Connecting to Your StepZen API Guide</a> which shows some examples of how to connect/query your new GraphQL API.</p>

 Recap: How to Convert a REST API You Don’t Control to GraphQL 

<p>If you’re trying to find a way to use GraphQL on a REST API, here’s what you should do.</p>

<p>First, check StepZen’s list of <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Publicly Supported Schemas">publicly supported schemas</a> to see if a schema already exists. This means you can use GraphQL to access the API of your choice without doing much.</p>

<p>If there isn’t a public schema available, go build your own! To do this:</p>

 
 Figure out what endpoints you need to use 
 Figuring out what data your endpoints take as input/output 
 Define a GraphQL type to reflect what your endpoints look like in GraphQL 
 Define a StepZen query to explain how the StepZen service can interact with the REST API 
 

<p>Once you have a schema, you can easily deploy it live to the StepZen service, which will give you a dedicated GraphQL endpoint/explorer you can query. And bam, you’re now able to use GraphQL to talk to any REST API, even ones you don’t own/control/etc!</p>

   New Zealand is considering launching its own digital currency as it sees opportunity for payments innovation 

 I’m worried. They don’t even have digital vaccine certificates and their Covid app i just won’t use ( though I do carry a pen to sign in manually ).

<p>A derived version of this article was published by the <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/?p=103731&amp;preview=1&amp;_ppp=2bb3b8b890">Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a> on October 7, 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you heard? Mobile is a big deal. The <a>majority of the world’s population carries a mobile device</a>, and there are <a>billions of connected devices</a> integrated throughout nearly every part of our daily life. Why does this insight matter? Putting it another way, mobile is the guiding light that leads enterprises down the path of commercial success. Commercial success requires The 3Cs: Connection, Communication, Commerce. One of the four core threads that connect these three stepping stones to commercial success is mobile; the other three are communications, content, and identity (aka personal information). Everyone in an enterprise must understand this, from the c-suite to the staffer. Why? Because today’s connected [mobile] individual is the point of everything along the customer journey. They are the point of discovery. The point of consideration. The point of sales/transaction. The point of engagement. The point of loyalty. Point of exit. And, at each point of engagement, mobile identity plays an irreplaceable role. We’re still early days in mobile identity, but the market is shaping and reshaping up quickly.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see the mobile device as playing an almost irreplaceable role in terms of this linkage between a physical person in live space, or meatspace, you might say, and the digital realm.” – Cameron D’Ambrosi, Managing Director, Liminal 2021 (MEF PD&amp;I Working Group Guest Speaker, 2021)</p></blockquote>
 Mobile Identity: A Pillar for Commercial Success 
<p>Mobile identity sits at the heart of most commercial experiences. Identity can help organizations know, with varying levels of assurance, who is on the other end of a device (aka “know your customer”); likewise, soon but not just yet, it will enable individuals to know the enterprise too (aka “know the sender”). The ability for enterprises and the connected individual to know, with absolute assurance (aka deterministic identity) or with varying degrees of assurance (aka probabilistic identity), who the human or entity is on the other end of a device is extremely important. When we have identity assurance, we can have transparency in our transactions, communications, and relationships. This transparency fosters trust, which in turn leads to lasting connections, effective communications, and commerce. Moreover, this transparency will allow organizations to better serve people at every stage along the customer lifecycle (acquisition, consideration, conversation, adoption, loyalty, and offboarding), while simultaneously meeting their contractual, legal and regulatory obligations and protecting themselves and their stakeholders from fraud and other cybercrime. With the systematic foundation of trust that mobile identity enables, a world of abundance can lay out our feet.</p>
 Mobile Ecosystem Forum PD&amp;I Working Group 
<p>The <a>Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a> is a global big-tent trade body made of leading cross-sector organizations from around the world. Its mission is to help foster a healthy, responsible, mobile ecosystem, one where mobile can be used as an effective tool to bring social and commercial prosperity to every region, organization, and individual.</p>
<p>It is accomplishing this by engaging in a range of initiatives that generate insights, stimulate interaction, and make a positive impact. Much of the MEFs work happens at a grassroots level in its workgroups. For example, the <a>Personal Data &amp; Identity Working Group</a>, chaired by <a>Andrew Perkin-White</a>, focuses on mobile identity, the emerging personal data economy, the growth and application of people-centric regulations (e.g.&nbsp;<a>GDPR</a>, <a>CCPA</a>), the annual <a>MEF global trust study</a>, and more. The working group meets monthly to discuss and prioritize the effort across all its initiatives.</p>
 MEF PD&amp;I Working Group Guest Speaker 
<p>Periodically the working group invites a guest speaker to the monthly working group meeting. September 20, 2021, the group was fortunate enough to have <a>Cameron D’Ambrosi</a>, Managing Director, <a>Liminal</a>, join the meeting and share his thoughts on the state of the global identity infrastructure market ecosystem, both today and in the years to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During his prepared remarks, Cameron shared Liminal’s framework for evaluating identity infrastructure, the “Honeycomb.” He talked through the structure of the Honeycombs, how “anchor” identity solutions sit in the center, adjacent solutions fuse together to support use cases, and various other solutions specialize in the three types of data: deterministic, probabilistic, and self-managed, and their persistent or transitory states. He touched on a number of important topics, including,</p>
 
 The Liminal “Identity Honeycombs” framework 
 The three data types and their two stages 
 Digital ID: A How, not a What 
 Use Case examples 
 Strategies for navigating the landscape 
 Risk/reward management 
 Identity orchestration 
 And more

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/wpFKG8D_kN0"></a></p>
 An Invitation To Lead 
<p>The conversation with Cameron went on much longer than what you heard in the recording above. Why? Because much of the content is reserved for MEF members. If you’re a MEF member, I encourage you to log in to the MEF site and listen to the engaging Q&amp;A the working group members had with Cameron. If you’re not a member of the MEF, I encourage you to consider becoming one. Through the MEF, you can gain indispensable insight, interact with people, and make a difference that will benefit you and your company professionally and personally. An important thing to remember is that with membership in any community, including the MEF, like anything in life, is that you get out of it what you put in. The more you put into your relationship with the MEF and your fellow members, the more you can get out.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this peek into the identity infrastructure marketplace. If you have thoughts and ideas as to where you think the marketplace is going, please do reach out. With the MEF, I’m working on a personal data &amp; identity market assessment report. I’d love to connect with you, see <a>MEF Personal Data &amp; Market Assessment Project (Schedule Interview and Share Insights)</a> to learn about the project, schedule an interview with me, or share your insights and resources.</p>

   I spent the last week mostly surrounded by boxes: we're completing our move to the new place and life is mostly unpacking now. I did find some time to fix some issues with my CDC vaccination history Datasette instance though.

  <p>I spent the last week mostly surrounded by boxes: we're completing our move to the new place and life is mostly unpacking now. I did find some time to fix some issues with my <a href="https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/">CDC vaccination history</a> Datasette instance though.</p>
 Fixing my CDC vaccination history site 
<p>I started tracking changes made to the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total">CDC's COVID Data Tracker</a> website back in Feburary. I created <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history">a git scraper repository</a> for it as part of my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/5/git-scraping/">five minute lightning talk on git scraping</a> (notes and video) at this year's NICAR data journalism conference.</p>
<p>Since then it's been quietly ticking along, recording the latest data in a git repository that now has <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/commits/main">335 commits</a>.</p>
<p>In March I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/commit/bf88c1e6cc3e5b6344a7dfea5d2a70dcb0552847#diff-87ee5504a3e25ac558b343724c905f2f7949e8cec3d92b9c4300bb922afa164f">added a script</a> to build the collected historic data into a SQLite database and publish it to Vercel using GitHub. That started breaking a few weeks ago, and it turnoud out that was because the database file had grown in size to the point where it was too large to deploy to Vercel (~100MB).</p>
<p>I got a bug report about this, so I took some time to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/issues/8">move the deployment over</a> to Google Cloud Run which doesn't have a documented size limit (though in my experience starts to creak once you go above about 2GB.)</p>
<p>I also started publishing the raw collected data <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/issues/9">directly as a CSV file</a>, partly as an excuse to learn <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/googlecloud/gsutil-bucket">how to publish to Google Cloud Storage</a>.</p>
 datasette-template-request 
<p>I released an extremely simple plugin this week called <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-template-request">datasette-template-request</a> - all it does is expose Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#request-object">request object</a> in the context passed to <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html">custom templates</a>, for people who want to update their custom page based on incoming request parameters.</p>
<p>More notable is how I built the plugin: this is the first plugin I've developed, tested and released entirely in my browser using the new <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> online development environment.</p>
<p>I created the new repo using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository">Datasette plugin template repository</a>, opened it up in Codespaces, implemented the plugin and tests, tried it out using the port forwarding feature and then published it to PyPI using the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-template-request/blob/0.1/.github/workflows/publish.yml">publish.yml</a> workflow.</p>
<p>Not having to even open a text editor on my laptop (let alone get a new Python development environment up and running) felt really good. I should turn this into a tutorial.</p>

<a href="https://equalsdrummond.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/workona-wordmark-logo.png"></a>



<p>This is the first post I’ve made in 2 years—for the simple reason that my day job in SSI (the acronym for  <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>—click the link and read the book if you want to learn more) has been all-consuming (and showing no signs of abating).</p>



<p>So that explains why the last post was a rant about an experience with Lyft. It’s blood-boiling incidents like that which move me past the inertia to actually push out a new post.</p>



<p>This post is similar, but with a different ending. Here’s the story:</p>



<p>For at least four years I had been an inveterate user of The Great Suspender browser extension to help save memory due to the dozens of browser tabs I always had open in Chrome.</p>



<p>Then last March <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-kills-the-great-suspender-heres-what-you-should-do-next/">Google remotely blocked The Great Suspender</a> because it had been sold to a malware company.</p>



<p>A friend recommended I try <a href="https://workona.com/">Workona</a> because “it does much more than just suspend tabs—it will transform how you work with your browser”.</p>



<p>I did a little research and found several more such breathless endorsements, so I decided to give Workona a try.</p>



<p>It worked exactly as advertised. Within 30 minutes “my life in a browser” was changed forever. I was never going back. (I won’t go into how Workona works here—just check out the many <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/workona/reviews">rave reviews</a>.)</p>



<p>I was hooked enough that after a few weeks I tweeted out a love letter to Workona. </p>



<blockquote><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/WorkonaHQ">@WorkonaHQ</a> It is rare that a browser utility stands out enough to merit a direct personal endorsement. But Workona is that good. I read so many reviews saying “it will change the way you use your browser” that I wondered if that could really be true. It was. Within minutes.</p></blockquote>



<p>When they replied to thank me, I responded.</p>



<blockquote><p>Honestly, you deserve it. Pretty soon I am going to start wondering, “Am I using Workona inside my browser or am I using my browser inside of Workona?”</p></blockquote>



 End of Act 1. 



<p>Act 2 began at about 6PM last Tuesday night when I clicked the “New Version – Upgrade” button that appears in Workona when there’s a new update. As usual, it refreshed in seconds. </p>



<p>Suddenly there was a new icon next to many of my Workona workspaces. I thought, “Cool, I wonder what new feature this is?” I clicked one to find out…</p>



<p>…and up popped a new dialog saying the workspace was now “locked” and the only way to unlock it was to buy a premium subscription (to that point Workona has been completely free).</p>



<p>I went ballistic. This fantastic new tool that had become an integral part of using my browser was suddenly blocking my own work in my own workspaces. I started clicking madly on the links provided in the upgrade dialog to find out who was responsible for this outrage. When I found a Workona contact form, I was almost shouting at the screen as I typed. A sampling:</p>



<blockquote><p>I am beyond upset that after working with&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;for several months now—whose functionality I love and which I have already recommended to several friends and tweeted about—you suddenly, with NO WARNING—lock all but 5 of my workspaces and hold me hostage to upgrade to free them OR require an SSO connection just to export my own data.</p><p>That, my good friends, is highly unethical business behavior.</p></blockquote>



<p>As you can tell, I was livid.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in the time it took me to go take a short walk and blow off steam, Alex Young at Workona sent me a reply via email.</p>



<blockquote><p>We’re sorry for the frustration this has caused. To start, you should be able to access all of your existing workspaces if you click the “Open workspace” button when you see the Upgrade modal. We are not locking any users out of their workspaces.&nbsp;</p><p>As for SSO, this is just needed to authenticate you for security purposes. You signed in via SSO, and as a result, that’s how we need to verify you.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Alex was right. Despite what the upgrade dialog said, the “Open workspace” button that was greyed out (the universal signal that a button is not functional) did in fact work if you clicked it. So I wasn’t locked out of all-but-5 of my workspaces. They had just made it look that way.</p>



 End of Act 2. 



<p>Act 3 began a few hours later after I finished the work I was under deadline for and finally replied to Alex’s email:</p>



<blockquote><p>Alex, I appreciate the rapid response to my email. I have no idea if&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;has an automatic timer for when that “upgrade prompt” appears for a user or whether&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;just applied the policy today. (If the latter, I worry that you and the rest of the support staff have been flooded with complaints like mine today.)</p><p>Honestly—and feel free to share this within the company—I would have been much more supportive if the whole thing had been messaged differently. For example:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>First, an advanced notice could have been made that explained the change in policy—there was NO WARNING whatsoever.</p><p>Second, the upgrade could have explained that you can still access the rest of your workspaces, you just have to go through the nag screen.</p><p>But the best way to handle it would have been to be upfront from the start and explain that the free version supports up to 5 workspaces and beyond that, you have to subscribe.</p></blockquote>



<p>That began a dialog in several more rounds of email with Alex where he acknowledged my criticisms and explained the rationale behind the upgrade policy. I particularly appreciated this one:</p>



<blockquote><p>We did send out an email to all of our users that the change would be happening – are you subscribed to receive our emails?&nbsp;</p><p>As for the rest of your feedback, I have passed this along to our product team.&nbsp;<br>Also – a little background regarding our current pricing: We have had to overcome immense technical challenges in the development of what we believe is the world’s best browser&nbsp;work&nbsp;manager.</p><p>Work&nbsp;has steadily moved from the desktop to the cloud, and many people do almost all of their most important&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser these days. For people that&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser, $7 is a good match to the value our app provides, and our pricing survey data backs this up. If you don’t&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser, or don’t feel you need a professional/reliable&nbsp;work&nbsp;management system, then we certainly understand that a different solution may be a better fit. We hope this helps you better understand why&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;has the premium pricing it does.</p></blockquote>



<p>It turns out that Workona had indeed sent out an advance notice (in email, not in their browser extension) of their change in policy in late August. I was on vacation, naturally, so I had missed it. </p>



<p>When I found it and read it—it was perfectly reasonable. And, although I thought $7/mo was a little on the high side for Workona (I use Zoom 6+ hours a day and it’s $15/mo), I really did feel that Workona represented the future of work in the browser.</p>



<p>I was going to wait until the next day to decide about upgrading. But before I went to bed, Alex had assuaged me enough—and most importantly restored my belief in the intent and integrity of Workona as a company—that I went ahead and subscribed for a year.</p>



<p>That was a pretty dramatic turnaround in a single evening. Kudos to Alex for his premium customer service. As I said to him in my final message:</p>



<blockquote><p>Alex, FYI, I subscribed for the 1 year plan. I want to personally thank you for talking me off the ledge. That’s the kind of customer service that makes or breaks a company IMHO.<br>I have high hopes for&nbsp;Workona. Keep being awesome.</p></blockquote>



 EPILOG 



<p>Today there was another upgrade message from Workona. When I clicked on it, a screen popped up (I had the foresight to take a screenshot) that offered an apology directly to Workona users right there in the browser. It contained a link to <a href="https://workona.com/blog/update-to-premium-plans/">this page on the Workona website</a>, the start of which I’ll excerpt here:</p>



 An Apology From Our CEO 



 



<p>September 24, 2021</p>



<blockquote><p>This week, we made some serious missteps while launching Workona’s premium plans. Please allow me to personally apologize and explain exactly what what we’ve done to make it right.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We assumed that a detailed email sent a month ago announcing the changes was enough advance notice for users. Clearly, we were wrong. Your feedback has made it obvious that this was a major mistake. We should have announced this in the product, multiple times. We messed up, and we’re sorry.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many users were caught off guard by the restrictions of the Free plan and wondered whether Workona was still a good option for them. This was exacerbated by the unclear language we used in our popup, which made them believe they were locked out of their workspaces. This was not the case (and not our intention), but that doesn’t change the damage it did to our users’ trust in Workona.</p></blockquote>



<p>There’s more. I encourage you to go to the Workona website and read the rest.</p>



<p>I took the time to write this post—my first one in two years—because when you screw up as a company—no matter how big or small—this is how you make it right. You bite the bullet, admit your mistake, and fix it, no matter how much work it takes.</p>



<p>The faster and more transparently you do it, the faster you repair the damage and start restoring faith in your company.</p>



<p>Good job, Workona. (And great job, Alex.) My faith in you has been restored, and I’ll continue to recommend you as a browser work management tool. Keep growing it into something even more amazing.</p>

<p>A few months back, I wrote about some of the edge points of the verifiable credentials data model and briefly mentioned that the authorization capabilities for linked data (ZCAP-LD) data model was a useful technology for addressing these edges for building better distributed authorization systems. So what are the differences between these two data models and why am I advocating for the separation of concerns for the two of them? The three main points I want to highlight are the conceptual differences in usages and how the data models assist with enforcing those concepts. Then I’ll highlight the differences in the data models and finally, I’ll connect it all to show how these differences make a difference when building distributed authorization systems.</p>

<p>Conceptually verifiable credentials exist to make provenanced assertions. What does this mean though? Basically, a verifiable credential is a way to know who is making the claims, what the claims are, and who the claims are about and it’s done in a standard way so that all parties who issue, hold, and verify the provenance of the claims can do so without having to pre-coordinate their software design. On the other hand, authorization capabilities (ZCAPs) are designed around removing the concept of who the statements are about and rather building around the concept of an “invoker”. And it’s this difference that allows for an emergence of a different authorization system called object capabilities authorization systems. It’s my personal opinion that object-capability systems are better for most security models being designed today due to the simplicity for relying parties, but we’ll have to save that discussion for a later post.</p>

<p>What’s the difference between a subject and an invoker then? The difference is all in the practicality of pairing the claims with the entity. In the verifiable credential by tying all the claims to a subject there’s an inherent coupling of the claims to identity by the issuer. In technical terms, it’s being paired to an identifier which is the “credentialSubject.id” property which means that the claims that are made should only be extended to a single entity which is the subject of the claims. Anything which extends beyond the original claims made by the issuer is a new credential that needs to be evaluated independently of the original veracity of the claims made by the first issuer.</p>

<p>For example, let’s look at a proof of assets credential:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/1872",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ProofOfAssetsCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049",
  "issuanceDate": "2021-06-04T20:50:09Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
    "TotalAccountValueInUSD": 4156.62,
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2021-06-04T20:50:29Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key-0",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>In this example, we can see that a bank branch is asserting on behalf of the bank that the bank account owner has a total account value with this bank of $4156.62. Now, let’s say the bank account owner has decided to chain their credential to their child so that their child can spend up to $50:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/1872",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ProofOfAssetsCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T20:54:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:child",
    "TotalAccountValueInUSD": 50.00,
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2017-06-18T21:19:10Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>and with this the child is now able to create a verifiable presentation like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab"

</code>   

<p>Let’s break down what is being asserted here, who the verifier needs to trust, and how the verifier would go about processing this verifiable presentation. From what we can see here, the bank is asserting that the bank account owner has a total account value of $4156.62, the bank account owner is asserting that their child is authorized to spend $50.00. Seems to make sense, right? Yeah, but the problem here is how is the verifier supposed to be able to trust that the bank account owner verified the child has that money as well, but why should the verifier trust the bank account owner? From their perspective, there are two problems here. First, they don’t trust any random person to make assertions about the amount of money in another person’s bank account. Second, the verifier is unable to correlate the relationship between the bank account owner and the child. From their perspective, the <code>credentialSubject.id</code> should be expected to be two opaque identifiers assuming all they’ve received is this verifiable presentation. So, the problem here is that the verifier is expected to infer knowledge about what is being stated here which presents risks in the business processes being encoded into software. Are they to assume that they’ll be paid by the bank account owner if the child doesn’t pay? The reality is the verifier shouldn’t rely upon this verifiable presentation because there’s no way to chain the trust and figure out the capabilities that the child should have based only on this verifiable presentation. Sure, they could manage some state about the relationships of the identifiers and coordinate with the bank to know that they’ll make sure someone pays, but that leads to bespoke authorization systems built specifically to the business logic which is unlikely to scale to the size of the internet today within a reasonable time frame. Coordination costs are incredibly expensive (look at how long it takes to make a standard) and managing state makes it nearly impossible to generalize the system outside the particular business process it’s designed for.</p>

<p>How do ZCAPs address this problem then? First off, it’s important to recognize that the model of capabilities lends itself to different statements being made. In the verifiable credential model, traditionally most people using them are making claims about “what the subject is”. Whereas with ZCAP-LD I’ve seen the focus of the statements on what the invoker can do. This slight shift combined with the change from a subject to an invoker changes the focus of the verifier to simplify what needs to be checked and makes the checks more explicit for what they’re checking.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example to see what I mean by this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
  {
      "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
  }],

  // The identifier of this specific zcap object
  "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",

  // Since this is the first delegated capability, the parentCapability
  // points to the target this capability will operate against
  // (in this case, a payment gateway)
  "parentCapability": "https://example.com/paymentGateway",
  
  // the bank account owner is only allowed to spend the amount in their account
  "caveat": [{
       "type": "MaxPayment",
        "maxPaymentValue": 4156.62
  }],

  // We are granting authority to any of bankAccountOwner's verification methods
  "invoker": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
  
  // Finally we sign this object with cryptographic material from
  // Alyssa's Car's capabilityDelegation field, and using the
  // capabilityDelegation proofPurpose.
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
    "capabilityChain": [

    "proofValue": "...",
    "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
    "verificationMethod": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049#key1"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now for the bank account owner to authorize their child to spend $50.00 they need to produce the following delegated capability:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }],

    // The identifier of this specific delegated zcap object
    "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",

    // Pointing up the chain at the capability from
    // which the bank Account Owner was initially 
    // granted authority by their bank
    "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",

    // Bank account owner adds a caveat:
    // child can spend a maximum of 50.00
    "caveat": [{
       "type": "MaxPayment",
        "maxPaymentValue": 50.00
    }],

    // bank account owner grants authority to any
    // verification method of their child's DID
    "invoker": "did:example:child",

    // Finally the bank account owner signs this 
    // object with the key she was granted the 
    // authority with
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
        "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
        "creator": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
        "signatureValue": "..."
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now for the ZCAP to be invoked by the child at the payment gateway to spend $50 they need to produce a ZCAP that looks like the following:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }],

    // The identifier of this specific delegated zcap object
    "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/3",

    // Pointing up the chain at the capability from
    // which the bank Account Owner was initially 
    // granted authority by their bank
    "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",

    // bank account owner grants authority to any
    // verification method of their child's DID
    "invoker": "did:example:child",

    // the chain of capabilities from the trusted entity

    "capabilityChain": [{
        "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
        }],
        "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",
        "parentCapability": "https://example.com/paymentGateway",
        "caveat": [{
            "type": "MaxPayment",
                "maxPaymentValue": 4156.62
        }],
        "invoker": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
        "proof": {
            "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
            "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
            "capabilityChain": [
            "https://example.com/paymentGateway"
            ],
            "proofValue": "...",
            "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
            "verificationMethod": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049#key1"
        }
    },
    {
        "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
        }],
        "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",
        "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",
        "caveat": [{
            "type": "MaxPayment",
            "maxPaymentValue": 50.00
        }],
        "invoker": "did:example:child",
        "proof": {
            "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
            "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
            "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
            "creator": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
            "signatureValue": "..."
        }
    }],
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "proofPurpose": "capabilityInvocation",
        "created": "2018-02-13T21:27:09Z",
        "creator": "did:example:child#key1",
        "signatureValue": "..."
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To verify this ZCAP, the payment gateway verifier needs to do the following:</p>

 
   verify the proof of the original capability 
   verify the original invoker is authorized to delegate the original capability on behalf of the payment gateway 
   verify the original capability meets or exceeds the authorities necessary to perform the request 
   verify the proof that the bank account owner delegated the original capability to the invoker 
   verify the caveats allow the delegated capability to still meet or exceed the authorities necessary to perform the request 
   verify the proof in the capability invoked by the child 
 

<p>So this is a bit simpler for the payment gateway verifying the chain and makes it explicit what’s being delegated through the different parties. The question of the relationship between the different parties has now been eliminated which means that the payment gateway can operate in a stateless method. Additionally, there’s less coordination between the original delegator and the payment gateway verifier. In the object capabilities model, the authorization semantics are all predetermined by what is possible to be authorized which keeps the claims tightly scoped to the purpose of the capabilities being invoked.</p>

<p>The difference here is that the basis of all authority stems from the verifier rather than building off the statements that existed before the verifier did who may not have designed the original claims for authorization systems. And this key difference is what allows for the simplicity of the verifier system to exist. It moves the model back to having the sole authority set by the verifier rather than the verifier having to adapt and potentially misinterpret the original veracity and the chained veracity of the claims.</p>

<p>So what are the drawbacks of the object-capability paradigm and more specifically of the ZCAP-LD data model? Well first and foremost, ZCAPs are fit for building object-capability authorization models and are unlikely to be applicable beyond that intended scope. For me, that’s alright because I like the idea of designing technology to do one thing well. Especially when dealing with security and access control. Whereas the verifiable credentials data model allows for generic statements to be made which are far more useful for verifiable data ecosystems to emerge. Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that the ZCAPs data model is a relatively immature draft report at the credentials community group whereas the verifiable credentials data model has a much more stable recommendation having completed the process to become an international standard recommended by the W3C. This means there’s far more likely to be interoperability between verifiable credential processors than there would be between ZCAPs.</p>

<p>Why put the time and effort into ZCAP-LD when we’ve already got VCs? Simply put because security is hard and trying to push square pegs into round holes oftentimes leads to bugs that are elevated to mission-critical authentication/authorization bypass vulnerabilities. By designing around a fit-for-purpose data model with a well-defined problem being solved it allows for us to be much more precise about where we believe extensibility is important versus where normative statements should be made to simplify the processing of the data models. By extension, this leads to a simpler security model and likely a much more robust design with fewer vulnerabilities. And that’s the reason that I’m a fan of ZCAP-LD.</p>

   New tool: an nginx playground 
 Julia Evans built a sandbox tool for interactively trying out an nginx configuration and executing test requests through it. I love this kind of tool, and Julia's explanation of how they built it using a tiny fly.io instance and a network namespace to reduce the amount of damage any malicious usage could cause is really interesting.

<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/">Office of Management and Budget</a> (OMB) and the <a href="https://cisa.gov">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA) recently released a <a href="https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/federal-zero-trust-strategy/">request for public feedback</a> on a draft strategy for a zero-trust cybersecurity architecture for the US Government in response to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a> issued last May. Public comments were due September 21. The comments I submitted are below.</p>



 



<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment on your draft, Moving the U.S. Government Towards Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles. I hope that the below comments will inform your decisions as you finalize this policy.</p>



 Identity 



 Use of phishing-resistant MFA 



<p>Phishing is an important attack vector and must be addressed. The use of phishing-resistant MFA critically prevents the use of credentials by impostor websites and services such as mobile apps. Requiring phishing-resistant MFA by agency staff, contractors, and partners is a logical step, although existing PIV and derived PIV credentials are already phishing resistant. At the present time, PIV credentials are not available to contractors and partners that typically do not require access to federal facilities, so an alternate approach to this problem might be to unify the authentication methods used by these parties to use PIV or equivalently secure authenticators.</p>



<p>Requiring phishing-resistant MFA as an option for public access to federal websites and online services encourages use and familiarization with these authentication methods by the public, in addition to their direct role in blocking phishing attacks. Members of the public that adopt phishing-resistant authenticators also need to be cautioned against the use of other multifactor authentication methods that they might be prompted to use by phishing actors.</p>



<p>Currently, many commercial products that offer phishing-resistant authentication using the WebAuthn standard do not meet the current technical requirements of verifier impersonation resistance in NIST SP 800-63-3 (cited in footnote 4 of the draft) because they bind the authentication to the domain name of the verifier rather than to the communication channel itself. However, this non-compliance does not significantly impact the phishing resistance of these authenticators. It is widely expected that NIST will recognize these authenticators as an alternative method of achieving verifier impersonation resistance in the next revision of that Guideline. For clarity, it would be useful to explicitly recognize these authenticators as phishing-resistant in this policy as well.</p>



 Checking passwords against blocklists 



<p>This draft notes that CISA will be making a service available to check passwords against known-breached data. Use of a password blocklist is required by NIST SP 800-63B as well. The size of these blocklists should be carefully considered. A blocklist that is too small does not sufficiently protect against the use of common passwords, but a list that includes every common or breached password is likely to frustrate users, who will then focus on coming up with an acceptable password rather than other aspects of password strength such as length. There should also be the ability for individual agencies to supplement these blocklists with agency-specific entries.</p>



<p>The use of common passwords is not the only weakness in password use. Agencies should be reminded of the need to store password verification secrets securely (using, at a minimum, “salting” and iterative hashing) and of the need for rate limiting to blunt online guessing attacks.</p>



 Networks 



 DNS encryption 



<p>The draft policy notes the importance of encrypting DNS traffic, but seems to be undecided on the use of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH, which operates in browsers) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT, which is normally implemented in the operating system). There is significant interesting DNS traffic that is not initiated by browsers, such as that coming from email clients, instant messaging applications, and many others. This policy should consider the need for DNS encryption outside the browser as well as for Web traffic.</p>



<p>Encryption of DNS traffic does limit agencies’ ability to inspect DNS requests for indications of malware and other inappropriate behavior, so there is somewhat of a security tradeoff in its implementation. If CISA’s Protective DNS offering is centralized, it may not be possible for individual agencies to employ DNS monitoring for security purposes.</p>



 DNSSEC 



<p>Notwithstanding the removal (by OMB M-18-23) of the requirement to implement DNSSEC that was established by M-08-23, DNSSEC implementation continues to be an effective defense against demonstrated DNS spoofing attacks and in providing a trust framework for data published in DNS. DNSSEC has a single “source of truth” that is easily monitored for fraud, unlike the WebPKI which has in excess of 100 certificate authorities, any of which could potentially publish a rogue certificate. Minimizing external security dependencies is very much in the spirit of the Zero Trust architecture. While Certificate Transparency helps a vigilant domain to detect the mistaken issuance of a certificate to the wrong party, many CAs are in jurisdictions where they could be compelled to issue a certificate and make it available to a bad actor, perhaps in support of a state-sponsored attack. For this reason, the use of DANE in addition to WebPKI, particularly for sensitive applications, should be strongly considered.</p>



<p>Furthermore, M-08-23 was in some cases interpreted as a requirement to DNSSEC-sign .gov domains but not necessarily to implement DNSSEC verification of DNS requests originating within an agency. In contrast many consumer DNS providers, including internet service providers and services such as Google, implement DNSSEC verification thereby giving their users a security advantage that these agencies currently do not have available. This policy should require verification as well as DNSSEC signing by agencies; verification could potentially be an aspect of the CISA Protective DNS program.</p>



 Encrypting email traffic 



<p>The draft correctly notes the importance of encryption for email traffic. It describes the use of MTA-STS to accomplish this by allowing a domain to advertise a policy that it supports SMTP-over-TLS. However, this publication requires additional infrastructure (web servers) to effect this, and requires caching of previously received policies to overcome the possibility that a bad actor will block the policy advertisement. In contrast DANE, which is deployed on DNSSEC protected domains, provides a way to publish a similar policy without this trust-on-first-use limitation and without the need to stand up additional infrastructure to support policy publication. DANE should be strongly considered as an alternative to MTA-STS for this requirement.</p>



<p>In addition, there is a complementary standard, REQUIRETLS (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8689">RFC 8689</a>), that allows the sender of an email message to tag it to indicate that the message must only be sent over a TLS-protected channel, effectively overriding the opportunistic nature of STARTTLS. This most directly satisfies the stated goal of guaranteeing that Federal emails are encrypted in transit. Unfortunately, REQUIRETLS has not received significant deployment, but government interest in this capability would undoubtedly motivate deployment. REQUIRETLS builds upon MTA-STS or DANE.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned if any further information or clarification is needed.</p>

      <br>  Can we live at the peak paradox?  <br> <p><a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox</a> is the middlemost point of the model. It is the point where everything has equal weight in terms of policy, priority, resources, commitment, interest, data and consequences.&nbsp; It is the area of a perfect storm.&nbsp; It is a magical (or imaginary) place where you can have everything, everyone else can have everything, no one is fighting for survival, and every work situation thrives.&nbsp; In reality, the converse is probably also true. It is where everyone fights for survival; I cannot get what I want, others have nothing and work is just meaningless. It is in between these two states of euphoria and despair that we spend our time.&nbsp; Never reaching utopia but somehow constantly individual’s individual’s feeling one step closer to dystopia.&nbsp; In this state, we have to decide how to allocate the limited resources we have to be able to change the situation (for the better.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst hard to accept, we actually don’t have the data, model or ability to allocate resources for better outcomes as we live in a complex system. In our ecosystem and economy, our actions have consequences that we cannot see. In the USA, they reintroduced wolves and have found that Wolves play a crucial role in keeping ecosystems healthy. They help keep deer and elk populations in check, benefiting individual’s many other plant and animal species. The carcasses of their prey also help to redistribute nutrients and provide food for other wildlife species, like grizzly bears and scavengers. Scientists are just beginning to fully understand the positive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_effect">ripple effects</a> that wolves have on ecosystems. The removal of the wolves was forecast to create a more vibrant and healthy ecosystem, but it turns out it collapses without them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The Ripple Effect is when an initial disturbance to a system propagates outward to disturb an increasingly more significant portion of the system, like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it.&nbsp; The ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier in macroeconomics. For example, an individual's reduction in spending reduces the incomes of others and their ability to spend. Unions negotiating for a pay rise drives prosperity for everyone. In sociology, the ripple effect can be observed in how social interactions can affect situations not directly related to the initial interaction and in charitable activities where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community to broaden its impact.&nbsp; The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software metrics as a complexity measure.</p><p>Living at peak paradox and making decisions at this central point creates ripples. However, we find it easy to predict the positive consequences of ripples we want to see in the direction of the peak purpose we are aiming for on the Peak Paradox model.&nbsp; We are blinded to the adverse effects because we believe we have understood the risks and concluded this is the best action, given where we are and our resources.&nbsp; Equally, we find it near impossible to see any good or bad consequences that can occur in other directions.&nbsp; The point here is that we cannot see how a ripple in a different direction will come back (forward) and change the situation we forecast.&nbsp; This is the complexity of modelling dependent systems that we do not understand, yet believing we have a risk model that does.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the Peak Paradox model is to shine a light on the other views, other perspectives, other consequences, other risks - not to change the decision, but to clarify how our decision will affect others and we are affected by theirs.&nbsp; With the same thinking, others acting with their own agency will optimise for a different peak and, in doing so, create ripples in our tank, highlighting why resilience has become such an important but widely misunderstood topic.&nbsp; We must agree on what we are trying to be resilient for, as it is often hidden.&nbsp;</p><p>The article on <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">how to make better decisions</a> using the Peak Pardox framework suggests that we have to move from the Peak Paradox if we can clarify what we are optimising for and bring the team together.&nbsp; However, the further we become aligned to a Purpose, whilst the easier the decision, the more unified the culture, the less resilient we become to others ripples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Balancing simplicity of decision making, with the allocation of resources and understanding risk and consequences is the optimisation model a board now has to wrestle with. Decision making has never been more challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><br>

  <p>Summary: JSON has its place. But I think we're overusing it in places where a good notation would serve us better.</p>



<p>
    JSON is robot barf. Don't get me wrong. JSON is a fine serialization format for data and I have no problem with it in that context. My beef is with the use of JSON for configuration files, policy specs, and so on. If JSON were all we had, then we'd have to live with it. But we've been building parsers for almost 70 years now. The technology is well understood. There are multiple libraries in every language for parsing. And yet, even very mature, well supported frameworks and platforms persist in using JSON instead of a human-friendly notation. 
</p>

<p>
    When a system requires programmers to use JSON, what they're effectively asking developers to use an "abstract" syntax instead of a "concrete" syntax. Here's what I mean. This is a function definition in concrete syntax:
</p>



<p>
    And here's the same function definition expressed as an abstract syntax tree (AST) serialized as JSON:
</p>



<p>
    I don't know any programmer who'd prefer to write the abstract syntax instead of the concrete. Can you imagine an entire program expressed like that? Virtually unreadable and definitely not maintainable. <a href="https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-parsing-abstract-syntax-trees-asts-5-tips-on-how-to-minimize-parse-time-abfcf7e8a0c8"> Parsing can take as much as 20% of the time taken to compile code</a>, so there's a clear performance win in using abstract syntax over concrete, but even so we, correctly, let the machine do the work. 
</p>

<p>
    I get that systems often start out simply with simple configuration. Some inputs are just hierarchies of data. But that often gets more complicated over time. And spending time figuring out the parser when you're excited to just get it working can feel like a burden. But taking the shortcut of making developers and others write the configuration in abstract syntax instead of letting the computer do the work is a mistake. 
</p>

<p>
    I'd like to say that the problem is that not enough programmers have a proper CS education, but I fear that's not true. I suspect that even people who've studied CS aren't comfortable with parsing and developing notations. Maybe it's because we treat the subject too esoterically—seemingly useful for people designing a programming language, but not much else. And students pick up on that and figure this is something, like calculus, they're unlikely to ever use IRL. What if programming langauge classes helped students learn the joy and benefit of building little languages instead? 
</p>

<p>
    I'm a big believer in the power of notation. And I think we too often shy away from designing the right notation for the job. As I wrote about <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2007/11/domain_specific_language.shtml">Domain Specific Languages</a> (DSLs) in 2007:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        I'm in the middle of reading Walter Isaacson's new biography of Einstein. It's clear that notation played a major role in his ability to come up with the principle of general relativity. He demurred at first, believing that the math was for someone else to come along later and tidy up. But later in his life, after the experience of working on general relativity, Einstein became an ardent convert.</p>
    <p>
        Similarly, there is power in notation for computing tasks. Not merely the advantage of parameterized execution but in it's ability to allow us to think about problems, express them so that other's can clearly and unambiguously see our thoughts, and collaborate to create joint solutions. What's more, languages can be versioned. GUI configurations are hard to version. Notation has advantages even when it's not executed.</p>
    <p>
        The DSL becomes the focal point for design activities. The other day, I was having a discussion with three friends about a particular feature. Pulling out pencil and paper and writing what the DSL would need to look like to support the feature helped all of us focus and come up with solutions. Without such a tool, I'm not sure how we would have communicated the issues or whether we'd have all had the same conception of them and the ultimate solution we reached.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    As this points out, clear notations have advantages beyond being easier to write and understand. They also provide the means to easily share and think about the problem. I think system designers would be better off if we spent more time thinking about the notation developers will use when they configure and use our systems, making it clear and easy to read and write. Good notation is a thinking tool, not just a way to control the system. The result will be increased expressiveness, design leverage, and freedom.

<p>This article shows how to create Microsoft Teams online meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph. Azure AD is used to implement the authentication using Microsoft.Identity.Web and the authenticated user can create teams meetings and send emails to all participants or attendees of the meeting.</p>

  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/09/20/creating-microsoft-teams-meetings-in-asp-net-core-using-microsoft-graph/">Creating Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph</a> (delegated)  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/10/18/creating-microsoft-teams-meetings-in-asp-net-core-using-microsoft-graph-application-permissions-part-2/">Creating Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph application permissions part 2</a>  



<p>Setup Azure App registration</p>



<p>An Azure App registration is setup to authenticate against Azure AD. The ASP.NET Core application will use delegated permissions for the Microsoft Graph. The listed permissions underneath are required to create the teams meetings and to send emails to the attendees. The account used to login needs access to office and should be able to send emails.</p>



  User.Read   Mail.Send   Mail.ReadWrite   OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite  



<p>This is the list of permissions I have activate for this demo. </p>







<p>The Azure App registration requires a user secret or a certificate to authentication the ASP.NET Core Razor page application. Microsoft.Identity.Web uses this to authenticate the application. You should always authenticate the application if possible. </p>



<p>Setup ASP.NET Core application</p>



<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget packages with the MicrosoftGraphBeta package are used to implement the Azure AD client. We want to implement Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and a secret to authenticate the identity and the Microsoft packages implements this client for us. </p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;PackageReference 
	Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web" 
	Version="1.16.1" /&gt;
&lt;PackageReference 
	Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI" 
	Version="1.16.1" /&gt;
&lt;PackageReference 
	Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta" 
	Version="1.16.1" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The ConfigureServices method is used to add the required services for the Azure AD client authentication and the Microsoft Graph client for the API calls. The AddMicrosoftGraph is used to initialize the required permissions.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// more services ...

	var scopes = "User.read Mail.Send Mail.ReadWrite OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite";

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
		.AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/beta", scopes)
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

	services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
}
  


<p>The AzureAd configuration is read from the app.settings file. The secrets are read from the user secrets in local development.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodsharepoint.onmicrosoft.com",
	"TenantId": "5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244",
	"ClientId": "a611a690-9f96-424f-9ea5-4ba99a642c01",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
},
  


<p>Creating a Teams meeting using Microsoft Graph</p>



<p>The OnlineMeeting class from Microsoft.Graph is used to create the teams meeting. In this demo, we added a begin and an end DateTime in UTC and the name (Subject) of the meeting. We want that all invited attendees can bypass the lobby and enter directly into the meeting. This is implemented with the LobbyBypassSettings property. The attendees are added to the meeting using the Upn property and setting this with the email of each attendee. The organizer is automatically set to the identity signed in. </p>


  public OnlineMeeting CreateTeamsMeeting(
	string meeting, DateTimeOffset begin, DateTimeOffset end)
{

	var onlineMeeting = new OnlineMeeting
	{
		StartDateTime = begin,
		EndDateTime = end,
		Subject = meeting,
		LobbyBypassSettings = new LobbyBypassSettings
		{
			Scope = LobbyBypassScope.Everyone
		}
	};

	return onlineMeeting;
}

public OnlineMeeting AddMeetingParticipants(
	OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting, List&lt;string&gt; attendees)
{
	var meetingAttendees = new List&lt;MeetingParticipantInfo&gt;();
	foreach(var attendee in attendees)
	{
		if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(attendee))
		{
			meetingAttendees.Add(new MeetingParticipantInfo
			{
				Upn = attendee.Trim()
			});
		}
	}

	if(onlineMeeting.Participants == null)
	{
		onlineMeeting.Participants = new MeetingParticipants();
	};

	onlineMeeting.Participants.Attendees = meetingAttendees;

	return onlineMeeting;
}
  


<p>A simple service is used to implement the GraphServiceClient instance which is used to send the Microsoft Graph requests. This uses the Microsoft Graph as described by the docs.</p>


  public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; CreateOnlineMeeting(
	OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting)
{
	return await _graphServiceClient.Me
		.OnlineMeetings
		.Request()
		.AddAsync(onlineMeeting);
}

public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; UpdateOnlineMeeting(
	OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting)
{
	return await _graphServiceClient.Me
		.OnlineMeetings[onlineMeeting.Id]
		.Request()
		.UpdateAsync(onlineMeeting);
}

public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; GetOnlineMeeting(
	string onlineMeetingId)
{
	return await _graphServiceClient.Me
		.OnlineMeetings[onlineMeetingId]
		.Request()
		.GetAsync();
}
  


<p>A Razor page is used to create a new Microsoft Teams online meeting. The two services are added to the class and a HTTP Post method implements the form request from the Razor page. This method creates the Microsoft Teams meeting using the services and redirects to the created Razor page with the ID of the meeting. </p>


  [AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "User.read", "Mail.Send", "Mail.ReadWrite", "OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite" })]
public class CreateTeamsMeetingModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly AadGraphApiDelegatedClient _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
	private readonly TeamsService _teamsService;

	public string JoinUrl { get; set; }

	[BindProperty]
	public DateTimeOffset Begin { get; set; }
	[BindProperty]
	public DateTimeOffset End { get; set; }
	[BindProperty]
	public string AttendeeEmail { get; set; }
	[BindProperty]
	public string MeetingName { get; set; }

	public CreateTeamsMeetingModel(AadGraphApiDelegatedClient aadGraphApiDelegatedClient,
		TeamsService teamsService)
	{
		_aadGraphApiDelegatedClient = aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
		_teamsService = teamsService;
	}

	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
	{
		if (!ModelState.IsValid)
		{
			return Page();
		}

		var meeting = _teamsService.CreateTeamsMeeting(MeetingName, Begin, End);

		var attendees = AttendeeEmail.Split(';');
		List&lt;string&gt; items = new();
		items.AddRange(attendees);
		var updatedMeeting = _teamsService.AddMeetingParticipants(
		  meeting, items);

		var createdMeeting = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.CreateOnlineMeeting(updatedMeeting);

		JoinUrl = createdMeeting.JoinUrl;

		return RedirectToPage("./CreatedTeamsMeeting", "Get", new { meetingId = createdMeeting.Id });
	}

	public void OnGet()
	{
		Begin = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;
		End = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(60);
	}
}
  


<p>Sending Emails to attendees using Microsoft Graph</p>



<p>The Created Razor page displays the meeting JoinUrl and some details of the Teams meeting. The page implements a form which can send emails to all the attendees using Microsoft Graph. The EmailService class implements the email logic to send plain mails or HTML mails using the Microsoft Graph.</p>


  using Microsoft.Graph;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;

namespace TeamsAdminUI.GraphServices
{
    public class EmailService
    {
        MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage = new();

        public Message CreateStandardEmail(string recipient, string header, string body)
        {
            var message = new Message
            {
                Subject = header,
                Body = new ItemBody
                {
                    ContentType = BodyType.Text,
                    Content = body
                },
                ToRecipients = new List&lt;Recipient&gt;()
                {
                    new Recipient
                    {
                        EmailAddress = new EmailAddress
                        {
                            Address = recipient
                        }
                    }
                },
                Attachments = MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage
            };

            return message;
        }

        public Message CreateHtmlEmail(string recipient, string header, string body)
        {
            var message = new Message
            {
                Subject = header,
                Body = new ItemBody
                {
                    ContentType = BodyType.Html,
                    Content = body
                },
                ToRecipients = new List&lt;Recipient&gt;()
                {
                    new Recipient
                    {
                        EmailAddress = new EmailAddress
                        {
                            Address = recipient
                        }
                    }
                },
                Attachments = MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage
            };

            return message;
        }

        public void AddAttachment(byte[] rawData, string filePath)
        {
            MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage.Add(new FileAttachment
            {
                Name = Path.GetFileName(filePath),
                ContentBytes = EncodeTobase64Bytes(rawData)
            });
        }

        public void ClearAttachments()
        {
            MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage.Clear();
        }

        static public byte[] EncodeTobase64Bytes(byte[] rawData)
        {
            string base64String = System.Convert.ToBase64String(rawData);
            var returnValue = Convert.FromBase64String(base64String);
            return returnValue;
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The CreatedTeamsMeetingModel class is used to implement the Razor page logic to display some meeting details and send emails using a form post request. The OnGetAsync uses the meetingId to request the Teams meeting using Microsoft Graph and displays the data in the UI. The OnPostAsync method sends emails to all attendees.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using TeamsAdminUI.GraphServices;
using Microsoft.Graph;

namespace TeamsAdminUI.Pages
{
    public class CreatedTeamsMeetingModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly AadGraphApiDelegatedClient _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
        private readonly EmailService _emailService;

        public CreatedTeamsMeetingModel(
            AadGraphApiDelegatedClient aadGraphApiDelegatedClient,
            EmailService emailService)
        {
            _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient = aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
            _emailService = emailService;
        }

        [BindProperty]
        public OnlineMeeting Meeting {get;set;}

        [BindProperty]
        public string EmailSent { get; set; }

        public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; OnGetAsync(string meetingId)
        {
            Meeting = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.GetOnlineMeeting(meetingId);
            return Page();
        }

        public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync(string meetingId)
        {
            Meeting = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.GetOnlineMeeting(meetingId);
            foreach (var attendee in Meeting.Participants.Attendees)
            {
                var recipient = attendee.Upn.Trim();
                var message = _emailService.CreateStandardEmail(recipient, Meeting.Subject, Meeting.JoinUrl);
                await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.SendEmailAsync(message);
            }

            EmailSent = "Emails sent to all attendees, please check your mailbox";
            return Page();
        }

    }
}
  


<p>The created Razor page implements the HTML display logic and adds a form to send the emails. The JoinUrl is displayed as this is what you need to open the meeting a Microsoft Teams application.</p>


  @page "{handler?}"
@model TeamsAdminUI.Pages.CreatedTeamsMeetingModel
@{
}

&lt;h4&gt;Teams Meeting Created: @Model.Meeting.Subject&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Id:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Model.Meeting.Id&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;JoinUrl&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Model.Meeting.JoinUrl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Participants&lt;/h4&gt;

@foreach(var attendee in Model.Meeting.Participants.Attendees)
{
	&lt;p&gt;@attendee.Upn&lt;/p&gt;
}

&lt;form method="post"&gt;
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;input type="hidden" value="@Model.Meeting.Id" /&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-save"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Send Mail to attendees&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Model.EmailSent&lt;/p&gt;
  


<p>Testing</p>



<p>When the application is started, you can create a new Teams meeting with the required details. The logged in user must have an account with access to Office and be on the same tenant as the Azure App registration setup for the Microsoft Graph permissions. The Teams meeting is organized using the identity that signed in because we used the delegated permissions. </p>







<p>Once the meeting is created, the created Razor page is opened with the details. You can send an email to all attendees or use the JoinUrl directly to open up the Teams meeting.</p>







<p>Creating Teams meetings and sending emails in ASP.NET Core is really useful and I will do a few following up posts to this as there is so much more you can do here once this is integrated.</p>

 I enjoyed reading The Code of Capital by Katharina Pistor.  I liked this book because it provides what seems like a rare perspective that is required to reveal the DNA of capitalism rather than the more common unintended obfuscation from books that are lacking.

<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178974/the-code-of-capital">The Code of Capital</a> by <a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/katharina-pistor">Katharina Pistor</a>.  I liked this book because it provides what seems like a rare perspective that is required to reveal the DNA of capitalism rather than the more common unintended obfuscation from books that are lacking.  A benefit is that emerging technologies related to assets can be considered in a more coherent way and we can see that issues which seem new often resemble those of the past.</p>

<p>For instance, Pistor asks the genesis question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How should the initial allocation of property rights in the digital world be achieved, and who is in charge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While my mind somehow retrieves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWiwYApseDk">Otisburg</a>, Pistor more helpfully notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the same questions the commoners disputed with the landlords and the settler challenged the First Peoples about, as discussed in Chapter 2.  Ultimately, these issues were resolved by establishing legal priority rights, backed by the coercive powers of the state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Law relating to capital is often created in private law offices but is dependent on the state for the legal modules used to assemble these legal codes.  The most important of these modules are contract law, property rights, collateral law, trust, corporate and bankruptcy law.</p>

<p>These legal codes transform an asset (object, claim, skill or idea) into capital.  Because the legal coding gives the asset attributes of priority, durability, universality and convertability, the asset can create wealth for its holder while surviving challenging economic circumstances and externalizing associated risks to others.  The book goes into detail as the legal modules are applied to new assets over time.</p>

<p>Following the evolution of these legal codes helped me understand things that had been a mystery to me.  I wish I could have read a book like this a long time ago.</p>

<p>I started writing weeknotes to add some accountability to the work I was doing during <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Sep/10/jsk-fellowship/">my JSK fellowship year</a> at Stanford. The fellowship ended over a year ago but I've stuck to the habit - I've been finding it really helpful as a structured approach to thinking about my work every week, and it occasionally helps motivate me to get things done enough that I have something I can write about!</p>
 Datasette Desktop 0.2.0 
<p>My big achievement this week was <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop 0.2.0</a> (and the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/releases/tag/0.2.1">0.2.1 patch release</a> that followed). I published <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Sep/13/datasette-desktop-2/">annotated release notes</a> for that a few days ago. I'm really pleased with the release - I think Datasette as a desktop application is going to significantly increase the impact of the project.</p>
<p>I also sent out <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/p/datasette-desktop-a-macos-application">an issue of the Datasette Newsletter</a> promoting the new desktop application.</p>
 Datasette Desktop for Windows 
<p>I did a quick research spike to investigate the feasibility of publishing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/71">a Windows version</a> of Datasette Desktop. To my surprise, I managed to get a working prototype going with just half a small amount of work:</p>

<blockquote><p>So that was one heck of a lot easier than I expected... <a href="https://t.co/BDa4gvkgnd">pic.twitter.com/BDa4gvkgnd</a></p>- Simon Willison (@simonw) <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1438008493265473536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>Electron claims to solve cross-platform development and it seems to uphold that claim pretty well!</p>
<p>I'm still quite a bit of work away from having a release: I need to learn how to build and sign Windows installers. But this is a very promising first step.</p>
 json-flatten 
<p>I've started thinking about how I can enable Datasette Desktop users to configure plugins without having to hand-edit plugin configuration JSON (the current mechanism).</p>
<p>This made me take another look at a small library I released a couple of years ago, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/json-flatten">json-flatten</a>, which turns a nested JSON object into a set of flat key/value pairs suitable for editing using an HTML form and then unflattens that data later on.</p>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; import json_flatten
&gt;&gt;&gt; json_flatten.flatten({"foo": {"bar": [1, True, None]}})
{'foo.bar.[0]$int': '1', 'foo.bar.[1]$bool': 'True', 'foo.bar.[2]$none': 'None'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; json_flatten.unflatten(_)
{'foo': {'bar': [1, True, None]}}  
<p>It turns out a few people have been using the library, and had filed issues - I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/json-flatten/releases/tag/0.2">version 0.2</a> with a couple of fixes.</p>

  <p>Summary:    Identity finds its way into everything—even toothbrushes. Careful planning can overcome privacy concerns to yield real benefits to businesses and customers alike.</p>


<p>
    I have a Philips Sonicare toothbrush. One of the features is a little yellow light that comes on to tell me that the head needs to be changed. The first time the light came on, I wondered how I would reset it once I got a new toothbrush head. I even googled it to find out. 
</p>

<p>
    Turns out I needn't have bothered. Once I changed the head the light went off. This didn't happen when I just removed the old head and put it back on. The toothbrush heads have a unique identity that the toothbrush recognizes. This identity is not only used to signal head replacement, but also to put the toothbrush into different modes based on the type of head installed. 
</p>

<p>
    Philips calls this <a href="https://www.electricteeth.com/sonicare-brushsync/">BrushSync</a>, but it's just RFID technology underneath the branding. Each head has an RFID chip embedded in it and the toothbrush body reads the data off the head and adjusts its internal state in the appropriate way.
</p>

<p>
    I like this use case RFID because it's got clear benefits for both Philips and their customers. Philips sells more toothbrush heads—so the internet of things (IoT) use case is clearly aligned with business goals. Customers get reminders to replace their toothbrush head and can reset the reminder by simply doing what they'd do anyway—switch the head
</p>

<p>
    There aren't many privacy concerns at present. But as more and more products include RFID chips, you could imagine scanners on garbage trucks that correlate what gets used and thrown out with an address. I guess we need garbage cans that can disable RFID chips when they're thrown away. 
</p>

<p>
    I was recently talking to a friend of mine, Eric Olafson, who is a founding investor in <a href="https://www.riotinsight.com">Riot</a>. Riot is another example of how thoughtfully applied RFID-based identifiers can solve business and customer problems. Riot creates tech that companies can use for RFID-based, in-store inventory management. This solves a big problem for stores that often don't know what inventory they have on hand. With Riot, a quick scan of the store each morning updates the inventory management system, showing where the inventory data is out of sync with the physical inventory. As more and more of us go to the physical store because the app told us they had the product we wanted, it's nice to know the app isn't lying. Riot puts the RFID on the tag, not the clothing, dealing with many of the privacy concerns.
</p>

<p>
    Both BrushSync and Riot use identity to solve business problems, showing'that unique identifiers on individual products can be good for business and customers alike. This speaks to the breadth of identity and its importance in areas beyond associating identifiers with people. I've noticed an uptick in discussions at <a href="http://internetidentityworkshop">IIW</a> about identity for things and the impact that can have. The next IIW is Oct 12-14—online—join us if you're interested.

<p>Since <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/intro-to-dids-for-people-5ebe620b5a15">the beginning</a> of our journey here at MATTR, decentralization and digital identity have been central to our approach to building products. As part of this, we’ve supported Decentralized Identifiers (or <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/docs/platform/core/dids/overview">DIDs</a>) since the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">earliest launch of our platform</a>. We’ve also considered how we might give you more options to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/did-extensibility-on-the-mattr-platform-14c73c7a798e">expand the utility</a> of these identities over&nbsp;time.</p> An important milestone <p>The W3C working group responsible for Decentralized Identifiers <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9179">recently published</a> the DID v1.0 specification under “Proposed Recommendation” status. This is a significant milestone as DIDs approach global standardization with the pending approval of the W3C Advisory Committee.</p><p>DIDs are maturing, but so is the environment and context in which they were originally designed. With a complex ecosystem consisting of dozens of different methodologies and new ones emerging on a regular basis, it’s important to balance the potential of this decentralized approach with a realistic approach for defining the real utility and value of each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a>. For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/">DID Method Rubric</a> provides a good frame of reference for comparing different approaches.</p><p>Different types of DIDs can be registered and anchored using unique rules specific to the set of infrastructure where they’re stored. Since DIDs provide provenance for keys which are controlled by DID owners, the rules and systems that govern each kind of DID method have a significant impact on the trust and maintenance model for these identifiers. This is the key thing to remember when choosing a DID method that makes sense for your&nbsp;needs.</p> Our supported DID&nbsp;methods <p>In MATTR VII, by supporting a variety of DID methods — deterministic or key-based DIDs, domain-based DIDs, and ledger-based DIDs — we are able to provide tools which can be customized to fit the needs of individual people and organizations.</p>  Key-based DIDs — Largely static, easy to create, and locally controlled. This makes them a natural choice for applications where there’s a need to manage connections and interactions with users directly.  DIDs anchored to web domains — These have a different trust model, where control over the domain can bootstrap a connection to a DID. This makes a lot of sense for organizations with existing domain names that already transact and do business online, and can extend their brand and reputation to the domain of&nbsp;DIDs.  Ledger-based DIDs — These offer a distributed system of public key infrastructure which is not centrally managed or controlled by a single party. While ledgers differ in their governance and consensus models, they ultimately provide a backbone for anchoring digital addresses in a way which allows them to be discovered and used by other parties. This can be a useful feature where a persistent identifier is needed, such as in online communication and collaboration.  <p>There is no single DID method or type of DID (which at the moment) should be universally applied to every situation. However, by using the strengths of each approach we can allow for a diverse ecosystem of digital identifiers enabling connections between complex networks of people, organizations and machines.</p><p>To date, we’ve provided support for three main DID methods in our platform: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a>. These align with three of the central types of infrastructure outlined&nbsp;above.</p> Introducing DID&nbsp;ION <p>We’re proud to announce that as of today we’ve added support for <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">DID ION</a>, a DID method which is anchored to IPFS and Bitcoin. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">supported the development of the Sidetree protocol</a> that underpins DID ION for some time as it has matured in collaboration with working group members at the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p><p>With contributions from organizations such as Microsoft, Transmute, and SecureKey, <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> and DID ION have emerged as a scalable and enterprise-ready solution for anchoring DIDs. The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">core idea</a> behind the Sidetree protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger system. DID ION is an implementation of that protocol which backs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, one of the largest and most used public ledger networks in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Sidetree possesses some unique advantages not readily present in other DID methods, such as low cost, high throughput, and built-in portability of the identifier. This provides a number of benefits to people and organizations, especially in supporting a large volume of different kinds of connections with the ability to manage and rotate keys as needed. We have added end-to-end capabilities for creating and resolving DIDs on the ION network across our platform and wallet products.</p><p>Although DID ION is just one implementation of the Sidetree protocol, we see promise in other DID methods using Sidetree and will consider adding support for these over time as and when it makes sense. We’ll also continue to develop Sidetree in collaboration with the global standards community to ensure that this protocol and the ION Network have sustainable futures for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>At the same time, the community around DID Sovrin is developing a new kind of interoperability by designing a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">DID method</a> that can work for vast networks of Indy ledgers, rather than focusing on the Sovrin-specific method that’s been used to date. As DID Sovrin gets phased out of adoption, we’re simultaneously deprecating standard support for DID Sovrin within MATTR VII. We’ll be phasing this out shortly with upcoming announcements for customers building on our existing platform.</p><p>If you’ve got any use cases that utilize DID Sovrin or want to discuss extensibility options, please reach out to us on any of our social channels or at info@mattr.global and we’ll be happy to work with&nbsp;you.</p> Looking ahead <p>We believe this a big step forward in providing a better set of choices when it comes to digital identity for our customers. From the start, we have designed our platform with flexibility and extensibility in mind, and will continue to support different DID methods as the market&nbsp;evolves.</p><p>We look forward to seeing how these new tools can be used to solve problems in the real world and will keep working to identify better ways to encourage responsible use of digital identity on the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-did-ion-to-mattr-vii-d56bdb7a2fde">Adding DID ION to MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, the world of messaging has morphed in front of our very eyes. There are now more than six messaging channel categories, including text (inc. SMS, MMS, RCS), email, social media, chatbots (i.e. for support and conversational commerce), proximity alerts, and more than a dozen over-the-top apps (WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber, Apple Business Chat, Line, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and more). What does this mean for organizations? Well, for some they may think it means that their organization has a variety of channels to choose from to reach the people they serve (aka consumers, shoppers, patients, investors, etc.). On the surface, this is true. But what it really means is that organizations must start developing their multi-channel messaging muscles so that they can reach individuals not on the organization’s preferred time and medium of communication, but on the individual’s preferred time and medium of communication.</p>
<p>To effectively manage a messaging program, the most important thing to realize is that messaging channels are NOT all created equal. Every channel has a different audience profile, audience expectations, norms, message lengths, message formats, ways to send and receive messages, and methods for reporting across the engagement continuum (e.g., transaction through relationship). Messaging is an ecosystem all of its own that must be nurtured if you want to find success.</p>
 Need I say more? Of course, I do! 
<blockquote><p>“The customer is everywhere and nowhere.” Todd Harrison, SVP of Digital at Skechers&nbsp;(Harrison, 2021)</p></blockquote>
<p>You may find yourself with prospects and customers and few ways to reach them? You may find yourself with tired campaigns that simply do not perform the way you want them to? You may find yourself losing touch with your most valuable asset, your first-party database. You may ask yourself, how did I get here? You may ask yourself, which channel should I use to achieve the best results?</p>
<p>Todd is right, “the customer is everywhere, and nowhere.” The way to address this problem is to put your customer at the heart of your business. What does this mean? It means you must learn to collect and listen to their preferences? To interact and engage them, not just barrage them with mono-directional messages that basically say, “I have an idea, why don’t you buy more stuff from us?” People want to be respected, heard, and served. You need to treat them as the hero of your story. To make this happen, you need to understand them. You need to focus on building out an end-to-end communication strategy, which includes building a preference-based opt-in database, often referred to as a customer data platform (CDP). Depending on your needs you’ll need dedicated messaging platforms (e.g. SMS, 10DLC, Email, etc.) or possibly a multichannel communication platform as a service (CPasS) to manage real-time messaging across all channels. Moreover, you’ll need a content strategy. And soon, to meet the expectations of those you serve, you’ll need to build the capability to deliver predictive, personalized, contextually aware content and offers, with real-time feedback loops so that you can listen to customers and respond to them when they reply or initiate a conversation with you. In the near future, we will find that messaging has become the cornerstone of the vast majority of businesses’ engagement strategies, but we have a long way to go as only six to ten percent of companies are actively nurturing and running commercial messaging programs today (Ruppert, 2021).</p>
<p>Yes, you can succeed with the tried and true tactics, but for how long? The marketplace and consumer sentiments are changing, and you must change with them, or you’ll be left behind.</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2030, society will no longer tolerate a business model that relies on mass transactions of increasingly sensitive personal data: a different system will be in place.”&nbsp;(Data 2030, 2020)</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll cover more on the bigger picture in future articles, let’s get back to messaging.</p>
 What it takes to run a successful messaging program 
<p>The key to a successful messaging program is to start simple and build from there.</p>
<p>You should not be frightened by the sea of mobile messaging opportunities. Embrace them, and take them one step at a time. Take it from us, with the simplest of messaging programs you have the potential to see material success. For example, we are aware of a retail company that, in 12 months after launching a text-based SMS program sprinkled with the occasional MMS message, acquired 700,000 subscribers and is now generating over $1.4M in monthly sales.</p>

 Where do you start? 
<p>SMS, or text messaging, is the most straightforward, omnipresent, and ubiquitous messaging channel that you can use to engage people anywhere in the world. And, best of all, it is proven.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephanieburns/2019/09/06/9-clever-ways-to-use-text-messaging-in-your-business/?sh=2aa3edb62951">Open rates in SMS are often 95% and higher</a>.</p>
<p>Text messaging is not just about driving sales, and although this is the end-game, it is about being of service to your audience throughout every stage of the relationship they have with you. Text messaging provides at the most basic level more engagement not just as a utility but as a consumer relationship tool – securing interactions, driving pre and post-sales engagements, gathering feedback through surveys, and fostering loyalty and support. You can, and should, use it across every stage of the purchase funnel: discovery, awareness, consideration, conversation, onboarding and adoption, loyalty, support, and offboarding.</p>
<p>NOTE: Keep an eye out for 10DLC, a new messaging standard the kicked off in June 2021. Our next article will be on this.</p>
 But What if? 
<p>Yes, text messaging, aka SMS, is ubiquitous, but what should you do when you need to grow beyond what texting has to offer? Remember, “the medium is the message” (Marshall McLuhan, 1964). Text messaging is not the right channel for every engagement.</p>
<p>What if you needed to reach and engage people in China, Brazil, Germany, or Australia? What if your product was best suited to be explained via a picture or a video? What are the best channels to reach these consumers? Text is not always the answer!</p>
  
<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Photo by Nathan Dumlao on Unsplash</a></p>
<p>Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other messaging channels are making a considerable play at being complementary messaging options for consumers and, in some cases, the primary channel. Geographic location is the main driver for these channel decisions as well as the use case. But the numbers don’t lie in regards to the global user base of over 2 billion consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/">OTT Messaging Leaders.&nbsp;</a></p>
  
 Where Should You Start? 
<p>Sounds like a lot? Sounds complicated? It’s really not if you think about these few items and take them one at a time in your messaging and engagement roadmap.</p>
<p>Here are a few things for you to consider that will help mold your direction. First, start with a few pillars: Message type (use-case, transactional, marketing, support…), Geolocation(s), Staffing, and Existing Partners. Consider,</p>
 
 Are you currently offering text transactional or marketing messaging? 
 Which markets and countries are you looking to reach? 
 How much is your social media advertising budget? 
 Are you considering messaging for support (don’t just think SMS, think OTT)? 
 Do you have internal staff to manage your messaging programs? 
 Are you currently using a Marketing Automation platform? 
 Are you working with external guides and mentors (Remember:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6841097885103341568/">coaches and mentors are required if you want to be an expert</a>&nbsp;)? 
 
 Enter Personal Data &amp; Identity 
<p>It is critical for you to remember that all effective commerce starts with a meaningful connection and relevant and consistent communication. The path to relevance is through data, particularly personal data, in fact, a new asset class that you need to wield with precision.</p>
 The Bottomline 
<p>For the majority SMS (text) will be your first entry into the messaging space. But, depending on how you answered the questions above, the odds are you will be a perfect candidate to implement one of the other messaging channels too. Your next step is to evaluate your current programs and roadmap of “Needs” vs ’Wants” and map out the use cases, i.e., the experience you want to offer your customers, prior to finding a good technology and solutions partner.</p>
<p>Your “Needs’ may have to do with driving revenue, loyalty sign-ups, gathering preference data, support efficiencies, personalization, and could be as simple as mapping out your KPI’s and creating efficiencies of your current messaging strategy. Day, time, type of message, MMS vs.&nbsp;SMS, frequency, and more have a say in the results in your program. Remember, planning before tactics!</p>
<p>Messaging has proven to be the most effective tool, especially when used in a thoughtful and meaningful experience, for people-centric engagement programs. But in the age of the connected individual, the bottom line is that it is a necessity, not a nice to have.</p>
<p>There is a lot to navigate, but this is nothing like any other part of your business. You can do it. Create a roadmap. Find your partners. Take one step at a time!</p>

<p>現地（ミュンヘン）時間13日午後7時半、European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021で GAIN – Global Assured Identity Network を発表しました。これは、すべての参加者が身元確認済みであるオーバレイネットワークです。</p>



<p>使用したスライドは以下からご覧になっていただけます。</p>



<p>ホワイトペーパー自体は、<a href="https://gainforum.org/">https://gainforum.org/</a> からダンロードしていただけます。</p>

 GAINとは 



<p>詳細は以下の英文ブログに譲りますが、その下にDeepLによる機械翻訳も参考までに載せておきます。（検証していないので間違いや割愛等結構あるかもしれません。が、なんとなく概要を見るのには良いでしょう。原本は英語ですので、詳しく見るにはそちらを御覧ください。）</p>



 
<blockquote><a href="https://nat.sakimura.org/2021/09/14/announcing-gain/">Announcing GAIN: Global Assured Identity Network</a></blockquote>
 



<p>インターネットの始まりには、信頼がありました。誰もが参加している組織に知られており、誰もが責任（Accountability）を負わされることを知っていたのです。</p>



<p>しかし、90年代にインターネットが商業的に利用できるようになると、信頼は失われました。参加者の大半が匿名になり、責任を問われないと認識するようになったのです。その結果、多くの犯罪者やバッドアクターがネットワーク上で活躍するようになりました。インターネットのワイルド・ワイルド・ウエストの時代が到来したのです。</p>



<p>それ以来、状況を改善し、信頼を回復するために多くの努力が払われてきました。しかし、あまり効果はありませんでした。金融犯罪は、人への影響が計り知れない不正行為から生まれ、世界経済に年間GDPの最大5％もの損失を与えています。マネーロンダリング防止やテロ資金対策に莫大な費用がかけられていますが、今のところ効果はありません。金融システム内の1,000ドルの「違法な資金」に対して、コンプライアンスに100ドルが費やされていますが、傍受されるのはわずか1ドル。わずか0.1％です。</p>



<p>このコインの裏側には金融包摂の問題もあります。</p>



<p>多くの人々は、口座開設に関わる本人確認コストのために商業的にとりこむことができず、経済的に排除されています。</p>



<p>匿名で行動できることは、原理的にはプライバシーの面で大きなメリットがあります。しかし、私たちが実現しているのは、個人データが危険にさらされ、善良な行為者が悪質な行為者に容易に追跡されるという状況です。いわば熟練した悪質な行為者のためのプライバシーであり、われわれ「それ以外の人」のためのプライバシーはありません。</p>



<p>30年の時間とコストをかけたにもかかわらず、なぜ私たちはこれらを阻止することに成功しないのでしょうか。</p>



<p>それは、アイデンティティとアカウンタビリティという根本的な問題に取り組んでこなかったからです。</p>



<p>私たちが必要としているのは、エコシステム内のすべての参加者のアカウンタビリティを再確立することです。</p>



<p>このようなエコシステムは、比較可能性と相互承認の原則に基づいて相互に接続することができ、最終的にはサイバーワールドの人口の大部分をカバーする説明責任のあるエコシステムのネットワークを形成することができます。</p>



<p>そのようなエコシステムのひとつが、今日、私たちが提案するものです。GAIN（Global Assured Identity Network）です。</p>



<p>GAINは、アカウンタビリティのある参加者のみで構成されるインターネット上のオーバーレイネットワークです。すべての参加者は、主に銀行やその他の規制対象組織からなるホスティング組織で口座を開設する際に、規制を満たすための身元確認を受けています。これらの高保証属性は、エンドユーザーの指示に基づいて アイデンティティ情報提供者から依拠当事者(RP)に渡される アイデンティティ情報の基礎として使用されます。</p>



<p>エンド・ユーザーは、自己申告ではなく、信頼できるエンティティによって証明された年齢などの属性を証明できるようになります。これは非常に強力です。</p>



<p>例えば、「私は18歳以上です」ということを、「私を信じてください」と言うだけでなく、銀行の証明書を使って証明することができます。</p>



<p>これは、プライバシーの観点からも非常に良いことです。</p>



<p>自己申告の場合、情報の受け手は自分の言っていることが信じられないので、通常、それを証明するために運転免許証などの身分証明書を提示しなければなりません。この時点で、彼女は年齢よりもはるかに多くの属性を開示していることになります。</p>



<p>このような能力は、以前に行われた 身元確認にかかっています。身元確認は非常にコストのかかるプロセスです。</p>



<p>この目的のためだけにそれを行おうとすると、法外な費用がかかる可能性があります。</p>



<p>本業のために身元確認を行う必要がある銀行やその他の規制機関は、この点で有利です。これは、ある巨大なオンライン小売業者が、ホリデーシーズンにしか必要とされない冗長機能をより有効に活用するために、クラウドコンピューティングサービスを提供し始めたようなものです。他のホスティングベンダーは太刀打ちできませんでした。</p>



<p>アイデンティティ情報提供者によってIDが証明されたからといって、個人がGAINで匿名で行動できないわけではありません。個人は、マーチャントやネットワークの他の参加者に対して、匿名または偽名で行動することができます。実際、個人の属性の開示は最小限にとどめるのが普通である。ただし、不正行為を行った場合には、正当な手続きに基づいて個人を追跡し、責任を追及することができるようになっています。指定されたオープナーと呼ばれるエンティティは、取引の履歴を開き、その時の人物を指し示すことができる。</p>



<p>ネットワーク上のすべてのビジネスエンティティは、ホスティング組織でのビジネスアカウントの作成と維持の一環として審査されており、匿名のままでいることはできません。彼らには説明責任があります。その結果、消費者は安心して取引を行うことができ、依拠当事者にとってはビジネスの拡大につながります。すべての善良なアクターが利益を得ることができるのです。</p>



<p>この効果はグローバルなものです。マーチャントは、一度登録して契約するだけで、世界中のネットワーク参加者にアクセスできるようになります。</p>



<p>個人は、エコシステム内のすべての依拠当事者が存在し、説明責任を果たしているという安心感を持ってアクセスすることができます。確かに悪質な業者はまだ存在するでしょうが、その範囲はより限定されたものになります。エコシステムは、現在のインターネットよりもはるかに安全になります。参加者がアクションを起こすのに十分なものになるでしょう。信頼が再び確立されます。</p>



<p>完璧なプロセスはありません。GAINにおいても、悪質な行為者は確実に存在しますが、それは標準ではなく例外となるため、問題ははるかに扱いやすくなります。行動を起こすには「十分」でしょう。</p>



<p>つまり、信頼が再確立されたのです。</p>

  <p><a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a> is a new macOS desktop application version of <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, an "open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data" built on top of SQLite. I released the first version <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Sep/8/datasette-desktop/">last week</a> - I've just released version 0.2.0 (and a 0.2.1 bug fix) with a whole bunch of critical improvements.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/releases/tag/0.2.0">release notes for 0.2.0 here</a>, but as I've done <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/datasette-release-notes/">with Datasette in the past</a> I've decided to present an annotated version of those release notes providing further background on each of the new features.</p>
 The plugin directory 
<blockquote>
<p>A new plugin directory for installing new plugins and upgrading or uninstalling existing ones. Open it using the "Plugins -&gt; Install and Manage Plugins..." menu item. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/74">#74</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This was the main focus for the release. <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">Plugins</a> are a key component of both Datasette and Datasette Desktop: my goal is for Datasette to provide a robust core for exploring databases, with a wide array of plugins that support any additional kind of visualization, exploration or data manipulation capability that a user might want.</p>
<p>Datasette Desktop goes as far as bundling <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Sep/8/datasette-desktop/#how-the-app-works">an entire standalone Python installation</a> just to ensure that plugins will work correctly, and invisibly sets up a dedicated Python virtual environment for plugins to install into when you first run the application.</p>
<p>The first version of the app allowed users to install plugins by pasting their name into a text input field. Version 0.2.0 is a whole lot more sophisticated: the single input field has been replaced by a full plugin directory interface that shows installed v.s. available plugins and provides "Install", "Upgrade" and "Uninstall" buttons depending on the state of the plugin.</p>
<p>When I set out to build this I knew I wanted to hit <a href="https://datasette.io/content/plugins.json?_shape=array">this JSON API</a> on <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a> to fetch the list of plugins, and I knew I wanted a simple searchable index page. The I realized I also wanted faceted search, so I could filter for installed vs not-yet-installed plugins.</p>
<p>Datasette's built-in table interface already implements faceted search! So I decided to use that, with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support/tree/0.11.5/datasette_app_support/templates">some custom templates</a> to add the install buttons and display the plugins in a more suitable format.</p>
<p>The first challenge was getting the latest list of plugins into my Datasette instance. I built this into the <code>datasette-app-support</code> plugin using the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#startup-datasette">startup() plugin hook</a> - every time the server starts up it hits that API and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support/blob/ee8a05ba1dd55734d2b99c9bd774ebb8e9790d7c/datasette_app_support/__init__.py#L17-L62">populates an in-memory table</a> with the returned data.</p>
<p>The data from the API is then extended with four extra columns:</p>
 
 
<code>"installed"</code> is set to "installed" or "not installed" depending on whether the plugin has already been installed by the user 
 
<code>"Installed_version"</code> is the currently installed version of the plugin 
 
<code>"upgrade"</code> is the string "upgrade available" or None - allowing the user to filter for just plugins that can be upgraded 
 
<code>"default"</code> is set to 1 if the plugin is a default plugin that came with Datasette 
 
<p>The data needed to build the plugin table is gathered by these three lines of code:</p>
 plugins = httpx.get(
     "https://datasette.io/content/plugins.json?_shape=array"
).json()
# Annotate with list of installed plugins
installed_plugins = {
    plugin["name"]: plugin["version"]
    for plugin in (await datasette.client.get("/-/plugins.json")).json()
}
default_plugins = (os.environ.get("DATASETTE_DEFAULT_PLUGINS") or "").split() 
<p>The first line fetches the full list of known plugins from the Datasette <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">plugin directory</a></p>
<p>The second makes an internal API call to the Datasette <code>/-/plugins.json</code> endpoint using the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-client">datasette.client mechanism</a> to discover what plugins are currently installed and their versions.</p>
<p>The third line loads a space-separated list of default plugins from the <code>DATASETTE_DEFAULT_PLUGINS</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>That last one deserves further explanation. Datasette Desktop now ships with some default plugins, and the point of truth for what those are <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/0.2.0/main.js#L34-L42">lives in the Electron app codebase</a> - because that's where the code responsible for installing them is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five plugins are now installed by default: <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-vega">datasette-vega</a>, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a>, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-pretty-json">datasette-pretty-json</a>, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-edit-schema">datasette-edit-schema</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-configure-fts">datasette-configure-fts</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/81">#81</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plugin directory needs to know what these defaults are so it can avoid showing the "uninstall" button for those plugins. Uninstalling them currently makes no sense because Datasette Desktop installs any missing dependencies when the app starts, which would instantly undo the user's uninstall action decision.</p>
<p>An environment variable felt like the most straight-forward way to expose that list of default plugins to the underlying Datasette server!</p>
<p>I plan to make default plugins uninstallable in the future but doing so require a mechanism for persisting user preference state which I haven't built yet (see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/101">issue #101</a>).</p>
 A log on the loading screen 
<blockquote>
<p>The application loading screen now shows a log of what is going on. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/70">#70</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first time you launch the Datasette Desktop application it creates a virtual environment and installs <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">datasette</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support">datasette-app-support</a> and the five default plugins (plus their dependencies) into that environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This can take quite a few seconds, during which the original app would show an indeterminate loading indicator.</p>
<p>Personally I hate loading indicators which don't show the difference between something that's working and something that's eternally hung. Since I can't estimate how long it will take, I decided to pipe the log of what the <code>pip install</code> command is doing to the loading screen itself.</p>
<p>For most users this will be meaningless, but hopefully will help communicate "I'm installing extra stuff that I need". Advanced users may find this useful though, especially for bug reporting if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Under the hood <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/commit/e0c899e422e60b43866551fd776b86a954deb94d">I implemented this</a> using a Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter">EventEmitter</a>. I use the same trick to forward server log output to the "Debug -&gt; Show Sever Log" interface.</p>
 Example CSV files 
<blockquote>
<p>The welcome screen now invites you to try out the application by opening interesting example CSV files, taking advantage of the new "File -&gt; Open CSV from URL..." feature. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/91">#91</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously Datasette Desktop wouldn't do anything at all until you opened up a CSV or SQLite database, and I have a hunch that unlike me most people don't have good examples of those to hand at all times!</p>
<p>The new welcome screen offers example CSV files that can be opened directly from the internet. I implemented this using a new API at <a href="https://datasette.io/content/example_csvs">datasette.io/content/example_csvs</a> (add <code>.json</code> for the JSON version) which is loaded by code running on that welcome page.</p>
<p>I have two examples at the moment, for <a href="https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/">the Squirrel Census</a> and the <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb">London Fire Brigade's animal rescue data</a>. I'll be adding more in the future.</p>
<p>The API itself is a great example of the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/">Baked Data architectural pattern</a> in action: the data itself is stored in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/example_csvs.yml">this hand-edited YAML file</a>, which is compiled to SQLite every time the site is deployed.</p>
<p>To get this feature working I added a new "Open CSV from URL" capability to the app, which is also available in the File menu. Under the hood this works by passing the provided URL to the new <code>/-/open-csv-from-url</code> API endpoint. The implementation of this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support/blob/0.11.5/datasette_app_support/utils.py#L52-L88">was surprisingly fiddly</a> as I wanted to consume the CSV file using an asynchronous HTTP client - I ended up using an adaption of <a href="https://github.com/mosquito/aiofile/blob/3.5.1/README.rst#async-csv-dict-reader">some example code</a> from the <a href="https://github.com/mosquito/aiofile">aiofile</a> README.</p>
 Recently opened files and "Open with Datasette" 
<blockquote>
<p>Recently opened <code>.db</code> and <code>.csv</code> files can now be accessed from the new "File -&gt; Open Recent" menu. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/mnckapilan">Kapilan M</a>! <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/54">#54</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the project's first external contribution! Kapilan M <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/pull/77">figured out a way</a> to hook into the macOS "recent files" mechanism from Electron, and I expanded that to cover SQLite database in addition to CSV files.</p>
<p>When a recent file is selected, Electron fires <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/app#event-open-file-macos">the "open-file" event</a>. This same event is fired when a file is opened using "Open With -&gt; Datasette" or dragged onto the application's dock.</p>
<p>This meant I needed to tell the difference between a CSV or a SQLite database file, which I do by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/0.2.0/main.js#L95-L101">checking if</a> the first 16 bytes of the file match the SQLite header of <code>SQLite format 3\0</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.db and .csv files can now be opened in Datasette starting from the Finder using "Right Click -&gt; Open With -&gt; Datasette". <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/40">#40</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Registering Datasette as a file handler for <code>.csv</code> and <code>.db</code> was not at all obvious. It turned out to involve adding the following to the Electron app's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/0.2.0/package.json#L13-L28">package.json file</a>:</p>
    "build": {
    "appId": "io.datasette.app",
    "mac": {
      "category": "public.app-category.developer-tools",
      "extendInfo": {
        "CFBundleDocumentTypes": [
          {
            "CFBundleTypeExtensions": [
              "csv",
              "tsv",
              "db"
            ],
            "LSHandlerRank": "Alternate"
          }
        ]
      }  
 The Debug Menu 
<blockquote>
<p>A new Debug menu can be enabled using Datasette -&gt; About Datasette -&gt; Enable Debug Menu".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debug menu existed previously in development mode, but with 0.2.0 I decided to expose it to end users. I didn't want to show it to people who weren't ready to see it, so you have to first enable it using a button on the about menu.</p>
<p>The most interesting option there is "Run Server Manually".</p>
<p>Most of the time when you are using the app there's a <code>datasette</code> Python server running under the hood, but it's entirely managed by the Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html">child_process</a> module.</p>
<p>When developing the application (or associated plugins) it can be useful to manually run that server rather than having it managed by the app, so you can see more detailed error messages or even add the <code>--pdb</code> option to drop into a debugger should something go wrong.</p>
<p>To run that server, you need the Electron app to kill its own version... and you then need to know things like what port it was running on and which environment variables it was using.</p>
<p>Here's what you see when you click the "Run Server Manually" debug option:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here's that command in full:</p>
<p><code>DATASETTE_API_TOKEN="0ebb45444ba4cbcbacdbcbb989bb0cd3aa10773c0dfce73c0115868d0cee2afa" DATASETTE_SECRET="4a8ac89d0d269c31d99059933040b4511869c12dfa699a1429ea29ee3310a850" DATASETTE_DEFAULT_PLUGINS="datasette datasette-app-support datasette-vega datasette-cluster-map datasette-pretty-json datasette-edit-schema datasette-configure-fts datasette-leaflet" /Users/simon/.datasette-app/venv/bin/datasette --port 8002 --version-note xyz-for-datasette-app --setting sql_time_limit_ms 10000 --setting max_returned_rows 2000 --setting facet_time_limit_ms 3000 --setting max_csv_mb 0</code></p>
<p>This is a simulation of the command that the app itself used to launch the server. Pasting that into a terminal will produce an exact copy of the original process - and you can add <code>--pdb</code> or other options to further customize it.</p>
 Bonus: Restoring the in-memory database on restart 
<p>This didn't make it into the formal release notes, but it's a fun bug that I fixed in this release.</p>
<p>Datasette Desktop defaults to opening CSV files in an in-memory database. You can import them into an on-disk database too, but if you just want to start exploring CSV data in Datasette I decided an in-memory database would be a better starting point.</p>
<p>There's one problem with this: installing a plugin requires a Datasette server restart, and restarting the server clears the content of that in-memory database, causing any tables created from imported CSVs to disappear. This is confusing!</p>
<p>You can follow my progress on this in issue <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/42">#42: If you open a CSV and then install a plugin the CSV table vanishes</a>. I ended up solving it by adding code that dumps the "temporary" in-memory database to a file on disk before a server restart, restarts the server, then copies that disk backup into memory again.</p>
<p>This works using two custom API endpoints added to the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support">datasette-app-support</a> plugin:</p>
 
 
<code>POST /-/dump-temporary-to-file</code> with <code>{"path": "/path/to/backup.db"}</code> dumps the contents of that in-memory temporary database to the specified file. 
 
<code>POST /-/restore-temporary-from-file</code> with <code>{"path": "/path/to/backup.db"}</code> restors the content back again. 
 
<p>These APIs are called from the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/0.2.0/main.js#L189-L221">startOrRestart()</a> method any time the server restarts, using a file path generated by Electron using the following:</p>
  backupPath = path.join(
  app.getPath("temp"),
  `backup-${crypto.randomBytes(8).toString("hex")}.db`
);  
<p>The file is deleted once it has been restored.</p>
<p>After much experimentation, I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support/blob/0.11.5/datasette_app_support/__init__.py#L270-L288">ended up using</a> the <code>db.backup(other_connection)</code> method that was added to Python's <code>sqlite3</code> module in Python 3.7. Since Datasette Desktop bundles its own copy of Python 3.9 I don't have to worry about compatibility with older versions at all.</p>
 The rest is in the milestone 
<p>If you want even more detailed notes on what into the release, each new feature is included in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/milestone/2?closed=1">0.2.0 milestone</a>, accompanied by a detailed issue with screenshots (and even a few videos) plus links to the underlying commits.</p>

<p>The Angular client is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client">angular-auth-oidc-client</a>. The offline_access scope is requested as well as the prompt=consent. The nonce validation after a refresh is ignored.</p>


  import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthModule, LogLevel } from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    AuthModule.forRoot({
      config: {
        authority: 'http://localhost:3000', 
		redirectUrl: window.location.origin, 
		postLogoutRedirectUri: window.location.origin,

			prompt: 'consent', // login, consent 
		}, 
      },
    }),
  ],
  exports: [AuthModule],
})
export class AuthConfigModule {}
  


<p>That’s all the configuration required.</p>

This structural requirement for accuracy can only translate accurately enough by using the right words.

<p>Monday will be my first day as community lead for Steampipe, a young open source project that normalizes APIs by way of Postgres foreign data wrappers. The project’s taglines are select * from cloud and query like it’s 1992; the <a href="https://steampipe.io/">steampipe.io home page</a> nicely illustrates these ideas. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about API normalization for a long time. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">original proposal</a> for the World Wide Web says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Databases</p>
<p>A generic tool could perhaps be made to allow any database which uses a commercial DBMS to be displayed as a hypertext view.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We ended up with standard ways for talking to databases — ODBC, JDBC — but not for expressing them on the web. </p>
<p>When I was at Microsoft I was bullish on <a href="https://www.odata.org/">OData</a>, an outgrowth of Pablo Castro’s wonderful <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2007/07/03/a-conversation-with-pablo-castro-about-astorias-restful-data-services/">Project Astoria</a>. Part of the promise was that every database-backed website could automatically offer basic API access that wouldn’t require API wrappers for everybody’s favorite programming language. The API was hypertext; a person could navigate it using links and search. Programs wrapped around that API could be useful, but meaningful interaction with data would be possible without them. </p>
<p>(For a great example of what that can feel like, jump into the middle of one of Simon Willison’s datasettes, for example <a href="https://san-francisco.datasettes.com/food-trucks/Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit?Applicant=1">san-francisco.datasettes.com</a>, and start clicking clicking around.)</p>
<p>Back then I wrote a couple of posts on this topic[<a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/11/18/odata-is-grease-to-cut-data-friction/">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2010/01/29/odata-for-collaborative-sense-making/">2</a>]. Many years later OData still hasn’t taken the world by storm. I still think it’s a great idea and would love to see it, or something like it, catch on more broadly. Meanwhile Steampipe takes a different approach. Given a proliferation of APIs and programming aids for them, let’s help by providing a unifying abstraction: SQL.</p>
<p>I’ve done a deep dive into the SQL world over the past few years. The <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">first post</a> in a series I’ve been writing on my adventures with Postgres is what connected me to Steampipe and its sponsor (my new employer) <a href="https://turbot.com/">Turbot</a>. When you install Steampipe it brings Postgres along for the ride. Imagine what you could do with data flowing into Postgres from many different APIs and filling up tables you can view, query, join, and expose to tools and systems that talk to Postgres. Well, it’s going to be my job to help imagine, and explain, what’s possible in that scenario. </p>
<p>Meanwhile I need to give some thought to my Twitter tag line: patron saint of trailing edge technologies. It’s funny and it’s true. At BYTE I explored how software based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">Net News Transfer Protocol</a> enabled my team to <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-internet-groupware/1565925378">do things</a> that we use Slack for today. At Microsoft I built a system for <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/elmcity-project-faq/">community-scale calendaring</a> based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a>. When I picked up NNTP and iCalendar they were already on the trailing edge.  Yet they were, and especially in the case of iCalendar still are, capable of doing much more than is commonly understood. </p>
<p>Then of course came web annotation. Although Hypothesis recently shepherded it to <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/">W3C standardization</a> it goes all the way back to the <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0416.html">Mosaic browser</a> and is exactly the kind of generative tech that fires my imagination. With Hypothesis now well established in education, I hope others will continue to explore the breadth of what’s possible when every document workflow that needs to can readily connect people, activities, and data to selections in documents. If that’s of interest, here are some <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/03/notes-for-an-annotation-sdk/">signposts</a> pointing to scenarios I’ve envisioned and prototyped.</p>
<p>And now it’s SQL. For a long time I set it aside in favor of object, XML, and NoSQL stores. Coming back to it, by way of Postgres, has shown me that:</p>
<p>– Modern SQL is more valuable as a programming language than is commonly understood</p>
<p>– So is Postgres as a programming environment</p>
<p>The tagline query like it’s 1992 seems very on-brand for me. But maybe I should let go of the trailing-edge moniker. Nostalgia isn’t the best way to motivate fresh energy. Maybe query like it’s 2022 sets a better tone? In any case I’m very much looking forward to this next phase.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s a sequel, and sequels tend to sag. Even The&nbsp;Godfather Part 2. (But that one only sagged in the relative sense, since Part 1 was perfect.)</p>
<p>If anything bothers me about this next Matrix it’s that what had seemed an untouchable Classic is now a Franchise. Not a bad beast, the Franchise. Just different: same genus, different species.</p>

<p>Passwords are hell.</p>
<p>Worse, to make your hundreds of passwords safe as possible, they should be nearly impossible for others to discover—and for you to remember.</p>
<p>Unless you’re a wizard, this all but requires using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password manager</a>.†</p>
<p>Think about how hard that job is. First, it’s impossible for developers of password managers to do everything right:</p>
 
 Most of their customers and users need to have logins and passwords for hundreds of sites and services on the Web and elsewhere in the networked world 
 Every one of those sites and services has its own gauntlet of methods for registering logins and passwords, and for remembering and changing them 
 Every one of those sites and services has its own unique user interfaces, each with its own peculiarities 
 All of those UIs change, sometimes often. 
 
<p>Keeping up with that mess while also keeping personal data safe from both user error and determined bad actors, is about as tall as an order can get. And then you have to do all that work for each of the millions of customers you’ll need if you’re going to make the kind of money required to keep abreast of those problems and providing the solutions required.</p>
<p>So here’s the thing: the best we can do with passwords is the best that password managers can do. That’s your horizon right there.</p>
<p>Unless we can get past logins and passwords somehow.</p>
<p>And I don’t think we can. Not in the <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/08/15/beyond-the-web">client-server ecosystem that the Web has become</a>, and that industry never stopped being, since long before the Internet came along. That’s the real hell. Passwords are just a symptom.</p>
<p>We need to work around it. That’s my work now. Stay tuned <a href="http://customercommons.org">here</a>, <a href="http://projectvrm.org">here</a>, and here for more on that.</p>
 
<p>† We need to fix that Wikipedia page.</p>

  <p>I just released <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">version 0.1.0</a> of the new Datasette macOS desktop application, the first version that end-users can easily install. I would very much appreciate your help testing it out!</p>
 Datasette Desktop 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> is "an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data". It's a Python web application that lets you explore data held in SQLite databases, plus a growing <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">ecosystem of plugins</a> for visualizing and manipulating those databases.</p>
<p>Datasette is aimed at data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local governments, scientists, researchers and anyone else who has data that they wish to explore and share with the world.</p>
<p>There's just one big catch: since it's a Python web application, those users have needed to figure out how to <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html">install and run</a> Python software in order to use it. For people who don't live and breath Python and the command-line this turns out to be a substantial barrier to entry!</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a> is my latest attempt at addressing this problem. I've packaged up Datasette, SQLite and a full copy of Python such that users can <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">download and uncompress a zip file</a>, drag it into their <code>/Applications</code> folder and start using Datasette, without needing to know that there's a Python web server running under the hood (or even understand what a Python web server is).</p>
<p>Please try it out, and send me feedback and suggestions <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/discussions/67">on GitHub</a>.</p>
 What the app does 
<p>This initial release has a small but useful set of features:</p>
 
 Open an existing SQLite database file and offer all of Datasette's functionality, including the ability to explore tables and to execute arbitrary SQL queries. 
 Open a CSV file and offer the Datasette table interface (<a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/economist_excess_deaths">example here</a>). By default this uses an in-memory database that gets cleared when the app shuts down, or you can... 
 Import CSV files into tables in on-disk SQLite databases (including creating a new blank database first). 
 By default the application runs a local web server which only accepts connections from your machine... but you can change that in the "File -&gt; Access Control" menu to allow connections from anyone on your network. This includes <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> networks too, allowing you to run the application on your home computer and then access it securely from other devices such as your mobile phone anywhere in the world. 
 You can install plugins! This is the most exciting aspect of this initial release: it's already in a state where users can customize it and developers can extend it, either with <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">Datasette's existing plugins</a> (69 and counting) or by <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html">writing new ones</a>. 
 
 How the app works 
<p>There are three components to the app:</p>
 
 A macOS wrapper application 
 Datasette itself 
 The <code>datasette-app-support</code> plugin 
 
<p>The first is the macOS application itself. This is currently written with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, and bundles a full copy of Python 3.9 (based on <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> by Gregory Szorc). Bundling Python is essential: the principal goal of the app is to allow people to use Datasette who aren't ready to figure out how to install their own Python environment. Having an isolated and self-contained Python is also a great way of avoiding making <a href="https://xkcd.com/1987/">XKCD 1987</a> even worse.</p>
<p>The macOS application doesn't actually include Datasette itself. Instead, on first launch it creates a new Python virtual environment (currently in <code>~/.datasette-app/venv</code>, feedback on that location welcome) and installs the other two components: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">Datasette</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support">datasette-app-support</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Having a dedicated virtual environment is what enables the "Install Plugin" menu option. When a plugin is installed the macOS application runs <code>pip install name-of-plugin</code> and then restarts the Datasette server process, causing it to load that new plugin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support">datasette-app-support</a> plugin is designed exclusively to work with this application. It adds API endpoints that the Electron shell can use to trigger specific actions, such as "import from this CSV file" or "attach this SQLite database" - these are generally triggered by macOS application menu items.</p>
<p>It also adds a custom authentication mechanism. The user of the app should have special permissions: only they should be able to import a CSV file from anywhere on their computer into Datasette. But for the "network share" feature I want other users to be able to access the web application.</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of installing Datasette on first-run rather than bundling it with the application is that the user will be able to upgrade to future Datasette releases without needing to re-install the application itself.</p>
 How I built it 
<p>I've been building this application completely in public over <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/30/datasette-app/">the past two weeks</a>, writing up my notes and research in GitHub issues as I went (here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/milestone/1?closed=1">the initial release milestone</a>).</p>
<p>I had to figure out a lot of stuff!</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>. Since almost all of the user-facing interface is provided by the existing Datasette web application, Electron was a natural fit: I needed help powering native menus and bundling everything up as an installable application, which Electron handles extremely well.</p>
<p>I also have ambitions to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/71">get a Windows version working</a> in the future, which should share almost all of the same code.</p>
<p>Electron also has fantastic <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start">initial developer onboarding</a>. I'd love to achieve a similar level of quality for Datasette some day.</p>
<p>The single biggest challenge was figuring out how to bundle a working copy of the Datasette Python application to run inside the Electron application.</p>
<p>My initial plan (touched on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/30/datasette-app/">last week</a>) was to compile Datasette and its dependencies into a single executable using <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a> or <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/">PyOxidizer</a> or <a href="https://py2app.readthedocs.io/">py2app</a>.</p>
<p>These tools strip down a Python application to the minimal required set of dependencies and then use various tricks to compress that all into a single binary. They are really clever. For many projects I imagine this would be the right way to go.</p>
<p>I had one big problem though: I wanted to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/5">support plugin installation</a>. Datasette plugins can have their own dependencies, and could potentially use any of the code from the Python standard library. This means that a stripped-down Python isn't actually right for this project: I need a full installation, standard library and all.</p>
<p>Telling the user they had to install Python themselves was an absolute non-starter: the entire point of this project is to make Datasette available to users who are unwilling or unable to jump through those hoops.</p>
<p>Gregory Szorc built PyOxidizer, and as part of that he built <a href="https://python-build-standalone.readthedocs.io/">python-build-standalone</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project produces self-contained, highly-portable Python distributions. These Python distributions contain a fully-usable, full-featured Python installation as well as their build artifacts (object files, libraries, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like exactly what I needed! I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/22">opened a research issue</a>, built a proof-of-concept and decided to commit to that as the approach I was going to use. Here's a TIL that describes how I'm doing this: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/electron/python-inside-electron">Bundling Python inside an Electron app</a></p>
<p>(I find GitHub issue threads to be the ideal way of exploring these kinds of areas. Many of my repositories have a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/labels/research">research label</a> specifically to track them.)</p>
<p>The last key step was figuring out how to sign the application, so I could distribute it to other macOS users without them facing this dreaded dialog:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It turns out there are two steps to this these days: signing the code with a developer certificate, and then "notarizing" it, which involves uploading the bundle to Apple's servers, having them scan it for malicious code and attaching the resulting approval to the bundle.</p>
<p>I was expecting figuring this out to be a nightmare. It ended up not too bad: I spent two days on it, but most of the work ended up being done by <a href="https://www.electron.build/">electron-builder</a> - one of the biggest advantages of working within the Electron ecosystem is that a lot of people have put a lot of effort into these final steps.</p>
<p>I was adamant that my eventual signing and notarization solution should be automated using GitHub Actions: nothing defangs a frustrating build process more than good
automation! This made things a bit harder because all of the tutorials and documentation assumed you were working with a GUI, but I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml">got there in the end</a>. I wrote this all up as a TIL: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/electron/sign-notarize-electron-macos">Signing and notarizing an Electron app for distribution using GitHub Actions</a> (see also <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/attach-generated-file-to-release">Attaching a generated file to a GitHub release using Actions</a>).</p>
 What's next 
<p>I announced the release <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1435457848050257925">last night on Twitter</a> and I've already started getting feedback. This has resulted in a growing number of issues under the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ausability">usability label</a>.</p>
<p>My expectation is that most improvements made for the benefit of Datasette Desktop will benefit the regular Datasette web application too.</p>
<p>There's also a strategic component to this. I'm investing a lot of development work in Datasette, and I want that work to have the biggest impact possible. Datasette Desktop is an important new distribution channel, which also means that any time I add a new feature to Datasette or build a new plugin the desktop application should see the same benefit as the hosted web application.</p>
<p>If I'm unlucky I'll find this slows me down: every feature I build will need to include consideration as to how it affects the desktop application.</p>
<p>My intuition currently is that this trade-off will be worthwhile: I don't think ensuring desktop compatibility will be a significant burden, and the added value from getting new features almost for free through a whole separate distribution channel should hopefully be huge!</p>

  <p>Summary:      Fluid multi-pseudonymity perfectly describes the way we live our lives and the reality that identity systems must realize if we are to live authentically in the digital sphere.</p>



<p>
    In response to my recent post on <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/08/ephemeral_relationships.shtml">Ephemeral Relationships</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sotirov">Emil Sotirov</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sotirov/status/1431785788673511425">tweeted</a> that this was an example of "fluid multi-pseudonymity as the norm." I love that phrase because it succinctly describes something I've been trying to explain for years. 
</p>

<p>
    Emil was riffing on this article in Aeon <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-self-is-not-singular-but-a-fluid-network-of-identities">You are a network</a> that says "Selves are not only 'networked', that is, in social networks, but are themselves networks." I've never been a fan of philosophical introspections in digital identity discussions. I just don't think they often lead to useful insights. Rather, I like what Joe Andrieu <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">calls functional identity</a>: Identity is how we recognize, remember, and ultimately respond to specific people and things. But this insight, that we are multiple selves, changing over time—even in the course of a day—is powerful. And as Emil points out, our real-life ephemeral relationships are an example of this fluid multi-pseudonymity. 
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#administrative">architectures of traditional, administrative identity systems</a> do not reflect the fluid multi-pseudonymity of real life and consequently are mismatched to how people actually live. I frequently see calls for someone, usually a government, to solve the online identity problem by issuing everyone a permanent "identity." I put that in quotes because I hate when we use the word "identity" in that way—as if everyone has just one and once we link every body (literally) to some government issued identifier and a small number of attributes all our problems will disappear.
</p>

<p>
    These calls don't often come from within the identity community. Identity professionals understand how hard this problem is and that there's no single identity for anyone. But even identity professionals use the word "identity" when they mean "account." I frequently make an ass of myself my pointing that out. I get invited to fewer meetings that way. The point is this: there is no "identity." And we don't build identity systems to manage identities (whatever those are), but, rather, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationships</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    All of us, in real life and online, have multiple <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationships</a>. Many of those are pseudonymous. Many are ephemeral. But even a relationship that starts pseudonymous and ephemeral can develop into something permanent and better defined over time. Any relationship we have, even those with online services, changes over time. In short, our relationships are fluid and each is different.
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereign identity excites me because, for the first time, we have a model for online identity that can flexibly support fluid multi-pseudonymity. Decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials form an identity metasystem capable of being the foundation for any kind of relationship: ephemeral, pseudonymous, ad hoc, permanent, personal, commercial, legal, or anything else. For details on how this all works, see my <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.626726/full">Frontiers article on the identity metasystem</a>.
</p>

<p>
    An identity metasystem that matches the fluid multi-pseudonymity inherent in how people actually live is vital for personal autonomy and ultimately human rights. Computers are coming to intermediate every aspect of our lives. Our autonomy and freedom as humans depend on how we architect this digital world. Unless we put digital systems under the control of the individuals they serve without intervening administrative authorities and make them as flexible as our real-lives demand, the internet will undermine the quality of life it is meant to bolster. The identity metasystem is the foundation for doing that.

<p>R0ml Lefkowitz’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">The Image of Postgres</a> evokes the Smalltalk experience: reach deeply into a running system, make small changes, see immediate results. There isn’t yet a fullblown IDE for the style of Postgres-based development I describe in this series, though I can envision a VSCode extension that would provide one. But there is certainly a REPL (read-eval-print loop), it’s called psql, and it delivers the kind of immediacy that all REPLs do. In our case there’s also Metabase; it offers a complementary REPL that enhances its power as a <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/05/metabase-as-a-lightweight-app-server/">lightweight app server</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">Clojure docs</a> it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Clojure REPL gives the programmer an interactive development experience. When developing new functionality, it enables her to build programs first by performing small tasks manually, as if she were the computer, then gradually make them more and more automated, until the desired functionality is fully programmed. When debugging, the REPL makes the execution of her programs feel tangible: it enables the programmer to rapidly reproduce the problem, observe its symptoms closely, then improvise experiments to rapidly narrow down the cause of the bug and iterate towards a fix.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel the same way about the Python REPL, the browser’s REPL, the Metabase REPL, and now also the Postgres REPL. Every function and every materialized view in the analytics system begins as a snippet of code pasted into the psql console (or Metabase). Iteration yields successive results instantly, and those results reflect live data. In <a href="https://blog.bracha.org/exemplarDemo/exemplar2021.html">How is a Programmer Like a Pathologist</a> Gilad Bracha wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A live program is dynamic; it changes over time; it is animated. A program is alive when it’s running. When you work on a program in a text editor, it is dead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Tudor Girba amplified the point in a tweet. </p>

<p>In a database-backed system there’s no more direct way to interact with live data than to do so in the database. The Postgres REPL is, of course, a very sharp tool. Here are some ways to handle it carefully.</p>
 Find the right balance for tracking incremental change 
<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/26/working-in-a-hybrid-metabase-postgres-code-base/">Working in a hybrid Metabase / Postgres code base</a> I described how version-controlled files — for Postgres functions and views, and for Metabase questions — repose in GitHub and drive a concordance of docs. I sometimes write code snippets directly in psql or Metabase, but mainly compose in a “repository” (telling word!) where those snippets are “dead” artifacts in a text editor. They come to life when pasted into psql.</p>
<p>A knock on Smalltalk was that it didn’t play nicely with version control. If you focus on the REPL aspect, you could say the same of Python or JavaScript. In any such case there’s a balance to be struck between iterating at the speed of thought and tracking incremental change. Working solo I’ve been inclined toward a fairly granular commit history. In a team context I’d want to leave a chunkier history but still record the ongoing narrative somewhere.</p>
 Make it easy to understand the scope and effects of changes 
<p>The doc concordance has been the main way I visualize interdependent Postgres functions, Postgres views, and Metabase questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/28/working-with-interdependent-postgres-functions-and-materialized-views/">Working with interdependent Postgres functions and materialized views</a> I mentioned Laurenz Albe’s <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tracking-view-dependencies-in-postgresql/">Tracking View Dependencies in Postgres</a>. I’ve adapted the view dependency tracker he develops there, and adapted related work from others to track function dependencies. </p>
<p>This tooling is still a work in progress, though. The concordance doesn’t yet include Postgres types, for example, nor the tables that are upstream from materialized views. My hypothetical VSCode extension would know about all the artifacts and react immediately when things change.</p>
 Make it easy to find and discard unwanted artifacts 
<p>Given a function or view named foo, I’ll often write and test a foo2 before transplanting changes back into foo. Because foo may often depend on bar and call baz I wind up also with bar2 and baz2. These artifacts hang around in Postgres until you delete them, which I try to do as I go along. </p>
<p>If foo2 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoized</a> function (see <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">this episode</a>), it can be necessary to delete the set of views that it’s going to recreate. I find these with a query.</p>
 select 
  'drop materialized view ' || matviewname || ';' as drop_stmt
from pg_matviews 
where matviewname ~* {{ pattern }}
 
<p>That pattern might be question_and_answer_summary_for_group to find all views based on that function, or _6djxg2yk to find all views for a group, or even [^_]{8,8}$ to find all views made by memoized functions. </p>
<p>I haven’t yet automated the discovery or removal of stale artifacts and references to them. That’s another nice-to-have for the hypothetical IDE. </p>
 The Image of Postgres 
<p>I’ll give R0ml the last word on this topic.</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the BYTE magazine cover from August of 1981. In the 70s and the 80s, programming languages had this sort of unique perspective that’s completely lost to history. The way it worked: a programming environment was a virtual machine image, it was a complete copy of your entire virtual machine memory and that was called the image. And then you loaded that up and it had all your functions and your data in it, and then you ran that for a while until you were sort of done and then you saved it out. And this wasn’t just Smalltalk, Lisp worked that way, APL worked that way, it was kind of like Docker only it wasn’t a separate thing because everything worked that way and so you didn’t worry very much about persistence because it was implied. If you had a programming environment it saved everything that you were doing in the programming environment, you didn’t have to separate that part out. A programming environment was a place where you kept all your data and business logic forever.</p>
<p>So then Postgres is kind of like Smalltalk only different.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Well we took the UI out of Smalltalk and put it in the browser. The rest of it is the same, so really Postgres is an application delivery platform, just like we had back in the 80s.

<p>This article shows how to implement authorization in an ASP.NET Core application which uses Azure security groups for the user definitions and Azure B2C to authenticate. Microsoft Graph API is used to access the Azure group definitions for the signed in user. The client credentials flow is used to authorize the Graph API client with an application scope definition. This is not optimal, the delegated user flows would be better. By allowing applications rights for the defined scopes using Graph API, you are implicitly making the application an administrator of the tenant as well for the defined scopes.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread">https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread</a> </p>



<p>Two Azure AD security groups were created to demonstrate this feature with Azure B2C authentication. The users were added to the admin group and the user group as required. The ASP.NET Core application uses an ASP.NET Core Razor page which should only be used by admin users, i.e. people in the group. To validate this in the application, Microsoft Graph API is used to get groups for the signed in user and an ASP.NET Core handler, requirement and policy uses the group claim created from the Azure group to force the authorization.</p>



<p>The groups are defined in the same tenant as the Azure B2C. </p>







<p>A separate Azure App registration is used to define the application Graph API scopes. The User.Read.All application scope is used. In the demo, a client secret is used, but a certificate can also be used to access the API.</p>







<p>The Microsoft.Graph Nuget package is used as a client for Graph API.</p>


  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Graph" Version="4.4.0" /&gt;
  


<p>The GraphApiClientService class implements the Microsoft Graph API client. A ClientSecretCredential instance is used as the AuthProvider and the definitions for the client are read from the application configurations and the user secrets in development, or Azure Key Vault. The user-id from the name identifier claim is used to get the Azure groups for the signed-in user. The claim namespaces gets added using the Microsoft client, this can be deactivated if required. I usually use the default claim names but as the is an Azure IDP, I left the Microsoft defaults which adds the extra stuff to the claims. The Graph API GetMemberGroups method returns the group IDs for the signed in identity.</p>

<p>The user and the application are authenticated using Azure B2C and an Azure App registration. Using Azure B2C, only a certain set of claims can be returned which cannot be adapted easily. Once signed-in, we want to include the Azure security group claims in the claims principal. To do this, the Graph API is used to find the claims for the user and add the claims to the claims principal using the IClaimsTransformation implementation. This is where the GraphApiClientService is used.</p>

            return principal;
        }
  


<p>The startup class adds the services and the authorization definitions for the ASP.NET Core Razor page application. The IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups authorization handler is added and this is used to validate the Azure security group claim.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddTransient&lt;AdminApiService&gt;();

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration, "AzureAdB2C")
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

	services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()

			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups&gt;();

	services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
	{
		options.AddPolicy("IsAdminPolicy", policy =&gt;
		{
			policy.Requirements.Add(new IsAdminRequirement());
		});
	});
}
  


<p>The IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups implements the AuthorizationHandler class with the IsAdminRequirement requirement. This handler checks for the administrator group definition from the Azure tenant. </p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AzureB2CUI.Authz
{
    public class IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups : AuthorizationHandler&lt;IsAdminRequirement&gt;
    {
        private readonly string _adminGroupId;

        public IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            _adminGroupId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureGroups:AdminGroupId");
        }
        protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, IsAdminRequirement requirement)
        {
            if (context == null)
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
            if (requirement == null)
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(requirement));

            var claimIdentityprovider = context.User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "group"
                &amp;&amp; t.Value == _adminGroupId);

            if (claimIdentityprovider != null)
            {
                context.Succeed(requirement);
            }

            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The policy for this can be used anywhere in the application.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "IsAdminPolicy")]
[AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "https://b2cdamienbod.onmicrosoft.com/5f4e8bb1-3f4e-4fc6-b03c-12169e192cd7/access_as_user" })]
public class CallAdminApiModel : PageModel
{
  


<p>If a user tries to call the Razor page which was created for admin users, then an Access denied is returned. Of course, in a real application, the menu for this would also be hidden if the user is not an admin and does not fulfil the policy. </p>







<p>If the user is an admin and a member of the Azure security group, the data and the Razor page can be opened and viewed.</p>







<p>By using Azure security groups, it is really easily for IT admins to add or remove users from the admin role. This can be easily managed using Powershell scripts. It is a pity that Microsoft Graph API is required to use the Azure security groups when authenticating using Azure B2C. This is much more simple to use when authenticating using Azure AD. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I said this about Metabase:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s all nicely RESTful. Interactive elements that can parameterize queries, like search boxes and date pickers, map to URLs. Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries. I came to see this system as a kind of lightweight application server in which to incubate an analytics capability that could later be expressed more richly.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s explore that idea in more detail. Consider this query that finds groups created in the last week.</p>
 with group_create_days as (
  select
     to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as day
  from "group"
  where created &gt; now() - interval '1 week'
)
select 
  day,
  count(*)
from group_create_days
group by day 
order by day desc 
 
<p>A Metabase user can edit the query and change the interval to, say, 1 month, but there’s a nicer way to enable that. Terms in double squigglies are Metabase variables. When you type {{interval}} in the query editor, the Variables pane appears. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here I’m defining the variable’s type as text and providing the default value 1 week. The query sent to Postgres will be the same as above. Note that this won’t work if you omit ::interval. Postgres complains: “ERROR: operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone – character varying.” That’s because Metabase doesn’t support variables of type interval as required for date subtraction. But if you cast the variable to type interval it’ll work.</p>
<p>That’s an improvement. A user of this Metabase question can now type 2 months or 1 year to vary the interval. But while Postgres’ interval syntax is fairly intuitive, this approach still requires people to make an intuitive leap. So here’s a version that eliminates the guessing. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The variable type is now Field Filter; the filtered field is the created column of the group table; the widget type is Relative Date; the default is Last Month. Choosing other intervals is now a point-and-click operation. It’s less flexible — 3 weeks is no longer an option — but friendlier.</p>
<p>Metabase commendably provides URLs that capture these choices. The default in this case is METABASE_SERVER/question/1060?interval=lastmonth. For the Last Year option it becomes interval=lastyear. </p>
<p>Because all Metabase questions that use variables work this way, the notion of Metabase as rudimentary app server expands to sets of interlinked questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/26/working-in-a-hybrid-metabase-postgres-code-base/">Working in a hybrid Metabase / Postgres code base</a> I showed the following example.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Metabase question, #600, runs a query that selects columns from the view top_20_annotated_domains_last_week. It interpolates one of those columns, domain, into an URL that invokes Metabase question #985 and passes the domain as a parameter to that question. In the results for question #600, each row contains a link to a question that reports details about groups that annotated pages at that row’s domain.</p>
<p>This is really powerful stuff. Even without all the advanced capabilities I’ve been discussing in this series — pl/python functions, materialized views — you can do a lot more with the Metabase / Postgres combo than you might think.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a interesting idiom I’ve discovered. It’s often useful to interpolate a Metabase variable into a WHERE clause.</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email = {{ email }} 
 
<p>You can make that into a fuzzy search using the case-insensitive regex-match operator ~*.</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email ~* {{ email }}
 
<p>That’ll find a single address regardless of case; you can also find all records matching, say, ucsc.edu. But it requires the user to type some value into the input box. Ideally this query won’t require any input. If none is given, it lists all addresses in the table. If there is input it does a fuzzy match on that input. Here’s a recipe for doing that. Tell Metabase that {{ email }} a required variable, and set its default to any. Then, in the query, do this:</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email ~*
  case 
    when {{ email }} = 'any' then ''
    else {{ email}}
  end
 
<p>In the default case the matching operator binds to the empty string, so it matches everything and the query returns all rows. For any other input the operator binds to a value that drives a fuzzy search.</p>
<p>This is all very nice, you may think, but even the simplest app server can write to the database as well as read from it, and Metabase can’t. It’s ultimately just a tool that you point at a data warehouse to SELECT data for display in tables and charts. You can’t INSERT or UPDATE or ALTER or DELETE or CALL anything. </p>
<p>Well, it turns out that you can. Here’s a Metabase question that adds a user to the table.</p>
<p>select add_dashboard_user( {{email}} )</p>
<p>How can this possibly work? If add_dashboard_user were a Postgres procedure you could CALL it from psql, but in this context you can only SELECT.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the solution in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">Postgres set-returning functions that self-memoize as materialized views</a>. A Postgres function written in pl/python can import and use a Python function from a plpython_helpers module. That helper function can invoke psql to CALL a procedure. So this is possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’ve used Metabase for years. It provides a basic, general-purpose UX that’s deeply woven into the fabric of the company. Until recently we thought of it as a read-only system for analytics, so a lot of data management happens in spreadsheets that don’t connect to the data warehouse. It hadn’t occurred to me to leverage that same basic UX for data management too, and that’s going to be a game-changer. I always thought of Metabase as a lightweight app server. With some help from Postgres it turns out to be a more capable one than I thought.</p>

<blockquote><p>Functionality attached to the context-defining data object. Instead of an “app” silo. Now here’s a thought. :-)</p>— Johannes Ernst (@Johannes_Ernst) <a href="https://twitter.com/Johannes_Ernst/status/1434044253835980803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>Let me unpack this a bit. Let’s say that I’d like to send a message to
some guy, let’s call him Tom for this example.</p>
<p>The messaging app vendors go like: “Oh yes, we’ll make it super-easy for
him (Johannes) to send a message to Tom, so we give him an extra short
handle (say @tom) so he doesn’t need to type much, and also add a ‘reply’
button to previous messages so he won’t even have to type that.”</p>
<p>Which is myopic, because it completely misunderstands or ignores the context
of the user. The user doesn’t think that way, at least most of the time.</p>
<p>As a user, I think the pattern is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I need to tell (person) about (news) related to
(common context), how do I best do that (i.e. which app)?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three concepts and a sub-concept:</p>
 
 
<p>Who do I want to tell. In Joshua’s example: the person(s) I’m about to meet
with.</p>
 
 
<p>What’s the news I want to tell them. Here it is “I am running late”.</p>
 
 But this news only makes sense in the common context of “we agreed to meet
today”. If the receiver doesn’t have that context, they will receive
my message and it will be pointless and bewildering to them. 
 
 
 
<p>What’s the best way of conveying that news. It might be a text, a phone call,
or pretty much anything. This item is the least important in this entire
scenario, as long as the receiver gets the message.</p>
 
 
<p>So thre are two primary “entry” points for this scenario:</p>
 
 
<p>It starts with a person. The user thinks “Tom, I need to tell Tom that I’ll
be late”, and the frantically tries to find a way of contacting them while
hurring in the subway or driving really fast. (We have all been there.)</p>
 
 
<p>It starts with the shared context object. The user looks at the calendar and
thinks “Oh darn, this meeting, it’s now, I’ll be late, I need to tell them”.
(They might not even remember who exactly will be in the meeting, but then likely
the calender event has that info.)</p>
 
 
<p>The entry point is almost never: “how convenient, I have all people I’m about
to meet with in the current window of the messaging app, they all know what
whatever I’m going to type into that window next is about the meeting, and
I can just simply say that I’ll be late.”</p>
<p>So … if we were to put the user, and their experience, at the center of
messaging, messaging wouldn’t be an app. (Well, it might also be an app,
but mostly it wouldn’t.)</p>
<p>Instead, the messaging would be a “system service” attached to the context
objects in which I’d like to message. In Joshua’s example that is:</p>
 
 
<p>the person I’m about to meet with (but this only works if there is a
single person; if there are a dozen this does not work).</p>
 
 
<p>the shared context about which I am conveying the news: here, the
(hopefully shared) calendar event. Joshua’s original point.</p>
 
 
<p>Now in my experience, this is just an example for a more general pattern. For example:</p>
 
 
<p>meeting notes. In which meeting any meeting notes were taken is
of course supremely important. Which is why most meeting minutes start
with a title, a date/time and a list of attendees. Instead, they should be
attached to the calendar event, just like the message thread. (Yes,
including collaborative editing.)</p>
<p>And by “attached” I don’t mean: there’s a URL somewhere in the calendar
dialog form that leads to a Google Doc. No, I mean that the calendar can
show them, and insert the to-do-items from the meeting, and future meetings
from that document, and the other way around: that when you look at
the meeting notes, I can see the calendar event, and find out it is
a biweekly meeting, and the notes for the other meetings are over there.</p>
 
 
<p>projects. Software development is the worst offender, as far as I
know. If you and I and half a dozen other people work on a project to
implement functionality X, that is our primary shared context. All
communication and data creation should occur in that context. But instead
we have our code in Github, our bugs in Confluence, our APIs … test
cases … screen mockups … video calls … chats … in a gazillion
different places, and one of these days I’m sure somebody is going to
prove that half of software budgets in many places are consumed by context
switching between tools that blissfully ignore that the user thinks not
like a vendor does. (And the other half by trying to make the so-called
“integrations” between services work.)</p>
 
 
<p>There are many more examples. (In a previous life, I ran around with the
concept of “situational computing” – which takes context-aware computing
to something much more dynamic and extreme; needless to say it was decades
before its time. But now with AR/VR-stuff coming, it will probably become
part of the mainstream soon.)</p>
<p>The 100 dollar question is of course: if this is the right thing for users, why aren’t apps doing that?</p>
<p>Joshua brought up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc">OpenDoc</a> in a subsequent
post. Yep, there is a similarity here, and apps don’t do this kind of thing for
the same reason OpenDoc failed. (It didn’t fail because it was slow as molasses
and Steve Jobs hated it.)</p>
<p>OpenDoc failed because it would have disintermediated big and powerful
companies such as Adobe, who would have had to sell 100 little OpenDoc
components, instead of one gigantic monolith containing those 100 components
as a take-it-or-leave-it package at “enterprise” pricing. No adoption by
Adobe, Adobe feeling Apple proactively attacked their business model, it
would have killed Apple right afterwards.</p>
<p>But having OpenDoc would have sooo much better for users. We would have gotten
much more innovation, and yes, lower prices. But software vendors, like all
businesses, primarily do what is right for them, not their customers.</p>
<p>Which is why we get <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo">silos</a> everwhere we look.</p>
<p>If we wanted to change that situation, about OpenDoc-like things, or
messaging attached, in context, to things like calendar events, we have
to change the economic situation in which the important vendors find
themselves.</p>
<p>Plus of course the entire technology stack, because if all you know is
how to ship an <code>int main(argv, argc)</code> on your operating system, something
componentized and pluggable and user-centric and context-centric is never
able to emerge, even if you want to.</p>
<p>(*) The title is meant to be sarcastically, in case you weren’t sure.</p>

<p>While helping Hypothesis find its way to ed-tech it was my great privilege to explore ways of adapting annotation to other domains including bioscience, journalism, and scholarly publishing. Working across these domains showed me that annotation isn’t just an app you do or don’t adopt. It’s also a service you’d like to be available in every document workflow that connects people to selections in documents.</p>
<p>In my talk Weaving the Annotated Web I showcased four such services: <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#sitc">Science in the Classroom</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#digipo">The Digital Polarization Project</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#scibot">SciBot</a>, and <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#claimchart">ClaimChart</a>. Others include tools to <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">evaluate credibility signals</a>, or <a href="https://misinfocon.com/lets-use-the-annotated-web-to-coordinate-the-struggle-against-fake-news-1627ff4919a3">review claims</a>, in news stories. </p>
<p>As I worked through these and other scenarios, I accreted a set of tools for enabling any annotation-aware interaction in any document-oriented workflow. I’ve wanted to package these as a coherent software development kit, that hasn’t happened yet, but here are some of the ingredients that belong in such an SDK. </p>
 Creating an annotation from a selection in a document 
<p>Two core operations lie at the heart of any annotation system: creating a note that will bind to a selection in a document, and binding (anchoring) that note to its place in the document. A tool that creates an annotation reacts to a selection in a document by forming one or more selectors that describe the selection.</p>
<p>The most important selector is TextQuoteSelector. If I visit <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a> and select the phrase “illustrative examples” and then use Hypothesis to annotate that selection, the payload sent from the client to the server includes this construct.</p>
 {
  "type": "TextQuoteSelector", 
  "exact": "illustrative examples", 
  "prefix": "n\n    This domain is for use in ", 
  "suffix": " in documents. You may use this\n"
}
 
<p>The Hypothesis client formerly used an NPM module, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-quote">dom-anchor-text-quote</a>, to derive that info from a selection. It no longer uses that module, and the equivalent code that it does use isn’t separately available. But annotations created using TextQuoteSelectors formed by dom-anchor-text-quote interoperate with those created using the Hypothesis client, and I don’t expect that will change since Hypothesis needs to remain backwards-compatible with itself.</p>
<p>You’ll find something like TextQuoteSelector in any annotation system. It’s formally defined by the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#text-quote-selector">here</a>. In the vast majority of cases this is all you need to describe the selection to which an annotation should anchor. </p>
<p>There are, however, cases where TextQuoteSelector won’t suffice. Consider a document that repeats the same passage three times. Given a short selection in the first of those passages, how can a system know that an annotation should anchor to that one, and not the second or third? Another selector, TextPositionSelector (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-position">https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-position</a>), enables a system to know which passage contains the selection.</p>
 {
  "type": "TextPositionSelector", 
  "start": 51
  "end": 72, 
}
 
<p>It records the start and end of the selection in the visible text of an HTML document. Here’s the HTML source of that web page.</p>
 &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Example Domain&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
    domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/example"&gt;More information...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 
<p>Here is the visible text to which the TextQuoteSelector refers.</p>
<blockquote><p>
\n\n    Example Domain\n    This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this\n    domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.\n    More information…\n\n\n\n
</p></blockquote>
<p>The positions recorded by a TextQuoteSelector can change for a couple of reasons. If the document is altered, it’s obvious that an annotation’s start and stop numbers might change. Less obviously that can happen even if the document’s text isn’t altered. A news website, for example, may inject different kinds of advertising-related text content from one page load to the next. In that case the positions for two consecutive Hypothesis annotations made on the same selection can differ. So while TextPositionSelector can resolve ambiguity, and provide hints to an annotation system about where to look for matches, the foundation is ultimately TextQuoteSelector.</p>
<p>If you try the first example in the README at <a href="https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition">https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition</a>, you can form your own TextQuoteSelector and TextPositionSelector from a selection in a web page. That repo exists only as a wrapper around the set of modules — dom-anchor-text-quote, dom-anchor-text-position, and wrap-range-text — needed to create and anchor annotations.</p>
<p>Building on these ingredients, <a href="https://github.com/judell/HelloWorldAnnotated">HelloWorldAnnotated</a> illustrates a common pattern.</p>
 
  Given a selection in a page, form the selectors needed to post an annotation that targets the selection.
   Lead a user through an interaction that influences the content of that annotation.
   Post the annotation.
  
<p>Here is an example of such an interaction. It’s a content-labeling scenario in which a user rates the emotional affect of a selection. This is the kind of thing that can be done with the stock Hypothesis client, but awkwardly because users must reliably add tags like WeakNegative or StrongPositive to represent their ratings. The app prompts for those tags to ensure consistent use of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Although the annotation is created by a standalone app, the Hypothesis client can anchor it, display it, and even edit it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And the Hypothesis service can search for sets of annotations that match the tags WeakNegative or StrongPositive. </p>
<p>There’s powerful synergy at work here. If your annotation scenario requires controlled tags, or a prescribed workflow, you might want to adapt the Hypothesis client to do those things. But it can be easier to create a standalone app that does exactly what you need, while producing annotations that interoperate with the Hypothesis system.</p>
 Anchoring an annotation to its place in a document 
<p>Using this same set of modules, a tool or system can retrieve an annotation from a web service and anchor it to a document in the place where it belongs. You can try the second example in the README at <a href="https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition">https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition</a> to see how this works.</p>
<p>For a real-world demonstration of this technique, see <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#sitc">Science in the Classroom</a>. It’s a project sponsored by The American Association for the Advancement of Science. Graduate students annotate research papers selected from the Science family of journals so that younger students can learn about the terminology, methods, and outcomes of scientific research.</p>
<p>Pre-Hypothesis, annotations on these papers were displayed using Learning Lens, a viewer that color-codes them by category. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Nothing about Learning Lens changed when Hypothesis came into the picture, it just provided a better way to record the annotations. Originally that was done as it’s often done in the absence of a formal way to describe annotation targets, by passing notes like: “highlight the word ‘proximodistal’ in the first paragraph of the abstract, and attach this note to it.” This kind of thing happens a lot, and wherever it does there’s an opportunity to adopt a more rigorous approach. Nowadays at Science in the Classroom the annotators use Hypothesis to describe where notes should anchor, as well as what they should say. When an annotated page loads it searches Hypothesis for annotations that target the page, and inserts them using the same format that’s always been used to drive the Learning Lens. Tags assigned by annotators align with Learning Lens categories. The search looks only for notes from designated annotators, so nothing unwanted will appear. </p>
 An annotation-powered survey 
<p>The <a href="https://credibilitycoalition.org/">Credibility Coalition</a> is “a research community that fosters collaborative approaches to understanding the veracity, quality and credibility of online information.” We worked with them on a project to test a set of <a href="https://credweb.org/reviewed-signals-20200224/">signals</a> that bear on the credibility of news stories. Examples of such signals include: </p>
 
 Title Representativeness (Does the title of an article accurately reflect its content?)
  Sources (Does the article cite sources?)
  Acknowledgement of uncertainty (Does the author acknowledge uncertainty, or the possibility things might be otherwise?)
  
<p>Volunteers were asked these questions for each of a set of news stories. Many of the questions were yes/no or multiple choice and could have been handled by any survey tool. But some were different. What does “acknowledgement of uncertainty” look like? You know it when you see it, and you can point to examples. But how can a survey tool solicit answers that refer to selections in documents, and record their locations and contexts? </p>
<p>The answer was to create a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">survey tool</a> that enabled respondents to answer such questions by highlighting one or more selections. Like the HelloWorldAnnotated example above, this was a bespoke client that guided the user through a prescribed workflow. In this case, that workflow was more complex. And because it was defined in a <a href="https://github.com/judell/AnnotationPoweredSurvey/blob/master/questions.js">declarative way</a>, the same app can be used for any survey that requires people to provide answers that refer to selections in web documents.</p>
 A JavaScript wrapper for the Hypothesis API 
<p>The HelloWorldAnnotated example uses functions from a library, <a href="https://github.com/judell/hlib">hlib</a>, to post an annotation to the Hypothesis service. That library includes functions for searching and posting annotations using the Hypothesis API. It also includes support for interaction patterns common to annotation apps, most of which occur in <a href="https://github.com/judell/facet">facet</a>, a standalone tool that searches, displays, and exports sets of annotations. Supported interactions include:</p>
<p>– Authenticating with an API token</p>
<p>– Creating a picklist of groups accessible to the authenticated user</p>
<p>– Assembling and displaying conversation threads</p>
<p>– Parsing annotations</p>
<p>– Editing annotations</p>
<p>– Editing tags</p>
<p>In addition to facet, other tools based on this library include <a href="https://github.com/judell/CopyAnnotations">CopyAnnotations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/judell/TagRename">TagRename</a></p>
 A Python wrapper for the Hypothesis API 
<p>If you’re working in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis-api/">hypothesis-api</a> is an alternative API wrapper that supports searching for, posting, and parsing annotations. </p>
 Notifications 
<p>If you’re a publisher who embeds Hypothesis on your site, you can use a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/new-search-capability/">wildcard search</a> to find annotations. But it would be helpful to be notified when annotations are posted. <a href="https://github.com/judell/h_notify">h_notify</a> is a tool that uses the Hypothesis API to watch for annotations on individual or wildcard URLs, or from particular users, or in a specified group, or with a specified tag. </p>
<p>When an h_notify-based watcher finds notes in any of these ways, it can send alerts to a Slack channel, or to an email address, or add items to an RSS feed.</p>
<p>At Hypothesis we mainly rely on the Slack option. In this example, user nirgendheim highlighted the word “interacting” in a page on the Hypothesis website. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The watcher sent this notice to our #website channel in Slack. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A member of the support team (Hypothesis handle mdiroberts) saw it there and responded to nirgendheim as shown above. How did nirgendheim know that mdiroberts had responded? The core Hypothesis system sends you an email when somebody replies to one of your notes. h_notify is for bulk monitoring and alerting.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
 A tiny Hypothesis server 
<p>People sometimes ask about connecting the Hypothesis client to an alternate server in order to retain complete control over their data. It’s doable, you can follow the instructions <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/install/">here</a> to build and run your own server, and some people and organizations do that. Depending on need, though, that can entail more effort, and more moving parts, than may be warranted.</p>
<p>Suppose for example you’re part of a team of investigative journalists annotating web pages for a controversial story, or a team of analysts sharing confidential notes on web-based financial reports. The documents you’re annotating are public, but the notes you’re taking in a Hypothesis private group are so sensitive that you’d rather not keep them in the Hypothesis service. You’d ideally like to spin up a minimal server for that purpose: small, simple, and easy to manage within your own infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer">proof of concept</a>. This tiny server clocks in just 145 lines of Python with very few dependencies. It uses Python’s batteries-include SQLite module for annotation storage. The web framework is Pyramid only because that’s what I’m familiar with, but could as easily be Flask, the ultra-light framework typically used for this sort of thing. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer/blob/main/service.py">tiny app</a> wrapped around those ingredients is all you need to receive JSON payloads from a Hypothesis client, and return JSON payloads when the client searches for annotations to anchor to a page.</p>
<p>The service is dockerized and easy to deploy. To test it I used the <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a> <a href="https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/">speedrun</a> to create an instance at <a href="https://summer-feather-9970.fly.dev">https://summer-feather-9970.fly.dev</a>. Then I made the handful of small tweaks to the Hypothesis client shown in <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer/blob/main/client-patches.txt">client-patches.txt</a>. My method for doing that, typical for quick proofs of concept that vary the Hypothesis client in some small way, goes like this:</p>
 
  Clone the Hypothesis client.
   Edit gulpfile.js to say const IS_PRODUCTION_BUILD = false. This turns off minification so it’s possible to read and debug the client code.
   Follow the instructions to <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/projects/client/en/latest/developers/developing/#running-the-client-from-the-browser-extension">run the client from a browser extension</a>. After establishing a link between the client repo and browser-extension repo, as per those instructions, use this build command — make build SETTINGS_FILE=settings/chrome-prod.json — to create a browser extension that authenticates to the Hypothesis production service.
   In a Chromium browser (e.g. Chrome or Edge or Brave) use chrome://extensions, click Load unpacked, and point to the browser-extension/build directory where you built the extension.
  
<p>This is the easiest way to create a Hypothesis client in which to try quick experiments. There are tons of source files in the repos, but just a handful of bundles and loose files in the built extension. You can run the extension, search and poke around in those bundles, set breakpoints, make changes, and see immediate results. </p>
<p>In this case I only made the changes shown in client-patches.txt:</p>
 
  In options/index.html I added an input box to name an alternate server.
   In options/options.js I sync that value to the cloud and also to the browser’s localStorage.
   In the extension bundle I check localStorage for an alternate server and, if present, modify the API request used by the extension to show the number of notes found for a page.
   In the sidebar bundle I check localStorage for an alternate server and, if present, modify the API requests used to search for, create, update, and delete annotations.
  
<p>I don’t recommend this cowboy approach for anything real. If I actually wanted to use this tweaked client I’d create branches of the client and the browser-extension, and transfer the changes into the source files where they belong. If I wanted to share it with a close-knit team I’d zip up the extension so colleagues could unzip and sideload it. If I wanted to share more broadly I could upload the extension to the Chrome web store. I’ve done all these things, and have found that it’s feasible — without forking Hypothesis — to maintain branches that maintain small but strategic changes like this one. But when I’m aiming for a quick proof of concept, I’m happy to be a cowboy.</p>
<p>In any event, here’s the proof. With the tiny server deployed to summer-feather-9970.fly.dev, I poked that address into the tweaked client. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And sure enough, I could search for, create, reply to, update, and delete annotations using that 145-line SQLite-backed server.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The client still authenticates to Hypothesis in the usual way, and behaves normally unless you specify an alternate server. In that case, the server knows nothing about Hypothesis private groups. The client sees it as the Hypothesis public layer, but it’s really the moral equivalent of a private group. Others will see it only if they’re running the same tweaked extension and pointing to the same server. You could probably go quite far with SQLite but, of course, it’s easy to see how you’d swap it out for a more robust database like Postgres.</p>
 Signposts 
<p>I think of these examples as signposts pointing to a coherent SDK for weaving annotation into any document workflow. They show that it’s feasible to decouple and recombine the core operations: creating an annotation based on a selection in a document, and anchoring an annotation to its place in a document. Why decouple? Reasons are as diverse as the document workflows we engage in. The stock Hypothesis system beautifully supports a wide range of scenarios. Sometimes it’s helpful to replace or augment Hypothesis with a custom app that provides a guided experience for annotators and/or an alternative display for readers. The annotation SDK I envision will make it straightforward for developers to build solutions that leverage the full spectrum of possibility.</p>

    <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/archive">This link gives you access to all the articles and archives</a> for &lt;/Hello CDO&gt; <p>“Prevention or Correction” is something society has wrestled with for a very long time. This article focuses on why our experience of “prevention or correction” ideas frames the CDO’s responsibilities and explores a linkage to a company’s approach to data.</p><p></p> <br>Almost irrespective of where you reside, we live with police, penal, and political systems that cannot fully agree on preventing or correcting.  It is not that we disagree with the “why”; is it the “how” that divides us! I am a child of an age when lefthandedness was still seen as something to correct, so we have made some progress.   <br>A fundamental issue is that prevention is the best thinking; but if you prevent it, it does not occur.  We are then left with the dilemma, “did you prevent it, or was it not going to occur anyway?” The finance team now ask, “Have we wasted resources on something that would not have happened?”<br><br>When something we don’t like does occur, we jump into action as we can correct it.  We prioritise, allocate resources and measure them.  We (humanity) appear to prefer a problem we can solve (touch, feel, see) and can measure rather than prevent.  A proportion of crime is driven by the poor economic situation of a population with no choice. Yet, we keep that same population in the same economic conditions as we have limited resources committed to correction (control.) It is way more messy and complex, and we need both, but prevention is not an easy route.  Just think about our current global pandemic, climate change or sustainability.  Prevention was a possibility in each case, but we kick into action now correction is needed. <br><br>In our new digital and data world, we are facing the same issues of prevention vs correction.  Should we prevent data issues or correct data issues, and who owns the problem?  <br><br>In the data industry right now, we correct and just like the criminal services, we have allocated all our budget to correction, so we don’t have time or resources for prevention. I would be rich if I had a dollar for every time I hear, “We need results, Fish, not an x*x*x*x data philosophy.” <br><br>For anyone who follows my views and beliefs, I advocate data quality founded on lineage and provenance (prevention). I am not a fan of the massive industry that has been built up to correct data (correction). I see it as a waste on many levels, but <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">FUD</a> sells to a naive buyer. I am a supporter of having a presence at the source of data to <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">guarantee attestation</a> and assign rights.  I cannot get my head around the massive budgets set aside to correct “wrong” data.  We believe that data quality is knowing the data is wrong and thinking we can correct it!  We have no idea if the correction is correct, and the updated data still lacks attestation.  We measure this madness and assign KPI to improve our corrective powers.  In this case, because it is data and not humans, prevention is the prefered solution as neither a cure nor correction work at any economic level that can be justified other than your a provider of the service or one of the capital providers. But as already mentioned, prevention is too hard to justify. The same analogy is a recurring theme in the buy (outsource) vs build debate for the new platform, but that is another post.  <br> Unpacking to expose and explore some motivations.  We know that the CDO job emerged in 2002, and some 20 years on, it is still in its infancy.  Tenures are still short (less than three years), and there is a lack of skills and experience because this data and digital thing are all new compared to marketing, finance, or accounting.  As I have written before, our <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">job descriptions for the CDO remain poorly defined</a>, with mandates too broad and allocated resources too limited.  All many articles at <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">&lt;/Hello CDO&gt;</a> I focus on the conflicts CDO’s have because of the mandates we are given.<br><br>Whilst mandates are too broad, thankfully, security and privacy are becoming new roles with their own mandates. The CDO is still being allocated a data transformation mandate but being asked to correct the data whilst doing it.   Not surprisingly, most data projects fail as the board remains fixated that the data we have is of value, and we should allocate all our resources correcting and securing it.   A bit like the house built on sand,  we endlessly commit resources to unpin a house without foundations because it is there, rather than moving to the more secure ground and building the right house.   Prevention or correction?   <br><br>All CDO’s face the classic problem of being asked to solve the world’s debt famine crisis with no budget, no resources and yesterday would be good.  Solve the data quality problem by correcting the waste at the end.  Because of this commitment to correct data, we find we are trapped.  “We should just finish the job as we have gone so far,”  is what the finance team says,  “prevention is like starting all over again”; it will be too expensive, wreck budgets and we will miss our bonus hurdle as it means a total re-start.  The budget is too big so let’s just put in some more foundations into the house built on sand.<br><br>It is one of my favourite saying “the reason it is called a shortcut, it because it is a short cut and it misses something out”  I often use it when we boil a decision down to an <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">ROI number</a>, believing that all the information needed can be presented in a simple single dimensional number.  The correction ideals will always win when we use shortcuts, especially ROI.<br><br> Prevention is a hard sell.  Correction is a simple sell.   Who benefits from an endless correction policy? Probably the CDO!  We get to look super busy, it is easy to get the commitment, and no one will argue at the board/ senior leadership team to do anything else. It might take three years to see the transformation has not happened, and there is plenty of demand for CDO’s? Why would a CDO want to support prevention? Why is the CDO role so in question?<br><br>Prevention takes time, is complex, and you may not see results during your tenure. I often reflect on what <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">will be my CDO legacy</a>?  Correction is instant, looks busy and gets results that you can be measured on.   Correction means there is always work to be done.  Prevention means you will eventually be out of a job.  Since prevention cannot be measured and is hard to justify with an ROI calculation,  maybe the CEO needs to focus on measuring the success of analytics?<br> Note to the CEO Data is complex, and like all expert discipline areas, you will seek advice, opinion and counsel from various sources to help form a balanced view.  Data quality is a thorny one as most of those around you will inform you of the benefits of correction over prevention.  Correction wins, and it is unlikely any balanced view arguing for prevention. <br><br>Perhaps it is worth looking at the CDO job description, focusing on what the KPIs are for and how you shift a focus to the outcomes of the analysis.  To improve analysis and outcomes demands better data quality, which correction can only get you so far. You get prevention by the back door.

<p>The UK&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/ico-codes-of-practice/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/">Information Commission’s (ICO) Children’s Code</a>, officially known as the“Age Appropriate Design Code: a code of practice for online services,” after a year grace period, goes into effect Thursday, Sept. 2, 2021. The code, which falls under section 125(1)(b) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act), looks to protect UK children, i.e., people under the age of eighteen (18).</p>
<p>Are you ready? I hope so; this code applies to any business, in and out of the UK, that provides digital services to UK children. And, it is not the only one of its kind around the world.</p>
 What You Need to Know 
<p>In the digital age, people’s digital footprint is first established months before they’re born, grows exponentially throughout their lives, and carries on after their death. Kids are especially vulnerable to being influenced by digital services; moreover, they are more likely to befall cybercrime. For instance, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/_files/pdfs/reports/2011/child-identity-theft.pdf">2011 study by Carnegie Mellon SyLab&nbsp;</a>study found that children were 51% more likely to have their security number used by someone else.</p>
 What is it for? 
<p>The code is designed to ensure that service providers of apps, programs, toys, or any other devices that collect and process children’s data “are appropriate for use by, and meet the development needs of, children.” It calls for 15 independent and interdependent legal, service design, and data processing principles and standards to be followed. Specifically, as called out in the code, these are:</p>
<p>• Best interests of the child • Data protection impact assessments • Age appropriate application• Transparency&nbsp;• Detrimental use of data • Policies and community standard • Default settings • Data minimization • Data sharing • Geolocation • Parental controls • Profiling • Nudge techniques • Connected toys and devices • Online tools</p>
 Who must comply? Risk of non-compliance 
<p>Information society services (ISS) that cater to UK children under the age of 18 or whose services are likely to be accessed by children must adhere to the code or risk ICO public assessment and enforcement notices, warnings, reprimands, and penalty notices (aka administrative fines). Serious code breaches may lead to fines of up to €20 million (or £17.5 million when the UK GDPR comes into effect) or 4% of the provider’s annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher.</p>
 What you need to do 
<p>Ensuring the digital future and safety of children and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/elderjustice/prosecutors/statutes">venerable adults</a>&nbsp;(people over 18 who cannot meet their own needs or seek help without assistance) is a founding principal of a healthy society and for running a sustainable business. There are several recommended steps you can take to get into and maintain alignment with the code:</p>
<p>1. Consider the likelihood that a child (or vulnerable adult) might use your service,&nbsp;the liability is on the service provider to determine the likelihood a child will use their service. You should conduct user testing, surveys, market research (inc. competitive analysis), and professional and academic literature reviews.</p>
<p>2. Document your data flows (i.e. conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA)),&nbsp;your DPIA should consist of data and systems flow diagrams and detailed descriptions of these systems (inc. services, process, and interfaces), all the data flowing through them, and how data is handled. The flow diagram should illustrate each engagement swim lane (e.g., individual, client, company, third-party) and the direction of data flow. The supporting documentation should define each data element and clearly spell out how it will be collected, used and managed. Take it from me and my firsthand experience. The DPIA lens is an invaluable tool for strategic product development. I highly recommend that you not look at the DIPA process as a legal necessity but rather as a valuable framework for learning about and assessing how your products and services work, exactly what they do and why. Performed with the right lens, the DPIA can be a fertile ground for creative inspiration and innovation.</p>
<p>3. Make it a team sport,&nbsp;effective data management is a company-wide, multi-disciplinary activity. It is important that you ensure all key stakeholders, not just legal, IT, security, and compliance, but also marketing, user experience, customer experience, design, support, product, sales, and third-party compliance partners (experts that can help you and your team succeed) all play a role in ensuring your products and services do not just meet legal requirements but exceed people’s expectations.</p>
 But There Is More 
<p>The above steps are extremely useful; however, there are two more considerations that should not be neglected- 1) things are just getting started, and 2) people’s sentiment—“the opportunity to differentiate.”</p>
<p>First,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-09-14-gartner-says-by-2023--65--of-the-world-s-population-w">Gartner</a>&nbsp;estimates that 10% of the world’s population is currently protected under people-centric regulation, i.e. regulations like&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California’s CPPA</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://lgpd-brazil.info/">Brazil’s LGPD</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">China’s data production law</a>&nbsp;which takes effect Nov. 1 2021. By 2023 Gartner estimate this number will rise to 65%. Moreover, keep in mind, it will not just be omnibus rules that take effect; sectoral-specific rules will apply as well. For example, in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is reevaluating its child protection laws (<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions-0">COPPA</a>) and the U.S. Department of Education Department will more than likely be updating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (<a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>). Moreover, there are state-specific regulations similar to the CCPA being enacted. For Instance, in July 2021, Colorado just enacted their people-centric regulations, “<a href="http://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021A/bills/2021a_190_enr.pdf">Privacy Act of 2021</a>.”</p>
<p>Second, globally, as evidenced by the last seven years of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/mefs-7th-annual-global-trust-report/">MEF Global Consumer Trust studies</a>, people are waking up to industry data practices. Simply saying they’re unhappy about them is an understatement. People are connected, they’re concerned, and they want control of their data. The problem is, they’re not exactly sure how to go about it.</p>
<p>There is more to win than just staying on the right side of the law. There is an opportunity for companies to go beyond the law, to recognize that digital privacy, the controls and flows of one’s personal data, should be treated as sacred as one’s physical privacy. Privacy should not be a luxury good obtained only by a select minority; it’s a human right. All three major societal constituents (individuals, private sector organizations, and public sector institutions) need to play their part. There is an opportunity for each to weigh in on this debate, especially public sector players who can differentiate themselves by actively and publicly providing people not just with the utility of the company’s service but with tools and education that help people proactively enact their data rights and to secure and gain agency over their digital footprint, not just now but throughout their entire life. Like global warming, if we each do our part, we can get data back under control and achieve a healthy equilibrium throughout the world’s markets.</p>

<p>At the end of 2020, the Sovrin Foundation published the 12 Principles of SSI, <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/</a> .  Building on the earlier works from Kim Cameron, and Christopher Allen, these principles layout what must be foundational principles around any self-sovereign identity system. The evolution of the Principles of SSI came about through the need to differentiate what is ‘true’ SSI versus marketing forces twisting the concept.  This market driven motivator can bring cultish overtones to the process.</p><p>With this event we had a bit of fun in what is otherwise 'serious' business.</p><p>A few themes that come out of the discussion:</p><p>- The position of the holder of the credential - when does the holder become the source of truth and the key to value creation?  In most current business value conversations the holder appears to incidental; the focus is on how to incent the verifiers and issuers with little regard to the position and influence of the holder.  While the SSI ‘triangle’ puts the holder at the ‘top’ of the triangle, the lack of consideration of the trust and value equation there, implies the triangle should be inverted elevating the issuers and verifiers and putting the holder on the bottom.</p><p>- When principles become a means of “locking in” a definition, they become a means of “locking out” those that do not meet the “bar”.  A concern voiced was that with this mental model, and the implication of the moral ‘righteousness’ of this position, the real commercial values of SSI are lost and those not in the ‘cult’ turn away.</p><p>The panelists are:</p>  <p>Simone Ravaioli, Director Digitary</p>  <p>Rob van Kranenberg, IoT Council and NGI Forward</p>  <p>Nicky Hickman, Chair of the ID4All WG, Sovrin Foundation</p>  <p>Michael Shea, Moderator of Vienna Digital Identity Meetup</p>  <p></p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/580329620">https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/580329620</a></p> Time markers:    <p>0:05:00  - Introduction </p>  <p>0:10:07   - Simone Ravaioli </p>  <p>0:17:09   - Nicky Hickman</p>  <p>0:25:44  - Rob van Kranenburg</p>  <p>0:35:00  - General Discussion</p>  <p>1:15:07   - Rob van Kranenburg</p>  <p>1:23:45  - Wrap up </p>   Resources <p>Slide decks:</p>  <p>Simone Ravaioli : Principles vs Cult (Simone)</p>  <p>Nicky Hickman : Principles vs Cult (Nicky)</p>  <p>Rob van Kranenburg : Slide Deck 1  Slide Deck 2</p>  <p>Blog Posts:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stoic-sovereign-identity-ssi-simone-ravaioli/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stoic-sovereign-identity-ssi-simone-ravaioli/</a></p>  <p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/">https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/</a> </p><p>The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance.

  <p>Summary:      A recent trip through SL airport's new TSA screening area shows why bureaucracies legibility fails. People aren't corporate or hierarchical. Instead they're messy... and innovative.</p>


<p>
    I just flew for the first time in 16 months. In that time, Salt Lake International Airport got a new terminal, including an update to the TSA screening area. The new screening area has been <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2020/09/22/tsa-highlights-features-security-checkpoint-new-slc">touted as a model of efficiency</a>, featuring bin stations for people to load their bags, electronics, belts, and shoes into bins that they then push onto a conveyor. The bins are handled automatically and everything is sunshine and joy. Except it isn't.
</p>

<p>
    The new system is perfect so long as the people using it are too. The first problem is that unless your at the last bin station, the conveyor in front of you is constantly full and it's hard to get your bin onto the conveyor. And if you've got more than one bin to load, they are separated from each other because the loading station isn't big enough for two. People just don't conform to the TSA's ideal!
</p>

<p>
    But the real problem is that people forget things in their pockets or don't take off their belt. In the olden days, the TSA had little bowls. You'd throw your stuff in one, put it on the belt, and be on your way. Now, there's no easy way to accommodate forgotten things except to go back to a bin loading station and put them in a big bin, clogging the conveyor even more. Three people in line ahead of me at the scanner forgot something, causing all kinds of delays. The TSA people were even telling them to just hold them in the scanner and taking them from them to hold while the scan was completed. Because there's no good way to deal with forgotten items, everyone is forced to improvise, but the system is rigid and doesn't easily accommodate improvisation. 
</p>

<p>
    The situation reminded me of the story James C. Scott tells in the opening of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300246757/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State</a> where forestry officials planted neat, efficient rows of trees instead of letting the forest take its natural path. The end result was less yield from the forest, but happier foresters who could now see every tree. Scott's point is that bureaucracy aims for legibility in order to serve its own purposes—and usually fails in that effort. The primary reason states have wanted legibility of citizens is taxes (and, historically, conscription). But once you have legibility, the temptation to extend it to other uses is too great to resist. In this case, the TSA has ordered the screening process and made it legible to the screeners, but made no provision for outliers. If no one forgets anything and the system is lightly loaded, it should work great. Of course, that's not the real world.  
</p>

<p>
    IT people are bureaucrats in their own way. We build and operate the systems that people use to do their jobs and live their lives. We strive for legibility in order to make the software simpler for us, even if it doesn't serve the users quite as well. Universities are decentralized places with lots of innovative people pursuing their own goals. They are more feudal than corporate. I've often heard university IT people complain about this reality because it makes their life harder.  If you're a professor, you'd like to use whichever LMS suits your particular needs. But that's not very legible. If you're a university IT person, you'd like to force all faculty to use the standard LMS that the university chose. Neat and orderly, but it squeezes the innovation out of the university one drop at a time. 
</p>

<p>
    Life is messy. People are forgetful, disorganized, and, relatedly, innovative. Bureaucracy desperately wants legibility so that the rules are followed, the processes perform, and the bureaucrat's life is made easy. Building systems that support decentralized workflows and individual decisions, without getting in the way, is hard. And letting people be people can be frustrating when it's causing you headaches. We'll never build  systems that support an authentic, operationalized digital existence until we stop trying to fit people's decentralized lives into our neat, ordered, legible software.
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300078153/windleyofente-20">Seeing like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed by James C. Scott</a> <p>In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. Centrally managed social plans misfire, Scott argues, when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not—and cannot—be fully understood. Further, the success of designs for social organization depends upon the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against "development theory" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. He identifies and discusses four conditions common to all planning disasters: administrative ordering of nature and society by the state; a "high-modernist ideology" that places confidence in the ability of science to improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large- scale interventions; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>This article shows how to improve the security of an ASP.NET Core Web API application by adding security headers to all HTTP API responses. The security headers are added using the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package from <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewlocknet">Andrew Lock</a>. The headers are used to protect the session, not for authorization. The application uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to authorize the API requests. The security headers are used to protected the session.  Swagger is used in development and the CSP needs to be weakened to allow swagger to work during development. A strict CSP definition is used for the deployed environment.</p>

<p>The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders Nuget package is added to the csproj file of the web applications. The Swagger Open API packages are added as well as the Microsoft.Identity.Web to protect the API using OAuth.</p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web" Version="1.15.2" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="IdentityModel.AspNetCore" Version="3.0.0" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference

		Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore" Version="6.1.4" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations" Version="6.1.4" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The security header definitions are added using the HeaderPolicyCollection class. I added this to a separate class to keep the Startup class small where the middleware is added. I passed a boolean parameter into the method which is used to add or remove the HSTS header and create a CSP policy depending on the environment. </p>



<p></p>


  public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev)
{
	var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
		.AddFrameOptionsDeny()
		.AddXssProtectionBlock()
		.AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
		.AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.RequireCorp();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
			builder.AddAutoplay().None();
			builder.AddCamera().None();
			builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
			builder.AddFullscreen().All();
			builder.AddGeolocation().None();
			builder.AddGyroscope().None();
			builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
			builder.AddMicrophone().None();
			builder.AddMidi().None();
			builder.AddPayment().None();
			builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
			builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
			builder.AddUsb().None();
		});

	AddCspHstsDefinitions(isDev, policy);

	return policy;
}
  


<p>The AddCspHstsDefinitions defines different policies using the parameter. In development, the HSTS header is not added to the headers and a weak CSP is used so that the Swagger UI will work. This UI uses unsafe inline Javascript and needs to be allowed in development. I remove swagger from all non dev deployments due to this and force a strong CSP definition then.</p>


  private static void AddCspHstsDefinitions(bool isDev, HeaderPolicyCollection policy)
{
	if (!isDev)
	{
		policy.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
			builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
			builder.AddImgSrc().None();
			builder.AddFormAction().None();
			builder.AddFontSrc().None();
			builder.AddStyleSrc().None();
			builder.AddScriptSrc().None();
			builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
			builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();
			builder.AddCustomDirective("require-trusted-types-for", "'script'");
		});
		// maxage = one year in seconds
		policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains
          (maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
	}
	else
	{
		// allow swagger UI for dev
		policy.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
			builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
			builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
			builder.AddFormAction().Self();
			builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
			builder.AddStyleSrc().Self().UnsafeInline();
			builder.AddScriptSrc().Self().UnsafeInline(); //.WithNonce();
			builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
			builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();
		});
	}
}
  


<p>In the Startup class, the UseSecurityHeaders method is used to apply the HTTP headers policy and add the middleware to the application. The env.IsDevelopment() is used to add or not to add the HSTS header. The default HSTS middleware from the ASP.NET Core templates was removed from the Configure method as this is not required.   The UseSecurityHeaders is added before the swagger middleware so that the security headers are deployment to all environments.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	app.UseSecurityHeaders(
		SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment()));

	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();

		app.UseSwagger();
		app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;
		{
			c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "API v1");
		});
	}
  


<p>The server header can be removed in the program class if using Kestrel. If using IIS, you probably need to use the web.config to remove this. </p>


  public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =&gt;
                {
                    webBuilder
                        .ConfigureKestrel(options =&gt; options.AddServerHeader = false)
                        .UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();
                });
  


<p>Running the application using a non development environment, the securtiyheaders.com check returns good results. Everything is closed as this is an API with no UI. </p>







<p>And the <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/</a> check returns a very possible evaluation of the headers. </p>







<p>If a swagger UI is required, the API application can be run in the development environment. This could also be deployed if required, but in a production deployment, you probably don’t need this.</p>







<p>To support the swagger UI, a weakened CSP is used and the <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/</a> check returns a more negative result.</p>



<p></p>







<p>Notes:</p>



<p>I block all traffic, if possible, which is not from my domain including sub domains. If implementing enterprise applications, I would always do this. If implementing public facing applications with high traffic volumes or need extra fast response times, or need to reduce the costs of hosting, then CDNs would need to be used, allowed and so on. Try to block all first and open up as required and maybe you can avoid some nasty surprises from all the Javascript, CSS frameworks used.</p>

<p>Update 8th September 2021: I made a bunch more progress over the week following this post, see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Sep/8/datasette-desktop/">Datasette Desktop—a macOS desktop application for Datasette</a> for details or <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">download the app</a> to try it out.</p>
<p></p>
 Why a desktop application? 
<p>On Monday I <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1429931719587598346">kicked off an enormous Twitter conversation</a> when I posted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder how much of the popularity of R among some communities in comparison to Python comes down to the fact that with R you can install the RStudio desktop application and you're ready to go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ties into my single biggest complaint about Python: it's just too hard for people to get started with. Setting up a Python development environment for the first time remains an enormous barrier to entry.</p>
<p>I later put this <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1429937655450505248">in stronger terms</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I think about this the more frustrated I get, thinking about the enormous amount of human potential that's squandered because the barriers to getting started learning to program are so much higher than they need to be</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which made me think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Those_who_live_in_glass_houses_should_not_throw_stones">glass houses</a>. My own <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> project has exactly the same problem: to run it locally you need to install Python and then install Datasette! Mac users <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html">can use Homebrew</a>, but telling newcomers to install Homebrew first isn't particularly welcoming either.</p>
<p>Ideally, I'd like people to be able to install a regular desktop application and start using Datasette that way, without even needing to know that it's written in Python.</p>
<p>There's been <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/93">an open issue</a> to get Datasette running as a standalone binary using PyInstaller since November 2017, with quite a bit of research.</p>
<p>But I want a UI as well: I don't want to have to teach new users how to install and run a command-line application if I can avoid it.</p>
<p>So I decided to spend some time researching <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> to see how hard it would be to make a basic Datasette desktop application a reality.</p>
 Progress so far 
<p>The code I've written so far can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app">simonw/datasette.app</a> repository on GitHub. The app so far does the following:</p>
 
 Run a <code>datasette</code> server on localhost attached to an available port (found using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/portfinder">portfinder</a>) which terminates when the app quits. 
 Open a desktop window showing that Datasette instance once the server has started. 
 Allow additional windows onto the same instance to be opened using the "New Window" menu option or the Command+N keyboard shortcut. 
 Provides an "Open Database..." menu option (and Command+O shortcut) which brings up a file picker to allow the user to select a SQLite database file to open - once selected, this is attached to the Datasette instance and any windows showing the Datasette homepage are reloaded. 
 
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n90Cg_9j9XE">a video demo</a> showing these features in action:</p>

<p>It's very much an MVP, but I'm encouraged by the progress so far. I think this is enough of a proof of concept to be worth turning this into an actual usable product.</p>
 How this all works 
<p>There are two components to the application.</p>
<p>The first is a thin Electron shell, responsible for launching the Python server, managing windows and configuring the various desktop menu options used to configure it. The code for that lives in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/main.js">main.js</a>.</p>
<p>The second is a custom Datasette plugin that adds extra functionality needed by the application. Currently this consists of a tiny bit of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/datasette-app-support/datasette_app_support/static/sticky-footer.css">extra CSS</a> to make the footer stick to the bottom of the window, and a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/datasette-app-support/datasette_app_support/__init__.py#L15-L56">custom API endpoint</a> at <code>/-/open-database-file</code> which is called by the menu option for opening a new database.</p>
 Initial impressions of Electron 
<p>I know it's cool to knock Electron, but in this case it feels like exactly the right tool for the job. Datasette is already a web application - what I need is a way to hide the configuration of that web application behind an icon, and re-present the interface in a way that feels more like a desktop application.</p>
<p>This is my first time building anything with Electron - here are some of my initial impressions.</p>
 
 The initial getting started workflow is really good. I started out with their <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start">Quick Start</a> and was up and running with a barebones application that I could start making changes to in just a few minutes. 
 The documentation is pretty good, but it leans more towards being an API reference. I found myself googling for examples of different things I wanted to do pretty often. 
 The automated testing situation isn't great. I'm using <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/spectron">Spectron</a> and <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/test/spec.js">my initial</a> (very thin) tests - I got them up and running in GitHub Actions, but I've already run into some limitations:
 
 For some reason each time I run the tests an Electron window (and <code>datasette</code> Python process) is left running. I can't figure out why this is. 
 There doesn't appear to be a way for tests to trigger menu items, which is frustrating because most of the logic I've written so far deals with menu items! There is an <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/spectron/issues/21">open issue for this</a> dating back to May 2016. 
 
 
 I haven't yet managed to package my app. This is clearly going to be the biggest challenge. 
 
 Up next: packaging the app 
<p>I was hoping to get to this before writing up my progress in these weeknotes, but it looks like it's going to be quite a challenge.</p>
<p>In order to produce an installable macOS app (I'll dive into Windows later) I need to do the following:</p>
 
 Build a standalone Datasette executable, complete with the custom plugin, using PyInstaller 
 Sign that binary with an Apple developer certificate 
 Build an Electron application that bundles a copy of that <code>datasette</code> binary 
 Sign the resulting Electron application 
 
<p>I'm expecting figuring this out to be a long-winded and frustrating experience, which is more the fault of Apple than of Electron. I'm tracking my progress on this in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/issues/7">issue #7</a>.</p>
 Datasette 0.59a2 
<p>I pushed out <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.59a2">a new alpha</a> of Datasette earlier this week, partly driven by work I was doing on <code>datasette.app</code>.</p>
<p>The biggest new feature in this release is a new plugin hook: <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-register-commands">register_commands()</a> - which lets plugins add additional commands to Datasette, e.g. <code>datasette verify name-of-file.db</code>.</p>
<p>I released a new plugin that exercises this hook called <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-verify">datasette-verify</a>. Past experience has shown me that it's crucial to ship an example plugin alongside a new hook, to help confirm that the hook design is fit for purpose.</p>
<p>It turns out I didn't need this for <code>datasette.app</code> after all, but it's still a great capability to have!</p>
 sqlite-utils 3.17 
<p>Quoting the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-17">release notes</a> in full:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 The <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-memory">sqlite-utils memory</a> command has a new <code>--analyze</code> option, which runs the equivalent of the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-analyze-tables">analyze-tables</a> command directly against the in-memory database created from the incoming CSV or JSON data. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/320">#320</a>) 
 
<a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-insert-files">sqlite-utils insert-files</a> now has the ability to insert file contents in to <code>TEXT</code> columns in addition to the default <code>BLOB</code>. Pass the <code>--text</code> option or use <code>content_text</code> as a column specifier. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/319">#319</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
 evernote-to-sqlite 0.3.2 
<p>As a follow-up to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/22/weeknotes-dogsheep/">last week's work</a> on my personal Dogsheep, I decided to re-import my Evernote notes... and found out that Evernote has changed their export mechanism in ways that broke my tool. Most concerningly their exported XML is <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/evernote-to-sqlite/issues/13">even less well-formed than it used to be</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/evernote-to-sqlite/releases/tag/0.3.2">new release</a> works around that.</p>

  <p>GitHub repository templates were <a href="https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/">introduced a couple of years ago</a> to provide a mechanism for creating a brand new GitHub repository starting with an initial set of files.</p>
<p>They have one big limitation: the repositories that they create share the exact same contents as the template repository. They're basically a replacement for duplicating an existing folder and using that as the starting point for a new project.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the Python <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/">cookiecutter</a> tool, which provides a way to dynamically create new folder structures from user-provided variables using Jinja templates to generate content.</p>
<p>This morning, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template">this repo</a> by Bruno Rocha, I finally figured out a neat pattern for combining cookiecutter with repository templates to compensate for that missing dynamic content ability.</p>
<p>The result: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository">datasette-plugin-template-repository</a> for creating new Datasette plugins with a single click, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository">python-lib-template-repository</a> for creating new Python libraries and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository">click-app-template-repository</a> for creating Click CLI tools.</p>
 Cookiecutter 
<p>I maintain three cookiecutter templates at the moment:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">simonw/datasette-plugin</a>, for creating new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html">Datasette plugins</a>. I've used that one for dozens of plugins myself. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">simonw/click-app</a>, which generates a skeleton for a new <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click-based</a> command-line tool. Many of my <a href="https://datasette.io/tools?q=to-sqlite">x-to-sqlite</a> tools were built using this. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib">simonw/python-lib</a>, for generating general-purpose Python libraries. 
 
<p>Having installed cookiecutter (<code>pip install cookiecutter</code>) each of these can be used like so:</p>
 <code>% cookiecutter gh:simonw/datasette-plugin
plugin_name []: visualize counties
description []: Datasette plugin for visualizing counties
hyphenated [visualize-counties]: 
underscored [visualize_counties]: 
github_username []: simonw
author_name []: Simon Willison
include_static_directory []: y
include_templates_directory []: 
</code> 
<p>Cookiecutter prompts for some variables defined in a <code>cookiecutter.json</code> file, then generates the project by evaluating the templates.</p>
<p>The challenge was: how can I run this automatically when a new repository is created from a GitHub repository template? And where can I get those variables from?</p>
 Bruno's trick: a self-rewriting repository 
<p>Bruno has a brilliant trick for getting this to run, exhibited by <a href="https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/blob/cec9c32ba007d633c4b9d26aad67889d1a6a5e9a/.github/workflows/rename_project.yml">this workflow YAML</a>. His workflow starts like this:</p>
  name: Rename the project from template

on: [push]

jobs:
  rename-project:
    if: ${{ github.repository != 'rochacbruno/python-project-template' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
       # ...  
<p>This means that his workflow only runs on copies of the original repository - the workflow is disabled in the template repository itself by that <code>if:</code> condition.</p>
<p>Then at the end of the workflow he does this:</p>
        - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: "Ready to clone and code"
          push_options: --force  
<p>This does a force push to replace the contents of the repository with whatever was generated by the rest of the workflow script!</p>
<p>This trick was exactly what I needed to get cookiecutter to work with repository templates.</p>
 Gathering variables using the GitHub GraphQL API 
<p>All three of my existing cookiecutter templates require the following variables:</p>
 
 A name to use for the generated folder 
 A one-line description to use in the README and in <code>setup.py</code>
 
 The GitHub username of the owner of the package 
 The display name of the owner 
 
<p>I need values for all of these before I can run cookiecutter.</p>
<p>It turns out they are all available from the GitHub GraphQL API, which can be called from the initial workflow copied from the repository template!</p>
<p>Here's the GitHub Actions step that does that:</p>
  - uses: actions/github-script@v4
  id: fetch-repo-and-user-details
  with:
    script: |
      const query = `query($owner:String!, $name:String!) {
        repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
          name
          description
          owner {
            login
            ... on User {
              name
            }
            ... on Organization {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }`;
      const variables = {
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        name: context.repo.repo
      }
      const result = await github.graphql(query, variables)
      console.log(result)
      return result  
<p>Here I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/actions/github-script">actions/github-script</a> action, which provides a pre-configured, authenticated instance of GitHub's <a href="https://octokit.github.io/rest.js">octokit/rest.js</a> JavaScript library. You can then provide custom JavaScript that will be executed by the action.</p>
<p><code>await github.graphql(query, variables)</code> can then execute a GitHub GraphQL query. The query I'm using here gives me back the currenty repository's <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> and the <code>login</code> and display name of the owner of that repository.</p>
<p>GitHub repositories can be owned by either a user or an organization - the <code>... on User</code> / <code>... on Organization</code> syntax provides the same result here for both types of nested object.</p>
<p>The output of this GraphQL query looks something like this:</p>
  {
  "repository": {
    "name": "datasette-verify",
    "description": "Verify that files can be opened by Datasette",
    "owner": {
      "login": "simonw",
      "name": "Simon Willison"
    }
  }
}  
<p>I assigned an <code>id</code> of <code>fetch-repo-and-user-details</code> to that step of the workflow, so that the <code>return</code> value from the script could be accessed as JSON in the next step.</p>
 Passing those variables to cookiecutter 
<p>Cookiecutter defaults to asking for variables interactively, but it also supports passing in those variables as command-line parameters.</p>
<p>Here's part of my next workflow steps that executes cookiecutter using the variables collected by the GraphQL query:</p>
  - name: Rebuild contents using cookiecutter
  env:
    INFO: ${{ steps.fetch-repo-and-user-details.outputs.result }}
  run: |
    export REPO_NAME=$(echo $INFO | jq -r '.repository.name')
    # Run cookiecutter
    cookiecutter gh:simonw/python-lib --no-input \
      lib_name=$REPO_NAME \
      description="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.description)" \
      github_username="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.login)" \
      author_name="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.name)"  
<p>The <code>env: INFO:</code> block exposes an environment variable called <code>INFO</code> to the step, populated with the output of the previous <code>fetch-repo-and-user-details</code> step - a string of JSON.</p>
<p>Then within the body of the step I use <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> to extract out the details that I need - first the repository name:</p>
 <code>export REPO_NAME=$(echo $INFO | jq -r '.repository.name')
</code> 
<p>Then I pass the other details directly to cookiecutter as arguments:</p>
 <code>cookiecutter gh:simonw/python-lib --no-input \
  lib_name=$REPO_NAME \
  description="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.description)" \
  github_username="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.login)" \
  author_name="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.name)"
</code> 
<p><code>jq -r</code> ensures that the raw text value is returned by <code>jq</code>, as opposed to the JSON string value which would be wrapped in double quotes.</p>
 Cleaning up at the end 
<p>Running cookiecutter in this way creates a folder within the root of the repository that duplicates the repository name, something like this:</p>
 <code>datasette-verify/datasette-verify
</code> 
<p>I actually want the contents of that folder to live in the root, so the next step I run is:</p>
 <code>mv $REPO_NAME/* .
mv $REPO_NAME/.gitignore .
mv $REPO_NAME/.github .
</code> 
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository/blob/45869a9156aa3c2ab95bf1b985151d1d51719c1f/.github/workflows/cookiecutter.yml">my completed workflow</a>.</p>
<p>This almost worked - but when I tried to run it for the first time I got this error:</p>
<p><code>![remote rejected] (refusing to allow an integration to create or update .github/workflows/publish.yml)</code></p>
<p>It turns out the credentials provided to GitHub Actions are forbidden from making modifications to their own workflow files!</p>
<p>I can understand why that limitation is in place, but it's frustrating here. For the moment, my workaround is to do this just before pushing the final content back to the repository:</p>
 <code>mv .github/workflows .github/rename-this-to-workflows
</code> 
<p>I leave it up to the user to rename that folder back again when they want to enable the workflows that have been generated for them.</p>
 Give these a go 
<p>I've set up two templates using this pattern now:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository">datasette-plugin-template-repository</a> for creating new Datasette plugins - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository/generate">use this template</a>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository">python-lib-template-repository</a> for creating new Python libraries - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository/generate">use this template</a>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository">click-app-template-repository</a> for creating new Python Click CLI tools - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository/generate">use this template</a>
 
 
<p>Both of these work the same way: enter a repository name and description, click "Create repository from template" and watch as GitHub copies the new repository and then, a few seconds later, runs the workflow to execute the cookiecutter template to replace the contents with the final result.</p>
<p>You can see examples of repositories that I created using these templates here:</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">Working with Postgres types</a> I showed an example of a materialized view that depends on a typed set-returning function. Because Postgres knows about that dependency, it won’t allow DROP FUNCTION foo. Instead it requires DROP FUNCTION foo CASCADE.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens with materialized views that depend on tables or other materialized views. Let’s build a cascade of views and consider the implications.</p>
 create materialized view v1 as (
  select 
    1 as number,
    'note_count' as label 
);
SELECT 1

select * from v1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count
 
<p>Actually, before continuing the cascade, let’s linger here for a moment. This is a table-like object created without using CREATE TABLE and without explicitly specifying types. But Postgres knows the types.</p>
 \d v1;

Materialized view "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>The read-only view can become a read-write table like so.</p>
 create table t1 as (select * from v1);
SELECT 1

select * from t1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count

\d t1

Table "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>This ability to derive a table from a materialized view will come in handy later. It’s also just interesting to see how the view’s implicit types become explicit in the table.</p>
<p>OK, let’s continue the cascade.</p>
 create materialized view v2 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v1
);
SELECT 1

select * from v2;

number | label
-------+-------
     2 | note_count

create materialized view v3 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v2
);
SELECT 1

select * from v3;

number | label
-------+-------
     3 | note_count
 
<p>Why do this? Arguably you shouldn’t. Laurenz Albe makes that case in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tracking-view-dependencies-in-postgresql/">Tracking view dependencies in PostgreSQL</a>. Recognizing that it’s sometimes useful, though, he goes on to provide code that can track recursive view dependencies. </p>
<p>I use cascading views advisedly to augment the use of CTEs and functions described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">Postgres functional style</a>. Views that refine views can provide a complementary form of the chunking that aids reasoning in an analytics system. But that’s a topic for another episode. In this episode I’ll describe a problem that arose in a case where there’s only a single level of dependency from a table to a set of dependent materialized views, and discuss my solution to that probem.</p>
<p>Here’s the setup. We have an annotation table that’s reloaded nightly. On an internal dashboard we have a chart based on the materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year which is derived from the annotation table and, as its name suggests, reports annotation counts on a monthly cycle. At the beginning of the nightly load, this happens: DROP TABLE annotation CASCADE. So the derived view gets dropped and needs to be recreated as part of the nightly process. But that’s a lot of unnecessary work for a chart that only changes monthly.</p>
<p>Here are two ways to protect a view from a cascading drop of the table it depends on. Both reside in a SQL script, monthly.sql, that only runs on the first of every month. First, annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year.</p>
 drop materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year;
create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with last_days as (
    select 
      last_days_of_prior_months( 
        date(last_month_date() - interval '6 year')
      ) as last_day
    ),
    monthly_counts as (
      select
        to_char(last_day, '_YYYY-MM') as end_of_month,
        anno_count_between( 
          date(last_day - interval '1 month'), last_day
        ) as monthly_annos
      from last_days
    )
    select
      end_of_month,
      monthly_annos,
      sum(monthly_annos) over 
        (order by end_of_month asc rows 
           between unbounded preceding and current row
        ) as cumulative_annos
    from monthly_counts
) with data;
 
<p>Because this view depends indirectly on the annotation table  — by way of the function anno_count_between — Postgres doesn’t see the dependency. So the view isn’t affected by the cascading drop of the annotation table. It persists until, once a month, it gets dropped and recreated.</p>
<p>What if you want Postgres to know about such a dependency, so that the view will participate in a cascading drop? You can do this.</p>
 create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with depends as (
    select * from annotation limit 1
  )
  last_days as (
    ),
  monthly_counts as (
    )
  select
    *
  from monthly_counts;
 
<p>The depends CTE doesn’t do anything relevant to the query, it just tells Postgres that this view depends on the annotation table.</p>
<p>Here’s another way to protect a view from a cascading drop. This expensive-to-build view depends directly on the annotation table but only needs to be updated monthly. So in this case, cumulative_annotations is a table derived from a temporary materialized view.</p>
 create materialized view _cumulative_annotations as (
  with data as (
    select 
      to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM') as created
    from annotation
    group by created
  ) 
  select 
    data.created, 
    sum(data.count) 
      over ( 
        order by data.created asc 
        rows between unbounded preceding and current row
      )
    from data
    group by data.created 
    order by data.created 

drop table cumulative_annotations;

create table cumulative_annotations as (
  select * from _cumulative_annotations
);

drop materialized view _cumulative_annotations;
 
<p>The table cumulative_annotations is only rebuilt once a month. It depends indirectly on the annotation table but Postgres doesn’t see that, so doesn’t include it in the cascading drop.</p>
<p>Here’s the proof.</p>
 -- create a table
create table t1 (number int);

insert into t1 (number) values (1);
INSERT 0 1

select * from t1;

number
-------
     1

-- derive a view from t1
create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

select * from v1

number
-------
     1

-- try to drop t1
drop table t1;

ERROR: cannot drop table t1 because other objects depend on it
DETAIL: materialized view v1 depends on table t1
HINT: Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.

-- derive an independent table from t1 by way of a matview
drop materialized view v1;

create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

create table t2 as (select * from v1);
SELECT 1

-- drop the matview
drop materialized view v1;

-- drop t1
drop table t1;

-- no complaint, and t2 still exists
select * from t2;

number
-------
     1
 
<p>These are two ways I’ve found to protect a long-lived result set from the cascading drop of a short-lived table on which it depends. You can hide the dependency behind a function, or you can derive an independent table by way of a transient materialized view. I use them interchangeably, and don’t have a strong preference one way or another. Both lighten the load on the analytics server. Materialized views (or tables) that only need to change weekly or monthly, but were being dropped nightly by cascade from core tables, are now recreated only on their appropriate weekly or monthly cycles.</p>

<p>In this series I’m exploring how to work in a code base that lives in two places: Metabase questions that encapsulate chunks of SQL, and Postgres functions/procedures/views that also encapsulate chunks of SQL. To be effective working with this hybrid collection of SQL chunks, I needed to reason about their interrelationships. One way to do that entailed the creation of a documentation generator that writes a concordance of callers and callees.</p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function sparklines_for_guid(_guid).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The called by column says that this function is called from two different contexts. One is a Metabase question, All courses: Weekly activity. If you’re viewing that question in Metabase, you’ll find that its SQL text is simply this:</p>
 select * from sparklines_for_guid( {{guid}} )
 
<p>The same function call appears in a procedure, cache warmer, that preemptively memoizes the function for a set of the most active schools in the system. In either case, you can look up the function in the concordance, view its definition, and review how it’s called.</p>
<p>In the definition of sparkline_for_guid, names of other functions (like guid_hashed_view_exists) appear and are linked to their definitions. Similarly, names of views appearing in SELECT or JOIN contexts are linked to their definitions. </p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function guid_hashed_view_exists. It is called by sparklines_for_guid as well as by functions that drive panels on the school dashboard. It links to the functions it uses: hash_for_guid and exists_view. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the view lms_course_groups which appears as a JOIN target in sparklines_for_guid. This central view is invoked — in SELECT or JOIN context — from many functions, from dependent views, and from Metabase questions. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Metabase questions can also “call” other Metabase questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted: “Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries.” Here’s an example of that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Metabase question (985) calls various linked functions, and is called by two other Metabase questions. Here is one of those.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because this Metabase question (600) emits an URL that refers to 985, it links to the definition of 985. It also links to the view, top_annotated_domains_last_week, from which it SELECTs.</p>
<p>It was straightforward to include Postgres functions, views, and procedures in the concordance since these live in files that reside in the fileystem under source control. Metabase questions, however, live in a database — in our case, a Postgres database that’s separate from our primary Postgres analytics db. In order to extract them into a file I use this SQL snippet.</p>
 select
  r.id,
  m.name as dbname,
  r.name,
  r.description,
  r.dataset_query
from report_card r
join metabase_database m
  on m.id = cast(r.dataset_query::jsonb-&gt;&gt;'database' as int)
where not r.archived
order by r.id;
 
<p>The doc generator downloads that Metabase data as a CSV file, queries.csv, and processes it along with the files that contain the definitions of functions, procedures, and views in the Postgres data warehouse. It also emits queries.txt which is a more convenient way to diff changes from one commit to the next. </p>
<p>This technique solved a couple of problems. First, when we were only using Metabase — unaugmented by anything in Postgres — it enabled us to put our Metabase SQL under source control and helped us visualize relationships among queries.</p>
<p>Later, as we augmented Metabase with Postgres functions, procedures, and views, it became even more powerful. Developing a new panel for a school or course dashboard means writing a new memoized function. That process begins as a Metabase question with SQL code that calls existing Postgres functions, and/or JOINs/SELECTs FROM existing Postgres views. Typically it then leads to the creation of new supporting Postgres functions and/or views. All this can be tested by internal users, or even invited external users, in Metabase, with the concordance available to help understand the relationships among the evolving set of functions and views.</p>
<p>When supporting functions and views are finalized, the SQL content of the Metabase question gets wrapped up in a memoized Postgres function that’s invoked from a panel of a dashboard app. At that point the concordance links the new wrapper function to the same set of supporting functions and views. I’ve found this to be an effective way to reason about a hybrid code base as features move from Metabase for prototyping to Postgres in production, while maintaining all the code under source control.</p>
<p>That foundation of source control is necessary, but maybe not sufficient, for a team to consider this whole approach viable. The use of two complementary languages for in-database programming will certainly raise eyebrows, and if it’s not your cup of tea I completely understand. If you do find it appealing, though, one thing you’ll wonder about next will be tooling. I work in VSCode nowadays, for which I’ve not yet found a useful extension for pl/pgsql or pl/python. With <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/13/pl-python-metaprogramming/">metaprogramming</a> life gets even harder for aspiring pl/pgsql or pl/python VSCode extensions. I can envision them, but I’m not holding my breath awaiting them. Meanwhile, two factors enable VSCode to be helpful even without deep language-specific intelligence.</p>
<p>The first factor, and by far the dominant one, is outlining. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2019/09/05/products-and-capabilities/">Products and capabilities</a> I reflect on how I’ve never adopted an outlining product, but often rely on outlining capability infused into a product. In VSCode that’s “only” basic indentation-driven folding and unfolding. But I find it works remarkably well across SQL queries, views and functions that embed them, CTEs that comprise them, and pl/pgsql or pl/python functions called by them. </p>
<p>The second factor, nascent thus far, is GitHub Copilot. It’s a complementary kind of language intelligence that’s aware of, but not bounded by, what a file extension of .sql or .py implies. It can sometimes discern patterns that mix language syntaxes and offer helpful suggestions. That hasn’t happened often so far, but it’s striking when it does. I don’t yet know the extent to which it may be <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/11/working-with-intelligent-machines/">training me while I train it</a>, or how those interactions might influence others. At this point I’m not a major Copilot booster, but I am very much an interested observer of and participant in the experiment.</p>
<p>All in all, I’m guardedly optimistic that existing or feasible tooling can enable individuals and teams to sanely navigate the hybrid corpus of source code discussed in this series. If you’re along for the ride, you’ll next wonder about debugging and monitoring a system built this way. That’s a topic for a future episode.</p>
