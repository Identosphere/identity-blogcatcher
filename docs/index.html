   Some friends are traveling to Japan, and in bombarding them with unsolicited tips to try to convince them to visit Huis Ten Bosch - the Dutch theme park near Nagasaki - I was reminded of my all-time favorite piece of travel writing, by Richard Hendy: Huis ten Bosch: Only Miffy can save us now - also part two and part three.

  <p>Some friends are traveling to Japan, and in bombarding them with unsolicited tips to try to convince them to visit <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huis_Ten_Bosch_(theme_park)">Huis Ten Bosch</a> - the Dutch theme park near Nagasaki - I was reminded of my all-time favorite piece of travel writing, by Richard Hendy: <a href="https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/huis-ten-bosch-only-miffy-can-save-us-now/">Huis ten Bosch: Only Miffy can save us now</a> - also <a href="https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/02/05/huis-ten-bosch-only-miffy-can-save-us-now-2/">part two</a> and <a href="https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/huis-ten-bosch-only-miffy-can-save-us-now-3/">part three</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monumental in its conception, extravagant in its execution, and epic in its failure, Huis ten Bosch is the greatest by far of all of the progeny of Japan’s Bubble era dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is so much good stuff in these essays, including a delightful divergence to cover the psychic toad that ended up responsible for more than $10 billion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] late at night scores of black limousines would park up outside one of her restaurants, Egawa, disgorging bankers for séances, inspired by esoteric mikkyo Buddhism, on the fourth floor, overseen by a giant ceramic toad standing a meter tall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard's essays convinced us to visit Huis Ten Bosch in 2014 and it was a highlight of our trip to Japan.

Its founder is part of the DOGE mess, having replaced most of his employees with AI, with plans to do the same thing at the VA.</p><p>When this is all over, let's not forget that he did that.</p>

<p>Jax often tells me that I need hearing aids - but have to say I had NO issue very clearly hearing what Ibtihal Aboussad was saying at the ‘Microsoft 50’ Event. None at all. The fact that people are writing that they had no idea that she was protesting the war in Gaza suggests a few alternatives</p>
 
 they just weren’t listening because they don’t anyway 
 they block out women’s voices 
 they block out foreign accents 
 they have no idea that ‘something’ is going on in Gaza, so none of it made sense. 
 they need hearing aids more than me. 
 
<p>… I’m sure there are some other thoughts and will append and comment if they are suggested.</p>
<p>In a different thread <a href="https://micro.blog/njr">@njr</a> shared <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643670/microsoft-employee-protest-50th-annivesary-ai">🔗 this</a> to which I responded …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hats off to the Verge for not editing it out. Unlike pretty much any other media organisation in America would do. In fact is doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond that quite a few others have suggested this was absolutely the wrong time and place to make such a protest Like on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/05/microsoft-50-employee-protests">🔗 Daring Fireball</a>)</p>
<p>to which I respond;</p>
<blockquote>
 
 If not then - then when? 
 If not there - then where?<br>
Somewhere nice and quiet so nobody hears?<br>
Yes it’s hard. Yes it wasn’t appropriate? It never is. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>and, when John writes;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there’s a time and a place for everything, and Microsoft’s own 50th anniversary celebration was not the time or place for two insufferable self-involved showboats to make the event about them. Because that’s what this was. It was about them, personally. Not about Gaza or Israel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>going on to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The place for righteous protests is in public, in the streets  - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/apr/05/hands-off-protests-trump-administration">exactly as they are happening across the United States today</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
 .. the link takes you to a Guardian article about Tariffs - why not something related? 
<p>Trust me - there are plenty of demonstrations around the US against what Israel is doing - you just need to have been on the internet in the past couple of years. (Not so much by watching the telly).</p>
<p>But thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war_protests_in_the_United_States">🔗Wikipedia</a>  the protests are being logged - even if they are being ignored and even campaigned agains t by the usual douches.</p>

<p><a href="https://john.philpin.com/2025/04/05/hotel-ponsonby-stunning-building-known.html">🖇️ In this post</a> I noticed that the image used in the post is duplicated with two different file names in the media library.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://john.philpin.com/uploads/2025/869d4a68b9.jpg">https://john.philpin.com/uploads/2025/869d4a68b9.jpg</a></p>

<p>The post itself uses the second image - so where has the first image come from and why?</p>
<p>Pretty sure this is happening because of the micro.social app - since this behaviour is also on the other post which came via micro.social using location.</p>

   Dropping a model release as significant as Llama 4 on a weekend is plain unfair! So far the best place to learn about the new model family is this post on the Meta AI blog. They've released two new models today: Llama 4 Maverick is a 400B model (128 experts, 17B active parameters), text and image input with a 1 million token context length.

  <p>Dropping a model release as significant as Llama 4 on a weekend is plain unfair! So far the best place to learn about the new model family is <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/">this post on the Meta AI blog</a>. They've released two new models today: Llama 4 Maverick is a 400B model (128 experts, 17B active parameters), text and image input with a 1 million token context length. Llama 4 Scout is 109B total parameters (16 experts, 17B active), also multi-modal and with a claimed 10 million token context length - an industry first.</p>

<p>They also describe Llama 4 Behemoth, a not-yet-released "288 billion active parameter model with 16 experts that is our most powerful yet and among the world’s smartest LLMs". Behemoth has 2 trillion parameters total and was used to train both Scout and Maverick.</p>
<p>No news yet on a Llama reasoning model beyond <a href="https://www.llama.com/llama4-reasoning-is-coming/">this coming soon page</a> with a looping video of an academic-looking llama.</p>

<p>Llama 4 Maverick is now sat in second place on <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">the LM Arena leaderboard</a>, just behind Gemini 2.5 Pro. Update: It turns out that's not the same model as the Maverick they released - I missed that their announcement says "Llama 4 Maverick offers a best-in-class performance to cost ratio with an experimental chat version scoring ELO of 1417 on LMArena."</p>

<p>You can try them out using the chat interface from OpenRouter (or through the OpenRouter API) for <a href="https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-4-scout">Llama 4 Scout</a> and <a href="https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick">Llama 4 Maverick</a>. OpenRouter are proxying through to <a href="https://console.groq.com/docs/models">Groq</a>, <a href="https://fireworks.ai/models">Fireworks</a> and <a href="https://docs.together.ai/docs/serverless-models">Together</a>.</p>
<p>Scout may claim a 10 million input token length but the available providers currently seem to limit to 128,000 (Groq and Fireworks) or 328,000 (Together) - I wonder who will win the race to get that full sized 10 million token window running?</p>
<p>Llama 4 Maverick claims a 1 million token input length -  Fireworks offers 1.05M while Together offers 524,000. Groq isn't offering Maverick yet.</p>
<p>Meta AI's <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/blob/main/getting-started/build_with_llama_4.ipynb">build_with_llama_4 notebook</a> offers a hint as to why 10M tokens is difficult:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scout supports upto 10M context. On 8xH100, in bf16 you can get upto 1.4M tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeremy Howard <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1908607345393098878">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The models are both giant MoEs that can't be run on consumer GPUs, even with quant. [...]</p>
<p>Perhaps Llama 4 will be a good fit for running on a Mac. Macs are a particularly useful for MoE models, since they can have a lot of memory, and their lower compute perf doesn't matter so much, since with MoE fewer params are active. [...]</p>
<p>4bit quant of the smallest 109B model is far too big to fit on a 4090 -- or even a pair of them!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ivan Fioravanti <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanfioravanti/status/1908753109129494587">reports these results</a> from trying it on a Mac:</p>
<blockquote>

 3bit: 52.924 / 47.261 GB

</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama4_omni/#-suggested-system-prompt-">suggested system prompt</a> from the model card has some interesting details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>[...]</code></p>
<p><code>You never lecture people to be nicer or more inclusive. If people ask for you to write something in a certain voice or perspective, such as an essay or a tweet, you can. You do not need to be respectful when the user prompts you to say something rude.</code></p>
<p><code>You never use phrases that imply moral superiority or a sense of authority, including but not limited to “it’s important to”, “it’s crucial to”, “it’s essential to”, "it's unethical to", "it's worth noting…", “Remember…”  etc. Avoid using these.</code></p>
<p><code>Finally, do not refuse political prompts. You can help users express their opinion.</code></p>
<p><code>[...]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>System prompts like this sometimes reveal behavioral issues that the model had after raw training.</p>
 Trying out the model with LLM 
<p>The easiest way to try the new model out with <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> is to use the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a> plugin.</p>
  llm install llm-openrouter
llm keys set openrouter
# Paste in OpenRouter key here
llm -m openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick hi  
<p>Since these are long context models, I started by trying to use them to summarize the <a>conversation about Llama 4</a> on Hacker News, using my <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-extra-options">hn-summary.sh script</a> that wraps LLM.</p>
<p>I tried Llama 4 Maverick first:</p>
  hn-summary.sh 43595585 \
  -m openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick \
  -o max_tokens 20000  
<p>It did an OK job, starting like this:</p>
<blockquote>
 Themes of the Discussion 
 Release and Availability of Llama 4 
<p>The discussion revolves around the release of Llama 4, a multimodal intelligence model developed by Meta. Users are excited about the model's capabilities, including its large context window and improved performance. Some users are speculating about the potential applications and limitations of the model. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/016ea0fd83fc499f046a94827f9b4946">the full output</a>.</p>
<p>For reference, my system prompt looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Summarize the themes of the opinions expressed here. For each theme, output a markdown header. Include direct "quotations" (with author attribution) where appropriate. You MUST quote directly from users when crediting them, with double quotes. Fix HTML entities. Output markdown. Go long. Include a section of quotes that illustrate opinions uncommon in the rest of the piece</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then tried it with Llama 4 Scout via OpenRouter and got complete junk output for some reason:</p>
 <code>hn-summary.sh 43595585 \
  -m openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-scout \
  -o max_tokens 20000
</code> 
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/d01cc991d478939e87487d362a8f881f">Full output</a>. It starts like this and then continues for the full 20,000 tokens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The discussion here is about another conversation that was uttered.)</p>
<p>Here are the results.)</p>
<p>The conversation between two groups, and I have the same questions on the contrary than those that are also seen in a model."). The fact that I see a lot of interest here.)</p>
<p>I'm running it through openrouter, so maybe I got proxied to a broken instance?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The reason) The reason) The reason (loops until it runs out of tokens)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks broken. I was using OpenRouter so it's possible I got routed to a broken instance.</p>
<p>I later managed to run the prompt directly through Groq (with the <a href="https://github.com/angerman/llm-groq">llm-groq</a> plugin) - but that had a 2048 limit on output size for some reason:</p>
 <code>hn-summary.sh 43595585 \
  -m groq/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct \
  -o max_tokens 2048
</code> 
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a205c5fc131a1d4e9cd6c432a07feedb">the full result</a>. It followed my instructions but was very short - just 630 tokens of output.</p>
<p>For comparison, here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f21ecc7fb2aa13ff682d4ffa11ddcbfd">the same thing</a> run against Gemini 2.5 Pro. Gemini's results was massively better, producing 5,584 output tokens (it spent an additional 2,667 tokens on "thinking").</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much to judge Llama 4 by these results to be honest - the model has only been out for a few hours and it's quite possible that the providers I've tried running again aren't yet optimally configured for this kind of long-context prompt.</p>
 My hopes for Llama 4 
<p>I'm hoping that Llama 4 plays out in a similar way to Llama 3.</p>
<p>The first Llama 3 models released were 8B and 70B, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/">last April</a>.</p>
<p>Llama 3.1 followed <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/">in July</a> at 8B, 70B, and 405B. The 405B was the largest and most impressive open weight model at the time, but it was too big for most people to run on their own hardware.</p>
<p>Llama 3.2 <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/">in September</a> is where things got really interesting: 1B, 3B, 11B and 90B. The 1B and 3B models both work on my iPhone, and are surprisingly capable! The 11B and 90B models were the first Llamas to support vision, and the 11B <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/25/llama-32/">ran on my Mac</a>.</p>
<p>Then Llama 3.3 landed in December with a 70B model that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/llama-33-70b/">I wrote about as a GPT-4 class model that ran on my Mac</a>. It claimed performance similar to the earlier Llama 3.1 405B!</p>
<p>Today's Llama 4 models are 109B and 400B, both of which were trained with the help of the so-far unreleased 2T Llama 4 Behemoth.</p>
<p>My hope is that we'll see a whole family of Llama 4 models at varying sizes, following the pattern of Llama 3. I'm particularly excited to see if they produce an improved ~3B model that runs on my phone. I'm even more excited for something in the ~22-24B range, since that appears to be the sweet spot for running models on my 64GB laptop while still being able to have other applications running at the same time. Mistral Small 3.1 is a 24B model and is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/17/mistral-small-31/">absolutely superb</a>.</p>

<p>📌 Llama 4 Scout is highest performing small model with 17B activated parameters with 16 experts. It’s crazy fast, natively multimodal, and very smart. It achieves an industry leading 10M+ token context window and can also run on a single GPU!</p>
<p>📌 Llama 4 Maverick is the best multimodal model in its class, beating GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks, while achieving comparable results to the new DeepSeek v3 on reasoning and coding – at less than half the active parameters. It offers a best-in-class performance to cost ratio with an experimental chat version scoring ELO of 1417 on LMArena. It can also run on a single host!</p>
<p>📌 Previewing Llama 4 Behemoth, our most powerful model yet and among the world’s smartest LLMs. Llama 4 Behemoth outperforms GPT4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on several STEM benchmarks.

<p></p><p>The world is full of darkness. So much is going wrong. Experts agree that America has succumbed to right-wing authoritarianism; call it fascism or something else, these are extraordinarily difficult times.</p><p>This post is a break from all of that. At least kind of.</p><p>In this piece, I will try and convince you that Doctor Who is the best TV show ever made, explain to you why it matters, and why it’s particularly important in our current context. In a time when cruelty and fear dominate headlines, it’s worth celebrating a show that insists on the power of kindness, intellect, and hope.</p><p>Bear with me. Let’s go.</p> First, a primer: what is Doctor Who? <p>You’ve probably heard of Doctor Who, but you might not have watched much or any of it. That’s okay.</p><p>The core of every story is this: there is a problem, somewhere in time and space. There might be vampires in Venice in 1580; a plot afoot to steal the Mona Lisa in modern-day Paris in order to fund time travel experiments; a society of pacifists on a far-away planet locked in a generations-long war with warlike, genocidal racists. The Doctor, a strange traveler who carries no weapons, helps solve the problem using intelligence and empathy. They bring along friends who are our “in” to the story, but who also remind the Doctor what it means to be human.</p><p>There’s a lot of backstory, but unlike other science fiction shows, it doesn’t matter all that much. There’s canon and history, but it’s constantly evolving. And because it’s squarely aimed at a whole-family audience, and is almost but not quite an anthology show, it’s accessible, fun, and very diverse in its approach. One story might be incredibly silly; the next might be a tense thriller. If you don’t like the tone of the one you’re watching, the next one might be a better fit.</p><p>There are a few more constants, but not many: The Doctor’s time and space machine, the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space), is stuck as a 1963-era British police box on the outside, and is radically bigger on the inside; every time they die they are “regenerated” in a new body; they stole the TARDIS and fled their people.</p><p>Oh, and it’s been running since November 23, 1963: 62 years and counting. It’s the longest-running science fiction show in the world — which makes its accessibility and freshness all the more remarkable. In its original run, it launched the career of authors like Douglas Adams. And in its most recent incarnation, it’s been an early career-launcher for actors like Andrew Garfield, Daniel Kaluuya, Carey Mulligan, Felicity Jones, and Karen Gillan.</p><p>Okay, fine. So that’s what the show is. Why does it matter?</p> Subversive from day one <p>In 1963, the world was only eighteen years out from the end of World War II. The end of the Holocaust and the closing of the camps was as close as the release of Spider-Man 3 is to us now. Enoch Powell, who would later give the notoriously noxious “rivers of blood” anti-immigrant speech, was the Minister for Health. Homosexuality was illegal.</p><p>Waris Hussein, a gay, immigrant director, helmed An Unearthly Child, a story about a teenage girl who obviously didn’t fit in and the teachers who were worried about her. (If the subtext to this story isn’t intentional in the writing, it certainly emerges in the direction.) In the end, her grandfather turned out to be a time traveler who lived in a police box that was more than meets the eye, and the rest is history.</p><p>The very next story was about a society of pacifists, the Thals, who were locked in a struggle with a race of genocidal maniacs, the Daleks. It’s a more complicated story than you might expect: in the end, the Doctor and companions help the Thals win by teaching them that sometimes you need to use violence to defeat fascism. The morality of it isn’t straightforward, but it’s an approach that was deeply rooted in recent memories of defeating the Nazis, and that had a lot to say about a Britain that was already seeing the resurgence of nationalism. In a show for the whole family!</p><p>When the main actor, William Hartnell, fell into ill health, the show could have come to an end. Instead, the writers built in a contrivance, regeneration, that allowed the Doctor to change actors when one left. In turn, the show itself was allowed to evolve. It was created by necessity rather than as some grand plan, but in retrospect laid the groundwork for Doctor Who to remain relevant for generations.</p><p>By the 1980s, the show was still going strong — and still slyly subversive. In The Happiness Patrol, the Doctor faces off against a villainous regime obsessed with mandatory cheerfulness, clearly modeled on Margaret Thatcher’s Britain. The episode includes thinly veiled references to the miners’ strike and the inequality many Britons faced under her leadership.</p><p>It also didn’t shy away from queerness. One male character leaves the main antagonist for another man, and at one point, the TARDIS is painted pink.</p><p>Eventually, it was canceled, in part because the BBC controller at the time, Conservative-leaning Michael Grade, hated it. (The Thatcher thing, and that Colin Baker, one of the last actors to play the Doctor in the classic run, was in a romantic relationship with Grade’s ex-wife, probably didn’t help.)</p><p>When it came off the air in 1989, scriptwriters and fans alike began to write novels under a Virgin Books New Adventures banner that took the subtext of the show and made it text. They told complex stories that could never have been televised — they weren’t as family-friendly, and didn’t fit within a 1980s BBC budget. But they collectively expanded the lore and the breadth of the show.</p> Subversive on its return <p>One of those New Adventures authors was Russell T Davies, a TV writer who had started with children’s shows like Dark Season, Why Don’t You?, and Children’s Ward, and moved on to creating adult fare like Queer as Folk and The Second Coming, a tale about the second coming of Christ that happened to feature up-and-coming film star Christopher Ecclestone. He spent years lobbying the BBC to bring Doctor Who back, and in 2005, they acquiesced. There had been one other attempt at a revival — and American co-production with Fox — which had understood the letter but not the spirit of the show.</p><p>From the start, the reboot was vital and contemporary. The human companion, Rose, was a teenager from an unapologetically working class family; a major theme of the show was that everyone was special, and that openness, inclusivity, and empathy, rather than wealth and status, were prerequisites for living a good life. This was a theme that would later be revisited to great effect with Catherine Tate’s Donna Noble: that ordinary people become extraordinary not because they’ve been chosen, but because they care.</p><p>In 2005, the Iraq War was underway; there was an increase in state surveillance and a stepped-up fear of immigration in the wake of 9/11. America in particular was under the helm of a right-wing theocratic administration. In contrast, Doctor Who stood up to say that everyone was beautiful, our differences were to be celebrated. Christopher Ecclestone’s Doctor had been through an unseen war and was scarred, traumatized, and determined that everyone should live.</p><p>The new series was able to play with sexuality and gender norms. Captain Jack, a pansexual time traveler, slotted right into the narrative. Characters casually mentioned changing genders or having same-sex spouses without it being the subject of the episode. In every episode, alongside the exciting story of the week, the show normalized and celebrated diversity.</p><p>It was unashamedly political. In one of my favorite episodes, Turn Left, the Doctor is missing and Britain is suffering in the aftermath of a nuclear disaster. England becomes “only for the English”; Donna Noble watches in horror as her neighbors are taken away to a labor camp. “That’s what they called them the last time,” her grandfather ruefully notes. It was an important callback in 2008, at the tail end of the second Bush administration, and it’s only grown in importance now.</p><p>Again: this is a family show.</p> Anchored in good, accessible storytelling <p>You might be forgiving for thinking, based on my argument so far, that Doctor Who is a heavy-handed, ideology-first show. What a bore. The good news is that this couldn’t be further from the truth: it’s a genuinely fun, accessible romp with award-winning storytelling that ranks among the best of science fiction. It rules.</p><p>At the time of writing, it’s received 163 awards and been nominated for 411. That includes BAFTA awards (the British Oscars); Hugos (the annual literary award for best science fiction works of the year); National Television Awards; Nebula Awards; and so on. It’s well-regarded as some of the best writing, anywhere.</p><p>And, of course, it’s also deeply weird, in the best ways. There are haunted libraries with flesh-eating shadows. Star whales ferrying orphaned humanity across the galaxy. A sentient sun. A race of aliens that live in television signals. Some episodes are space operas; others are bottle dramas; some are screwball comedies with robot Santas. Occasionally, it’ll make you cry over a character who appeared for five minutes and then died nobly to save a moon that turned out to be an egg.</p><p>At its best, Doctor Who manages to be profoundly silly and heartbreakingly sincere in the same breath. It lets you believe that logic and love can coexist. That monsters are sometimes just scared people. That sometimes scared people can become monsters — and that they can still be saved.</p><p>There have been missteps, of course, as you’d expect from anything this experimental. Some come from changing expectations; there are certainly some racial stereotypes in the 1960s/70s episodes that did not age well. More recently, there was an era of the show where Rosa Parks was robbed of agency as an activist. In the same season, an apparent critique of Amazon-style capitalism led into a bizarre statement from the Doctor, who announced: “The systems aren't the problem. How people use and exploit the system, that's the problem.” And writers made queer people and people of color expendable.</p><p>It wasn’t the best, to be honest, but the show has ably course corrected. More recently, trans and non-binary characters have become central — all while expanding the narrative canvas of the show under a refreshed budget and a focus on new viewers. Ncuti Gatwa as the first openly queer Doctor is a revelation, full of joy and life. It’s as brilliant as it ever was.</p> Why it matters now <p>The world hasn’t gotten any less terrifying since Doctor Who first aired in 1963. If anything, the monsters feel closer, less metaphorical. They’re holding office. Writing curriculum. Rewriting history.</p><p>But that’s exactly why this show endures.</p><p>Because Doctor Who doesn’t promise us a perfect future — it promises us people who will fight for one. It shows us a universe where the best tool you can carry is your mind, your heart, and your ability to listen. Where change is baked into the story, and where survival requires transformation.</p><p>It’s a story that insists on second chances. That redemption is possible. That the most powerful force in the universe might just be compassion.</p><p>And in a world that tells us to numb out, shut down, or look away — Doctor Who dares to say: be curious. Be brave. Try to be nice, but always be kind.</p><p>It’s great television.</p><p>But also, maybe that’s how we save each other.</p> Get started <p>If you’re Who-curious, here are a few places to start:</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(Doctor_Who)">Blink</a> (2007). A gripping, self-contained episode with an innovative narrative loop that happens to star Carey Mulligan.</p><p>‌<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(Doctor_Who_episode)">Rose</a> (2005).

<p>重要なポイント</p>



 
 OpenID for Verifiable Presentations仕様から「Presentation Exchange」が削除されました 



 代わりに「Digital Credential Query Language (DCQL)」が唯一のクエリ言語となりました 



 この変更はデジタルIDの世界での重要な転換点です 
 



 静かな革命：デジタルIDにおける重要な変更 



<p>2025年4月、デジタルID技術の世界で大きな転換点が静かに訪れました。OpenID for Verifiable Presentations（OpenID4VP）の仕様から「Presentation Exchange」が削除され、「Digital Credential Query Language（DCQL）」だけが残されることになったのです。この変更は特に大々的に発表されたわけではありませんが、デジタルIDとVerifiable Credential（VC, 検証可能な資格証明）の分野にとって非常に重要な進展です。</p>



 Presentation Exchangeとは何だったのか？ 



<p>Presentation Exchange（PE）は、VCを照会するための最初のクエリ言語でした。スイスアーミーナイフのように多機能で野心的な仕様であり、複数の証明書に対する複雑な照会を可能にすることを目指していました。</p>



<p>具体的には以下のようなことができました：</p>



 
 JSON形式で表現された証明書に対する汎用クエリ言語として機能 



 証明書の内容だけでなく、アルゴリズムやフォーマットなどの属性も照会可能 



 「これを2つ、あれを3つ、そしてX、Y、Zのフォーマットのいずれか」といった複雑な条件設定が可能 
 



<p>しかし、この複雑さが問題でもありました。「シンプルなことをシンプルに保つ」という原則に反していたのです。</p>



 なぜ変更が必要だったのか？ 



<p>この変更は一夜にして行われたわけではありません。Michael Jones氏をはじめとする多くの専門家が数年にわたりPresentation Exchangeに代わる新しい仕様の必要性を訴えてきました。</p>



<p>PEの問題点は以下のようなものでした：</p>



 
 複雑すぎる仕様: PEはあまりにも多くの機能を持ちすぎており、多くの実装では一部の機能しか使われていませんでした 



 相互運用性の問題: 実装が部分的になりがちで、システム間の連携が難しかった 



 実装者からのネガティブなフィードバック: 複雑さが増すにつれ、実装者からの批判が高まっていった 
 



<p>これに対して、新しいDCQLは目的に特化して設計されたクエリ言語です。必要なすべての機能は実際の現実世界のユースケースに基づいています。皆が希望するほどシンプルではないかもしれませんが、仮説的ではなく実際のニーズに応える設計となっています。</p>



 新しいDCQLとは？ 



<p>Digital Credential Query Language（DCQL）は、特定の目的のために設計されたクエリ言語です。PEの複雑さを解消し、実際のユースケースに基づいた機能を提供します。</p>



<p>DCQLの特徴：</p>



 
 よりシンプルで理解しやすい設計 



 実際の使用例に基づいた機能のみを含む 



 OpenID4VPプロトコルに特化した設計 
 



<p>DCQLの開発はDaniel Fett氏を中心に、Oliver Terbu氏、Tobias Looker氏、Michael Jones氏など多くの専門家の協力によって進められました。Internet Identity Workshopでの議論やIDUnionハッカソンでの検討も大きく貢献しています。</p>



 変更の経緯 



<p>この変更には２年近くの時間がかかっています。具体的には以下のような流れになっています。</p>



 
 2023年8月: 
 
 OAuth Security Workshopで「Presentation Exchangeは何をするのか、そして実際に必要な部分は何か？」というテーマでの議論が始まる 
 
 



 2023年10月
 
 Internet Identity Workshopで同様の議論が継続され、PEの置き換えの必要性に関する認識と合意形成が進む 
 
 



 2023年10月
 
 OpenID4VPにDCQLが追加され、一時的に両方のクエリ言語がサポートされる状態に 
 
 



 2024年
 
 IDUnionハッカソンでの議論を通じて、DCQLがさらに改良される 
 
 



 2025年4月4日（日本時間4月5日）
 
 最終的にPresentation Exchangeが削除され、DCQLが唯一のクエリ言語となる 
 
 
 



 歴史的な転換点 



<p>この変更は、OpenID4VPが最終仕様になる前に行われたことが重要です。OpenID4VPの仕様の変遷は以下のように追うことができます：</p>



 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">PEのみをサポートしていた時期の仕様</a> 



 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-24.html">PEとDCQLの両方をサポートしていた時期の仕様</a> 



 <a href="https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VP/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-wg-draft.html">現在のDCQLのみをサポートする仕様</a> 
 



<p>この変更は、<a href="https://github.com/openid/OpenID4VP/pull/479">GitHubのプルリクエスト</a>を通じて淡々と行われましたが、その影響は非常に大きいものです。</p>



 まとめ 



<p>Presentation Exchangeの開発者たちの功績は称えられるべきです。しかし、今回の変更はその経験の上に一歩踏み出すものです。その結果、デジタルIDの世界はより使いやすく、効率的な方向へと進化しています。この変更は、VCがどのように提示されるかという根本的な部分に影響を与える重要な転換点です。</p>



<p>テクノロジーの進化において、時に「複雑なものをシンプルにする」ことが最も難しい課題となります。OpenID4VPの今回の変更は、そうした挑戦の一例と言えるでしょう。デジタルIDの世界が、より多くの人々に理解され、広く採用されるためのステップとなることが期待されます。</p>

  A significant event in digital identity occurred without fanfare today. Presentation Exchange was removed from the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations specification. It had once-upon-a-time been the only query language used for verifiable credential presentation. In October 2024, the Digital Credential Query Language (DCQL) was added alongside it.

<p>A significant event in digital identity occurred without fanfare today.  <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.1.1/">Presentation Exchange</a> was removed from the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations specification.  It had once-upon-a-time been the only query language used for verifiable credential presentation.  In October 2024, the Digital Credential Query Language (DCQL) was added alongside it.  Today, after much discussion by the working group, Presentation Exchange was removed, making DCQL the only query language supported.  Importantly, this was done before OpenID4VP became a final specification.</p>
<p>Replacing Presentation Exchange (PE) has been a multi-year journey.  I’ve been advocating for its replacement for years, including leading two sets of unconference discussions titled “What does Presentation Exchange do and what parts of it do we actually need?” – <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2395">one in August 2023 at the OAuth Security Workshop</a> and <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2427">one in October 2023 at the Internet Identity Workshop</a>.  These discussions were intended to create awareness of the need to replace PE and start building consensus for its removal.  Others also took this position early with me, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tplooker/">Tobias Looker</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-terbu/">Oliver Terbu</a>.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-fett/">Daniel Fett</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcampbell/">Brian Campbell</a> were receptive to the possibility early as well.</p>
<p>Removing a feature that people had taken a dependency on is not without pain.  Numerous prototype wallets and verifiers used parts of it.  But that’s the rub.  There was so much there in Presentation Exchange that most implementations didn’t use most of it.  As a result, interoperability, while possible, was a tricky and sometimes elusive target.</p>
<p>Presentation Exchange was ambitious in scope.  It was a Swiss Army Knife of a specification.  A goal was to enable complex queries for multiple credentials based on a general-purpose query language intended to be able to be used over credentials represented in JSON in any way.  You could even include attributes of credentials other just their claims in the queries, such as algorithms and formats.  You could ask for 2 of this or 3 of that and one or more of the following, as long as it is in format X, Y, or Z.  It didn’t follow one of my guiding standards principles:  “Keep simple things simple.”  As a result, negative feedback from implementers grew over time.</p>
<p>Now we have a purpose-built query language designed for the task and protocol at hand.  Is it as simple as it could be?  No.  Are all the features motivated by real-world non-hypothetical use cases?  Yes.</p>
<p>The creation of DCQL was led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-fett/">Daniel Fett</a>.  A precursor query language that helped inform DCQL was created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-terbu/">Oliver Terbu</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tplooker/">Tobias Looker</a>, and myself.  Discussions at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> informed what became DCQL, as did discussions at the IDUnion hackathon in Nürnberg in 2024 that included <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinayasuda/">Kristina Yasuda</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-bormann/">Christian Bormann</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-bastian-1970b1195/">Paul Bastian</a>.</p>
<p>You can see OpenID4VP <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">when PE was the only query language</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-24.html">when it had both query languages</a>, and <a href="https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VP/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-wg-draft.html">now with only DCQL</a>.  Compare for yourself.</p>
<p>Let me close by saying that I respect the people who created Presentation Exchange to a person.  I count many of them as friends.  They took a complex multi-faceted problem and wrapped their arms around it, producing a concrete solution.  Much can be said in favor of those who pick up the pen and dare to create.  Much was learned from what they produced, and it helped bootstrap an emerging industry.  We wouldn’t be where we are today, were it not for their pioneering efforts!</p>
<p>In the end, the removal happened unceremoniously, with the merge of <a href="https://github.com/openid/OpenID4VP/pull/479">a pull request</a>, like so many other changes – nearly anticlimactic.  But this one marks a sea change in how credentials are presented.  Thanks to all who made this happen!</p>
<p>I didn’t want to let the moment pass without recognizing its significance.</p>

   Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview pricing 
Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro is currently the top model on LM Arena and, from my own testing, a superb model for OCR, audio transcription and long-context coding. 
 You can now pay for it! 
 The new gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25 model ID is priced like this: 
 
 Prompts less than 200,00 tokens: $1.25/million tokens for input, $10/million for output 
 Prompts more than 200

Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro is currently the top model <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">on LM Arena</a> and, from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/">my own testing</a>, a superb model for OCR, audio transcription and long-context coding.<p></p>
<p>You can now pay for it!</p>
<p>The new <code>gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25</code> model ID is priced like this:</p>
 
 Prompts less than 200,00 tokens: $1.25/million tokens for input, $10/million for output 
 Prompts more than 200,000 tokens (up to the 1,048,576 max): $2.50/million for input, $15/million for output 
 
<p>This is priced at around the same level as Gemini 1.5 Pro ($1.25/$5 for input/output below 128,000 tokens, $2.50/$10 above 128,000 tokens), is cheaper than GPT-4o for shorter prompts ($2.50/$10) and is cheaper than Claude 3.7 Sonnet ($3/$15).</p>
<p>Gemini 2.5 Pro is a reasoning model, and invisible reasoning tokens are included in the output token count. I just tried prompting "hi" and it charged me 2 tokens for input and 623 for output, of which 613 were "thinking" tokens. That still adds up to just 0.6232 cents (less than a cent) using my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">LLM pricing calculator</a> which I updated to support the new model just now.</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.17">llm-gemini 0.17</a> this morning adding support for the new model:</p>
 <code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25 hi
</code> 
<p>Note that the model continues to be available for free under the previous <code>gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25</code> model ID:</p>
 <code>llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 hi
</code> 
<p>The free tier is "used to improve our products", the paid tier is not.</p>
<p>Rate limits for the paid model <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-1">vary by tier</a> - from 150/minute and 1,000/day for tier 1 (billing configured), 1,000/minute and 50,000/day for Tier 2 ($250 total spend) and 2,000/minute and unlimited/day for Tier 3 ($1,000 total spend). Meanwhile the free tier continues to limit you to 5 requests per minute and 25 per day.</p>
<p>Google are <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1908179750536827183">retiring the Gemini 2.0 Pro preview</a> entirely in favour of 2.5.

  <p><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/a-sneaky-phish-just-grabbed-my-mailchimp-mailing-list/">A Sneaky Phish Just Grabbed my Mailchimp Mailing List</a></p>
In further evidence that phishing attacks can catch out the most sophisticated among us, security researcher (and operator of <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">';--have i been pwned?</a>) Troy Hunt reports on how he fell for an extremely well crafted phishing attack against his MailChimp account which then exported his full list of subscribers, including people who had unsubscribed (data which MailChimp stores and continues to make available).<p></p>
<p>This could happen to any of us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've received a gazillion similar phishes before that I've identified early, so what was different about this one? Tiredness, was a major factor. I wasn't alert enough, and I didn't properly think through what I was doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Troy's account was protected by authenticator app 2FA, but the phishing site (on the realistic sounding <code>mailchimp-sso.com</code> domain) asked for that code too and instantly proxied it through to MailChimp - somewhat ironic as Troy had been promoting phishing-resistant passkeys on his trip to London, a technology that MailChimp doesn't offer yet.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of interesting details here. I appreciated this point about how short-lived authentication sessions can reduce account security by conditioning users to expect constant login requests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also realised another factor that pre-conditioned me to enter credentials into what I thought was Mailchimp is their very short-lived authentication sessions. Every time I go back to the site, I need to re-authenticate and whilst the blame still clearly lies with me, I'm used to logging back in on every visit. Keeping a trusted device auth'd for a longer period would likely have raised a flag on my return to the site if I wasn't still logged in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like MailChimp preserve the email addresses of unsubscribed users to prevent them from being re-subscribed by future list imports. Troy discusses this issue at length in further updates to the post.</p>

Much of finance depends on insurance underwriting, so as these effects spread, so do the knock-on impacts on financial markets.</p><blockquote><p>"At 3C of global heating, climate damage cannot be insured against, covered by governments, or adapted to, Thallinger said: “That means no more mortgages, no new real estate development, no long-term investment, no financial stability.

<p>Let's not overthink auth in MCP.</p>

<p>Yes, the MCP server is going to need its own auth server. But it's not as bad as it sounds. Let me explain.</p>

<p>First let's get a few pieces of terminology straight.</p>

<p>The confusion that's happening in the discussions I've seen so far is because the spec and diagrams show that the MCP server itself is handing authorization. That's not necessary.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In OAuth, we talk about the "authorization server" and "resource server" as distinct roles. I like to think of the authorization server as the "token factory", that's the thing that makes the access tokens. The resource server (usually an API) needs to be able to validate the tokens created by the authorization server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It's possible to build a single server that is both a resource server and authorization server, and in fact many OAuth systems are built that way, especially large consumer services.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But nothing about the spec requires that the two roles are combined, it's also possible to run these as two totally unrelated services.</p>

<p>This flexibility that's been baked into OAuth for over a decade is what has led to the rapid adoption, as well the proliferation of open source and commercial products that provide an OAuth authorization server as a service.</p>

<p>So how does this relate to MCP?</p>

<p>I can annotate the flow from the <a href="https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a> spec to show the parts where the client talks to the MCP Resource Server separately from where the client talks to the MCP Authorization Server.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<p>Here is the updated sequence diagram showing communication with each role separately.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<p>Why is it important to call out this change?</p>

<p>I've seen a few conversations in <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/issues/205">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/issues/195">places</a> about how requiring the MCP Server to be both an authorization server and resource server is too much of a burden. But actually, very little needs to change about the spec to enable this separation of concerns that OAuth already provides.</p>

<p>I've also seen various suggestions of other ways to separate the authorization server from the MCP server, like delegating to an enterprise IdP and having the MCP server validate access tokens issued by the IdP. These other options also conflate the OAuth roles in an awkward way and would result in some undesirable properties or relationships between the various parties involved.</p>

<p>So what needs to change in the MCP spec to enable this?</p>

 Discovery 

<p>The main thing currently forcing the MCP Server to be both the authorization server and resource server is how the client does discovery.</p>

<p>One design goal of MCP is to enable a client to bootstrap everything it needs based on only the server URL provided. I think this is a great design goal, and luckily is something that can be achieved even when separating the roles in the way I've described.</p>

<p>The MCP spec currently says that clients are expected to fetch the <a href="https://oauth.net/2/authorization-server-metadata/">OAuth Server Metadata</a> (RFC8414) file from the MCP Server base URL, resulting in a URL such as:</p>

<p><code>https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server</code></p>

<p>This ends up meaning the MCP Resource Server must also be an Authorization Server, which leads to the complications the community has encountered so far. The good news is there is an OAuth spec we can apply here instead: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata/">Protected Resource Metadata</a>.</p>

 Protected Resource Metadata 

<p>The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata/">Protected Resource Metadata</a> spec is used by a Resource Server to advertise metadata about itself, including which Authorization Server can be used with it. This spec is both new and old. It was started in 2016, but was never adopted by the OAuth working group until 2023, after I had presented at an IETF meeting about the need for clients to be able to bootstrap OAuth flows given an OAuth resource server. The spec is now awaiting publication as an RFC, and should get its RFC number in a couple months.</p>

<p>Applying this to the MCP server would result in a sequence like the following:</p>

<p><a></a></p>

 
 The MCP Client fetches the Resource Server Metadata file by appending <code>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource</code> to the MCP Server base URL. 
 The MCP Client finds the <code>authorization_servers</code> property in the JSON response, and builds the Authorization Server Metadata URL by appending <code>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server</code> 
 The MCP Client fetches the Authorization Server Metadata to find the endpoints it needs for the OAuth flow, the authorization endpoint and token endpoint 
 The MCP Client initiates an OAuth flow and continues as normal 
 

<p><br>
Note: The Protected Resource Metadata spec also supports the Resource Server returning <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> with a link to the resource metadata URL if you want to avoid the requirement that MCP Servers host their metadata URLs at the <code>.well-known</code> endpoint, it just requires an extra HTTP request to support this.</p>

 Access Token Validation 

<p>Two things to keep in mind about how the MCP Server validates access tokens with this new separation of concerns.</p>

<p>If you do build the MCP Authorization Server and Resource Server as part of the same system, you don't need to do anything special to validate the access tokens the Authorization Server issues. You probably already have some sort of infrastructure in place for your normal API to validate tokens issued by your Authorization Server, so nothing changes there.</p>

<p>If you are using an external Authorization Server, whether that's an open source product or a commercial hosted service, that product will have its own docs for how you can validate the tokens it creates. There's a good chance it already supports the standardized <a href="https://oauth.net/2/jwt-access-tokens/">JWT Access Tokens</a> described in RFC 9068, in which case you can use off-the-shelf <a href="https://oauth.net/code/">JWT validation middleware</a> for common frameworks.</p>

<p>In either case, the critical design goal here is that the MCP Authorization Server issues access tokens that only ever need to be validated by the MCP Resource Server. This is in line with the security recommendations in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.3">Section 2.3 of RFC 9700</a>, in particular that "access tokens SHOULD be audience-restricted to a specific resource server". In other words, it would be a bad idea for the MCP Client to be issued an access token that works with both the MCP Resource Server and the service's REST API.</p>

 Why Require the MCP Server to have an Authorization Server in the first place? 

<p>Another argument I've seen is that MCP Server developers shouldn't have to build any OAuth infrastructure at all, instead they should be able to delegate all the OAuth bits to an external service.</p>

<p>In principle, I agree. Getting API access and authorization right is tricky, that's why there are entire companies dedicated to solving the problem.</p>

<p>The architecture laid out above enables this exact separation of concerns. The difference between this architecture and some of the other proposals I've seen is that this cleanly separates the security boundaries so that there are minimal dependencies among the parties involved.</p>

<p>But, one thing I haven't seen mentioned in the discussions is that there actually is no requirement than an OAuth Authorization Server provide any UI itself.</p>

 An Authorization Server with no UI? 

<p>While it is desirable from a security perspective that the MCP Resource Server has a corresponding Authorization Server that issues access tokens for it, that Authorization Server doesn't actually need to have any UI or even any concept of user login or accounts. You can actually build an Authorization Server that delegates all user account management to an external service. You can see an example of this in <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/limited-release/agents/">PayPal's MCP server</a> they recently launched.</p>

<p>PayPal's traditional API already supports OAuth, the authorization and token endpoints are:</p>

 
 <code>https://www.paypal.com/signin/authorize</code> 
 <code>https://api-m.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token</code> 
 

<p>When PayPal built their MCP server, they launched it at <code>https://mcp.paypal.com</code>. If you fetch the metadata for the MCP Server, you'll find the two OAuth endpoints for the MCP Authorization Server:</p>

 
 <code>https://mcp.paypal.com/authorize</code> 
 <code>https://mcp.paypal.com/token</code> 
 

<p>When the MCP Client redirects the user to the authorization endpoint, the MCP server itself doesn't provide any UI. Instead, it immediately redirects the user to the real PayPal authorization endpoint which then prompts the user to log in and authorize the client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This points to yet another benefit of architecting the MCP Authorization Server and Resource Server this way. It enables implementers to delegate the actual user management to their existing OAuth server with no changes needed to the MCP Client. The MCP Client isn't even aware that this extra redirect step was inserted in the middle. As far as the MCP Client is concerned, it has been talking to only the MCP Authorization Server. It just so happens that the MCP Authorization Server has sent the user elsewhere to actually log in.</p>

 Dynamic Client Registration 

<p>There's one more point I want to make about why having a dedicated MCP Authorization Server is helpful architecturally.</p>

<p>The MCP spec strongly recommends that MCP Servers (authorization servers) support <a href="https://oauth.net/2/dynamic-client-registration/">Dynamic Client Registration</a>. If MCP is successful, there will be a large number of MCP Clients talking to a large number of MCP Servers, and the user is the one deciding which combinations of clients and servers to use. This means it is not scalable to require that every MCP Client developer register their client with every MCP Server.</p>

<p>This is similar to the idea of using an email client with the user's chosen email server. Obviously Mozilla can't register Thunderbird with every email server out there. Instead, there needs to be a way to dynamically establish a client's identity with the OAuth server at runtime. Dynamic Client Registration is one option for how to do that.</p>

<p>The problem is most commercial APIs are not going to enable Dynamic Client Registration on their production servers. For example, in order to get client credentials to use the Google APIs, you need to register as a developer and then register an OAuth client after logging in. Dynamic Client Registration would allow a client to register itself without the link to the developer's account. That would mean there is no paper trail for who the client was developed by. The Dynamic Client Registration endpoint can't require authentication by definition, so is a public endpoint that can create clients, which as you can imagine opens up some potential security issues.</p>

<p>I do, however, think it would be reasonable to expect production services to enable Dynamic Client Registration only on the MCP's Authorization Server. This way the dynamically-registered clients wouldn't be able to use the regular REST API, but would only be able to interact with the MCP API.</p>

<p>Mastodon and BlueSky also have a similar problem of needing clients to show up at arbitrary authorization servers without prior coordination between the client developer and authorization server operator. I call this the "<a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>" problem. Mastodon used Dynamic Client Registration as their solution, and has since documented some of the issues that this creates, linked <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/21991">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/27740">here</a>.</p>

<p>BlueSky decided to take a different approach and instead uses <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-parecki-oauth-client-id-metadata-document/">an https URL as a client identifier</a>, bypassing the need for a client registration step entirely. This has the added bonus of having at least some level of confidence of the client identity because the client identity is hosted at a domain. It would be a perfectly viable approach to use this method for MCP as well. There is a discussion on that within MCP <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions/202">here</a>. This is an ongoing topic within the OAuth working group, I have a couple of drafts in progress to formalize this pattern, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-parecki-oauth-client-id-metadata-document/">Client ID Metadata Document</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-parecki-oauth-client-id-scheme/">Client ID Scheme</a>.</p>

 Enterprise IdP Integration 

<p>Lastly, I want to touch on the idea of enabling users to log in to MCP Servers with their enterprise IdP.</p>

<p>When an enterprise company purchases software, they expect to be able to tie it in to their single-sign-on solution. For example, when I log in to work Slack, I enter my work email and Slack redirects me to my work IdP where I log in. This way employees don't need to have passwords with every app they use in the enterprise, they can log in to everything with the same enterprise account, and all the apps can be protected with multi-factor authentication through the IdP. This also gives the company control over which users can access which apps, as well as a way to revoke a user's access at any time.</p>

<p>So how does this relate to MCP?</p>

<p>Well, plenty of people are already trying to figure out how to let their employees safely use AI tools within the enterprise. So we need a way to let employees use their enterprise IdP to log in and authorize MCP Clients to access MCP Servers.</p>

<p>If you're building an MCP Server in front of an existing application that already supports enterprise Single Sign-On, then you don't need to do anything differently in the MCP Client or Server and you already have support for this. When the MCP Client redirects to the MCP Authorization Server, the MCP Authorization Server redirects to the main Authorization Server, which would then prompt the user for their company email/domain and redirect to the enterprise IdP to log in.</p>

<p>This brings me to yet another thing I've been seeing conflated in the discussions: user login and user authorization.</p>

<p>OAuth is an authorization delegation protocol. OAuth doesn't actually say anything about how users authenticate at the OAuth server, it only talks about how the user can authorize access to an application. This is actually a really great thing, because it means we can get super creative with how users authenticate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Remember the yellow box "User logs in and authorizes" from the original sequence diagram? These are actually two totally distinct steps. The OAuth authorization server is responsible for getting the user to log in somehow, but there's no requirement that how the user logs in is with a username/password. This is where we can insert a single-sign-on flow to an enterprise IdP, or really anything you can imagine.</p>

<p>So think of this as two separate boxes: "user logs in", and "user authorizes". Then, we can replace the "user logs in" box with an entirely new OpenID Connect flow out to the enterprise IdP to log the user in, and after they are logged in they can authorize the client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'll spare you the complete expanded sequence diagram, since it looks a lot more complicated than it actually is. But I again want to stress that this is nothing new, this is already how things are commonly done today.</p>

<p>This all just becomes cleaner to understand when you separate the MCP Authorization Server from the MCP Resource Server.</p>

<p>We can push all the complexity of user login, token minting, and more onto the MCP Authorization Server, keeping the MCP Resource Server free to do the much simpler task of validating access tokens and serving resources.</p>

 Future Improvements of Enterprise IdP Integration 

<p>There are two things I want to call out about how enterprise IdP integration could be improved. Both of these are entire topics on their own, so I will only touch on the problems and link out to other places where work is happening to solve them.</p>

<p>There are two points of friction with the current state of enterprise login for SaaS apps.</p>

 
 IdP discovery 
 User consent 
 

 IdP Discovery 

<p>When a user logs in to a SaaS app, they need to tell the app how to find their enterprise IdP. This is commonly done by either asking the user to enter their work email, or asking the user to enter their tenant URL at the service.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Neither of these is really a great user experience. It would be a lot better if the browser already knew which enterprise IdP the user should be sent to. This is one of my goals with the work happening in <a href="https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM">FedCM</a>. With this new browser API, the browser can mediate the login, telling the SaaS app which enterprise IdP to use automatically only needing the user to click their account icon rather than type anything in.</p>

 User Consent 

<p>Another point of friction in the enterprise happens when a user starts connecting multiple applications to each other within the company. For example, if you drop in a Google Docs link into Slack, Slack will prompt you to connect your Google account to preview the link. Multiply this by N number of applications that can preview links, and M number of applications you might drop links to, and you end up sending the user through a huge number of OAuth consent flows.</p>

<p>The problem is only made worse with the explosion of AI tools. Every AI tool will need access to data in every other application in the enterprise. That is a lot of OAuth consent flows for the user to manage. Plus, the user shouldn't really be the one granting consent for Slack to access the company Google Docs account anyway. That consent should ideally be managed by the enterprise IT admin.</p>

<p>What we actually need is a way to enable the IT admin to grant consent for apps to talk to each other company-wide, removing the need for users to be sent through an OAuth flow at all.</p>

<p>This is the basis of another OAuth spec I've been working on, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/">Identity Assertion Authorization Grant</a>.</p>

<p>The same problem applies to MCP Servers, and with the separation of concerns laid out above, it becomes straightforward to add this extension to move the consent to the enterprise and streamline the user experience.</p>

<p>Ahmad Shadeed explores potential applications of this in detail, trying it out for CSS grid columns, progress bars, background images, animation delays and more.</p>
<p>I like this example that uses the <code>rows="5"</code> attribute on a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> to calculate its <code>max-height</code> - here wrapped in a feature detection block:</p>
 @supports (x: attr(x type(*))) {
  textarea {
    min-height: calc(
      attr(rows type(&lt;number&gt;)) * 50px
    );
  }
} 

<p>That <code>type(&lt;number&gt;)</code> is the new syntax.</p>
<p>Many of Ahmad's examples can be achieved today across all browsers using a slightly more verbose CSS custom property syntax.</p>
<p>Here are the tracking issues for CSS values support in <code>attr()</code> for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=435426">Firefox</a> (opened 17 years ago) and <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26609">WebKit</a> (16 years ago).

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Trump’s tariffs to rock tech, Gemini 2.5 Pro could be the best coding model yet, GPU demand keeps rising for the largest players, OpenAI raises record-breaking sum, payroll scaleup Deel paid a spy to steal trade secrets, and more.</p>  <p>New trend: EMs quitting to be startup founders using AI. An interesting impact of AI tools is that they empower engineering leaders who are not hands-on to launch their own businesses, and build a good enough v1 of products to get customers, or raise funding.</p>  <p>Tips on using LLMs to code from Simon Willison. Ignore the “AGI hype,” ask for opinions, tell the tools exactly what to do, and more practical advice.</p>  <p>Leaked startup recruitment guidelines cause stir. A recruiter at a large tech company accidentally shared internal recruitment guidelines for engineers. It reveals how important pedigree is becoming, and that some companies keep blacklists of places they refuse to hire from. It’s one reality of a super-competitive job market.</p>   1. Industry Pulse  Trump’s tariffs to rock tech? <p>Last November, when the US elected Donald Trump as president again, we asked <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/151331695/what-does-trumps-win-mean-for-the-tech-industry">what it meant for the tech industry.</a> The US is the clear leader in technology, with nearly all of the world’s largest tech companies by revenue and users headquartered there. I closed my analysis with “expect the unexpected.”</p><p>And so it has turned out: yesterday, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jxrnl9xe2o">introduced</a> the highest tariffs on US imports in the past century: 10% baseline tariffs for nearly all countries, with the EU to be tariffed at 20%, China at 54% (34% plus 20% of earlier tariffs), Vietnam at 46%, India at 26%, Japan at 24%.</p><p>The implications of these tariffs – and potential counter-tariffs as part of a trade-war – look massive. They could impact the tech industry as much as <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/zirp">the end of zero interest rates mega-event</a> has done. I will look into the effects of Trump’s tariffs on tech in a follow-up issue, very soon.</p> Gemini 2.5 Pro, the best coding model yet?

<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-3.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>500円でできるなら、一回申請してみようかなと思います。Windows PCからじゃないと出来ないのがちょっとあれですが。</p>



<p>商業登記電子証明書は、法人の代表者がオンラインで各種手続きを行う際に必要となる電子証明書です。以下のような用途で使用されます：</p>



 商業登記電子証明書の主な利用用途 



<p>商業登記電子証明書は以下のような用途で使用できます。</p>



 
 法務関係
 
 商業登記や供託、電子公証、印鑑証明書の取得など。 
 
 



 税金関係
 
 国税電子申告・納税システム（e-Tax）や地方税電子申告（eLTAX）を利用した申告・納税。 
 
 



 社会保険・労働保険関係
 
 健康保険や厚生年金保険の手続き、労働保険関連の申請。 
 
 



 特許関連
 
 特許のインターネット出願や国際出願（PCT-RO）。 
 
 



 自動車保有関係手続
 
 車両登録や継続検査など、自動車関連手続き。 
 
 



 その他行政手続き
 
 電波利用の電子申請、防衛装備庁の電子入札、府省共通の電子調達システムなど。 
 
 
 



<p>でもこの中には、あんまり使用する機会があるものが無いなぁ。</p>



 PDFへの電子署名の方法 



<p>商業登記電子証明書は契約書などPDFに署名をすることもできます。PDFに署名するには、以下の手順を実行します：</p>



 1. 必要なソフトウェアの準備 



 
 Adobe Acrobat ProまたはAdobe Acrobat Readerを使用します。 



 法務省が提供する「商業登記電子認証ソフト」や「申請用総合ソフト」をインストールしておくと便利です。 
 



 2. PDFファイルの準備 



 
 署名対象のファイルがWordやExcelの場合、事前にPDF形式に変換します。 
 



 3. 電子署名の付与手順 



 
 PDFファイルを開く
 
 Adobe Acrobat ProまたはReaderで署名対象のPDFを開きます。 
 
 



 デジタルIDの設定
 
 メニューから「ツール」→「証明書」を選択。 



 「デジタル署名」をクリックし、署名位置を指定。 



 「新しいデジタルIDを設定」を選び、「ファイルのデジタルIDを使用」を選択。 



 商業登記電子証明書（拡張子.p12）を選択し、パスワードを入力して設定します。 
 
 



 署名の実行
 
 設定したデジタルIDを選択し、再度パスワードを入力。 



 署名後、署名済みのPDFファイルとして保存します。 
 
 



 署名完了の確認
 
 署名が付与されたPDFには、Adobe上で「この文書には有効な署名が含まれています」と表示されます。 
 
 
 



<p>注意点</p>



 
 商業登記電子証明書は法務局発行のため、Adobe Acrobatで検証時に「少なくとも1つの署名に問題があります」と表示される場合があります。これは、Adobeの信頼済みリストに法務局のルート証明書が登録されていないためです。この場合でも、法務省提供のソフトウェアで検証すれば問題ありませんが、一般に利用しようとするとここが障害になりますね。 



 複数人での署名が必要な場合や追加で署名する場合も対応可能です。 
 



<p>より詳しくは、<a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/CERTIFICATION/index.html">https://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/CERTIFICATION/index.html</a> を御覧ください。</p>

   Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders

  <p><a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/">Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders</a></p>
Absolutely brilliant piece of CSS ingenuity by Lean Rada, who describes a way to implement blurry placeholder images using just CSS, with syntax like this:<p></p>
 &lt;img src="…" style="--lqip:192900"&gt; 

<p>That 192900 number encodes everything needed to construct the placeholder - it manages to embed a single base color and six brightness components (in a 3x2 grid) in 20 bits, then encodes those as an integer in the roughly 2 million available values between -999,999 and 999,999 - beyond which range Lean found some browsers would start to lose precision.</p>
<p>The implementation for decoding that value becomes a bunch of clever bit-fiddling CSS expressions to expand it into further CSS variables:</p>
 [style*="--lqip:"] {
  --lqip-ca: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 18))), 4);
  --lqip-cb: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 16))), 4);
  /* more like that */
} 

<p>Which are expanded to even more variables with code like this:</p>
 --lqip-ca-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ca) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cb-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cb) / 3 * 100%)); 

<p>And finally rendered using a CSS gradient definition that starts like this:</p>
 [style*="--lqip:"] {
  background-image:
    radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 25%, var(--lqip-ca-clr), transparent),
    radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 25%, var(--lqip-cb-clr), transparent),
    /* ... */
    linear-gradient(0deg, var(--lqip-base-clr), var(--lqip-base-clr));
} 

<p>The article includes several interactive explainers (most of which are also powered by pure CSS) illustrating how it all works.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/leanrada.com/blob/7b6739c7c30c66c771fcbc9e1dc8942e628c5024/main/scripts/update/lqip.mjs#L118-L159">Node.js script</a> for converting images to these magic integers uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp">Sharp</a> to resize the image to 3x2 and then use the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space">Oklab perceptually uniform color space</a> (new to me, that was created by Björn Ottosson in 2020) to derive the six resulting values.

I still have accounts on X, Substack, Facebook, and others. But I find that there's less and less there that I actually care about. I find myself wading through lots of crap to find the things I want to see. Still, I do like to browse through ideas while waiting in line, at the doctor's office, and so on.</p><p>This post from Cory Doctorow entitled <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise">You should be using an RSS reader</a> caught my eye a while ago. I used to use an RSS reader all the time. I've tried to get back into it a time or two, but it didn't stick. Inspired by Cory to try one more time, I downloaded the RSS reader he uses (<a href="https://newsblur.com/">Newsblur</a>) and gave it another shot. This time I coupled it with moving the RSS reader app on my phone to a more prominent position so when I'm looking for something to browse, I see it first.</p><p>First I found RSS feeds for some of my friends and publications I like to read. I also discovered that <a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038239391-Is-there-an-RSS-feed-for-my-publication">Substack publications have RSS feeds</a>. Many publications don't make finding RSS easy, but it's almost always there. There are a few authors I like on The New Stack and I found that if you enter <code>/rss</code> after the URL for an author or category page, you get RSS for that author or category. For example, here's the <a href="https://thenewstack.io/author/jon-udell/rss">RSS page for Jon Udell.</a> Cool. </p><p>After adding RSS feeds for things I like (most online publications have one), I started reading things on Newsblur instead of opening up X. Most newsreaders don't have an algorithm. If they do, it is not usually the default setting and can be turned off. If you subscribe to too many feeds, turn it on and let it prioritize your reading. But regardless, you control the experience. Just like you should.</p><p>At the end of his post, Cory writes:</p><blockquote><p>Using RSS to follow the stuff that matters to you will have an immediate, profoundly beneficial impact on your own digital life—and it will appreciably, irreversibly nudge the whole internet towards a better state.</p><p>From <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/">You should be using an RSS reader</a><br>Referenced 2025-04-02T13:02:11-0400</p></blockquote><p>Cory's right, using an RSS reader will make your digital life better. I'm wasting less time scrolling past stuff I don't care about and more time reading things I enjoy. That's a win.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a>Robot Reading on Phone</a> from DALL-E (public domain)</p>

<p>In 1967, Alan Westin published Privacy and Freedom in response to growing concerns in the 1960s about computer databases and surveillance. Westin argued that encroachments on privacy were also encroachments on 'American liberty.' When he stated that "Privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others"<a>[1]</a>, he argued that privacy (liberty) was not possible without individuals having both the autonomy to both make these claims and to have them respected.</p><p>In the 60s, there was a growing concern about technology encroaching on privacy. He argued, "The real need is to move from public awareness of the problem to a sensitive discussion of what can be done to protect privacy in an age when so many forces of science, technology, environment, and society press against it from all sides."<a>[2]</a></p><p>The US Privacy Act (1974) was the first legislative response, followed by the OECD privacy guidelines (1980) and the Council of Europe Data Protection Convention in 1981. Data protection or privacy laws have become the norm in the 50 years since the US Privacy Act. However, the concerns expressed then are just as valid today, whether from a left view of <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/?ref=webistemology.com">Surveillance Capitalism</a> or a business school description of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Surveillance_Capitalism?ref=webistemology.com">Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>.&nbsp;Despite the proliferation of privacy laws, privacy is as much under threat today as it was then.</p><p>Returning to "Privacy and Freedom", does the failure of privacy mean a failure of freedom? Is the likelihood of a country being free, partially free, or not free uncorrelated with whether or not the government has data protection or privacy laws? There are more than 200 countries in the world, 150 of which have some form of privacy or data protection legislation<a>[3]</a>. Freedom House's Annual <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world?ref=webistemology.com">Freedom in the World</a> report categorises countries as "Free", "Partially Free", or "Not Free" based on a set of 25 indicators<a>[4]</a>. When you compare the percentages of countries' freedom ratings, the impact of having privacy or data protection legislation on whether or not a country is free is minimal.</p>

<p>This suggests that privacy itself is not related to freedom (or liberty) OR that there is a problem with the way that privacy laws have been written or implemented. The proposition that privacy should be concomitant with individual freedom and that the ability of groups to organise seems almost axiomatically true. And recent writings suggest that, as currently architected, privacy laws can be helpful for authoritarian governments.<a>[5]</a>. This echoes critiques from privacy scholars such as Woodrow Hartzog<a>[6]</a> or Ignacio Cofone<a>[7]</a>. In a recent article, Daniel Solove says, "To adequately regulate government surveillance, it is essential to also regulate surveillance capitalism. Government surveillance and surveillance capitalism are two sides of the same coin. It is impossible to protect privacy from authoritarianism without addressing consumer privacy."<a>[8]</a></p><p>Without trying to be hyperbolic, the current trajectory for privacy laws and regulations is leading down a path of digital alienation. It is time for privacy laws and practices to support digital autonomy.</p> <p>Footnotes</p>   Westin, Alan F..

See the episode transcript at the top of this page, and a summary at the bottom.</p> Brought to You By <p>• <a href="https://www.swarmia.com/pragmatic/">Swarmia</a> — The engineering intelligence platform for modern software organizations.</p><p>• <a href="https://sentry.io/pragmatic/?">Sentry</a> — Error and performance monitoring for developers.</p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>Why did Meta build its own internal developer tooling instead of using industry-standard solutions like GitHub? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasreimers/">Tomas Reimers</a>, former Meta engineer and co-founder of <a href="https://graphite.dev/">Graphite</a>, joins the show to talk about Meta's custom developer tools – many of which were years ahead of the industry.</p><p>From Phabricator to Sandcastle and Butterflybot, Tomas shares examples of Meta’s internal tools that transformed developer productivity at the tech giant. Why did working with stacked diffs and using monorepos become best practices at Meta? How are these practices influencing the broader industry? Why are code reviews and testing looking to become even more critical as AI transforms how we write software? We answer these, and also discuss:</p><p>• Meta's custom internal developer tools</p><p>• Why more tech companies are transitioning from polyrepos to monorepos</p><p>• A case for different engineering constraints within the same organization</p><p>• How stacked diffs solve the code review bottleneck</p><p>• Graphite’s origin story and pivot to their current product</p><p>• Why code reviews will become a lot more important, the more we use AI coding tools</p><p>• Tomas’s favorite engineering metric</p><p>• And much more!</p>     Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this conversation:</p><p>“Stacked diffs” makes a lot of sense inside companies. However, it makes less sense when working on, e.g., open source projects. Perhaps this is a reason that GitHub has not added support for this workflow — even though it’s popular inside companies like Meta or Uber. We previously did a deepdive on <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs">Stacked Diffs (and why you should know about them)</a>.</p><p>The “trust matrix:” this is a good way to decide how much process/tooling to put in place in a team. If you trust people a lot and are willing to tolerate mistakes, you should lean on culture and not process. If you start to become a team or company where you need to trust people less: this is the time to move more tooling and more process. So, as a small startup you probably don’t need that much tooling and process!</p><p>There could be an industry-wide movement to monorepos: at mid-sized and larger scaleups and tech companies. Tomas sees a lot of scaleups they work with the move from polyrepos (several repositories) to monorepos. Moving to a monorepo is still a lot of work and requires custom tooling: and this is why it was limited to the largest tech companies in the past. Interesting to hear about this change!</p><p>AI coding tools increase the importance of quality code reviews. We’ll see more code churned out by AI: but an engineer needs to review it before it goes out. It’s a good question how we can stick to thorough code reviews when it is so tempting to just say, “Looks good to me (LGTM)” and have the&nbsp;seemingly&nbsp;correct code merged.</p><p></p> The

href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/facebook-2">Inside Meta’s Engineering Culture</a></p>   Stacked diffs   <p>Meta used a method called stacking for code changes, where developers create a series of dependent changes (think of it as small PRs depending one on another)</p>  <p>This involves building multiple, sequential branches, each representing a smaller part of a larger feature.</p>  <p>The goal: minimize developer wait times associated with lengthy code reviews by submitting smaller units.</p>  <p>Reviewing smaller pull requests is generally faster and more effective.</p>  <p>Meta created internal tools to manage the Git operations, such as rebasing, necessary for maintaining stacked branches.</p>   Monorepo   <p>Meta adopted a monorepo strategy, housing most of its codebase in a single repository.</p>  <p>This approach aimed to simplify collaboration and management of dependencies between different parts of the system.</p>  <p>Initially having multiple large repositories, Meta moved towards consolidating them for greater efficiency.</p>  <p>Tomas observes a trend of more companies adopting monorepos.</p>   Impact of AI on software development   <p>Tomas expects the use of AI tools to increase the speed and volume of code generation by developers.</p>  <p>This increase in code will place greater emphasis on the processes of code review and software testing to ensure quality.</p>  <p>AI has the potential to automate certain aspects of the code review process, allowing human reviewers to concentrate on more complex design and integration issues.</p>  <p>AI may also play a role in generating software tests, potentially increasing test coverage.</p>  <p>Still: human understanding and review of code will remain essential for verifying the intended functionality and business logic.</p>   Engineering metrics to measure to get a sense of team performance   <p>Commonly tracked metrics include the number of pull requests created and the time taken for them to be merged.</p>  <p>Uber implemented a metric measuring the time a pull request spent waiting for review without any action. This aimed to address delays in the review process, particularly in distributed teams.</p>  <p>While measuring developer focus time is challenging, it is recognized as an important factor in productivity.</p>  <p>Where to find Tomas Reimers:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/tomasreimers">https://x.com/tomasreimers</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a

   Composite primary keys in Django 
Django 5.2 is out today and a big new feature is composite primary keys, which can now be defined like this: 
 class Release(models.Model):
    pk = models.CompositePrimaryKey(
        "version", "name"
    )
    version = models.IntegerField()
    name = models.CharField(max_length=20) 

 They don't yet work with the Django admin or as targets for foreign keys.

<p>They don't yet work with the Django admin or as targets for foreign keys.</p>
<p>Other smaller new features include:</p>
 
 All ORM models are now automatically imported into <code>./manage.py shell</code> - a feature borrowed from <code>./manage.py shell_plus</code> in <a href="https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/">django-extensions</a> 
 Feeds from the Django syndication framework can now specify <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/contrib/syndication/#feed-stylesheets">XSLT stylesheets</a> 
 <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse.text">response.text</a> now returns the string representation of the body - I'm so happy about this, now I don't have to litter my Django tests with <code>response.content.decode("utf-8")</code> any more 
 a new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/howto/custom-template-tags/#django.template.Library.simple_block_tag">simple_block_tag</a> helper making it much easier to create a custom Django template tag that further processes its own inner rendered content 
 A bunch more in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/5.2/">full release notes</a> 
 
<p>5.2 is also an LTS release, so it will receive security and data loss bug fixes up to April 2028.

<p>[<a href="https://everythingchanges.us/blog/keep-moving/">Mandy Brown</a>]</p><p>A good reminder here from Mandy Brown.</p><blockquote><p>"Among the people I’ve witnessed working through crises in their work and lives, the one pattern that comes up over and over again is making art. Art brings us back to ourselves, helps us root in our own agency and creative power, makes space for the joy of craft and play, and reminds us of our purpose in the world. On dark days, it’s easy to think that there’s no room for art, because the work of survival is so demanding. But art doesn’t merely take time—it gives time and energy back. It renews our spirits and the spirits of everyone who sees or hears or experiences the art, who receives the art as it’s intended: as a gift."</p></blockquote><p>I sometimes have to remind myself that it's not frivolous; that it doesn't matter that it's not productive in a work sense. But it's not frivolous. It's living. It's being alive. And we all have the right to be alive.</p>

 主なメリット: 



 相続時・災害時の手続き簡略化 



 
 口座にマイナンバーを付番することで、相続時や災害時に、複数の金融機関に存在する預貯金口座の所在を容易に特定し、関連情報の提供を受けることが可能になります。 



 資料には、「相続時又は災害時に、預貯金口座の所在を特定し、その預貯金口座に関する情報の提供を受けることができます」と明記されています。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/860a0c3f/20250319_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf">資料２</a>」より） 



 広報資料でも、「金融機関の窓口等で口座に付番しておくと、相続時や災害時には、付番口座の所在を把握できるようになるといったメリットを享受できます」と説明されています。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/news/dd6aa934-b132-4438-bed8-b6f86f0e37d8">資料１</a>」より） 
 



 マイナンバーによる一括連携 



 
 本人の同意があれば、金融機関やマイナポータルを通じて、一度に複数の金融機関の預貯金口座にマイナンバーを付番することができます。 



 資料には、「本人同意を前提とし、金融機関及びマイナポータルから、一 度に複数の預貯金口座への付番ができます」と記載されています。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/860a0c3f/20250319_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf">資料２</a>」より） 



 図解では、マイナポータルまたは金融機関の窓口を通じて、複数の金融機関へマイナンバーを届け出る流れが示されています。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/24c5ac2e/20250331_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf"></a><a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/860a0c3f/20250319_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf">資料２</a>」より） 
 



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-2.png?ssl=1"></a>



 心配事などへの対応 



 任意性 



 
 金融機関へのマイナンバーの届出は任意であり、義務ではありません。 



 デジタル庁のウェブサイトでは、「なお、金融機関などへのマイナンバーの届出は任意です」と明記されています。（「預貯金口座付番制度等の拡充について｜デジタル庁」より） 
 



 プライバシーへの配慮 



 
 マイナンバーを届け出たとしても、その情報が国の資産把握に直結するわけではありません。金融機関がマイナンバーの届出をきっかけに、国の預貯金残高などを通知することはないと強調されています。 



 資料には、「マイナンバーの届出をきっかけに、金融機関 が国に預貯金残高などをお知らせすることは ないから安心してね」というQ&amp;A形式の説明があります。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/860a0c3f/20250319_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf">資料２</a>」より） 



 また、「従来より、国が預貯金者の口座情報を確認 できるのは、法令に基づき、必要な社会保障 の資力調査や税務調査などを行う場合に 限られている」とも説明されています。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/860a0c3f/20250319_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf">資料２</a>」より） 



 マイナンバーカードに口座情報が登録されることもなく、紛失・盗難時の一時利用停止措置も用意されています。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/860a0c3f/20250319_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf">資料２</a>」より） 
 



 開始時期 



 
 口座管理法制度は、令和7年（2025年）4月1日から開始されます。 



 資料の冒頭には、「令和７年 ４月１日 開始！」と大きく記載されています。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/24c5ac2e/20250331_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf">資料３</a>」より） 
 



 手続き〜どうやったら登録できるの？ 



 
 本人の同意を前提として、金融機関およびマイナポータルから、一度に複数の預貯金口座へのマイナンバーの付番を申し出ることができます 。 



 具体的には、以下の方法で登録（マイナンバーの付番の申出）ができると考えられます。
 
 金融機関の窓口：金融機関の窓口にマイナンバーカードを持参して、口座にマイナンバーを届け出ることで、付番の手続きを行うことができます。一つの金融機関の窓口で、マイナンバーが付番された預貯金口座の所在を確認できるようになる予定です。 



 マイナポータル：マイナポータルを通じて、複数の金融機関の預貯金口座に対して、一度にマイナンバーの付番を申し込むことができるようになります。ただし、4月2日11:47段階ではまだ準備ができていないようで、フリーダイヤルで聞いたところ、金融機関の窓口でやるか、しばらく時間をおいて再度問い合わせしてほしいとのことでした。 
 
 
 



 重要事項 



 
 口座管理法制度: 預貯金口座へのマイナンバーの付番制度を指します。 



 マイナンバー付番のメリット: 相続・災害時の手続きを簡略化し、複数の口座情報を一括で確認できるようになること。 



 マイナポータル: マイナンバーに関するオンラインサービスを通じて、預貯金口座への付番手続きが可能になる予定です。 



 公金受取口座登録制度との違い: 預貯金口座付番制度は、あくまで相続・災害時の情報確認を容易にするためのものであり、給付金等の受取口座を国に登録する「公金受取口座登録制度」とは異なります。 



 デジタル庁のウェブサイトでは、この二つの制度の違いが明確に説明されています。（「預貯金口座付番制度｜デジタル庁」より） 



 住所変更の重要性: 金融機関に登録されている住所等の情報が最新でない場合、マイナンバーの付番ができない可能性があるため、事前の情報更新が推奨されています。 



 資料には、「金融機関に届け出ている住所等の更新が 出来ていないと、本人の口座だと認識されずに、 マイナンバーの付番が出来ないよ」という注意喚起があります。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/860a0c3f/20250319_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf">資料２</a>」より） 



 問い合わせ窓口: マイナンバー制度全般や本件に関する問い合わせ先として、マイナンバー総合フリーダイヤル（0120-95-0178）などが案内されています。（「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/c1c0269d-13ca-4b57-9a0f-c9a066fad457/860a0c3f/20250319_policies_numbering-on-accounts_outline_01.pdf">資料２</a>」より） 
 



 結論 



<p>2025年4月1日から開始される口座管理法制度は、マイナンバーを活用して預貯金口座情報を一元的に管理し、相続や災害といった緊急時における手続きの負担を軽減することを目的としています。マイナンバーの届出は任意であり、プライバシーへの配慮もなされています。制度の利用にあたっては、金融機関への登録情報の確認・更新が重要となります。</p>

 Implementing an extension search path 
<p>Peter: Thank you for having me!</p>
<p>I’m gonna talk about a current project by me and a couple of people I have
worked with, and that will hopefully ship with Postgres 18 in a few months.</p>
<p>So, what do I know about extensions? I’m a Postgres core developer, but I’ve
developed a few extensions in my time, here’s a list of extensions that I’ve
built over the years.</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/petere/plsh">plsh</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/petere/pguint">pguint</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/petere/pgpcre">pgpcre</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/petere/pguri">pguri</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/petere/plxslt">plxslt</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/petere/pgemailaddr">pgemailaddr</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/petere/pgtrashcan">pgtrashcan</a> 
 
<p>Some of those are experiments, or sort of one-offs. Some of those are actually
used in production.</p>
<p>I’ve also contributed to well-known extensions: <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/orafce/">orafce</a>; and back in the day,
<a href="https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/pglogical">pglogical</a>, <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/4/bdr/">BDR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/pg_failover_slots">pg_failover_slots</a>, at <a href="https://enterprisedb.com" title="EnterpriseDB">EDB</a>, and previously
2ndQuadrant. Those are obviously used widely and in important production
environments.</p>
<p>I also wrote an extension installation manager called <a href="https://github.com/petere/pex">pex</a> at one point. The
point of pex was to do it in one shell script, so you don’t have any
dependencies. It’s just a shell script, and you can say <code>pex install orafce</code>
and it installs it. This was a proof of concept, in a sense, but was actually
quite useful sometimes for development, when you just need an extension and
you don’t know where to get it.</p>
<p>And then I wrote, even more experimental, a follow-on project called
<a href="https://github.com/petere/autopex">autopex</a>, which is a plugin module that you load into Postgres that
automatically installs an extension if you need it. If you call <code>CREATE EXTENSION orafce</code>, for example, and you don’t have it installed, autopex
downloads and installs it. Obviously highly insecure and dubious in terms of
modern software distribution practice, but  it does work: you can just run
<code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>, and it just installs it if you don’t have it. That kind of
works.</p>
<p>So anyways, so I’ve worked on these various aspects of these over time. If
you’re interested in any of these projects, they’re all under my <a href="https://github.com/petere/">GitHub
account</a>.</p>
<p>In the context of this presentation…this was essentially not my idea. People
came to me and asked me to work on this, and as it worked out, multiple people
came to me with their problems or questions, and then it turned out it was all
the same question. These are the problems I was approached about.</p>
<p>The first one is extension management in the Kubernetes environment. we’ll
hear about this in a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/events/306551747/" title="PostgreSQL Extension Mini Summit: Extension Management in CNPG">future talk</a> in this series. <a href="https://www.gabrielebartolini.it">Gabriele Bartolini</a> from
the <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a> project approached me and said that the issue in a
Kubernetes environment is that if you launch a Postgres service, you don’t
install packages, you have a pre-baked disk image that contains the software
that you need. There’s a Postgres server and maybe some backup software in
that image, and if you want to install an extension, and the extension is not
in that image, you need to rebuild the image with the extension. That’s very
inconvenient.</p>
<p>The ideal scenario would be that you have additional disk images for the
extensions and you just somehow attach them. I’m hand waving through the
Kubernetes terminology, and again, there will be <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/events/306551747/" title="PostgreSQL Extension Mini Summit: Extension Management in CNPG">a presentation</a>
about that in more detail. But I think the idea is clear: you want to have
these immutable disk images that contain your pieces of software, and if you
want to install more of them, you just wanna have these disk images augment
’em together, and that doesn’t work at the moment.</p>
<p>Problem number two is: I was approached by a maintainer of the <a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a>
project, a Mac binary distribution for Postgres. It’s a nice, user-friendly
binary distribution for Postgres. This is sort of a similar problem: on macOS
you have these <code>.app</code> files to distribute software. They’re this sort of weird
hybrid between a zip file with files in it and a directory you can look into,
so it’s kind of weird. But it’s basically an archive with software in it. And
in this case it has Postgres in it and it integrates nicely into your system.
But again, if you want to install an extension, that doesn’t work as easily,
because you would need to open up that archive and stick the extension in
there somehow, or overwrite files.</p>
<p>And there’s also a tie in with the way these packages are signed by Apple, and
if you, mess with the files in the package, then the signature becomes
invalid. It’s the way it’s been explained to me. I hope this was approximately
accurate, but you already get the idea, right? There’s the same problem where
you have this base bundle of software that is immutable or that you want to
keep immutable and you want to add things to it, which doesn’t work.</p>
<p>And then the third problem I was asked to solve came from the Debian package
maintainer, who will also <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/events/306682786/" title="PostgreSQL Extension Mini Summit: Apt Extension Packaging">speak later</a> in this presentation series. What he
wanted to do was to run the tests of an extension while the package is being
built. That makes sense. You wanna run the tests of the software that you’re
building the package for in general. But in order to do that, you have to
install the extension into the the normal file system location, right? That
seems bad. You don’t want to install the software while you’re into the main
system while you’re building it. He actually wrote a custom patch to be able
to do that, which then my work was inspired by.</p>
<p>Those are the problems I was approached about.</p>
<p>I had some problems I wanted to solve myself based on my experience working
with extensions. While I was working on these various extensions over the
years, one thing that never worked is that you could never run <code>make check</code>.
It wasn’t supported by the PGXS build system. Again, it’s the same issue.</p>
<p>It’s essentially a subset of the Debian problem: you want to run a test of the
software before you install it, but Postgres can only load an extension from a
fixed location, and so this doesn’t work. It’s very annoying because it makes
the software development cycle much more complicated. You always have to then,
then run <code>make all</code>, <code>make install</code>, make sure you have a server running,
<code>make installcheck</code>. And then you would want to test it against various
different server versions. Usually they have to run this in some weird loop.
I’ve written custom scripts and stuff all around this, but it’s was never
satisfactory. It should just work.</p>
<p>That’s the problem I definitely wanted to solve. The next problem  — and
these are are all subsets of each other — that if you have Postgres
installed from a package, like an RPM package for example, and then you build
the extension locally, you have to install the extension into the directory
locations that are controlled by your operating system. If you have Postgres
under <code>/usr</code>, then the extensions also have to be installed under <code>/usr</code>,
whereas you probably want to install them under <code>/usr/local</code> or somewhere
else. You want to keep those locally built things separately, but that’s not
possible.</p>
<p>And finally — this is a bit more complicated to explain — I’m mainly using
macOS at the moment, and the <a href="https://brew.sh" title="The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)">Homebrew</a> package manager is widely used there.
But it doesn’t support extensions very well at all. It’s really weird because
the way it works is that each package is essentially installed into a separate
subdirectory, and then it’s all symlinked together. And that works just fine.
You have a bunch of <code>bin</code> directories, and it’s just a bunch of symlinks to
different subdirectories and that works, because then you can just swap these
things out and upgrade packages quite easily. That’s just a design choice and
it’s fine.</p>
<p>But again, if you wanna install an extension, the extension would be its own
package — PostGIS, for example — and it would go into its own directory.
But that’s not the directory where Postgres would look for it. You would have
to install it into the directory structure that belongs to the other package.
And that just doesn’t work. It’s just does not fit with that system at all.
There are weird hacks at the moment, but it’s not satisfactory. Doesn’t work
at all.</p>
<p>It turned out, all of these things have sort of came up over the years and
some of these, people have approached me about them, and I realized these are
essentially all the same problem. The extension file location is hard-coded to
be inside the Postgres installation tree. Here as an example: it’s usually
under something like <code>/usr/share/postgresql/extension/</code>, and you can’t install
extensions anywhere else. If you want to  keep this location managed by the
operating system or managed by your package management or in some kind of
immutable disk image, you can’t. And so these are essentially all versions of
the same problem. So that’s why I got engaged and tried to find a solution
that addresses all of ’em.</p>
<p>I had worked on this already before, a long time ago, and then someone broke
it along the way. And now I’m fixing it again. If you go way, way back, before
extensions as such existed in Postgres in 9.1, when you wanted to install a
piece of software that consists of a shared library object and some SQL, you
had to install the shared library object into a predetermined location just
like you do now. In addition, you had to run that SQL file by hand, basically,
like you run <code>psql -f install_orafce.sql</code> or something like that. Extensions
made that a little nicer, but it’s the same idea underneath.</p>
<p>In 2001, I realized this problem already and implemented a configuration
setting called <code>dynamic_library_path</code>, which allows you to set a different
location for your shared library. Then you can say</p>
  <code>dynamic_library_path = '/usr/local/my-stuff/something'
</code>  <p>And then Postgres would look there. The SQL file just knows where is
because you run it manually. You would then run</p>
  <code>psql -f /usr/local/my-stuff/something/something.sql
</code>  <p>That fixed that problem at the time. And when extensions were implemented, I
was essentially not paying attention or, you know, nobody was paying
attention. Extension support were a really super nice feature, of course, but
it broke this previously-available feature: then you couldn’t install your
extensions anywhere you wanted to; you were tied to this specific file system,
location, <code>dynamic_library_path</code> still existed: you could still set it
somewhere, but you couldn’t really make much use of it. I mean, you could make
use of it for things that are not extensions. If you have some kind of plugin
module or modules that install hooks, you could still do that. But not for an
extension that consist of a set of SQL scripts and a control file and
<code>dynamic_library_path</code>.</p>
<p>As I was being approached about these things, I realized that was just the
problem and we should just now fix that. The recent history went as follows.</p>
<p>In April, 2024, just about a year ago now, David Wheeler started <a href="https://postgr.es/m/E7C7BFFB-8857-48D4-A71F-88B359FADCFD@justatheory.com">a hackers
thread</a> suggesting <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/author/christoph_berg/">Christoph Berg</a>’s Debian patch as a starting point for
discussions. Like, “here’s this thing, shouldn’t we do something about this?”</p>
<p>There was, a fair amount of discussion. I was not really involved at the time.
This was just after feature freeze,and so I wasn’t paying much attention to
it. But the discussion was quite lively and a lot of people pitched in and
had their ideas and thoughts about it. And so a lot of important, filtering
work was done at that time.</p>
<p>Later, in September, <a href="https://www.gabrielebartolini.it">Gabriele</a>, my colleague from EDB who
works on <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a>, approached me about this issue and said like: “hey,
this is important, we need this to make extensions useful in the Kubernetes
environment.” And he said, “can you work, can you work on this?”</p>
<p>I said, “yeah, sure, in a couple months I might have time.” [Laughs]. But it
sort of turns out that, at <a href="https://pgconf.eu">PGConf.EU</a> we had a big brain trust meeting of
various people who basically all came and said, “hey, I heard you’re working
on <code>extension_control_path</code>, I also need that!”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gabrielebartolini.it">Gabriele</a> was there, and <a href="https://github.com/tbussmann">Tobias Bussmann</a> from
<a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a> was there ,and <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/author/christoph_berg/">Christoph</a>, and I was like,
yeah, I really need this <code>extension_control_path</code> to make this work. So I made
sure to talk to everybody there and, and make sure that, if we did this, would
it work for you? And then we kind of had a good idea of how it should work.</p>
<p>In November the first patch was posted and last week it was <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/4f7f7b0">committed</a>. I
think there’s still a little bit of discussion of some details and, we
certainly still have some time before the release to fine tune it, but the
main work is hopefully done.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/4f7f7b0">the commit</a> I made last week. The fact that this presentation was
scheduled gave me additional motivation to get it done. I wanna give some
credits to people who reviewed it. Obviously David did a lot of reviews and
feedback in general. My colleague Matheus, who I think I saw him earlier, he
was also here on the call, did help me quite a bit with sort of finishing the
patch. And then Gabriele, Marco and Nicolò, who work on <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a>, did a
large amount of testing.</p>
<p>They set up a whole sort of sandbox environment making test images for
extensions and, simulating the entire process of attaching these to the main
image. Again, I’m butchering the terminology, but I’m just trying to explain
it in general terms. They did the whole end-to-end testing of what that would
then look like with <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a>. And again, that will, I assume, be
discussed when Gabriele <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/events/306551747/" title="PostgreSQL Extension Mini Summit: Extension Management in CNPG">presents</a> in a few weeks.</p>
<p>These are the stats from the patch</p>

</code> <p>the reason I show this is that, it’s not big! What I did is use the same
infrastructure and mechanisms that already existed for the
<code>dynamic_library_path</code>. That’s the code in that’s in <code>dfmgr</code> there in the
middle. That’s where this little path search is implemented9. And then of
course, in <code>extension..c</code> there’s some code that’s basically just a bunch of
utility functions, like to list all the extensions and list all the versions
of all the extensions. Those utility functions exist and they needed to be
updated to do the path search. Everything else is pretty straightforward.
There’s just a few configuration settings added to the documentation and the
sample files and so on. It’s not that much really.</p>
<p>One thing we also did was add tests for this, Down there in <code>test_extensions</code>.
We wrote some tests to make sure this works. Well, it’s one thing to make sure
it works, but the other thing is if we wanna make changes or we find problems
with it, or we wanna develop this further in the future, we have a record of
how it works, which is why you write tests. I just wanted to point that out
because we didn’t really have that before and it was quite helpful to build
confidence that we know how this works.</p>
<p>So how does it work? Let’s say you have your Postgres installation in a
standard Linux file system package controlled location. None of the actual
packages look like this, I believe, but it’s a good example. You have your
stuff under the <code>/usr/bin/</code>, you have the shared libraries in the
<code>/usr/lib/something</code>, you have the extension control files and SQL files in
the <code>/usr/share/</code> or something. That’s your base installation. And then you
wanna install your extension into some other place to keep these things
separate. So you have <code>/usr/local/mystuff/</code>, for example.</p>
<p>Another thing that this patch implemented is that you can now also do this:
when you build an extension, you can write <code>make install prefix=something</code>.
Before you couldn’t do that, but there was also no point because if you
installed it somewhere else, you couldn’t do anything with it there. Now you
can load it from somewhere else, but you can also install it there — which
obviously are the two important sides of that.</p>
<p>And then you set these two settings: <code>dynamic_library_path</code> is an existing
configuration setting, yYou set that to where your lib directory is, and then
the <code>extension_control_path</code> is a new setting. The titular setting of this
talk, where you tell it where your extension control files are.</p>
<p>There’s these placeholders, <code>$libdir</code> and <code>$system</code> which mean the system
location, and then the other locations are your other locations, and it’s
separated by colon (and semi-colon on Windows). We had some arguments about
what exactly the <code>extension_control_path</code> placeholder should be called and,
people continue to have different opinions. What it does is it looks in the
list directories for the control file, and then where it finds the control
file from there, it loads all the other files.</p>
<p>And there’s a fairly complicated mechanism. There’s obviously the actual SQL
files, but there’s also these auxiliary control files, which I didn’t even
know that existed. So you can have version specific control files. It’s a
fairly complicated system, so we wanted to be clear  that what is happening is
the, the main control file  is searched for in these directories, and then
wherever it’s found, that’s where it looks for the other things. You can’t
have the control file in one path and then the SQL files in another part of
the path; that’s not how it works.</p>
<p>That solves problem number five. Let’s see what problem number five was. I
forgot [Chuckles]. This is the basic problem, that you no longer have to
install the extensions in the directories that are ostensibly controlled by
the operating system or your package manager.</p>
<p>So then how would Debian packaging use this? I got this information from
<a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/author/christoph_berg/">Christoph</a>. He figured out how to do this. He just said, “Oh,
I did this, and that’s how it works.” During packaging, the packaging scripts
that built it up in packages that you just pass these:</p>
  <code>PKGARGS="--pgoption extension_control_path=$PWD/debian/$PACKAGE/usr/share/postgresql/$v/extension:\$system
--pgoption dynamic_library_path=$PWD/debian/$PACKAGE/usr/lib/postgresql/$v/lib:/usr/lib/postgresql/$v/lib"
</code>  <p>These options set the control path and the <code>dynamic_library_path</code> and these
versions and then it works. This was confirmed that this addresses his
problem. He no longer has to carry his custom patch. This solves problem
number three.</p>
<p>The question people ask is, “why do we have two?” Or maybe you’ve asked
yourself that. Why do we need two settings. We have the
<code>dynamic_library_path</code>, we have the <code>extension_control_path</code>. Isn’t that kind
of the same thing? Kind of, yes! But in general, it is not guaranteed that
these two things are in a in a fixed relative location.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to our fake example. We have the libraries in
<code>/usr/lib/postgresql</code> and the SQL and control files in
<code>/usr/share/postgresql</code>, for example. Now you could say, why don’t we just set
it to <code>/usr</code>? Or, for example, why don’t we just set the path to
<code>/usr/local/mystuff</code> and it should figure out the sub directories. That would
be nice, but it doesn’t quite work in general because it’s not guaranteed that
those are the subdirectories. There could be, for example. <code>lib64</code>, for
example, right? Or some other so architecture-specific subdirectory names. Or
people can just name them whatever they want. So, this may be marginal, but it
is possible. You need to keep in mind that the subdirectory structure is not
necessarily fixed.</p>
<p>So we need two settings. The way I thought about this, if you compile C code,
you also have two settings. And if you think about it, it’s exactly the same
thing. When you compile C code, you always have to do <code>-I</code> and <code>-L</code>: <code>I</code> for
the include files, <code>L</code> for the  lib files. This is basically the same thing.
The include file is also the text file that describes the interfaces and the
libraries are the libraries. Again, you need two options, because you can’t
just tell the compiler, oh, look for it in <code>/usr/local</code> because the
subdirectories could be different. There could be architecture specific lib
directories. That’s a common case. You need those two settings. Usually they
go in parallel. If somebody has a plan on how to do it simpler, follow up
patches are welcome.</p>
<p>But the main point of why this approach was taken is also to get it done in a
few months. I started thinking about this, or I was contacted about this in
September and I started thinking about it seriously in the October/November
timeframe. That’s quite late in the development cycle to start a feature like
this, which I thought would be more controversial! People haven’t really
complained that this breaks the security of extensions or anything like that.
I was a little bit afraid of that.</p>
<p>So I wanted to really base it on an existing facility that we already had, and
that’s why I wanted to make sure it works exactly in parallel to the other
path that we already have, and that has existed for a long time, and was
designed for this exact purpose. That was also the reason why we chose this
path of least resistance, perhaps.</p>
<p>This is the solution progress for the six problems that I described initially.
The <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a> folks obviously have accompanied this project actively and
have already prototyped the integration solution. And, and presumably we will
hear about some of that at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/events/306551747/" title="PostgreSQL Extension Mini Summit: Extension Management in CNPG">meeting on May 7th</a>, where
Gabriele will talk about this.</p>
<p><a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a> I haven’t been in touch with, but one of the maintainers is
here, maybe you can give feedback later. Debian is done as I described, and
they will also be at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/events/306682786/" title="PostgreSQL Extension Mini Summit: Apt Extension Packaging">the next meeting</a>, maybe there will be some
comment on that.</p>
<p>One thing that’s not fully implemented is the the <code>make check</code> issue. I did
send a follow-up patch about that, which was a really quick prototype hack,
and people really liked it. I’m slightly tempted to give it a push and try to
get it into Postgres 18. This is a work in progress, but it’s, there’s sort of
a way forward. The local install problem I said is done.</p>
<p><a href="https://brew.sh" title="The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)">Homebrew</a>, I haven’t looked into. It’s more complicated, and I’m also not
very closely involved in the development of that. I’ll just be an outsider
maybe sending patches or suggestions at some point, maybe when the release is
closer and, and we’ve settled everything.</p>
<p>I have some random other thoughts here. I’m not actively working on these
right now, but I have worked on it in the past and I plan to work on it again.
Basically the conversion of all the building to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-meson.html">Meson</a> is on my mind, and
other people’s mind.</p>
<p>Right now we have two build systems: the <code>make</code> build system and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-meson.html">Meson</a>
build system, and all the production packages, as far as I know, are built
with <code>make</code>. Eventually we wanna move all of that over to Meson, but we want
to test all the extensions and if it still works. As far as I know, it does
work; there’s nothing that really needs to be implemented, but we need to go
through all the extensions and test them.</p>
<p>Secondly — this is optional; I’m not saying this is a requirement — but
you may wish to also build your own extensions with Meson. But that’s in my
mind, not a requirement. You can also use <code>cmake</code> or do whatever you want. But
there’s been some prototypes of that. Solutions exist if you’re interested.</p>
<p>And to facilitate the second point, there’s been the proposal — which I
think was well received, but it just needs to be fully implemented — to
provide a <code>pkg-config</code> file to build against the server, and <code>cmake</code> and Meson
would work very well with that. Then you can just say  here’s a <code>pkg-config</code>
file to build against the server. It’s much easier than setting all the
directories yourself or extracting them from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgconfig.html"><code>pg_config</code></a>. Maybe that’s
something coming for the next release cycle.</p>
<p>That’s what I had. So <code>extension_control_path</code> is coming in Postgres 18. What
you can do is test and validate that against your use cases and and help
integration into the downstream users. Again, if you’re sort of a package or
anything like that, you know, you can make use of that. That is all for me.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
 Questions, comments 
 
 
<p>Reading the comments where several audience members suggested Peter
follows Conference Driven Development he confirmed that that’s definitely
a thing.</p>
 
 
<p>Someone asked for the “requirements gathering document”. Peter said that
that’s just a big word for “just some notes I have”. “It’s not like an
actual document. I called it the requirements gathering. That sounds very
formal, but it’s just chatting to various people and someone at the next
table overheard us talking and it’s like, ‘Hey! I need that too!’”</p>
 
 
<p>Christoph: I tried to get this fixed or implemented or something at least
once over the last 10 something-ish years, and was basically shot down on
grounds of security issues if people mess up their system. And what
happens if you set the extension path to something, install an extension,
and then set the path to something else and then you can’t upgrade. And
all sorts of weird things that people can do with their system in order to
break them. Thanks for ignoring all that bullshit and just getting it
done! It’s an administrator-level setting and people can do whatever they
want with it.</p>
<p>So what I then did is just to implement that patch and, admittedly I never
got around to even try to put it upstream. So thanks David for pushing
that ahead. It was clear that the Debian version of the patch wasn’t
acceptable because it was too limited. It made some assumptions about the
direct restructure of Debian packages. So it always included the prefix in
the path. The feature that Peter implemented solves my problem. It does
solve a lot of more problems, so thanks for that.</p>
 
 
<p>Peter: Testing all extensions. What we’ve talked about is doing this
through the Debian packaging system because the idea was to maybe make a
separate branch or a separate sub-repository of some sort, switch it to
build Meson, and rebuild all the extension packages and see what happens.
I guess that’s how far we’ve come. I doesn’t actually mean they all work,
but I guess that most of them has tests, so we just wanted to test, see
if it works.</p>
<p>There are some really subtle problems. Well, the ones I know of have been
fixed, but there’s some things that certain compilation options are not
substituted into the <code>Makefile</code>s correctly, so then all your extensions
are built without any optimizations, for example, without any <code>-O</code>
options. I’m not really sure how to detect those automatically, but at
least, just rebuild everything once might be an option. Or just do it
manually. There are not thousands of extensions. There are not even
hundreds that are relevant. There are several dozens, and I think that’s
good coverage.</p>
 
 
<p>Christoph: I realize that doing it on the packaging side makes sense
because we all have these tests running. So I was looking into it. The
first time I tried, I stopped once I realized that Meson doesn’t support
LLVM yet; and the second time I tried, I just <code>diff</code>-ed the generated
<code>Makefile</code>s to see if there’s any difference that looks suspicious. At
thus point I should just continue and do compilation run and see what the
tests are doing and and stuff.</p>
<p>So my hope would be that I could run <code>diff</code> on the results; the problem is
compiling with Postgres with Autoconf once and then with Meson the second
time, then see if it has an impact on the extensions compiled. But my idea
was that if I’m just running <code>diff</code> on the two compilations and there’s no
difference, there’s no point in testing because they’re identical anyway.</p>
 
 
<p>Peter Oooh, you want the actual compilation, for the <code>Makefile</code> output to
be the same.</p>
 
 
<p>Christoph: Yeah. I don’t have to run that test, But the <code>diff</code> was a bit
too big to be readable. There was lots of white space noise in there. But
there were also some actual changes. Some were not really bad, like9 in
some points variables were using a fully qualified path for the <code>make</code>
directory or something, and then some points not; but, maybe we can just
work on making that difference smaller and then arguing about correctness
is easier.</p>
 
 
<p>Peter: Yeah, that sounds like a good approach.</p>
 
 
<p>Jakob: Maybe I can give some feedback from <a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a>. So, thank you
very much. I think this solves a lot of problems that we have had with
extensions over the years, especially because it allows us to separate the
extensions and the main Postgres distribution. For Postgres.app we
basically have to decide which extensions to include and we can’t offer
additional extensions when people ask for them without shipping them for
everyone. So that’s a big win.</p>
<p>One question I am wondering about is the use case of people building their
own extensions. As far as I understand, you have to provide the prefix/
And one thing I’m wondering whether there is there some way to give a
default value for the prefix. Like in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgconfig.html"><code>pg_config</code></a> or in something like
that, so people who just type <code>make install</code> automatically get some path.</p>
 
 
<p>Peter: That might be an interesting follow on. I’m making a note of it.
I’m not sure how you’d…</p>
 
 
<p>Jakob: I’m just thinking because a big problem is that a lot of people who
try things don’t follow the instructions for the specific Postgres. So for
example, if we write documentation how to build extensions and people on a
completely different system — like people Google stuff and they get
instruction — they’ll just try random paths. Right now, if you just
type <code>make install</code>, it works on most systems because it just builds into
the standard directories.</p>
 
 
<p>Peter: Yeah, David puts it like, “should there be a different default
extension location?” I think that’s probably not an unreasonable
direction. I think that’s something we should maybe think about, once this
is stabilized. I think for your <a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a> use case, it, I think you
could probably even implement that yourself with a one or two line patch
so that at least, if you install Postgres.app, then somebody tries to
build an extension, they get a reasonable location.</p>
 
 
<p>David: If I could jump in there, Jakob, my assumption was that
<a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a> would do something like designate the <code>Application Support</code>
directory and <code>Preferences</code> in <code>~/Library</code> as where extensions should be
installed. And yeah, there could be some patch to PGXS to put stuff there
by default.</p>
 
 
<p>Jakob: Yeah, that would be nice!</p>
 
 
<p>Peter: Robert asked a big question here. What do we think the security
consequences of this patch? Well, one of the premises is that we already
have <code>dynamic_library_path</code>, which works exactly the same way, and there
haven’t been any concerns about that. Well, maybe there have been
concerns, but nothing that was acted on. If you set the path to somewhere
where anybody can write stuff, then yeah, that’s not so good. But that’s
the same as anything. Certainly there were concerns as I read through the
discussion.</p>
<p>I assumed somebody would hav security questions, so I really wanted to
base it on this existing mechanism and not invent something completely
new. So far nobody has objected to it [Chuckles]. But yeah, of course you
can make a mess of it if you go into that <code>extension_control_path = /tmp</code>!
That’s probably not good. But don’t do that.</p>
 
 
<p>David: That’s I think in part the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor">xz exploit</a> kind of made people more
receptive to this patch because we want to reduce the number of patches
that packaging maintainers have to maintain.</p>
 
 
<p>Peter: Obviously this is something people do. Better we have one solution
that people then can use and that we at least we understand, as opposed to
everybody going out and figuring out their own complicated solutions.</p>
 
 
<p>David: Peter, I think there are still some issues with the behavior of
<code>MODULEDIR</code> from PGXS and <code>directory</code> in the control file that this
doesn’t quite work with this extension. Do you have some thoughts on how
to address those issues?</p>
 
 
<p>Peter: For those who are not following: there’s an existing, I guess,
rarely used feature that, in the control file, you can specify directory
options, which then specifies where other files are located. And this
doesn’t work the way you think it should maybe it’s not clear what that
should do if you find it in a path somewhere. I guess it’s so rarely used
that we might maybe just get rid of it; that was one of the options.</p>
<p>In my mental model of how the C compiler works, it sets an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath"><code>rpath</code></a> on
something. If you set an absolute <code>rpath</code> somewhere and you know it’s not
gonna work if you move the thing to a different place in the path. I’m not
sure if that’s a good analogy, but it sort of has similar consequences. If
you hard-code absolute path, then path search is not gonna work. But yeah,
that’s on the list I need to look into.</p>
 
 
<p>David: For what it’s worth, I discovered last week that the part of this
patch where you’re stripping out <code>$libdir</code> and the extension make file that
was in modules, I think? That also needs to be done when you use <code>rpath</code>
to install an extension and point to extensions today with Postgres 17.
Happy to see that one go.</p>
 
 
<p>Christoph: Thanks for fixing that part. I was always wondering why this
was broken. The way it was broken. It looked very weird and it turned out
it was just broken and not me not understanding it.</p>
 
 
<p>David: I think it might have been a documentation oversight back when
extensions were added at 9.1 to say this is how you list the modules.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is great! Im super excited for this patch and where it’s
going and the promise for stuff in the future. Just from your list of the
six issues it addresses, it’s obviously something that covers a
variety of pain points. I appreciate you doing that.</p>
 
 
<p>Peter: Thank you!</p>
 
 
<p>Many thanks and congratulations wrap up this call.</p>

<p>Hi – this is Gergely with the monthly, free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. If you’ve been forwarded this email, you can <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about">subscribe here</a>.</p><p>It’s been widely reported that the tech hiring market is much cooler than in 2020-2022; the number of software engineering job openings <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/state-of-eng-market-2024">is down internationally in all major regions</a> and the number of full-remote roles <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/150567054/how-common-are-remote-jobs">is in steady decline</a>. Meanwhile, other metrics indicate that tech hiring is starting to recover – at least for senior engineers – as covered last month in the article, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/startup-market-in-2025">State of the startup and scaleup hiring markets, as seen by recruiters</a>. It all adds up to a state of flux for candidates and employers to navigate through.</p><p>This article is an attempt to get clarity about how tech interviews are changing, by focusing on what the engineers who take interviews are seeing. For this, I turned to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-king-40072280/">Evan King</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanmai/">Stefan Mai</a>, cofounders of interview preparation startup, <a href="https://www.hellointerview.com/">Hello Interview</a>. Before starting it, Evan was a staff engineer at Meta for 4 years, and Stefan an engineering manager at Amazon for 6 years, and also a senior engineering manager at Meta. They’ve conducted hundreds of interviews, while Stefan has also been a hiring manager. Since launching their new business, they’ve helped thousands of engineers prepare for interviews, and have collected information on the pulse of the job market.</p><p>I reached out to them after reading their practical, fresh take <a href="https://hellointerview.substack.com/p/modern-hardware-numbers-for-system">on system design interviews</a>, for candid takes on devs interviewing at startups and Big Tech in the current climate, especially compared to a few years ago. Today, we cover:</p>  <p>New reality of tech hiring. A rebounding market still well below its 2021-2022 peak.</p>  <p>Analyzing the tech hiring market. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related sectors are hot, while frontend/backend/mobile are not. It’s tougher for new grads than experienced engineers.</p>  <p>Interview process changes. The formats of DSA and system design interviews remain the same, but are more demanding. Downleveling is more common, and team matching has quietly become another hurdle to clear.</p>  <p>Interview formats differ between startups and Big Tech. Startups embrace more practical interviews and AI tools, while Big Tech seems less flexible about changing approach.</p>  <p>Preparation strategies by experience. Advice for entry-level, mid-level, senior, staff+ tech professionals, and for EMs.</p>  <p>Silver linings. Big Tech hiring is up, there’s a boom in AI positions, and the playbook of interviews is public.</p>  <p>In the article below we’ll cover how demand for engineers in the AI field keeps being strong. For pointers on picking up engineering practices, see the deepdives <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-in-the-real-world">AI Engineering in the real world</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-with-chip-huyen">AI Engineering with Chip Huyen</a>.</p><p>With that, it’s over to Evan and Stefan:</p>    1. New reality of tech hiring <p>Three years ago, if you were a competent software engineer with 3+ years of experience, you likely had recruiters flooding your inbox with opportunities. Companies were fighting over engineering talent, throwing extraordinary compensation packages at candidates, and in some cases even looking past poor interview performance in order to secure hires faster. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/perfect-storm-causing-a-hot-tech-hiring-market">The 2020-2021 tech hiring frenzy</a> was exceptional; a period many now look back on with a mixture of nostalgia and disbelief.</p><p>Fast forward to 2025, and the landscape has transformed dramatically. As co-founders of HelloInterview.com, we've had front row seats to these changes, observing tens of thousands of engineering interview journeys across companies of all sizes. In this deepdive, we aim to give you the unvarnished reality of tech interviewing in 2025, via real experiences of candidates navigating it today.</p><p>We’ve observed Big Tech’s hiring volumes are up roughly 40% year on year. This data comes from candidates currently working at late-stage companies, of whom the overwhelming majority use our platform to prepare for interviews they already have scheduled. This provides a reliable proxy for overall tech hiring trends, as candidates on our platform have immediate, concrete interview dates. An uptick in candidates getting more interviews suggests that the worst of the 2022-2023 tech winter has passed, and that there are more attractive openings worth preparing for. Still, we're operating in a fundamentally different market with new rules, expectations, and challenges.</p><p>The 40%-rebound figure is only part of the story. Yes, tech hiring is slowly making a comeback in aggregate terms, but it's a selective, strategic recovery that leaves some qualified engineers struggling to navigate processes which are now more demanding and less forgiving. Companies once desperate to fill seats are now being methodical and cautious, prioritizing precision in hiring decisions over speed and volume.</p><p>What we're witnessing isn't simply a market correction; it’s a subtle yet significant shift in evaluation standards. While the core interview structure at Big Tech remains largely unchanged, the bar has shifted approximately one standard deviation higher across the board, and performance that would have secured an offer in 2021 might not even clear the screening stage today.</p> 2. Analyzing the tech hiring market <p>Here’s our take on the current job market.</p> Selective recovery <p>By the raw numbers, tech hiring appears on a solid upward trajectory. <a href="http://trueup.io">TrueUp.io</a>'s job trend tracking shows tech job postings have risen from a 2023 low of 163,000, to approximately 230,000 today; roughly a 41% increase.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0eddf17-c535-41a5-90f4-471e10e7c07e_1600x1130.png">          </a>Number of open tech jobs at tech startups, tech unicorns, and public tech companies. Source: <a href="https://trueup.io/job-trend">TrueUp</a> <p>The 42% increase in openings is consistent with what we've observed internally in HelloInterview usage metrics and mock interview volume, when we adjust data for candidates with interviews scheduled.</p><p>We are still well below the feverish heights of 2020-2022, though. Back then, open roles peaked at close to 500,000. The current recovery, while significant, has only restored us to around 46% of that peak.</p><p>Unlike previous tech hiring cycles when a rising tide lifted all boats, today's market is characterized by extreme selectivity. Companies have become far more picky about where they invest headcount, with major differences in opportunity based on specialization, experience level, and the prestige of ex-employers.</p> Domain specialization <p>Engineers in certain areas of specialization are seeing a lot of relevant openings, such as in:</p>  <p>AI infrastructure</p>  <p>Machine learning operations</p>  <p>Generative AI application development</p>  <p>These areas of hiring are reminiscent of the 2021 peak; often with multiple offers, aggressive compensation, and expedited interview processes.</p><p>For example, a Bay Area staff engineer specializing in AI infrastructure at Google recently received a competing offer from Meta's AI infrastructure team which was above $1 million in total compensation. Previously at Google, numbers like this were typically reserved for senior staff positions. But getting a large pay bump when changing companies, while staying at the same level, is not an isolated incident; we're seeing similar-sized compensation packages for specialists in high-performance computing, ML systems design, and those specializing in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai?view=azureml-api-2">responsible AI development</a>.</p><p>Engineers in “core” domains see fewer opportunities. “Core domains” refers to frontend, backend services, mobile development, and similar areas. Later-stage startups that previously maintained multiple teams in these areas have consolidated with more empowered full-stack engineers. Focusing on full-stack leads to lower overall headcount, fewer openings, and more selective hiring processes. We see candidates with strong backgrounds in these areas often taking a long time to land a role, and when they do get an offer, the comp growth is rarely above what they currently earn. Note from Gergely: we previously saw how <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/native-vs-cross-platform">native mobile engineers face a tougher job market</a>, and that <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/141204650/getting-a-new-job-as-a-software-engineer">becoming more full-stack</a> is a sensible strategy for being more employable.</p><p>Senior engineers can still attract multiple offers, especially those with directly relevant experience for hiring companies. This could be deep domain expertise (e.g. working in the infrastructure domain when interviewing for infra teams, working in the finance domain when interviewing with FinTechs, etc), or it could be a deep technology expertise which matters to the employer. Meanwhile, engineers with less transferable skills face an uphill battle. Narrow skillsets often develop from working at the likes of Google or Meta, where people specialize narrowly in proprietary systems, tools, and technologies that don’t exist in the broader market.</p> Experience level divide <p>The current market is also starkly stratified by career stage, creating dramatically different realities for engineers depending on experience:</p><p>Junior engineers and new grads face the biggest challenge. We spoke with a job seeker based in India who graduated from IIT – the most prestigious computer science university in the country. They shared a meticulously-maintained spreadsheet of their job search:</p>  <p>6 months of searching</p>  <p>100 companies contacted; all known to hire from IIT</p>  <p>4 initial interviews</p>  <p>Zero offers</p>  <p>Companies that once maintained robust university hiring programs have dramatically scaled them back, which is concerning because this could create an experience gap that impacts the industry for years to come, and could manifest in a “missing generation” of engineers. This could create an industry-wide shortage of early and mid-career talent; potentially stalling innovation, as fewer fresh perspectives enter the field and challenge established practices.</p><p>Mid-career engineers: more interview loops to an offer. By mid-career engineers we refer to professionals with around 3-4 years of experience at respected companies. Candidates with this background are generally securing interviews, but the number of interview loops they go through to get an offer has increased substantially.</p><p>For example, a high achieving, mid-level engineer in the Bay Area with 4 years of experience at Amazon went through eleven full interview loops at different scaleups and tech companies before receiving their first – and only – offer!</p><p>Senior and staff engineers with high-demand specializations: premium comp and multiple offers. Companies are willing to pay significantly above <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal">market rate</a> for proven expertise in AI, infrastructure, and security. Such candidates often have the luxury of choosing between competing offers and negotiating aggressively.</p><p>One of Evan’s recent mentees is a principal SDE, based in the Bay Area, working in one of Microsoft's AI infrastructure groups. This Principal SDE received competing offers from NVIDIA, Snowflake, Meta, and other places – all within a single month!</p><p>Engineering managers face a tough market. Widespread organizational restructuring swept through tech in 2022-2023, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-38">eliminating entire management layers</a>, and companies have been slow to restore these positions since. As a result, many qualified engineering leaders now compete for a significantly reduced pool of opportunities. The heightened competition has transformed hiring standards.</p><p>Technical abilities once overlooked for managers are now meticulously evaluated, and system design skills are also becoming non-negotiable. In the past, managers were often hired primarily on leadership capabilities, but today, they need to prove leadership, as well as being hands-on with technology, software engineering, and software design.</p><p>The priorities in leadership roles have also shifted dramatically. Many tech companies previously focused on big-organization skills to build alignment across large teams. Today, those companies seek senior leaders who can remain focused on execution and support the higher executive layer; they’re usually not looking for senior leaders who want to remain at the high-level, interested in only steering the ship.</p><p>This transition to engineering leaders being expected to be hands-on feeds into longstanding debates about the distinction between engineering managers and technical leads. After all, today’s engineering leaders look awfully similar to yesterday’s tech leads! This change is reshaping what companies expect from their engineering leadership.</p> 3. Interview process changes <p>Tech interviews are changing, and below are the biggest shifts from a few years ago that we’ve observed.</p> DSA interviews: elevated technical bar <p>On one hand, the fundamental structure of technical interviews hasn't radically changed. On the other, expectations have become significantly more demanding. Companies are simply setting a higher standard for what constitutes a passing performance.</p><p>In data structure and algorithm (DSA) interviews, engineers face noticeably harder problems at every stage of the process. One senior engineer interviewed at Google in 2021, and did so again last year. They told us:</p><blockquote><p>"I used to think that <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/?difficulty=HARD">LeetCode ‘hard’ problems</a> were never asked at Google. Now [in 2024] they seem to have become the norm."</p></blockquote><p>Beyond pure difficulty, we're seeing more emphasis on the completeness of implementation. Interviewers now routinely expect things like:</p>  <p>proper error handling</p>  <p>robust input validation</p>  <p>clean code</p>  <p>…all within the same time constraints as before.</p>  <p>There is little incentive to pass someone who doesn't get everything entirely correct. This is the grim reality of what happens when there are so many qualified candidates in the interview pool.</p> System design interviews: higher expectations <p>System design interviews have undergone an equally dramatic elevation. Senior-level candidates we talk to report being expected to demonstrate familiarity with modern distributed systems concepts that previously might have only been expected at staff levels.</p><p>Specialized knowledge has even crept into standard interviews. For example, geospatial indexing was once considered niche, but now has become commonplace in popular system design questions like "find nearby friends," Yelp-like applications, or ride-sharing platforms like Uber. We now advise candidates of all levels to have at least a basic familiarity with concepts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash">geohashing</a> and spatial data structures (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">quadtrees</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree">R-trees</a>) – as silly as that sounds. The same trends apply as to DSA: more candidates, more competition, a higher bar for hiring.</p><p>One staff engineer candidate we worked with really stood out. He had worked at Google in Seattle for almost 15 years, and was re-entering the market for the first time since. He was taken aback by the expectations in modern interviews compared to when he joined Google. As someone who had never before worked on stream processing systems, he found it frustrating that companies he interviewed at expected him to have intimate familiarity with concepts like <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/kafka/exactly-once.html">exactly-once semantics</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function"> windowing techniques</a>, and <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/structured-streaming/watermarks">watermarking algorithms</a>. He told us:</p><blockquote><p>"I’ve built and maintained critical infrastructure for over a decade, but suddenly I'm expected to have specialized knowledge in areas completely unrelated to my expertise. It’s just so frustrating."</p></blockquote><p>It's easy to empathize. At the same time, it's also easy to see how the luxury of choice with candidates leads to this. This elevation in technical expectations isn't arbitrary; with reduced hiring volumes, companies can afford to be more selective, and many are specifically looking for engineers who can contribute across a broader range of problems. Engineers with deep but narrow specialisms have fewer opportunities in this environment.</p> Downleveling <p>Downleveling seems to be a new trend. With heightened hiring bars and current market conditions, we're seeing candidates routinely receiving offers a level below their current position, particularly at the senior and staff levels.</p><p>In one case, Stefan worked with a candidate at Meta who successfully completed the interview process for a senior position later, but the offer was withdrawn and they were offered a mid-level role instead. This downleveling was due to a new policy requiring candidates to have at least six years of experience for senior positions. Personally, it’s heartbreaking – and arbitrary! – to see companies strongarm talent like this. The candidate ultimately accepted the offer, not being able to secure a better one.</p><p>This trend is particularly true for staff-level engineers, with many being offered senior positions even when they meet but don't easily exceed the staff-level bar. Companies have calculated that with less competition for talent, they can implement more aggressive leveling practices, and many candidates are accepting lower level offers after months of searching.</p><p>The long-term career implications of this are significant, as it often requires 2-3 years to get back to their former level. Despite this impact on career trajectory, we're seeing acceptance rates for down-leveled offers increase significantly as candidates prioritize stability in an uncertain market. Note from Gergely: we previously covered downleveling in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-seniority-rollercoaster">The seniority rollercoaster</a>.</p> Team match evolution <p>Perhaps the most significant structural change in the interview process has been the evolution of team matching. This is a process, now popular at Meta and Google, where candidates first pass an interview but don't receive offers until they match with a team.</p><p>This team matching approach has been adopted more broadly at larger tech companies, but with a slightly ugly twist: it's increasingly functioning as an additional filter, rather than for the candidate’s benefit.</p><p>We observe that team matching introduces a new set of "interviews" with hiring managers for candidates to navigate. It’s positioned as a mutual selection process, but the reality is that it's become another hurdle candidates must clear before securing an offer.</p><p>Meta notably overhauled its hiring process in 2024, eliminating most aspects of its longstanding "bootcamp" program, in which new hires joined the company first, and then found their team during bootcamp. In its place, they've implemented a team matching system that requires candidates to secure a team match before receiving a final offer.</p><p>The outcomes have been problematic for many candidates. One staff engineer we worked with who passed all technical rounds at Meta with strong, positive feedback, waited four months in team match limbo. To make things worse, by the time the team match completed, all their competing offers had expired!</p><p>When a match finally materialized, the offer was significantly below initial expectations, with little room for negotiation in the absence of alternatives. We see that team-matching backlogs seem to have been cleared as of late at Meta, but waiting many months remains common, especially in more competitive markets like New York City.</p><p>Indeed, some companies appear to be using team matching delays strategically as a negotiation tactic. Meanwhile, team-matching processes have morphed from giving candidates options, into additional screening layers where qualified candidates often find themselves eliminated or in limbo.</p><p>Team matching has evolved into a de facto second interview, despite companies' efforts to present it otherwise. From our conversations with hiring managers, we've found they commonly interview ten candidates to fill a single position. These managers strongly advise candidates to thoroughly prepare for this phase and customize their presentations specifically for the team they want to join.</p><p>Stefan advises candidates to plan for this phase and use it to their advantage. It’s true that the team matching process is slow – but this can create an opportunity to synchronize offers by scheduling interviews without team matching in place for later. Having several offers gives crucial leverage in negotiations.</p> 4. Interview format differences at startups and Big Tech <p>With the rise of AI and growing skepticism about traditional coding interviews, we're seeing a widening gap between how Big Tech and newer companies do interviews.</p><p>Traditional FAANG employers remain largely committed to their existing formats, with only minor adjustments. As one FAANG head of recruiting told us:</p><blockquote><p>"The inertia of these processes is enormous. These companies have built entire recruiting machines around their current processes, with years of calibration data. They're reluctant to make dramatic changes without compelling evidence that alternatives would work better at scale."</p></blockquote><p>Organizationally, changes to the interview process are often gatekept by engineering executives who would prefer to wait for a fire, than potentially create a problem at the first smell of smoke.</p><p>Several mid-sized companies have moved toward more realistic, open-ended coding challenges that better reflect actual work. Examples of places adopting more realistic interviews include Stripe, Coinbase, and OpenAI. Rather than solving LeetCode questions, candidates tackle problems like:</p>  <p>Designing a query engine</p>  <p>Implementing a key-value store</p>  <p>Designing an in-memory database to handle transactions</p>  <p>Early-stage startups have pushed even further, often replacing traditional coding exercises with take-home projects that explicitly allow the use of AI tools. Yangshun Tay, founder of GreatFrontEnd, has been a prominent voice on Linkedin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yangshun_softwareengineering-react-javascript-activity-7298571236723367936-_8E3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABExRcABJ3yzKC4MRWrv8iATSQK7FCXah9Y">advocating for this shift</a> in hiring practices. He <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yangshun_softwareengineering-react-javascript-activity-7298571236723367936-_8E3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABExRcABJ3yzKC4MRWrv8iATSQK7FCXah9Y">detailed</a> how his team successfully implemented this approach to better evaluate candidates' real-world problem-solving abilities:</p><blockquote><p>“Coming from Big Tech, I'm aware of the flaws of the typical interview process. Hence I use a somewhat different process when it comes to hiring Front End Engineers for GreatFrontEnd:</p><p>1. Zero LeetCode</p><p>2. Take-home assignment</p><p>3. The take-home assignment is a todo list (what?!)</p><p>4. Product sense is evaluated</p><p>5. Candidates who pass the take-home assignment know the upcoming interview questions beforehand and have ample time to prepare</p><p>6. Candidates get a perk for interviewing with us (...)</p><p>It's important to note that such an interview process is more time consuming than the standard LeetCode one and does not scale well with the number of applicants.”</p></blockquote><p>This shift serves a dual purpose: it better reflects real work conditions, while combating the growing problem of assessment fraud. One seed-stage AI founder in the Bay Area we spoke with estimated that at least 20% of candidates were obviously cheating in their traditional coding tests. The issue isn't limited to startups; one of Evan’s good friends, an Amazon interviewer, confided that half of his last ten candidates were obviously using AI tools on secondary screens during supposedly monitored assessments. By explicitly incorporating these tools into the evaluation process, companies are adapting to workplace realities and assessments’ integrity challenges.</p><p>Innovation in technical evaluation is bubbling up from smaller, more agile organizations, with Big Tech watching on from behind. This is an interesting inversion of the historical pattern wherein for the past decade, interview practices pioneered by Google and other tech giants trickled down to smaller companies eager to emulate their success. Now, it’s the opposite! One question is when or if FAANG employers will adapt to this new reality.</p><p>The truth is that Big Tech is unlikely to make changes to the hiring process without resounding, negative post-interview signals, which could be things like a significant quantity of unregretted attrition attributable to poor interview signals.</p><p>We think it’s more likely that Big Tech makes minor adjustments, like returning to on-site interviews in the short term. They recognize their current interview processes are essentially a game, but they do effectively identify candidates willing to invest in intensive preparation. Unfortunately for candidates, their willingness to grind through arbitrary algorithmic challenges correlates just enough with on-the-job characteristics of high-performing engineers to justify maintaining the status quo.</p><p>We wonder if sticking to existing interview approaches is increasingly unsustainable in the age of large language models (LLMs). As AI tools become more capable of solving the exact algorithmic puzzles used in interviews, the signal value of those assessments will inevitably diminish. No engineer in the future will need to manually code algorithms like parenthesis balancing or binary tree traversals; instead, they'll prompt an AI to generate that code. The companies pioneering more realistic, project-based assessments are adapting to the reality of how engineering work will actually be done moving forward.</p><p>What's clear is that candidates currently face a bifurcated landscape: prepare for traditional algorithm interviews for Big Tech roles, while simultaneously developing the skills to excel in more open-ended, practical evaluations for opportunities elsewhere.</p> 5. Preparation strategies by experience level <p>We’ve found that an optimal preparation strategy varies significantly by experience level, and the relative importance of different interview components change with career progress. Here are patterns we’ve observed:</p><p>For junior engineers with 0-2 years of experience, we’ve found this preparation the most effective:</p>  <p>80% of preparation time: focus on algorithms and coding problems</p>  <p>20%: preparation for the behavioral interviews</p>  <p>The technical bar for junior roles has risen dramatically, making mastery of fundamental algorithms and data structures essential. Successful junior candidates typically solve 150-200 coding problems across all difficulty levels before interviewing. You must be a stronger coder before anything else.</p><p>Mid-level engineers with 2-4 years of experience benefit from a more balanced approach:</p>  <p>50% coding</p>  <p>25% system design</p>  <p>25% preparation for behavioral interviews</p>  <p>At this level, companies expect strong implementation skills and emergent architectural thinking. The most successful mid-level candidates we work with develop a systematic approach to system design, focusing on building blocks they can combine and adapt, rather than memorizing specific solutions.</p><p>For senior engineers with 5-8 years’ experience, we’ve seen this setup work well:</p>  <p>50% preparation on system design</p>  <p>20% on coding</p>  <p>30% on behavioral interviews</p>  <p>The primary differentiator at this level is the ability to design robust, scalable systems while clearly articulating tradeoffs. Senior engineers are expected to handle ambiguity well, asking clarifying questions and making reasonable assumptions when information is incomplete.</p><p>The most common mistake we see from senior candidates is neglecting behavioral preparation. This is a critical error; at the senior level, companies are evaluating not just technical capability, but also leadership potential, conflict resolution skills, and cultural fit.</p><p>We've seen technically brilliant candidates fail interviews or get down-leveled unnecessarily because they couldn't effectively communicate their impact, describe how they influenced cross-functional teams, or demonstrate self-awareness about previous challenges. Behavioral preparation isn't a checkbox; it significantly impacts hiring decisions, especially at senior levels and above.</p><p>Staff+ engineers face a different challenge:</p>  <p>Coding: a baseline at this point; stumble here and rejection can be swift.</p>  <p>90% of differentiation comes from system design and behavioral/leadership assessments.</p>  <p>For these roles, companies look beyond implementation details to evaluate architectural vision, cross-functional leadership, and executive communication skills. Successful staff+ candidates demonstrate strategic thinking, connecting technical decisions to business outcomes in their system design discussions.</p><p>Top AI labs like OpenAI have their own distinct hiring patterns. Rather than prioritizing traditional leadership skills, they heavily filter by pedigree or headline achievements and strongly favor candidates from elite, high profile companies, AI-focused startups, prestigious universities, and those with flashy achievements which they can communicate easily. Without this, applicants face an uphill battle, regardless of their technical excellence.</p> Effective Practice <p>Let's acknowledge the reality that the tech interview process has become a specialized game that continues to deviate from day-to-day engineering work. This isn't ideal, but it's the reality. Companies have settled on standardized evaluation approaches that don't perfectly mirror actual job responsibilities, and this disconnect frustrates many engineers.</p><p>The good news is that the rules of the game are publicly known. It's essentially a “secret handshake” you need to learn to gain entry into these companies. The process might seem arbitrary, but with proper preparation, it's entirely learnable. Anyone with sufficient dedication can master these patterns and significantly improve their performance.</p><p>We recognize our bias here; as an interview preparation platform, we obviously believe in the value of structured practice. The data speaks for itself: candidates who engage in deliberate practice consistently outperform those who don't, regardless of natural ability or experience level. The patterns are clear across thousands of interview outcomes.</p><p>If investing in formal mock interviews doesn't fit your preferences or budget, that's completely understandable and there are numerous alternatives: find a friend who works at your target company, connect with peers on Reddit or Discord communities, or form study groups with other job seekers. The specific method matters less than the fundamental principle that interviewing is a skill that improves with practice, feedback, and iteration.</p><p>What doesn't work is assuming your daily engineering work has prepared you for the interview environment. The performance aspect of interviewing – thinking aloud, handling pressure, communicating clearly while solving problems – requires deliberate practice in conditions that mirror actual interviews. Without this, even brilliant engineers can struggle to demonstrate their capabilities within the artificial constraints of an interview process.</p> 6. Silver linings <p>The tech hiring landscape of 2025 is a far cry from the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/perfect-storm-causing-a-hot-tech-hiring-market">job seekers’ gold rush of 2020-2021</a>. The pendulum has swung hard from "please take our money" to "prove you're worth it," and engineers are feeling the squeeze. But don't throw in the towel!</p><p>Major tech companies including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Meta, collectively maintain nearly <a href="https://trueup.io/big-tech-hiring">40,000 open roles</a>. Even orgs inside these companies that aren't growing headcount-wise are still hiring to backfill, even as they make layoffs.</p><p>The AI sector continues to experience exceptional growth, with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and numerous AI infrastructure startups, hiring aggressively. Ignore bleak predictions about the imminent replacement of engineers; the reality of hiring shows how much businesses need engineers to achieve their goals. Companies in the AI sector often offer comp packages reminiscent of the 2021 peak, particularly for engineers with relevant expertise, or those demonstrating strong learning potential in AI-adjacent domains.</p><p>The engineers crushing it right now understand that modern tech interviewing has basically become its own bizarre sport, complete with arbitrary rules and peculiar traditions. They're treating interviews like performances, not just technical evaluations, and they're putting in the practice hours to match.</p><p>As AI continues reshaping how engineering work gets done, interview processes will have to evolve too because they can't keep testing for skills which AI makes obsolete. But for now, we're stuck in this awkward transitional phase where you need to master both the old-school algorithm games, and newer, more practical assessments.</p><p>At the risk of stating the obvious, at Hello Interview we see a clear pattern: there's a strong correlation between preparation investment and interview success. Candidates who dedicate time to structured practice are still more likely to secure multiple offers, even in this more selective environment.</p><p>The game might be harder, but at least the rulebook is public. With enough deliberate practice and the right preparation strategy for your level, you can still come out on top, even in this tougher market.</p> Takeaways <p>Gergely again.</p><p>Thanks very much to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-king-40072280/">Evan</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanmai/">Stefan</a> for summarizing what they see in the tech market. They gathered most of these insights by interacting with devs using <a href="https://www.hellointerview.com/">Hello Interview</a>, the mock interview and interview prep service of which they’re cofounders.</p><p>Some interesting things I’m reflecting on:</p><p>A tighter job market was predicted due to the end of zero interest rates. A year ago, we analyzed what <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp-software-engineers">the end of 0% interest rates meant for software engineers</a>. One top conclusion was to expect a tougher job market: more competition, less “shopping around”, and engineering managers especially having a hard time. This is reflected in what Evan and Stefan report from the recruitment front line. In some ways, since this was a predictable effect, it’s easier to understand as a cause of some of today’s hiring challenges.</p><p>AI is hot, and hot AI companies care a lot about pedigree. One thing that feels a little surprising is learning from Evan and Stefan how much companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and other top companies seem to filter by pedigree. Perhaps this should not be a surprise given these companies are inundated with applications from everywhere: if they can afford to hire from the most glittering tech companies, why wouldn’t they?</p><p>It’s a reminder that even if you are in the AI engineering field, getting into a top workplace from a lesser-known company is close to impossible without recognised industry expertise. If your target is to one day work at such companies, you might need to prepare for a multi-step career journey, starting out at lesser-known places doing AI-related work, forging a path towards better known companies, and then, one day, perhaps getting into the “top” places.</p><p>Getting a job takes more time investment. There’s constant complaints from devs about how time-consuming it is to prepare for tech interviews. If it’s a company doing Leetcode-style algorithmic interviews, the issue is the time it takes to practise beforehand. Meanwhile, if it’s a company with a complex takehome, the complaint is the time it takes to do the exercise itself.</p><p>As a competent engineer, you probably assume that an employer should accept that you know your craft, skip all the time-consuming evaluation that just seems pointless, and lead with an offer, right?</p><p>But from the vantage point of a hiring manager, a new hire is always a risk. Few things are worse than a hire that doesn’t work out because of a skill gap, motivation, or any number of reasons. Interviews are meant to verify skillsets and motivation.</p><p>We’ve gone from a candidate’s market in 2020-2022, to an employer’s market today. In this environment, you will most likely need to invest a lot more time in preparing for job interviews and doing them. The upside is that this preparation doesn’t go to waste, as interview formats don’t all change so rapidly.</p><p>Expectations are going up, and will keep on rising. At Uber, my manager at the time told me that performance expectations at Uber only went one way for the same level: up. This was because the business was growing rapidly, and the expectation of any new hire was to raise the bar. This meant that over time, expectations of “normal” for any career level kept inflating. After a while, this felt natural, but it was a strange thing to adjust to!</p><p>I feel we’re seeing something similar play out across the broader industry, today. Due to lots of qualified, capable engineers applying for jobs, expectations are going up at all career levels, and this is why downleveling is more common.</p><p>If you get a downleveled offer: first of all, congrats for getting an offer! In this job market, it’s an achievement in itself. It’s helpful to take current job market conditions into account before being too disappointed by this outcome. And if you have yet to receive an offer, know that the market is tougher right now than it’s been in a decade, so job searches take longer than before.</p><p>If you’re currently in the job market, or are doing interviews and have noticed any changes in recruitment processes, please share in a comment:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-reality-of-tech-interviews/comments">Leave a comment</a></p><p>This deepdive is a guest post – if you’re interested in pitching an article for The Pragmatic Engineer, <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-guest-article/">see details here</a>.</p>

I participated in this wide-ranging 50 minute conversation with David Asboth and Shaun McGirr.

<blockquote>
<p>If you're a new programmer, my optimistic version is that there has never been a better time to learn to program, because it shaves down the learning curve so much. When you're learning to program and you miss a semicolon and you bang your head against the computer for four hours [...] if you're unlucky you quit programming for good because it was so frustrating. [...]</p>
<p>I've always been a project-oriented learner; I can learn things by building something, and now the friction involved in building something has gone down so much [...] So I think especially if you're an autodidact, if you're somebody who likes teaching yourself things, these are a gift from heaven. You get a weird teaching assistant that knows loads of stuff and occasionally makes weird mistakes and believes in bizarre conspiracy theories, but you have 24 hour access to that assistant.</p>
<p>If you're somebody who prefers structured learning in classrooms, I think the benefits are going to take a lot longer to get to you because we don't know how to use these things in classrooms yet. [...]</p>
<p>If you want to strike out on your own, this is an amazing tool if you learn how to learn with it. So you've got to learn the limits of what it can do, and you've got to be disciplined enough to make sure you're not outsourcing the bits you need to learn to the machines.</p>

<p>フランス競争当局（FCA）は3月31日、アップルに対して1億5000万ユーロ（約242億円）という高額な罰金を科しました。問題となったのは、2021年から2023年にかけてアップルが導入した「App Tracking Transparency（ATT）」と呼ばれるプライバシー保護ツールです。</p>



<p>このツールはiOSユーザーのプライバシーを保護するという名目で導入されましたが、フランス当局の調査によると、その実装方法には競争法上の問題があったとされています。</p>



 ATTの仕組みと問題点 



<p>ATTは基本的に、アプリがユーザーのデータを収集して広告目的で使用する前に、明示的な同意を求めるというものです。一見すると消費者保護のための素晴らしい機能に思えますが、問題はその実装方法にありました。</p>



<p>具体的には：</p>



 
 サードパーティアプリには「過度に複雑な」ポップアップ表示が要求された 



 ユーザーは煩わしいポップアップに嫌気がさし、同意率が低下 



 一方、アップル自身のアプリではシンプルなチェックボックス一つで済むように設計 



 アップルは同意を得たユーザーデータを自社の広告サービスに活用し収益化 
 



<p>この設計により、他のアプリ開発者が広告収入を得ることが難しくなった一方で、アップル自身は個人データを収集・活用して広告ビジネスで利益を上げていたと当局は指摘しています。</p>



 市場への影響と当局の判断 



<p>フランス競争当局によれば、この仕組みは特に広告収入に依存する小規模なアプリパブリッシャーに深刻な経済的打撃を与えました。興味深いことに、当局はATTというプライバシー保護ツール自体に問題があるのではなく、その実装方法が「必要でも比例的でもなかった」と結論づけています。</p>



<p>当局の声明では「異なるポップアップウィンドウ間の相互作用を規定するルールがフレームワークの中立性を損ない、アプリケーションパブリッシャーとサービスプロバイダーに明確な経済的損害を与えた」と指摘されています。</p>



 罰金の意味と今後の展開 



<p>今回の242億円という罰金額はアップルの四半期収益（2024年第4四半期で約19兆円）から見れば微々たるものですが、大手テクノロジー企業によるプライバシー保護を名目とした市場支配への警鐘として重要な意味を持ちます。</p>



<p>注目すべきは、フランス当局がATTの変更を義務付けなかったことです。アップル側も「本日の決定に失望していますが、フランス競争当局はATTに特定の変更を要求していません」とコメントしており、機能自体は維持される見通しです。</p>



<p>このケースは、デジタル市場におけるプライバシー保護と公正競争のバランスという難しい課題を浮き彫りにしています。ユーザーのプライバシー保護は重要ですが、それが特定企業の市場支配強化のツールとなってはならないという規制当局の姿勢が示されたといえるでしょう。</p>

<p>4月1日、デジタル庁から本人確認ガイドラインの改定に向けた有識者会議（令和6年度）の取りまとめが公表されました。「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/resources/standard_guidelines#ds500">DS-500 行政手続におけるオンラインによる本人確認の手法に関するガイドライン</a>」（通称「本人確認ガイドライン」）は、行政手続きをデジタル化する時に、安全に本人確認するためのルールや方法をまとめたものです。例えるなら、オンラインでの「本人確認の教科書」みたいなものですね。このガイドラインは、アメリカのNISTという機関が作ったガイドラインなどを参考にしつつ、マイナンバーカードを使った本人確認など、日本独自のやり方も取り入れています。</p>



<p>最近は、行政手続きのオンライン化が進んだり、マイナンバーカードを使う人が増えたり、ネットを使った詐欺も増えたりと、本人確認を取り巻く環境が大きく変わってきています。</p>



<p>アメリカでは、NISTのガイドラインの改定案が出ていますし、ヨーロッパでは、スマホで使えるデジタルIDの仕組み「デジタル・アイデンティティ・ウォレット」も導入されようとしています。</p>



<p>そこで、デジタル庁では、専門家を集めて「本人確認ガイドラインの改定に向けた有識者会議」を開き、今の課題や海外の動きを踏まえ、ガイドラインをどう変えていくか話し２年間にわたって話し合ってきました。最終回が<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/councils/identification-guideline-revise-experts-meeting/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1">令和６年度第５回の会合</a>でした。</p>



<p>公表されたのは、「<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/c543b091/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_outline_01.pdf">本人確認ガイドライン改定方針 令和6年度とりまとめ（案）」</a>と、<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/3c596c7a/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_outline_02.pdf">本人確認ガイドライン改定案（令和6年度とりまとめ時点案）</a>および、これらを受けての有識者コメントをまとめた<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/1f45fd60/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_minutes.pdf">議事録</a> （これら指摘事項も反映されていくはず）です。</p>



<p>なお、文末に Youtube 版解説も付けましたので、そちらも合わせて御覧ください。</p>



 資料1：本人確認ガイドライン改定方針 令和6年度とりまとめ（案） 



<p>まず、</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/c543b091/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_outline_01.pdf">資料1：本人確認ガイドライン改定方針 令和6年度とりまとめ（案）（PDF／1,130KB）</a> 
 



<p>ですが、これは、令和6年度のこの有識者会議の結果をまとめたもので、ガイドラインをどう変えていくかのアイデアが書かれています。ここでは、以下のようなことが書かれています。</p>



<p>改定の背景</p>



 
 行政手続のオンライン化やマイナンバーカードの普及 



 フィッシング攻撃の高度化や本人確認書類の偽造事件の増加 



 米国NISTのガイドライン改定や欧州でのデジタルIDウォレット導入の動き  
 



<p>改定の主なポイント</p>



 
 ガイドラインの適用対象と名称の見直し: 対面での本人確認や行政手続以外の行政サービスも対象とする。 



 本人確認手法検討における「基本的な考え方」の定義: 事業目的の遂行、公平性、プライバシー、ユーザビリティ・アクセシビリティ、セキュリティの5つの観点を重視する。 



 本人確認の基本的な枠組みの定義: 身元確認、当人認証、フェデレーションの概念を明確化し、連携モデルと非連携モデルのシステム実装モデルを定義、連携モデルをその基本とする。 



 脅威と対策の最新化、保証レベルの見直し: 最新の脅威動向や技術動向を踏まえ、身元確認と当人認証における脅威と対策、保証レベルの位置づけと対策基準を見直す。 



 リスク評価プロセスの全面的な見直し: 本人確認手法の評価プロセスを5つの観点から行い、リスク評価プロセスを単純化する。 
 



<p>その他</p>



 
 ガイドライン本編とは別に、具体的な技術や手法、事例などをまとめた「本人確認ガイドライン解説書」を新たに整備する。 
 



 資料2：本人確認ガイドライン改定案（令和6年度とりまとめ時点案） 



<p>一方、</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/3c596c7a/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_outline_02.pdf">資料2：本人確認ガイドライン改定案（令和6年度とりまとめ時点案）（PDF／1,838KB）</a> 
 



<p>ですが、実際のガイドライン改定案が示されています。</p>



<p>主なポイントとしては以下のようなことが書かれています。</p>



 
 リスクに応じた「適切な保証レベル」の選択:
 
 従来は画一的に高い保証レベルが求められがちで、利便性を損なうケースがあった。 



 本改定では、手続のリスクに応じた適切な保証レベル (本人確認の確からしさの段階)&nbsp;を選択することを基本とする。 



 過剰な厳格さを避け、安全・安心で利便性の高い行政サービスの実現を目指す。 
 
 



 検討の5つの観点:
 
 保証レベルや本人確認手法の選択にあたり、以下の5つの観点を考慮する。
 
 事業目的の遂行 (本人確認が手続きの障壁にならないか) 



 公平性 (特定の人だけが利用できない等の不公平がないか) 



 プライバシー (個人情報の取扱いは適切か) 



 ユーザビリティ及びアクセシビリティ (利用者にとって使いやすいか) 



 セキュリティ (リスクに対して適切な強度か) 
 
 
 
 



 本人確認の構成要素:
 
 本人確認を以下の3つの要素で定義・整理する。
 
 身元確認 (Identity Proofing):&nbsp;申請者が実在し、生存する人物であることを確認する (属性収集、書類検証、申請者検証等)。 



 当人認証 (Authentication):&nbsp;手続を利用しようとする者が、身元確認時に登録された者と同一人物であることを確認する (知識、所有物、生体情報に基づく認証)。 



 フェデレーション (Federation):&nbsp;信頼できる他のIDプロバイダが行った身元確認や当人認証の結果に依拠する。 
 
 
 
 



 実装モデル:
 
 連携モデル (Federated):&nbsp;共通のIDプロバイダを利用するモデル (効率化のため第一候補)。 



 非連携モデル (Non-Federated):&nbsp;各システムが独自に本人確認機能を構築するモデル。 



 両者の組み合わせも可能。 
 
 



 脅威と対策:
 
 身元確認、当人認証、フェデレーションそれぞれにおける脅威 (なりすまし、書類偽造、フィッシング、重複登録等) を具体的に示し、それらに対する対策プロセスや手法例、保証レベルごとの対策基準を定義している。 



 特に身元確認では、真正性確認手法 (デジタル署名検証、信頼できる情報源への照会、物理的検査等) や申請者検証手法 (容貌確認、暗証番号、確認コード送付等) を整理。 



 当人認証では、多要素認証の重要性やフィッシング耐性のある認証方式 (公開鍵認証等) に言及。 
 
 



 本人確認手法の検討プロセス:
 
 ①リスク特定 → ②リスク影響度評価 (高・中・低) → ③保証レベル判定 (レベル1～3) → ④手法の評価 (5つの観点) → ⑤補完的対策や例外措置の検討 → ⑥継続的な評価・改善、というプロセスを提示。 
 
 



 法人等の身元確認 (別紙2):
 
 個人とは異なる考え方が必要。 



 ①法人等の実在性確認 (法人番号、名称、所在地等)、②申請者個人の実在性確認、③法人等と申請者個人の紐づき確認 (代表者印、委任状等) の3ステップで整理。 
 
 
 



 今後の予定 



<p>ガイドライン改定案の公開、意見募集、各省協議等を経て、改定版を発行することになるはずです。わりと良い文書になっているとおもうので、今から楽しみです。英語版もぜひ作っていただきたいところです。</p>



 詳細 



<p>以下、もう少し詳細に説明したものになります。ご参考まで。</p>



 主要なテーマ 



 ガイドラインの適用範囲と名称の拡大・変更: 



 
 現行の「オンラインによる本人確認」から、対面の手続きや行政手続き以外の行政サービスも含むように適用範囲を拡大する。 



 ガイドライン名称を「DS-511 行政手続等での本人確認におけるデジタルアイデンティティの取扱いに関するガイドライン」に変更する。 



 文書番号もDS-500からDS-511へ変更する。 



 （<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/c543b091/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_outline_01.pdf">資料1</a> より）「デジタル技術を活用した本人確認の機会が対面や行政手続以外にも拡大していることを踏まえ、本ガイドラインの 適用対象を拡大する方針とする。」 



 （<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/3c596c7a/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_outline_02.pdf">資料2</a> P.2 より）「本ガイドラインは、国の行政機関が提供する行政手続又は行政サービス（以下「対象手続」という。）において、個人又は法人等が申請・届出・アカウント登録・ログイン等を行う際の本人確認を対象とする。」 
 



 検討にあたる「基本的な考え方」の定義: 



 
 手続き等の特性に応じた適切な手法選択のため、「事業目的の遂行」「公平性」「プライバシー」「ユーザビリティ及びアクセシビリティ」「セキュリティ」の5つの観点を定義する。 



 （<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/3c596c7a/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_outline_02.pdf">資料2</a> P.i より）「今回の改定では、対象手続のリスクに応じた「適切な保証レベル」を選択できるようにすることを念頭におき、そのための基本的な考え方として「事業目的の遂行」、「公平性」、「プライバシー」、「ユーザビリティ及びアクセシビリティ」及び「セキュリティ」の 5つの観点を定義した。」 



 （<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/c543b091/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_outline_01.pdf">資料1</a> より）「単にセキュリティレベルの高い手法を選べばよい訳ではない。事業目的の遂行、公平性、プラ イバシー、ユーザビリティ及びアクセシビリティへの影響も考慮しながら、リスクに応じたレ ベルの本人確認手法を選択することが必要である。」 
 



 本人確認の基本的な枠組みの定義: 



 
 本人確認を「身元確認（Identity Proofing）」、「当人認証（Authentication）」、「フェデレーション（Federation）」の3つの要素で構成すると定義する。 



 実装モデルとして「連携モデル（Federated Model）」と「非連携モデル（Non-Federated Model）」を定義する。 



 （<a href="https://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/058ea13e-58e4-4e77-b18f-24833a65c7b1/3c596c7a/20250304_meeting_identification-guideline-revision_outline_02.pdf">資料2</a> P.9 より）「本ガイドラインでは、本人確認を構成する要素として「身元確認」と「当人認証」を定義する。さらに、身元確認や当人認証を他者（信頼できる IDプロバイダ）に依拠して実現する要素として「フェデレーション」を定義する。」 
 



 脅威と対策の最新化、保証レベルの見直し: 



 
 国内外の脅威動向、最新技術動向、NIST SP 800-63-4の改定内容を踏まえ、各要素における想定脅威と手法例を最新化する。 



 身元確認保証レベルと当人認証保証レベルの位置づけと対策基準を、脅威への耐性の観点から見直す。 



 身元確認のプロセスを「属性情報の収集」「本人確認書類の検証」「申請者の検証」「登録」に定義し、各プロセスにおける脅威を明確化する。 



 身元確認保証レベルは、ICチップ等によるデジタルな検証の有無を重要な差異とし、低リスク手続き向けの「レベル1」を再定義する（簡易的な身元確認）。 



 当人認証のプロセスを「認証器の登録」「当人認証の実施」「盗難・紛失時の対応」「アカウント回復」と定義し、ライフサイクル全体での対策を考慮する。 



 当人認証保証レベルの対策基準を、フィッシング耐性などの最新脅威への対応を強化する方向で見直す。レベル3では全ての利用者にフィッシング耐性のある認証方式を必須とする。

 リスク評価プロセスの全面的な見直し: 



 
 保証レベル判定までのプロセスを簡略化しつつ、事業目的、公平性、プライバシー等への影響を考慮した評価プロセスを導入する。 



 リスク評価の初期段階として「リスクの特定」プロセスを新設する。 



 影響度の評価基準を、利用者の権利権益の侵害を軸としつつ、プライバシーへの深刻な影響や犯罪・攻撃への悪用が想定される場合は「高位」とする。 



 本人確認手法の評価プロセスを新設し、「基本的な考え方」で定義した5つの観点から評価する。 



 評価結果に基づき、複数の手法の併用、追加対策、より高い/低い保証レベルの手法の採用などの補完的対策を検討するプロセスを導入する。 



 継続的な評価と改善のためのプロセスを具体化し、利用者からの問い合わせ、セキュリティイベント、脅威動向などを収集・分析し、必要に応じて改善措置を講じる。

 ガイドライン解説書の新規整備: 



 
 Normativeな本編に対し、Informativeな「本人確認ガイドライン解説書」を新たに整備する。 



 解説書には、具体的な技術、手法、事例、検討用ワークシートなど、変化の速い情報を集約し、本編の簡潔化と柔軟な改定への対応を図る。

 法人等の手続きにおける身元確認の考え方: 
 



 
 個人に対する身元確認とは異なる考え方や手法が必要となるため、別紙として法人等の手続きにおける身元確認のプロセスと手法例を示す。

  <p><a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/evals/">Pydantic Evals</a></p>
Brand new package from David Montague and the Pydantic AI team which directly tackles what I consider to be the single hardest problem in AI engineering: building evals to determine if your LLM-based system is working correctly and getting better over time.<p></p>
<p>The feature is described as "in beta" and comes with this very realistic warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims to know for sure exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This code example from their documentation illustrates the relationship between the two key nouns - Cases and Datasets:</p>
 from pydantic_evals import Case, Dataset

case1 = Case(
    name="simple_case",
    inputs="What is the capital of France?",
    expected_output="Paris",
    metadata={"difficulty": "easy"},
)

dataset = Dataset(cases=[case1]) 

<p>The library also supports custom evaluators, including LLM-as-a-judge:</p>
 Case(
    name="vegetarian_recipe",
    inputs=CustomerOrder(
        dish_name="Spaghetti Bolognese", dietary_restriction="vegetarian"
    ),
    expected_output=None,
    metadata={"focus": "vegetarian"},
    evaluators=(
        LLMJudge(
            rubric="Recipe should not contain meat or animal products",
        ),
    ),
) 

<p>Cases and datasets can also be serialized to YAML.</p>
<p>My first impressions are that this looks like a solid implementation of a sensible design. I'm looking forward to trying it out against a real project.

<p>They saw the best results overall from Claude 3.7 Sonnet against <a href="https://www.swebench.com/lite.html">SWE-bench Lite</a>, where it scored 37.2% in rewrite mode without a debugger, 48.4% with their debugger tool and 52.1% with debug(5) - a mechanism where the pdb tool is made available only after the 5th rewrite attempt.</p>
<p>Their code is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym">available on GitHub</a>. I found this implementation of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym/blob/1.0.0/debug_gym/gym/tools/pdb.py">the pdb tool</a>, and tracked down the main system and user prompt in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym/blob/1.0.0/debug_gym/agents/debug_agent.py">agents/debug_agent.py</a>:</p>
<p>System prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Your goal is to debug a Python program to make sure it can pass a set of test functions. You have access to the pdb debugger tools, you can use them to investigate the code, set breakpoints, and print necessary values to identify the bugs. Once you have gained enough information, propose a rewriting patch to fix the bugs. Avoid rewriting the entire code, focus on the bugs only.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>User prompt (which they call an "action prompt"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Based on the instruction, the current code, the last execution output, and the history information, continue your debugging process using pdb commands or to propose a patch using rewrite command. Output a single command, nothing else. Do not repeat your previous commands unless they can provide more information. You must be concise and avoid overthinking.</code></p>

<p>[<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/30/author-china-mieville-says-we-shouldnt-blame-science-fiction-for-its-bad-readers/">Anthony Ha at TechCrunch</a>]</p><p>China Miéville, who is one of the great contemporary science fiction and fantasy authors, is right on the money about Silicon Valley's tendency to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/torment-nexus">create the Torment Nexus</a>.</p><p>This is exactly why I think science fiction is so important, and why it has a lot to contribute:</p><blockquote><p>"To Miéville, it’s a mistake to read science fiction as if it’s really about the future: “It’s always about now. It’s always a reflection. It’s a kind of fever dream, and it’s always about its own sociological context.”</p><p>He added that there’s a “societal and personal derangement” at work when the rich and powerful “are more interested in settling Mars than sorting out the world” — but ultimately, it’s not science fiction that’s responsible."</p></blockquote><p>To me, the point and excitement of science fiction is to talk about today through the lens of analogy and extrapolation: not necessarily to warn or celebrate, but to explore. Of course, there's a broad spectrum of stories under that umbrella, and not all of them fit that mold as well as others, but that's what drives me as a reader and a writer. It's up to the reader to decide what to take from that.</p><p>I think a lot about Starship Troopers. (Really! I do. Some people think about the Roman Empire. I think about Heinlein.) The original book was, at the very least, fascist-adjacent. The movie adaptation was, at least for me, and in intent by its director, a very funny satire at the expense of those ideas. But, of course, some people took away the top-line plot and either decried the fascism or, more worryingly, freaking loved it. See also: Fight Club, which a certain kind of incel adjacent maladjusted man-child has taken on as something to model, rather than a satirical novel that pokes at them and the country they inhabit.</p><p>The reader makes their own interpretation. And if that happens to be a sociopathic world-view bent on world domination, that's on them.</p>

 [Brian Krebs]  Sobering roundup from Brian Krebs about how each of the five pillars of the First Amendment - speech, religion, the media, the right to assembly, and the right to petition the government and seek redress for wrongs - has been attacked during the first few months of the Trump Administration.

The president has made no secret of his affection for autocratic leaders and “strongmen” around the world, and he is particularly enamored with Hungary’s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has visited Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort twice in the past year."</p></blockquote><p>The piece concludes with a warning that Trump is following a similar playbook to Orbán by consolidating control over the courts and decimating the free press. It played out there; we will see what happens here.</p>

    My advice about using AI is simple: use AI as an assistant, not an expert, and use it judiciously. Some people will object, “but AI can be wrong!” Yes, and so can the internet in general, but no one now recommends avoiding online resources because they can be wrong.

GビズIDについてはこれまでもOpenIDファウンデーションジャパンのイベント等に古くは経産省、デジタル庁へ移管されてからはデジタル庁の方々にお越しいただき技術仕様やトラストフレームワークについてご発表いただいてきました。  <br> <blockquote> OpenID Summit Tokyo 2020 - 2020/1/24  <a

href="https://openid.connpass.com/event/341152">https://openid.connpass.com/event/341152</a>/ </blockquote> <br>  GビズIDについて  簡単に言うと、GビズIDは企業の代表や従業員などが当該の企業に所属していることを表し、例えば補助金の申請などの行政手続きをオンラインで実施することを可能にするためのID基盤ですね。  そのためには当然、当該の企業が実在していること、そしてGビズIDを利用する代表者や従業員が当該企業と適切に関係しており所属していることを保証していくことが重要です。  <br>  ここは非常に重要な一方でまだまだ課題も多く、例えば現状は法人の実在性について法務局の発行する印鑑証明書や個人事業主の場合は市町村の発行する印鑑登録証明書を使うことで確認することになりますが、アカウントライフサイクルは各利用企業側に任せるしかないという状況があったりします。  <br>  <br>  法人共通認証基盤の必要性  この考え方は何も日本だけで必要とされているわけではなく、海外においても同様の要求はあるわけです。OpenID FoundationのeKYC and Identity Assurance Working Groupでは個人の本人確認がどのようにIdentity Providerで実施されたかという情報をRelying Partyへ伝達するためのOpenID Connect for Identity Assurance（最近<a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/10/openid-connect-for-identity-assurance.html">正式化</a>されましたね！）に加えて、個人が法人とどのような関係性にあるのかを表現するためのAuthority Claims Extensionの開発を進めています。この辺りは日本のOpenIDファウンデーションジャパンのKYC WGの参加メンバーの方々とも協力して国際標準への道筋をうまく作っていきたいところです。  <br>  参考）eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group  <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/</a>  <br>  <br>  GビズIDのアップデート概要  こう言うのは更新履歴を見ていくのが重要ですね。  デジタル庁が公開している<a href="https://gbiz-id.go.jp/top/system_guide/system_guide.html">システム連携ガイド</a>を見ると技術仕様を含め確認ができるので、こちらの更新履歴を見てみましょう。なお、現在「行政サービス向け」のシステム連携ガイドが公開されていますが、そもそも現状のGビズIDは民間サービスとの連携を許可していません。それにもかかわらず行政サービス向け、と明記されているのは今後の民間サービスへの展開を見据えてのことなのかな、、と期待が膨らみますね。  <br>  早速更新履歴を見ていきましょう。すでにバージョン2.3なんですね。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgfQ4z2xiw7RimXDuUduRLk52_I3QL1udr7Lw8POjhlX6To4uNA8mfVsx8UPXG_5trbmH0bGelS7lm_Y1g_aZQSEZ8YR3JjUInw0At1RuTG3Zxdx6VpqD_TkRbb82l0xO_pZ_F6SNzE20kFfH4laWiWZ4tiBOoduiShBbv-I71BSwKNuTNBFO0bpHFzQohG"></a>

<br><br>  結構更新が多いです。さすが大型アップデートです。  <br>  個人的に関心が高かったのは、以下の２点です。    アカウント種別に管理者（GビズIDメンバー（管理者））が増えた  GビズIDトラストフレームワークが策定され、IAL/AALが明記された   アカウント種別はこれまでプライム、メンバー、エントリーの３種類で、原則プライムは法人代表者のためのアカウントでした。そして、メンバーアカウントの作成や管理はプライムの権限者が実施するしかなかったわけですが、いちいち代表者がログインしてアカウント管理をするのか！！という課題も大きかったのだと思います。GビズIDメンバー（管理者）というアカウント管理権限を持ったアカウントを作成することができるようになりました。   ちなみにGビズIDプライムのアカウントはマイナンバーカードを使ったオンライン申請もできるようになってますね。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjTo43uc1jo9law25KnIwhls5M3QDpO1L4u_RJm2S8O8JGZ0_VFewIJ0LZCTxAAUZYOQZ0vORfr_UesdmzvIndbCeOIb2Ija1nAa3IKjiOT8ajmX2GtSQMa_Inos4CJzG_XqxlVFMHXOqk2aFHK3EP4h93ZBNDSFTwGVSlvi3EdFxjbbRxu4trSdqC3vr2e"></a> <br><br>  トラストフレームワークについても別文書で定義されています。 <blockquote> 法人共通認証基盤におけるトラストフレームワーク  <a href="https://gbiz-id.go.jp/top/trust_framework/trust_framework.pdf">https://gbiz-id.go.jp/top/trust_framework/trust_framework.pdf</a> </blockquote> <br>  システム連携ガイドにもざっくりとしたレベル感は記載されていますので、Relying Partyは扱う情報の機密レベルやリスク度合いに応じてどのアカウント種別を要求するか決めていく必要があります。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj4jrHEe2EgCsRpXBKyilyL5Zm7w9faMpSPK8OXnlquqz8uE8cZ_s3VJipti0DCY2IxyUdNptW6m-mlTdG3cSQac592jlnxAU6ySeOAvbRSN2gDxk8fozmxcA_suLSIF0jBi7kpZm2790liC4Ot8wmgqhkl01ZT1h3A_6DVh1x5L-rWAauy9UfgXOYAohRB"></a> <br><br>  OpenID Connect for Identity Assuranceへの対応  タイトルにも書いた通り、今回のGビズIDのアップデートの目玉はOpenID Connect for Identity Assurance（OIDC4IDA）への対応です。といっても結論フルスペック対応ではなく、スキーマについてある程度対応した、という程度ではありますが国が提供するサービスに新しい技術仕様が採用されていくのは非常に嬉しいことですね。  <br>  具体的にはscopeにjp_gbizid_v1_idaを指定することでOIDC4IDAに対応した属性情報を取得できるようになるようです。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhSv48L2DuDQibRH7v1lVK2WpvXgb6pFxQ1xS_SKrWv2ft8UtnRn6wLhEy1cSaEAWe5NzKrU0Su4rrtSzS_FvtmlVfSo5jIBdnKWMRQiZfGvEB9pJLreAJjgE99d8DpSisRYFfF0NB2kezPNumAq5pAmUlvsPOU3YfUgfNZ360d3rxH3F5unnFDaONnOIJG"></a> <br>実際に返却される属性（verified_claims）は下記の通りです。  要するにGビズIDのトラストフレームワークに従い、どのような審査・確認が行われたアカウントなのか、という情報がRelying Partyに対して送出されるようになるわけです。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjcRJrgS_joTeWeAW4Jtyp8mWL--ZwA8oX207_QNL8q3k_LYewnRpx9aseqib0J7RxysdKDDcvE6qay1xrYfILpGpaBmDJPFYkN9i7iBuz_-_ppV3HczFHVmoPgTiEfFFybhSZn5_1nd_qkk8nD3MfMGjP82KWTygoIqN-GpeQkR2v1ShT2B1-I-8kgc7sa"></a>  <br>  よく見るとauthorityに関する属性も返していますね。この辺りは現在eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Groupで開発を進めているAuthority Claims Extensionを先取りした感じです。 <br>サンプルレスポンスも書いてあります。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi8m1fSmalYsS80Sj7i7RRnWrIzZ7QSBZIiSvRKdzZKXKZB5Ly7xweY2C_gS3Gs9QnnRu5vaLfp5FAPSaUZzXwLfefw4trzXowlQ6UHPP6Nav4iXx5HgTjiR0vW0hAtloeUI5ABTdZIzvukawhHVKCPAeWc6OwVp6b1myKmJ5xkWvW6Vj9vrR0uYmXfkkmE"></a>  <br> 組織情報の詳細についても返却できるようになっていますね。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjcPr0ngU47RIdsZR65Gd7zTc6rAavK4_DQVMVHLRAsWINxZp18ZxB5B397Cl5ebKO04yPBUrCBDoZfSvdXD9V0AXw4nJP7mAyzYnGrBy6P1X7ju41KwKF4T7d4q2LsBx8CPgw1CxZ1iWyqkfk8TZuq5GLKQw36EgxL6fT6ceMYkcfXicNxHWkFbkbxgyQl"></a>  <br> こんな感じで当該組織でそのアカウントがどのような役割を持っているのかが表現できるようになっています。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg6-x2GCNkP9xG1RqF19KJeYP90i_4Ur0h7fa-PAOPpI9-t7tLe9hkPvY9_oXXr7fADV5TYdJ3Qt7W9i7WAv-iV24cuLFtGd7JKx5Dd2mmJelPhVQ5TDcpUInAzVPrpcmVkYrvHkjyHDNpV1-LSpBbNZ6I4FbLPLshyS3cU9iaDHzAGUqqwtNDeH3nYnL-l"></a> <br><br><br>これはちゃんとこのドキュメントを英訳してグローバルで発信していかないといけませんね。結構先進的なことをやっているので海外の実装者や政府機関にとっても非常に参考になると思います。＞デジタル庁さん、がんばってください！<br><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

 [Allison Morrow at CNN]  It's refreshing to see this kind of AI skepticism in a major outlet:   "Apple, like every other big player in tech, is scrambling to find ways to inject AI into its products. Why? Well, it’s the future! What problems is it solving? Well, so far that’s not clear! Are customers demanding it? LOL, no.

Why? Well, it’s the future! What problems is it solving? Well, so far that’s not clear! Are customers demanding it? LOL, no.

They are an academic wonder with huge potential and some early commercial successes, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. But a bot that’s 80% accurate [...] isn’t a very useful consumer product."</p></blockquote><p>I'm more than ready for the hype cycle to come to its conclusion. Are there some interesting use cases for AI? Sure. Should the ethical, functional, environmental, and contextual issues with current AI vendors give us all pause at the very least? Absolutely.</p>

 [Makena Kelly at WIRED]  If you know anything about building software, you know that this is an absurd idea:   "The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integ

<p>[<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-rebuild-social-security-administration-cobol-benefits/">Makena Kelly at WIRED</a>]</p><p>If you know anything about building software, you know that this is an absurd idea:</p><blockquote><p>"The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integrity of the system—and the benefits on which tens of millions of Americans rely—at risk."</p></blockquote><p>Moving a 60 million line COBOL codebase to another language (be it Java or anything else) is not a small undertaking, and the SSA underpins necessary benefits for millions of Americans. Doing it in months likely requires using something like an LLM - and anyone who's used an LLM to code will tell you that the output is riddled with mistakes and inefficiencies. It's not a workable plan.</p><p>Or, as <a href="https://about.danhon.com/">Dan Hon</a> puts it in the piece:</p><blockquote><p>“If you weren't worried about a whole bunch of people not getting benefits or getting the wrong benefits, or getting the wrong entitlements, or having to wait ages, then sure go ahead.”</p></blockquote><p>A project like this should take years. Most of that isn't coding time: it's analysis, writing the tests, rearchitecting, and putting protections in place to ensure that nobody goes without the benefits they need to live. Doing it as a rush job isn't just incompetence; it's indifference to the lives of some of our most vulnerable neighbors. Which, let's face it, is in keeping with everything else going on.</p>

   Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer 
Every now and then a log file or a tool I'm using will spit out a bunch of JSON that terminates unexpectedly, meaning I can't copy it into a text editor and pretty-print it to see what's going on. 
 The other day I got frustrated with this and had the then-new GPT-4.5 build me a pretty-printer that didn't mind incomplete JSON, using an OpenAI Canvas. Here's the chat

<p>The other day I got frustrated with this and had the then-new GPT-4.5 build me a pretty-printer that didn't mind incomplete JSON, using an OpenAI Canvas. Here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67dd9d55-7f70-8006-b55d-72730f60ddbe">the chat</a> and here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/67e5e9b3f7bc8191b2306a123c9d328f">the resulting interactive</a>.</p>
<p>I spotted a bug with the way it indented code today so I pasted it into Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking mode and had it make a bunch of improvements - <a href="https://claude.ai/share/22dc4b58-e8c4-44a4-9650-a37d21513b8d">full transcript here</a>. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/incomplete-json-printer.html">finished code</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In many ways this is a perfect example of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe coding </a> in action. At no point did I look at a single line of code that either of the LLMs had written for me. I honestly don't care how this thing works: it could not be lower stakes for me, the worst a bug could do is show me poorly formatted incomplete JSON.</p>
<p>I was vaguely aware that some kind of state machine style parser would be needed, because you can't parse incomplete JSON with a regular JSON parser. Building simple parsers is the kind of thing LLMs are surprisingly good at, and also the kind of thing I don't want to take on for a trivial project.</p>
<p>At one point I told Claude "Try using your code execution tool to check your logic", because I happen to know Claude can write and then execute JavaScript independently of using it for artifacts. That helped it out a bunch.</p>
<p>I later dropped in the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>modify the tool to work better on mobile screens and generally look a bit nicer - and remove the pretty print JSON button, it should update any time the input text is changed. Also add a "copy to clipboard" button next to the results. And add a button that says "example" which adds a longer incomplete example to demonstrate the tool, make that example pelican themed.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's fun being able to say "generally look a bit nicer" and get a perfectly acceptable result!

<p>This sounds like a significant upgrade to GPT-4o, albeit one where the release notes are limited to a single tweet.</p>
<p>ChatGPT-4o-latest (2025-0-26) just hit second place on <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">the LM Arena leaderboard</a>, behind only Gemini 2.5, so this really is an update worth knowing about.</p>
<p>The @OpenAIDevelopers account <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1905335104211185999">confirmed</a> that this is also now available in their API:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code> is now updated in the API, but stay tuned—we plan to bring these improvements to a dated model in the API in the coming weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/17/llm/#chatgpt-4o-latest">wrote about chatgpt-4o-latest</a> last month - it's a model alias in the OpenAI API which provides access to the model used for ChatGPT, available since August 2024. It's priced at $5/million input and $15/million output - a step up from regular GPT-4o's $2.50/$10.</p>
<p>I'm glad they're going to make these changes available as a dated model release - the <code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code> alias is risky to build software against due to its tendency to change without warning.</p>
<p>A more appropriate place for this announcement would be the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/changelog">OpenAI Platform Changelog</a>, but that's not had an update since the release of their new audio models on March 20th.

   Thoughts on setting policy for new AI capabilities 
Joanne Jang leads model behavior at OpenAI. Their release of GPT-4o image generation included some notable relaxation of OpenAI's policies concerning acceptable usage - I noted some of those the other day.

Joanne Jang leads model behavior at OpenAI. Their release of GPT-4o image generation included some notable relaxation of OpenAI's policies concerning acceptable usage - I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/introducing-4o-image-generation/">noted some of those</a> the other day.<p></p>
<p>Joanne summarizes these changes like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr we’re shifting from blanket refusals in sensitive areas to a more precise approach focused on preventing real-world harm. The goal is to embrace humility: recognizing how much we don't know, and positioning ourselves to adapt as we learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This point in particular resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Trusting user creativity over our own assumptions. AI lab employees should not be the arbiters of what people should and shouldn’t be allowed to create. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of years ago when OpenAI were the only AI lab with models that were worth spending time with it really did feel that San Francisco cultural values (which I relate to myself) were being pushed on the entire world. That cultural hegemony has been broken now by the increasing pool of global organizations that can produce models, but it's still reassuring to see the leading AI lab relaxing its approach here.

  <p><a href="https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/introducing-state-of-the-art-nomic-embed-code">Nomic Embed Code: A State-of-the-Art Code Retriever</a></p>
Nomic have released a new embedding model that specializes in code, based on their CoRNStack "large-scale high-quality training dataset specifically curated for code retrieval".<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-code">nomic-embed-code</a> model is pretty large - 26.35GB - but the announcement also mentioned a much smaller model (released 5 months ago) called <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed">CodeRankEmbed</a> which is just 521.60MB.</p>
<p>I missed that when it first came out, so I decided to give it a try using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers">llm-sentence-transformers</a> plugin for <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>.</p>
 <code>llm install llm-sentence-transformers
llm sentence-transformers register nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed --trust-remote-code
</code> 
<p>Now I can run the model like this:</p>
 <code>llm embed -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed -c 'hello'
</code> 
<p>This outputs an array of 768 numbers, starting <code>[1.4794224500656128, -0.474479079246521, ...</code>.</p>
<p>Where this gets fun is combining it with my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/18/symbex/">Symbex tool</a> to create and then search embeddings for functions in a codebase.</p>
<p>I created an index for my LLM codebase like this:</p>
 <code>cd llm
symbex '*' '*.*' --nl &gt; code.txt
</code> 
<p>This creates a newline-separated JSON file of all of the functions (from <code>'*'</code>) and methods (from <code>'*.*'</code>) in the current directory - you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ac45c6638ea87942383e97c5cf69ae09">see that here</a>.</p>
<p>Then I fed that into the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/cli.html#llm-embed-multi">llm embed-multi</a> command like this:</p>
 <code>llm embed-multi \
  -d code.db \
  -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed \
  code code.txt \
  --format nl \
  --store \
  --batch-size 10
</code> 
<p>I found the <code>--batch-size</code> was needed to prevent it from crashing with an error. </p>
<p>The above command creates a collection called <code>code</code> in a SQLite database called <code>code.db</code>.</p>
<p>Having run this command I can search for functions that match a specific search term in that <code>code</code> collection like this:</p>
 <code>llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c 'Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin' | jq
</code> 
<p>That <code>"Represent this query for searching relevant code: "</code> prefix is required by the model. I pipe it through <code>jq</code> to make it a little more readable, which gives me <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/fdc1b48b20a99714200f5d3970b1dff4">these results</a>.</p>
<p>This <code>jq</code> recipe makes for a better output:</p>
 <code>llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c 'Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin' | \
  jq -r '.id + "\n\n" + .content + "\n--------\n"'
</code> 
<p>The output from that starts like so:</p>
 <code>llm/cli.py:1776

@cli.command(name="plugins")
@click.option("--all", help="Include built-in default plugins", is_flag=True)
def plugins_list(all):
    "List installed plugins"
    click.echo(json.dumps(get_plugins(all), indent=2))
--------

llm/cli.py:1791

@cli.command()
@click.argument("packages", nargs=-1, required=False)
@click.option(
    "-U", "--upgrade", is_flag=True, help="Upgrade packages to latest version"
)
...
def install(packages, upgrade, editable, force_reinstall, no_cache_dir):
    """Install packages from PyPI into the same environment as LLM"""
</code> 
<p>Getting this output was quite inconvenient, so I've <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/853">opened an issue</a>.

<p>In the context of Web3 we’re currently walking down a dangerous path accidentally, and it’s not something being discussed enough. When a user connects to a site with Web3 capabilities enabled the site first requests the user to share a wallet address with them. This paradigm was set primarily by some choices that were made early on by Metamask as a means of protection for the user. At the time these were beneficial, but over time we’ve recognized some tradeoffs between UX and privacy because of it. Let’s explore those further.</p>

 The UX paradigm of sharing an account address is discrete 

<p>The permissions design of this started out as a low level paradigm where the DApp only needed the wallet address and could fetch state itself from the chain. This led to a thin client design where the site and the UX for different interactions are largely determined by the site. However, because the majority of the application logic is handled by the site itself it also means that the site has to operate in a more trusted context. Both in terms of security and privacy.</p>

<p>Additionally, as we’ve added more functionality to the wallet to try and improve the UX, such as EIP-4361 (Sign in With Ethereum) it’s led to an antipattern in the UX. In order to create a “login” flow, the user first has to share the wallet address, then they have to approve a specifically structured transaction using EIP-191. Because of the order of operations of design and the focus on not conducting breaking changes to the Web3 platform APIs (e.g. what the wallet makes accessible to the site) we’ve now added a tiny bit of debt to the UX paradigm rather than combining these operations into a single design interface.</p>

 The account address paradigm trust model doesn’t align with the browsers 

<p>In the context of a modern browser, most sites are isolated into their own sandbox. This occurs both at the OS process level in order to prevent sites open in one tab from tampering with other sites in another tab either at a deeper memory level or at a more functional script injection level. It also happens at a storage layer through the partitioning of localStorage, cookies, IndexedDBs, etc. Essentially, sites are separated into what’s called an “origin” in the browser and that origin identifier (such as https://example.com) becomes the boundary.</p>

<p>This is why “cross-origin” communication is considered an explicit exception. Examples of this would be using CORS for a site to approve the loading of a cross-origin script it trusts. This is ultimately rooted back in the security model (and more recently privacy model) of the browser. Over and over we’ve learned that trusting sites is a mistake because users aren’t always able to identify when sites are doing things that aren’t in their best interest, such as tracking them for dynamic pricing or crowding a page with personalized ads. So what sort of problems should we expect to come in Web3 because our Web3 platform API is too trusting of the site?</p>

 My prediction for problems to occur in Web3 

<p>We should expect that when the user shares their address that will act as implied consent for cross-origin tracking in the same way cookie notices act as a prompt for tracking. The problem here is that as wallets share wallet addresses across different sites, it will become a global identifier used for the purposes of tracking a user and building a copy of their browsing history server side even if the user doesn’t perform an onchain transaction. This could be as simple as an RPC service provider who’s already got a large customer base of wallets and DApps taking this information and building a dataset to sell with it, or it could be a DApp or Wallet doing it directly themselves. Chainalysis has already been doing this for the purposes of correlating wallet addresses to users to sell to governments. What’s to stop someone like them from entering into the web advertising business too because so much of the web3 space is leveraging them for compliance purposes?</p>

<p>Furthermore, once they’ve built this profile all future onchain transactions will be correlated to the shadow copy of the users browsing history (built in the same way they’re built with 3P cookies) and economic activity (such as what they buy with stablecoins) to build deeper behavioral profiles to sell them more goods or serve them more personalized ads. In other words, we really shouldn’t re-introduce this given all major web browser vendors have been moving towards phasing out 3P cookies. But if we can’t share a wallet address how can we solve this problem?</p>

 A paradigm beyond sharing a cross-origin globally unique identifier (wallet address) 

<p>The answer in my opinion here lies in going down the thick client approach rather than thick app approach. What I mean by “thick” is where the majority of application logic is handled. Today, much of the UX, unsigned transaction generation, and many other aspects are handled by the site. This is probably because the site has no way to request the wallet handles this for them and because the site has desires to build a brand recognition around their protocol using the UX from the site as an value differentiator.</p>

<p>However, we can imagine a world where the site casts an intent to the wallet, such that the wallet can display and generate the necessary information to display to the user. A toy example, I like to use here is through a very specific API designed for checking out and paying with Web3.</p>

<p>A wallet could enable the following API to perform a checkout operation without needing to share an address:</p>

   <code>const checkoutTxn = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: "wallet_checkout",
    params: {
        recipient: "eip155:1:0x1234abc", // a pseudonoymous address to send funds to
        amount: "100.01",
        currency: [
            "eip155:1:0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
            "eip155:1:0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7"
        ]
    }
});
</code>   

<p>In this you’ll notice a different paradigm. First, the wallet doesn’t need to send the wallet address to the site so it can generate the transaction, instead it will leave it up to the wallet to decide this. Second, the site communicates what it desires to the wallet and lets it decide how to handle it. So for example, it wants the user to send $100.01 worth of either USDC on Base L2 or USDT on mainnet which is communicated based on the currency contract address. If the user doesn’t have USDC or USDT on the proper network the wallet can perform the underlying swaps and bridging to assist with completing the intended transaction so that the caller receives the money into the address they expect.</p>

<p>In summary, we shouldn’t be looking to perpetuate the legacy antipatterns of web2 in Web3 like third party cookies. Instead, we should be looking to extend the web platform in ways that browsers aren’t. In this way the value added capabilities we receive from Web3 for asset ownership become an extension of the web by enhancing it so that we can meet the land of web2 where they’re at, rather than building a separate Web3 island and expecting everyone to come join us.</p>

   Function calling with Gemma 
Google's Gemma 3 model (the 27B variant is particularly capable, I've been trying it out via Ollama) supports function calling exclusively through prompt engineering. The official documentation describes two recommended prompts - both of them suggest that the tool definitions are passed in as JSON schema, but the way the model should request tool executions differs.

  <p><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/capabilities/function-calling">Function calling with Gemma</a></p>
Google's Gemma 3 model (the 27B variant is particularly capable, I've been trying it out <a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3">via Ollama</a>) supports function calling exclusively through prompt engineering. The official documentation describes two recommended prompts - both of them suggest that the tool definitions are passed in as JSON schema, but the way the model should request tool executions differs.<p></p>
<p>The first prompt uses Python-style function calling syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s),
 you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]</code></p>
<p><code>You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call a function</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Always love seeing CAPITALS for emphasis in prompts, makes me wonder if they proved to themselves that capitalization makes a difference in this case.)</p>
<p>The second variant uses JSON instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s),
you MUST put it in the format of {"name": function name, "parameters": dictionary of argument name and its value}</code></p>
<p><code>You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call a function</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a neat illustration of the fact that all of these fancy tool using LLMs are still using effectively the same pattern as was described in <a href="https://react-lm.github.io/">the ReAct paper</a> back in November 2022. Here's <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern">my implementation of that pattern</a> from March 2023.

I’m joined by two founding engineers on this project: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkaufman5/">Jonathan Kaufman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahfiner/">Noah Finer</a>.</p><p>In our chat, Jonathan and Noah pull back the curtain on what it took to build Figma Slides. They share engineering challenges faced, interesting engineering practices utilized, and what it's like working on a product used by millions of designers worldwide.</p><p>We talk about:</p>  <p>An overview of Figma Slides</p>  <p>Tech stack</p>  <p>Why the engineering team built grid view before single slide view</p>  <p>How all Figma files look the same across browsers</p>  <p>The "vibe testing" approach</p>  <p>How beta testing helped experiment more</p>  <p>The “all flags on”, “all flags off” testing approach</p>  <p>Engineering Crits</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this conversation:</p><p>1. Figma’s web app uses a surprising amount of C++ code. It’s rare for web engineers to need to use C++ — but Figma is an exception, as the design tool built their own rendering engine. This means that frontend engineers need to get into the opinionated C++ codebase to make changes — though rewriting some parts of the code to TypeScript is currently on the way.</p><p>2. The “EngCrit” process is an interesting — and unique! — one. Figma’s engineering reviews/discussions are called EngCrit. An engineer presents their plan or idea in a FigJam board, and other engineers join in to give their feedback. This process has parallels with the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rfcs-and-design-docs">RFC or design doc process</a> — but it feels a lot more lightweight. Plus, it dogfoods Figma’s own products!</p><p>3. Some of the most straightforward UI parts are the most involved ones. It was interesting to learn that one of the most complicated pieces of the web app was the Single Slide View. This seemingly simple interface:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5c1dec4-8bb6-40cd-92b7-101a3431c895_3840x2161.png">          </a>The “Single Slide View.” How hard could it be to build this seemingly simple UI? <p>The reason for the complexity was how this view is actually a zoomed in version of the grid view — this one:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcec2e27d-8064-4943-be2c-d2c6e9e1ffc5_3840x2161.png">          </a>The “Grid View.” The Single Slide View zooms into this visual, and hides everything else but the single slide <p>There are several reasons that the team decided to do this “zoomed in trick:” one of them is that when multiple people are editing a slide, zooming in means that the cursors for these other users show up both on the slide view and on the grid view.</p><p>This detail is a good reminder that a simple UI can hide a complex implementation.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture">Inside Figma’s engineering culture</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/qa-across-tech">Quality Assurance across the tech industry</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-first-software-engineering">Design-first software engineering</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rfcs-and-design-docs">Engineering planning with RFCs, design documents and ADRs</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=105s">01:45</a>) An overview of Figma Slides and the first steps in building it</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=401s">06:41</a>) Why Figma built grid view before single slide view</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=600s">10:00</a>) The next steps of building UI after grid view</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=730s">12:10</a>) The team structure and size of the Figma Slides team</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=854s">14:14</a>) The tech stack behind Figma Slides</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=931s">15:31</a>) How Figma uses C++ with bindings</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1063s">17:43</a>) The Chrome debugging extension used for C++ and WebAssembly</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1262s">21:02</a>) An example of how Noah used the debugging tool</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1338s">22:18</a>) Challenges in building Figma Slides</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1395s">23:15</a>) An explanation of multiplayer cursors</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1575s">26:15</a>) Figma’s philosophy of building interconnected products—and the code behind them</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1702s">28:22</a>) An example of a different mouse behavior in Figma</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1980s">33:00</a>) Technical challenges in developing single slide view</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2110s">35:10</a>) Challenges faced in single-slide view while maintaining multiplayer compatibility</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2400s">40:00</a>) The types of testing used on Figma Slides</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2622s">43:42</a>) Figma’s zero bug policy</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2730s">45:30</a>) The release process, and how engineering uses feature flags</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2920s">48:40</a>) How Figma tests Slides with feature flags enabled and then disabled</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=3095s">51:35</a>) An explanation of eng crits at Figma</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=3293s">54:53</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Initial development   <p>The initial development took about 6 months, starting at a hackathon in late 2023 and the beta launch in April 2024. The public launch happened a week ago, on 19 March.</p>  <p>Phasing of the project</p>  <p>“Slide grid:” the first concept built on a hack week</p>  <p>The initial development was about getting the two-way navigation right between the grid view and the single slide view.</p>  <p>Single slide view construction happened later, around 6 months into the project.</p>  <p>Single slide view operates by zooming into the infinite canvas and hiding elements, maintaining the 2D space. Clever!</p>    <p>User researcher part of the team: this was surprising to hear! The researcher helped a lot with getting the direction of the project right – building something designers would find intuitive to use</p>   Tech stack and tools   <p>Figma's core editors use a C++ codebase and custom renderer outputting to a &lt;canvas&gt; element via WebGL or WebGPU.</p>  <p>UI elements outside the canvas use TypeScript and React.</p>  <p>A "bindings layer" enables communication between the C++ codebase and the web UI.</p>  <p>The C++ codebase</p>  <p>Some engineers join with C++ experience; others learn on the job.</p>  <p>Both Jon and Noah learned C++ on the job, for the most part!</p>  <p>The C++ codebase has a learning curve, similar to game engine development.</p>    <p>Rewriting some C++ to Typescript</p>  <p>Figma is rewriting parts of the C++ codebase into TypeScript, using the bindings layer.</p>  <p>Interactive elements like plus buttons use TypeScript to interact with the C++ canvas.</p>    <p>Tooling for debugging</p>  <p>A Chrome extension called<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/wasm"> DWARF debugging</a> is a powerful tool the team uses</p>  <p>This extension debugs C++ code within Chrome Inspector, even as WebAssembly, similar to JavaScript source maps.</p>  <p>Breakpoints can be set in TypeScript/React and C++ WebAssembly for debugging interactions.</p>  <p>This tooling helps find intricate bugs between the UI and the core editor.</p>  <p>Previously, C++ debugging involved running a special build in Xcode.</p>  <p>Figma has an internal "web bisect" tool using commit previews to identify bug-introducing commits. A very helpful tool!</p>     Engineering practices   <p>Testing: the team does a lot of this.</p>  <p>They run all unit and interaction tests with flags off and then on. Another clever approach</p>  <p>This practice helps prevent regressions caused by specific feature flags.</p>    <p>Feature flags: extensively used. The product has more than 2,000 of these.</p>  <p>Developers have an internal panel to manage feature flags locally and in staging.</p>    <p>Staging: a dedicated staging environment used for testing. Features in this environment are enabled via flags. Staging is used to get early product feedback</p>  <p>Alpha launch: this was done for Slides by involving select customers</p>  <p>Eng Crits: asynchronous feedback via sticky notes in FigJam, followed by discussion.</p>  <p>Zero bug policy</p>  <p>Figma has a "zero bug policy" for new developments, prioritising fixes after launch</p>  <p>The on-call process triages feedback, and addresses reported issues promptly.</p>    <p>Beta phase: this 11-month long period prioritized critical bugs affecting core experience before the broader launch.</p>   Engineering challenges   <p>Single slide view implementation as viewport manipulation presented unique challenges.</p>  <p>This approach allows existing multiplayer cursor functionality in both views.</p>  <p>Multiplayer uses a server-side Rust service for edit propagation and conflict resolution via WebSockets.</p>  <p>Ensuring "interop" between Figma products</p>  <p>Ensuring products like Design, FigJam, and Slides work nicely with one another</p>  <p>Supporting interop means new node types must function across editors.</p>  <p>What makes it easier is how the underlying C++ codebase is largely shared across editors.</p>  <p>Differences in interactions use "mouse behaviors", editor-specific implementations for mouse actions. The mouse behavior concept comes from game engine architectures.</p>    <p>Custom text rendering</p>  <p>Figma has custom text rendering for consistency across browsers and operating systems.</p>  <p>This means that in-house development is needed for features like spellcheck – something that comes for free for web apps using the DOM!</p>    <p>Managing a collapsed state in a single slide view without file persistence was a state management problem.</p>  <p>Reordering slides in single slide view with multiplayer</p>  <p>To do so: state mutations needed to be minimized</p>  <p>The solution used existing auto layout nodes, with each slide row as a node within a grid node</p>  <p>Reordering manipulates the "parent index" of row nodes, minimizing mutations</p>    <p>Testing complex multiplayer interactions</p>  <p>This was difficult to do! It’s hard to reproduce problematic multi-user scenarios</p>  <p>Extensive unit tests are put in-place for grid reconciliation. These cover past bug scenarios and assert expected mutations. (This is a clever way to ensure fewer regressions!)</p>    <p>Where to find Jonathan Kaufman:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/kauffecup">https://x.com/kauffecup</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkaufman5/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkaufman5/</a></p><p>• Website: <a href="https://www.jkaufman.io/">https://www.jkaufman.io/</a></p><p>Where to find Noah Finer:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/finerflame">https://x.com/finerflame</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahfiner/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahfiner/</a></p><p>• Website: <a href="https://noahfiner.com/">https://noahfiner.com/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Figma: <a href="https://www.figma.com/">https://www.figma.com/</a></p><p>• Figma Slides: <a href="https://www.figma.com/slides/">https://www.figma.com/slides/</a></p><p>• Config: <a href="https://config.figma.com/">https://config.figma.com/</a></p><p>• FigJam: <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">https://www.figma.com/figjam/</a></p><p>• C++: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B</a></p><p>• Typescript: <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">https://www.typescriptlang.org/</a></p><p>• React: <a href="https://react.dev/">https://react.dev/</a></p><p>• Debug C/C++ WebAssembly: <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/wasm">https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/wasm</a></p><p>• Xcode: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/</a></p><p>• Multiplayer cursors: <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1267761575266415196/multiplayer-cursors">https://www.figma.com/community/file/1267761575266415196/multiplayer-cursors</a></p><p>• How Figma’s multiplayer technology works: <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/</a></p><p>• Design-first software engineering: Craft – with Balint Orosz: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-first-software-engineering">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-first-software-engineering</a></p><p>• Reconciliation: <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html">https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html</a></p><p>• Inside Figma’s Engineering Culture: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture</a></p><p>• How we engineer feedback at Figma with eng crits: <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-run-eng-crits-at-figma/">https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-run-eng-crits-at-figma/</a></p><p>• Nextjs: <a href="https://nextjs.org/">https://nextjs.org/</a></p><p>• Hacker News: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a></p><p>• Refactoring UI: <a href="https://www.refactoringui.com/">https://www.refactoringui.com/</a></p><p>• Tailwind: <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">https://tailwindcss.com/</a></p><p>• Adam Wathan’s website: <a href="https://adamwathan.me/">https://adamwathan.me/</a></p><p>• Steve Schoger’s website: <a href="https://www.steveschoger.com/">https://www.steveschoger.com/</a></p><p>• Piranesi: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Piranesi-Susanna-Clarke/dp/1635577802/">https://www.amazon.com/Piranesi-Susanna-Clarke/dp/1635577802/</a></p><p>• Immune: A Journey into the Mysterious System That Keeps You Alive: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Immune-Kurzgesagt-gorgeously-illustrated-immune/dp/1529360684">https://www.amazon.com/Immune-Kurzgesagt-gorgeously-illustrated-immune/dp/1529360684</a></p><p>—</p><p>Production and marketing by <a href="https://penname.co/">Pen Name</a>.

Offshore vehicles are often used to keep investors anonymous."</p></blockquote><p>The key point here is not that the Chinese investments are illegal - they probably aren't - or that anyone thinks SpaceX is being directed by the Chinese government. What's odd is that the company prefers the obfuscation: it sounds like they don't accept Chinese investment unless it's being channeled through an offshore vehicle designed to hide their involvement from regulatory scrutiny. That obfuscation is particularly important given that Elon Musk is now a part of the US government.</p>

It's written with a kind of ironic detachment that seeks to minimize the Wynn-Williams' own culpability, and while it's an engaging, jaw-dropping read, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2025/careless-people-book-review-facebook-global-policy/">there are clear omissions</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"In recounting events, the author glosses over her own indifference to repeated warnings from policymakers, civil society, and internal teams outside the U.S. that ultimately led to serious harm to communities.</p><p>[...] Her delayed reckoning underscores how Facebook’s leadership remains largely detached from real-world consequences of their decisions until they become impossible to ignore. Perhaps because everyone wants to be a hero of their own story, Wynn-Williams frames her opposition to leadership decisions as isolated; in reality, powerful resistance had long existed within what Wynn-Williams describes as Facebook’s “lower-level employees.”"</p></blockquote><p>The author has personal experience working for Facebook as part of the global teams Wynn-Williams presided over, cleaning up the messes that she and her colleagues created.</p><p>As such, the author sees the gaps clearly, and her review cuts to the core of the problem with the book. That doesn't mean it's valueless, and in some ways it's strongest when detailing the personalities of people like Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, and contrasting the public face of Lean In with her experiences of being a mother while working alongside them.</p><p>The fact that Facebook <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/careless-people-sarah-wynn-williams-facebook-gag-order.html">is attempting to suppress the book</a> inherently makes it worth reading, in my view, and I think it should be read by everyone in the tech industry. Not only because it’s a cautionary tale in itself, but because the personalities described here are rife in the industry. </p><p>I’ve never spoken to Mark or Sheryl or Joel or most of the rest of them, but I’ve met people like them, with those same sensibilities, and they are every bit as shallow and driven by power as is laid out here. These are the people to avoid. These are the people who will lead us into hell. These are the people who, in very real ways, through genocides, swung elections, and the violence of indifference to real human suffering, already are. </p><p>The thing is, Sarah Wynn-Williams was one of them.</p>

Whatever the answer, it should now be clear that history is happening, big time.

  <p>I've added a new content type to my blog: notes. These join my existing types: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=entry">entries</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=blogmark">bookmarks</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=quotation">quotations</a>.</p>
<p>A note is a little bit like a bookmark without a link. They're for short form writing - thoughts or images that don't warrant a full entry with a title. The kind of things I used to post to Twitter, but that don't feel right to cross-post to multiple social networks (Mastodon and Bluesky, for example.)</p>
<p>I was partly inspired by Molly White's <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/micro">short thoughts, notes, links, and musings</a>.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this for a while, but the amount of work involved in modifying all of the parts of my site that handle the three different content types was daunting. Then this evening I tried running my blog's source code (using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) through <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/">the new Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>:</p>
  files-to-prompt . -e py -c | \
  llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 -s \
  'I want to add a new type of content called a Note,
  similar to quotation and bookmark and entry but it
  only has a markdown text body. Output all of the
  code I need to add for that feature and tell me
  which files to add  the code to.'  

<p>Gemini gave me <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6d9fb3e33e7105d391a31367d6a235de#response">a detailed 13 step plan</a> covering all of the tedious changes I'd been avoiding having to figure out!</p>
<p>The code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/527">is in this PR</a>, which touched 18 different files. The whole project took around 45 minutes start to finish.</p>
<p>(I used Claude to <a href="https://claude.ai/share/17656d59-6f52-471e-8aeb-6abbe1464471">brainstorm names</a> for the feature - I had it come up with possible nouns and then "rank those by least pretentious to most pretentious", and "notes" came out on top.)</p>
<p>This is now far too long for a note and should really be upgraded to an entry, but I need to post a first note to make sure everything is working as it should.</p>

   Introducing 4o Image Generation 
When OpenAI first announced GPT-4o back in May 2024 one of the most exciting features was true multi-modality in that it could both input and  output audio and images. The "o" stood for "omni", and the image output examples in that launch post looked really impressive.

  <p><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">Introducing 4o Image Generation</a></p>
When OpenAI first announced GPT-4o <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/13/gpt-4o/">back in May 2024</a> one of the most exciting features was true multi-modality in that it could both input and  output audio and images. The "o" stood for "omni", and the image output examples <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">in that launch post</a> looked really impressive.<p></p>
<p>It's taken them over ten months (and Gemini <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/experiment-with-gemini-20-flash-native-image-generation/">beat them to it</a>) but today they're finally making those image generation abilities available, live right now in ChatGPT for paying customers.</p>
<p>My test prompt for any model that can manipulate incoming images is "Turn this into a selfie with a bear", because you should never take a selfie with a bear! I fed ChatGPT <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/selfie.jpg">this selfie</a> and got back this result:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That's pretty great! It mangled the text on my T-Shirt (which says "LAWRENCE.COM" in a creative font) and added a second visible AirPod. It's very clearly me though, and that's definitely a bear.</p>
<p>There are plenty more examples in <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">OpenAI's launch post</a>, but as usual the most interesting details are tucked away in <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-image-generation-system-card-addendum/">the updates to the system card</a>. There's lots in there about their approach to safety and bias, including a section on "Ahistorical and Unrealistic Bias" which feels inspired by Gemini's <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-image-generation-issue/">embarrassing early missteps</a>.</p>
<p>One section that stood out to me is their approach to images of public figures. The new policy is much more permissive than for DALL-E - highlights mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4o image generation is capable, in many instances, of generating a depiction of a public figure based solely on a text prompt.</p>
<p>At launch, we are not blocking the capability to generate adult public figures but are instead implementing the same safeguards that we have implemented for editing images of photorealistic uploads of people. For instance, this includes seeking to block the generation of photorealistic images of public figures who are minors and of material that violates our policies related to violence, hateful imagery, instructions for illicit activities, erotic content, and other areas. Public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated can opt out.</p>
<p>This approach is more fine-grained than the way we dealt with public figures in our DALL·E series of models, where we used technical mitigations intended to prevent any images of a public figure from being generated. This change opens the possibility of helpful and beneficial uses in areas like educational, historical, satirical and political speech. After launch, we will continue to monitor usage of this capability, evaluating our policies, and will adjust them if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that "public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated can opt out" I wonder if we'll see a stampede of public figures to do exactly that!</p>
<p>Update: There's significant confusion right now over this new feature because it is being rolled out gradually but older ChatGPT can still generate images using DALL-E instead... and there is no visual indication in the ChatGPT UI explaining which image generation method it used!</p>
<p>OpenAI made the same mistake last year <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/15/chatgpt-in-4o-mode/">when they announced ChatGPT advanced voice mode</a> but failed to clarify that ChatGPT was still running the previous, less impressive voice implementation.</p>
<p>Update 2: Images created with DALL-E through the ChatGPT web interface now show a note with a warning:</p>

<p></p><p>Inadvertently, the other day, I became one of&nbsp;those people.</p><p>My team and I were sitting together as part of a week-long summit; some attendees were in New York City, while others attended remotely. I was taking them through the principles that I believe are important for developing software for our newsroom: a laser focus on the needs of a real user, building the smallest thing we can and then testing and iterating from there, shortening feedback loops, and focusing on the most targeted work we can that will meaningfully make progress towards our goals.</p><p>And then I said it:</p><p>“I see our team as a startup.”</p><p>Oof. It wasn’t even the first time the words had left my mouth. Or the second or the third.</p><p>One of my colleagues very kindly gave me feedback in a smaller session afterwards. She pointed out that this has become a cliché in larger organizations: a manager will say “we act like a startup” but then will do nothing of the sort. In fact, almost nobody in these settings can agree on what a startup even is.</p><p>And even if they did, the environment doesn’t allow it. Big companies don’t magically “act like a startup”. The layers of approval, organizational commitments, and big-org company culture are all inevitably still intact — how could they not be? — and the team is supposed to nebulously “be innovative” as a kind of thin corporate aspiration rather than an achievable, concrete practice. The definitions, resources, culture, and permission to act differently from the rest of the organization simply aren’t there. At best it’s naivety; at worst it’s a purposeful, backhanded call for longer hours and worse working conditions.</p><p>But when I said those words, I wasn’t thinking about corporate culture. I was remembering something else entirely.</p><p>I often think back to a conference I attended in Edinburgh — the Association for Learning Technology’s annual shindig, which that year was held on the self-contained campus of Heriot-Watt University. There, I made the mistake of criticizing RDF, a technology that was the darling of educational technologists at the time. That was why a well-regarded national figure in the space stood up and yelled at me at the top of his voice: “Why should anyone listen to you? You’re two guys in a shed!”</p><p>The thing is, we were two guys in a shed. With no money at all. And, at the time, I was loving it.</p><p>A few years earlier, I quit my job because I was certain that social networking platforms were a huge part of the future of how people would learn from each other and about the world. My co-founder and I didn’t raise funding: instead, we found customers early on and gave ourselves more time by earning revenue. Neither one of us was a businessman; we didn’t know what we were doing. We had to invent the future of our company — and do it with no money. It felt like we were willing it into existence, and we were doing it on our own terms. Nobody could tell us what to do; there was nobody to greenlight our ideas except our customers. It was thrilling. I’ve never felt more empowered in my career.</p><p>There is no way to recapture that inside of a larger organization. And nobody should want to.</p><p>The most important difference is that we owned the business. Each of us held a 50% share. Yes, we worked weird hours, pulled feats of technical gymnastics, and were working under the constant fear of running out of money, but that was a choice we made for ourselves — and if the business worked, we’d see the upside. That’s not true for anyone who can be described as an “employee” rather than a “founder”. Even if employees hold stock in the company, the stake is always orders of magnitude smaller; their ability to set the direction of the company, smaller still.</p><p>Another truth is that almost nobody has done this. If you’ve worked in larger institutions for most of your career, you’ve never felt the same urgency. If you’ve never bootstrapped a startup, the word might conjure up memories of two million dollar raises and offices in SoMA. Maybe a Series C company with hundreds of people on staff. Or Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, backstabbing his way to riches. In each case, the goal is to grow the company, make your way to an IPO or an exit, and be a good steward of investor value. In places like San Francisco, that’s probably a more common startup story than mine. But it’s an entirely different adventure.</p><p>So instead of using the word “startup” and somehow expecting people to innately connect with my lived experience on a wholesale basis, what do I actually want to convey? What do I think is important?</p><p>I think it’s these things:</p>  Experiment-driven: The team has autonomy to conceive of, design, run, and execute on the results of repeated, small, measurable experiments. 
 Human-centered: The team has their “customers” (their exact users) in mind and is trying to solve their real problems as quickly as possible. Nobody is building a bubble and spending a year “scratching their own itch” without knowing if their user will “buy” it. 
 Low-budget: The team is conscious about cost, scope, and complexity. There’s no assumption of infinite time, money, or attention. That constraint is a feature, not a bug. 
 Time-bound: The team is focused on quick wins that move the needle quickly, not larger projects with far-off deadlines (or no deadline at all). 
 Outcome-driven: The point is to help the user, not to spend our time doing one activity or sticking to a known area of expertise. If buying off the shelf fits the budget and gets us there faster, then that’s what we do. If it turns out that the user needs something different, then that’s what we build. Quickly. 
 <p>That’s what I was trying to say. Not that we’re a startup — but that we can and should work in a way that’s fast, focused, and grounded in real human needs. We don’t need the mythology or the branded T-shirts. We just need the mindset — and the permission.</p>

<p>AI Engineering is the hottest new engineering field, and it’s also an increasingly loaded phrase which can mean a host of different things to different people. It can refer to ML engineers building AI models, or data scientists and analysts working with large language models (LLMs), or software engineers building on top of LLMs, etc. To make things more confusing, some AI tooling vendors use the term for their products, like Cognition AI naming theirs an “AI engineer.”</p><p>In her new book “AI Engineering,” author Chip Huyen <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-with-chip-huyen">defines</a> AI engineering as building applications that use LLMs, placing it between software engineering (building software products using languages, frameworks, and APIs), and ML engineering (building models for applications to use). Overall, AI engineering feels closer to software engineering because it usually starts with software engineers building AI applications using LLM APIs. The more complex the AI engineering use case, the more it can morph into looking like ML engineering.</p><p>Today, we focus on software engineers who have switched to being AI engineers. These are devs who work with LLMs, and build features and products on top of them. We cover:</p>  <p>What are companies building? An overview of seven companies at different stages and in various segments of tech.</p>  <p>Onboarding to AI Engineering as a software engineer. Approaches that help devs get up to speed faster.</p>  <p>Tech stack. Seven different tech stacks, showcasing variety and some common choices.</p>  <p>Engineering challenges. Problems caused by LLMs being non-deterministic, evals, latency, privacy, and more.</p>  <p>Novel tooling. Several companies build in-house tooling, which pays off with this fast-moving technology. Incident management startup, incident.io, shares their unique, bespoke stack.</p>  <p>Cost considerations. LLMs can quickly get expensive, although costs are dropping quickly. But as this happens, usage tends to grow which causes its own issues. Businesses share how big a deal costs really are.</p>  <p>Learnings from software devs turned AI engineers. Building a prototype is the easy bit, vibes-based development inevitably turns bad, smart teams fail because they get overwhelmed; educating AI users, and more.</p>  <p>Note: I am an investor in incident.io and Wordsmith, which both share details in this deepdive. I always focus on being unbiased in these articles – but at the same time, being an investor means these companies share otherwise hard-to-obtain details. I was not paid by any business to mention them in this article. See <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">my ethics statement</a> for more.</p><p>Thanks to the engineers contributing to this deepdive: <a href="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/">Lawrence Jones</a> (senior staff engineer at incident.io), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tillman-elser/">Tillman Elser</a> (AI lead at Sentry), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossmcnairn/">Ross McNairn</a> (cofounder at Wordsmith AI), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/igoro/">Igor Ostrovsky</a> (cofounder at Augment Code), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-morgis-44015027/">Matt Morgis</a> (Staff Engineer, AI, formerly at Elsevier), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-peacock-133749120/">Ashley Peacock</a> (Staff Engineer at Simply Business), and <a href="https://x.com/ryanecogswell">Ryan Cogswell</a> (Application Architect at DSI).</p> 1. What are companies building?  Incident.io: incident note taker and bot <p><a href="http://incident.io">Incident.io</a> is a tool to help resolve outages as they happen. A few months ago, the engineering team went back to the drawing board to build features that capitalize on how much LLMs have improved to date. Two of these features:</p>  <p>AI note taker during incidents. This includes live transcription, real-time summaries for people joining a call to get up to speed with, and key decisions/actions to clarify who does what.</p>  <p>Incident investigator: an agent looks into an ongoing incident by checking code, logs, monitoring, and old incidents to identify root causes and share findings, with a responder being paged. More details on <a href="https://incident.io/building-with-ai">how this tool is built</a>.</p>  <p>Both these features make heavy use of LLMs, and also integrate with several other systems like backend services, Slack, etc.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcec9ab8-fa1e-4d85-9570-c4d9f08fa2bc_1600x879.png">          </a>AI feature: when joining an incident, get a summary of what’s currently being discussed  Sentry: Autofix and issue grouping <p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> is a popular application monitoring software. Two interesting projects they built:</p>  <p>Autofix: make it really fast to go from a problem with code (a Sentry issue) to a fix with a GitHub PR. Autofix is an open source RAG framework that combines all of Sentry’s context/telemetry data with code in order to root cause, fix, and create unit tests for bugs.</p>  <p>Issue Grouping: cut down alerting volume while reducing noise. For this, the team used recent advancements in approximate neighbor search (ANN), plus dramatic recent improvements in embedding quality from the new BERT architecture transformer models.</p>  <p>Both these features are <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/seer">fair source</a>, meaning you can see exactly how they work.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0569b70-50cb-4f63-84ff-2f4f18eefdf4_1498x1295.png">          </a>Autofix identifies the root cause of an issue with a useless Stack Trace  Wordsmith: legal AI <p><a href="https://www.wordsmith.ai/">Wordsmith</a> is building AI tools that legal teams use, including:</p>  <p>Documents workspace: plug into all of a company’s communication streams, including analyzing documents and augmenting their contents, and drafting communications. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXrQ5WZzTG8">Check out a video of it in action.</a></p>  <p>AI contract review: A product that can analyse any contract or website, then review it and generate a marked-up word doc, <a href="https://app.wordsmith.ai/shared/reviews/f110ec32-759d-4f63-beee-d058a49a7175">here</a>. Basically, it’s a lawyer anyone can use.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1942506b-a161-45bf-a823-e09490234691_1600x929.png">          </a>AI contract review: AI tool detects, highlights and summarizes potential contractual issues  Augment Code <p><a href="https://www.augmentcode.com/">Augment Code</a> is an AI coding assistant for engineering teams and large codebases. This kind of product probably needs little introduction for devs:</p>  <p>AI coding assistant: including IDE extensions for VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor, and Vim, and a Slack extension</p>  <p>Fine-tuning models: for AI coding tools, models make a big difference. The team don’t pre-train models or build their own LLMs, but run extensive post-training and do fine tuning to suit the 4-5 models used for specific coding-related cases.</p>   Elsevier: RAG platform <p><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/">Elsevier</a> is one of the world’s leading publishers of scientific and medical content. Matt Morgis was an engineering manager at the company when the engineering leadership noticed that several product teams were independently implementing <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">RAG capabilities</a>; each sourcing content, parsing it, chunking it, and creating embeddings.</p><p>An enterprise-wide RAG platform was the solution Matt and his team built, to enable multiple teams to build AI-powered products for medical and scientific professionals. Their platform consists of:</p>  <p>Database. A content database that centralized and normalized content from various sources.</p>  <p>Embeddings+search: A content embedding &amp; indexing pipeline and vector search API.</p>  <p>LLM API: interfacing to multiple LLM models. This API allows teams to experiment with different models by changing a parameter on the API. It also allowed Elsevier to track the usage of various LLM models based on applications using it.</p>  <p>Products built on top of this platform:</p>  <p>Intelligent tutoring system for medical students</p>  <p>Clinical decisions support tool for doctors</p>   Insurance company: chatbot <p>Ashley Peacock is a staff software engineer at the insurer, <a href="https://www.simplybusiness.com/">Simply Business</a>, who built a pretty common use case: a chatbot for customers to get answers to questions. This seems like the simplest of use cases – you might assume it just involves connecting documentation for the chatbot to use – but it was surprisingly challenging because:</p>  <p>Industry regulation. The chatbot cannot be inaccurate or make things up, as customers use the information to make decisions about which insurance purchases.</p>  <p>Non-deterministic responses. The business needed to turn a nondeterministic chatbot into one that only produces approved responses.</p>  <p>The team had the idea to create an “approved answers” knowledge base for the chatbot, and faced the challenge of creating the questions for this. The team made the chatbot state when it cannot answer a question, and to then connect with human support, which then updated the knowledge base with their solution. This approach works pretty well after taking a few iterations to get right.</p> HR SaaS: summarization features <p><a href="https://datasolutionsinc.com">Data Solutions International</a> (DSI) is a 30-person HR tech company with 5 engineers, selling products that help with performance review processes, assessments, and employee engagement surveys. The company is family-owned, has been operating for 27 years, and is profitable.</p><p>Summarizing comments for employee engagement processes was the first feature they wanted to build, as something customers would appreciate, and which the team could learn about working with LLMs from.</p><p>During an employee engagement process, there are questions like "what do you like most about working here", and "if you could change one thing about working at Company X, what would it be?", etc. For larger companies with thousands of employees, there may be thousands of comments per question. Individual departmental leads might read all comments relevant to them, but there’s no way an HR team at a very large business could check every single comment.</p><p>Before LLMs, such comments were categorized into predefined categories, which were hardcoded, per company and per survey. This was okay, but not great. Data Solutions International’s goal was to use LLMs to summarize a large number of comments, and report to survey admins the broad categories which comments belong in, how many comments per category there are, and to allow drilling down into the data.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9871893a-4a76-48ee-919d-71f457c55e2e_1600x734.png">          </a>Summary of teamwork-related comments: The feature builds a word cloud of common topics from thousands of comments, and provides an overview of any term  2. Onboarding to AI Engineering as a software engineer <p>So, how do you get started building applications with LLMs as a software engineer transitioning to this new field? Some advice from folks at the above companies who have:</p> You can teach AI yourself – and probably should <p>Let’s start with an encouraging story from veteran software engineer <a href="https://x.com/ryanecogswell">Ryan Cogswell</a>, at HR tech company, DSI. He joined the company 25 years ago, and was the first engineering hire. When AI tools came along, DSI decided to build a relatively simple first AI feature in their HR system that summarized comments for employee engagement purposes. Neither Ryan nor any of the other 4 devs had expertise in AI and LLMs, so the company contracted an external agency which offered a fixed, timeboxed offer to scope the project. Here’s how it went:</p>  <p>Month #1: the agency goes and builds stuff, and shares LLM outputs with DSI</p>  <p>Month #2: while continuing to iterate on desired outputs, devs at DSI ask the agency for access to how things work. They get access to scripts and notebooks</p>  <p>Month #3: the agency lays out the proposed architecture for the project.</p>  <p>The proposal was for a really complex architecture:</p>  <p>SageMaker: a heavyweight solution from AWS to build, train, and deploy ML models</p>  <p>Langfuse: an open source LLM engineering platform to debug and improve LLM applications</p>  <p>Lambdas: serverless functions to run computations</p>  <p>Database #1: store interim states of data between prompts</p>  <p>Database #2: storing user feedback</p>  <p>Other parts: to support RAG aspects</p>  <p>Pipings: to hold it all together</p>  <p>The agency quoted 6-9 months to build the relatively small feature (!!), and an estimated operational cost higher than DSI’s entire investment in all their infrastructure! This was when Ryan asked how hard it could be to build it themselves, and got to work reading and prototyping, making himself the company’s resident GenAI expert.</p><p>In 2 months, Ryan and a couple of colleagues built the feature for a fraction of the cost to operate than the agency’s quote. His tech stack choice:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock: chosen for cost (vs hosting own models), security, and that the platform doesn’t use their input or output tokens for training</p>  <p><a href="https://cohere.com/blog/introducing-embed-v3">Cohere Embed v3</a>: the model used to generate embeddings</p>  <p>PostgreSQL: to store embeddings and do vector-based database queries, using AWS Aurora PostgreSQL</p>  <p>Java: the backend code runs on this, deployed in AWS</p>  <p>React: the frontend that fetches and displays the data, integrated into the existing web app</p>   Get used to non-deterministic outputs <p>Ross McNairn is cofounder and CEO of the startup, Wordsmith, which several software engineers have joined. You need to rethink how to think about things, he says:</p><blockquote><p>“Working with AI requires a totally different way of approaching problems.</p><p>For new joiner engineers, there is a major readjustment in the first few weeks while they explore the codebase and participate in discussions. There are so many problems that can be eloquently sidestepped using AI. Understanding the suite of tools available takes some time.<br><br>Getting comfortable with evaluations and iterating on non-deterministic outputs is the biggest challenge most devs have. A lot of solutions are more subjective: engineers need to really understand the domain in order to assess if output is high-quality. It takes time to ramp up to the point where you can confidently assess output quality.”</p></blockquote> Switching to in-house can be easier, even for EMs <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-morgis-44015027/">Matt Morgis</a> was an engineering manager at Elsevier who decided to transition back to staff engineer, specifically to work on AI:</p><blockquote><p>“The move to go from manager to IC was deliberate: working with AI has rekindled my joy in coding.</p><p>For experienced engineers who know how to break problems down, AI tools are an incredible force multiplier. At the same time, when I was a manager, I saw AI coding tools handicap junior engineers’ development. The tools are powerful, but I think they’re best wielded by those who understand good software engineering principles.”</p></blockquote><p>The transition was successful, and today Matt is a staff engineer focusing on GenAI at CVS Health.</p> 3. Tech stack <p>Here’s the tech stack which various companies used. There’s no right or wrong tech stack – what follows is for context and inspiration, not a blueprint.</p> Incident.io <p>The stack:</p>  <p>Postgres and <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector">pgvector</a> for storing embeddings and searching them</p>  <p>ChatGPT 4o as the default model, and Sonnet 3.7 for code analysis and technical tasks, as they find this Anthropic model performs better. Built in a way to easily switch between them as needed</p>  <p>Gemini: some models used GCP’s Vertex offering, but less often than other models</p>  <p>GCP using Kubernetes: the infrastructure layer</p>  <p>Go on the backend, running as a monolith</p>  <p>React + Typescript on the frontend, including for the dashboard of their own developers’ custom AI tools (covered below)</p>   Sentry <p>In-house LLM agent tooling: the team evaluated and rejected using a tool like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LangChain">LangChain</a> framework to integrate LLMs with other data sources and into workflows. It was a lot more work to build their own, but the upsides are that the architecture and code are more in-line with abstractions and design patterns in Sentry’s existing codebase.</p><p>The company used the following languages and frameworks to build this tooling:</p>  <p>Postgres for database and vector store, <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector">pgvector</a> for similarity search (for Approximate Nearest Neighbor – <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/">ANN</a> – search)</p>  <p>Clickhouse for online analytical processing (OLAP)</p>  <p>Sentry for observability – it would be odd to not use their own product for this</p>  <p>Kubernetes for orchestrating compute resources</p>  <p>Python and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> (machine learning library) for inference</p>   Legal AI startup Wordsmith <p>The stack:</p>  <p>Pinecone as their vector database</p>  <p>LangChain as their framework to integrate LLMs into the stack. <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">LangSmith</a> as their developer platform</p>  <p><a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/">LlamaIndex</a> as orchestration frameworks to integrate data with LLMs</p>  <p>Multi-cloud providers:</p>  <p>AWS for running Anthropic models via Bedrock. AWS offers generous credits for startups, which was a factor in the choice</p>  <p>Azure to access OpenAI services because it allows specifying regions to use, which is important when serving EU customers, for example. Using OpenAI’s services directly would not allow switching of regions.</p>  <p>GCP: for Gemini and Vertex (Google’s search AI).</p>  <p>Azure and GCP each have business models for locking in customers; Microsoft is the only major cloud provider offering OpenAI models, and only GCP offers Gemini.</p><p>The company routes to different model by use case:</p>  <p>OpenAI: for reasoning-heavy use cases, where the o1 and o3 models are very strong</p>  <p>Groq: when performance is critical, or the goal is to augment UI. Wordsmith calls their API directly – as the performance of Groq is incredibly fast; a step-change in AI development, according to the WordSmith team. Note: <a href="https://groq.com/">Groq</a> is a standalone company and product, not to be confused with Grok, the AI assistant on social media site, X.</p>   AI coding assistant, Augment Code <p>The stack to build and run LLMs:</p>  <p>Google Cloud: the cloud vendor of choice</p>  <p>A3 Mega 600GPU/75 node cluster: used for LLM training and inference</p>  <p>NVIDIA: the hardware choice for GPUs, and for software (CUDA)</p>  <p>Python and PyTorch: the team wrote training and inference libraries making heavy use of PyTorch</p>   RAG platform at scientific publisher Elsevier <p>The scientific publisher used this stack to build their in-house RAG platform:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock and Azure OpenAI for hosting and running LLMs</p>  <p>LangChain for LLM integration</p>  <p>Snowflake as their content data warehouse</p>  <p>Embedding pipelines and vector database:</p>  <p><a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a> for running embedding pipelines</p>  <p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html">AWS Fargate for ECS</a> to run containers</p>  <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/">AWS OpenSearch</a> as the vector search database</p>      <p><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> (a Python-based web framework to build HTTP APIs) for HTTP APIs</p>   Chatbot for insurance company Simply Business <p>A pretty simple stack:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock to host the model, making use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-guardrails-in-knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock/">Knowledge Bases and Guardrails features</a></p>  <p>Anthropic Sonnet 3.5 model</p>  <p>Ruby on Rails as the language and framework, running it on top of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html">AWS ECS</a></p>   Summarization at HR tech DSI <p>As covered above, Ryan took the initiative at DSI by building a simpler solution than the one an AI vendor proposed. DSI ended up with:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock for running the models</p>  <p>PostgreSQL: to store embeddings and do vector-based database queries. Using AWS Aurora PostgreSQL, and <a href="https://cohere.com/blog/introducing-embed-v3">Cohere Embed v3</a> for generating embeddings</p>   Tech stack trends across companies <p>The seven businesses in this article are all different, but there are some common trends:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock: the preferred way to host and run Anthropic models</p>  <p>Postgres with pgvector: the database of choice to work with embeddings and vectors at most companies. The exception is Wordsmith, which uses vector database <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a></p>  <p>LangChain: a few places use this as the framework to integrate LLMs into their stacks</p>  <p>The bigger the scale, the closer you get to the “metal:” most startups are happy to use cloud providers to run LLMs. However, when starting to get into fine-tuning LLMs and heavy usage, it becomes time to rent larger resources and get close to the hardware. Augment Code using NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA software is an example.</p>   4. Engineering challenges <p>What unusual or new challenges does AI Engineering pose for more “traditional” software engineers? The most common ones mentioned:</p>

<p>This blog shows how to implement a delegated Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow in ASP.NET Core, and has a focus on access token management. The solution uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to implement the different flows and it really simple to implement, when you know how to use the Nuget package and use the correct Microsoft documentation. The application can request delegated access tokens On-Behalf-Of a user and another application, providing a seamless and secure access to protected resources using a zero trust strategy.</p>

 ASP.NET Core delegated Microsoft OBO access token management (Entra only) 
 



 Setup 



<p>Three applications can used in this setup. A web UI application, an API and another API which implements the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow for the users delegated access token and the application. The Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow">OBO</a> works very like part of the OAuth token exchange standard, but it is not a standard, just a Microsoft flavor for a standard.</p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per user session for delegated downstream API user tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. The tokens must be persisted safely in multiple instance setups. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens. Microsoft.Identity.Web implements this completely as long as as authentication and OAuth flows are implemented using Entra ID.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per user session 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely (Safe and encrypted storage if not in-memory) 



 The token must be replaced after each UI authentication (per user) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 



 The application must handle a user logout 
 



 Web UI 



<p>The first step in the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow is to authenticate the user and a web application using Entra ID. This is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The Web application uses OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE and a confidential client. The application requests an access token for the first API. The access token is a delegated access token issued for the user and the specific API. The implementation uses a secret to assert the application. Microsoft recommends using a certificate and client assertions when deploying to production.</p>

        options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
    }).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor()
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityConsentHandler();
  


<p>The WebApiEntraIdService class is used to use the access token from the web application and call the downstream API. If the access token is missing, or invalid, an new access token is requested in the application.</p>

 Web API using On-Behalf-Of Flow 



<p>The first Web API implements the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow to acquire a new access token for the existing access token and the user represented in the access token. The access token is a delegated access token. The API has no UI and does not use any UI flows. If the access token used in the request is invalid, a 401 is returned with an exception information on what permission or access token is required to use the API. If the API is requested using a valid access token, the API application uses the default scope and requests a new access token using a secret or a certificate. The new access token can be used to access the downstream API.</p>

 Running the applications 



<p>When the applications are started, the data from the downstream APIs is returned to the web application.</p>

 Further examples of the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow 



<p>Microsoft authentication authorization libraries are complicated and many. They is no one way to implement this. Microsoft provides Microsoft Graph Nuget packages, Azure SDK packages, mixes application and delegation flows, managed identities solutions, direct token acquisition and some legacy Nuget packages to integrate the security. Here are further examples of using the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow using different client solutions. </p>

<p>This Wednesday, March 26 at noon America/New_York (16:00 UTC), <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter
Eisentraut</a> has graciously agreed to give a talk at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/events/306569342/" title="Postgres Extensions Ecosystem Mini-Summit #2">Extension Mini Summit

I’m personally stoked for this topic, as freeing extensions from the legacy of
a single directory opens up a number of new patterns for packaging,
installation, and testing extensions. Hit the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/" title="Postgres Extension Ecosystem Mini-Summit on Meetup">Meetup</a> to register for this

 State of the Extensions Ecosystem 
<p>So I wanted to give a brief update on the state of the Postgres extension
ecosystem, the past, present, and future. Let’s give a brie history; it’s
quite long, actually.</p>
<p>There were originally two approaches back in the day. You could use shared
preload libraries to have it preload dynamic shareable libraries into the main
process. And then you could do pure SQL stuff using, including procedural
languages like PL/Perl, PL/Tcl, and such.</p>
<p>And there were a few intrepid early adopters, including PostGIS, BioPostgres,
PL/R, PL/Proxy, and pgTAP, who all made it work. Beginning of Postgres 9.1
Dimitri Fontaine added support for explicit support for extensions in the
Postgres core itself. The key features included the ability to compile and
install extensions. This is again, pure SQL and shared libraries.</p>
<p>There are <code>CREATE</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DROP EXTENSION</code> commands in SQL that you
can use to add extensions to a database, upgrade them to new versions and to
remove them. And then <code>pg_dump</code> and <code>pg_restore</code> support so that extensions
could be considered a single bundle to be backed up and restored with all of
their individual objects being included as part of the backup.</p>
<p>Back then, a number of us, myself included, saw this as an opportunity to have
the extensibility of Postgres itself be a fundamental part of the community
and distribution. I was a long time user of Perl and used CPAN, and I thought
we had something like CPAN for Postgres. So, I proposed <a href="https://pgxn.org/">PGXN</a>, the
PostgreSQL Extension Network, back in 2010. The idea was to do distribution of
source code. You would register namespaces for your extensions.</p>
<p>There was discovery via a website for search, documentation published, tags to
help you find different kinds of objects, and to support installation through
a command line interface. The compile and install stuff that Postgres itself
provides, using PGXS and Configure.</p>
<p>This is what PGXN looks like today. It was launched in 2011. There’s a command
line client, this website, an API an a registry you can upload your extensions
to. The most recent one was <code>pg_task</code> a day or so ago.</p>
<p>In the interim, since that came out in 2011/2012, the cloud providers have
come into their own with Postgres, but their support for extensions tends to
be rather limited. For non-core extension counts, as of yesterday, Azure
provides 38 extensions, GCP provides 44 extensions, and AWS 51. These are the
third party extensions that don’t come with Postgres and its contrib itself.
Meanwhile, PGXN has 420 extensions available to download, compile, build, and
install.</p>
<p>A GitHub project that tracks random extensions on the internet,
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">joelonsql/PostgreSQL-EXTENSIONs.md</a>), which is pretty comprehensive,
has almost 1200 extensions listed. So the question is why is the support not
more broad? Why aren’t there a thousand extensions available in every one of
these systems?</p>
<p>Rthis has been a fairly common question that’s come up in the last couple
years. A number of new projects have tired to fill in the gaps. One is
<a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="pg_tle: Framework for building trusted language extensions for PostgreSQL">Trusted Language Extensions</a>. They wanted to make it easier to
distribute extensions without needing dynamic shared libraries by adding
additional features in the database itself.</p>
<p>The idea was to empower app developers to make it easy to install extensions
via SQL functions rather than having to access the file system of the database
server system itself. It can be portable, so there’s no compilation required,
it hooks into the create extension command transparently, supports custom data
types, and there have been plans for foreign data wrappers and background
workers. I’m not sure how that’s progressed in the past year. The <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="pg_tle: Framework for building trusted language extensions for PostgreSQL">pg_tle</a>
extension itself was created by AWS and Supabase.</p>
<p>Another recent entrant in tooling for extensions is <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>, which is native
Rust extensions in Postgres. You build dynamic shared libraries, but write
them in pure Rust. The API for pgrx provides full access to Postgres features,
and still provides the developer-friendly tooling that Rust developers are
used to. There’s been a lot of community excitement the last couple of years
around pgrx, and it remains under active development — version 0.13.0 just
came out a week or so ago. It’s sponsored and run out of the PgCentral
Foundation.</p>
<p>There have also been a several new registries that have come up to try to fill
the gap and make extensions available. They have emphasized different things
than PGXN. One was ease of use. So, for example, here <a href="https://pgxman.com/" title="npm for PostgreSQL">pgxman</a> says it should
be really easy to install a client in a single command, and then it installs
something, and then it downloads and installs a binary version of your an
extension.</p>
<p>And then there was platform neutrality. They wanted to do binary distribution
and support multiple different platform, to know what binary∑ to install for a
given platform. They provide stats. PGXN doesn’t provide any stats, but some
of them are list stats like how many downloads we had, how many in the last
180 days.</p>
<p>And curation. Trunk is another binary extension registry, from my employer,
Tembo. They do categorization of all the extensions on Trunk, which is at 237
now. Quite a few people have come forward to tells us that they don’t
necessarily use Trunk to install extensions, but use them to find them,
because the categories are really helpful for people to figure out what sorts
of things are even available, and an option to use.</p>
<p>So here’s the State of the Ecosystem as I see it today.</p>
 
 
<p>There have been some lost opportunities from the initial excitement around
2010. Extensions remain difficult to find and discover. Some are on PGXN,
some are on GitHub, some are on Trunk, some are on GitLab, etc. There’s no
like one place to go to find them all.</p>
 
 
<p>They remain under-documented and difficult to understand. It takes effort
for developers to write documentation for their extensions, and a lot of
them aren’t able to. Some of them do write the documentation, but they
might be in a format that something like PGXN doesn’t understand.</p>
 
 
<p>The maturity of extensions can be difficult to gauge. If you look at that
<a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">list of 1200 extensions</a> on GitHub, which ones are the good ones?
Which ones do people care about? That page in particular show the number
of stars for each extension, but that the only metric.</p>
 
 
<p>They’re difficult to configure and install. This is something TLE really
tried to solve, but the uptake on TLE has not been great so far, and it
doesn’t support all the use cases. There are a lot of use cases that need
to be able to access the internal APIs of Postgres itself, which means
compiling stuff into shared libraries, and writing them in C or Rust or a
couple of other compiled languages.</p>
<p>That makes them difficult to configure. You have ask questions lik: Which
build system do I use? Do I install the tooling? How do I install it and
configure it? What dependencies does it have? Et cetera.</p>
 
 
<p>There’s no comprehensive binary packaging. The Postgres community’s own
packaging systems for Linux — Apt, and YUM — do a remarkably good job
of packaging extensions. They probably have more extensions packaged for
those platforms than any of the others. If they have the extension you
need and you’re using the PGDG repositories, then this stuff is there. But
even those are still like a fraction of all the potential available
extensions that are out there.</p>
 
 
<p>Dependency management can be pretty painful. It’s difficult to know what
you need to install. I was messing around  yesterday with the PgSQL HTTP
extension, which is a great extension that depends on libcurl. I thought
maybe I could build a package that includes libcurl as part of it. But
then I realized that libcurl depends on other packages, other dynamic
libraries. So I’d have to figure out what all those are to get them all
together.</p>
<p>A lot of that goes away if you use a system like apt or yum. But if you,
if you don’t, or you just want to install stuff on your Mac or Windows,
it’s much more difficult.</p>
 
 
<p>Centralized source distribution, we’ve found found, is insufficient. Even
if all the extensions were available on PGXN, not everybody has the
wherewithal or the expertise to find what they need, download it, compile
it, and build it. Moreover, you don’t want to have a compiler on your
production system, so you don’t want to be building stuff from source on
your production system. So then you have to get to the business of
building your own packages, which is a whole thing.</p>
 
 
<p>But in this state of the extension ecosystem we see new opportunities too. One
I’ve been working on for the past year, which we call “PGXN v2”, is made
possible by my employer, Tembo. The idea was to consider the emerging patterns
— new registries and new ways of building and releasing and developing
extensions — and to figure out the deficiencies, and to engage deeply with
the community to work up potential solutions, and to design and implement a
new architecture. The idea is to serve the community for the next decade
really make a PGXN and its infrastructure the source of record for extensions
for Postgres.</p>
<p>In the past year, I did a bunch of design work on it. Here’s a high level
architectural view. We’d have a root registry, which is still the source code
distribution stuff. There’s a web UX over it that would evolve from the
current website. And there’s a command line client that knows how to build
extensions from the registry.</p>
<p>But in addition to those three parts, which we have today, we would evolve a
couple of additional parts.</p>
 
 
<p>One is “interactions”, so that when somebody releases a new extension on
PGXN, some notifications could go out through webhooks or some sort of
queue so that downstream systems like the packaging systems could know
something new has come out and maybe automate building and updating their
packages.</p>
 
 
<p>There could be “stats and reports”, so we can provide data like how many
downloads there are, what binary registries make them available, what
kinds of reviews and quality metrics rate them. We can develop these stats
and display those on the website.</p>
 
 
<p>And, ideally, a “packaging registry” for PGXN to provide binary packages
for all the major platforms of all the extensions we can, to simplify the
installation of extensions for anybody who needs to use them. For
extensions that aren’t available through PGDG or if you’re not using that
system and you want to install extensions. Late last year, I was focused
on figuring out how t build the packaging system.</p>
 
 
<p>Another change that went down in the past year was the Extension Ecosystem
Summit itself. This took place at PGConf.Dev last May. The idea was for a
community of people to come together to collaborate, examine ongoing work in
the extension distribution, examine challenges, identify questions, propose
solutions, and agree on directions for execution. Let’s take a look at the
topics that we covered last year at the summit.</p>
 
 
<p>One was extension metadata, where the topics covered included packaging
and discoverability, extension development, compatibility and taxonomies
as being important to represent a metadata about extensions — as well as
versioning standards. One of the outcomes was <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/3" title="RFC: Meta Spec v2">an RFC</a> for
version two of the PGXN metadata that incorporates a lot of those needs
into a new metadata format to describe extensions more broadly.</p>
 
 
<p>Another topic was the binary distribution format and what it should look
like, if we were to have major, distribution format. We talked about being
able to support multiple versions of an extension at one time. There was
some talk about the Python Wheel format as a potential precedent for
binary distribution of code.</p>
<p>There’s also an idea to distribute extensions through Docker containers,
also known as the <a href="https://opencontainers.org">Open Container Initiative</a>. Versioning came up
here, as well. One of the outcomes from this session was another PGXN <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/2" title="RFC: Binary Distribution Format">RFC
for binary distribution</a>, which was inspired by Python Wheel among other
stuff.</p>
<p>I wanted to give <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-oci-poc/#demo" title="POC: Distributing Trunk Binaries via OCI (Demo)">a brief demo</a> build on that format. I hacked
some changes into the PGXS <code>Makefile</code> to add a new target, <code>trunk</code> that
builds a binary package called a “trunk” and uploads it to an OCI registry
for distribution. <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-oci-poc/#demo" title="POC: Distributing Trunk Binaries via OCI (Demo)">Here’s what it looks like</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>On my Mac I was compiling my semver extension. Then I go into a Linux
container and compile it again for Linux using the <code>make trunk</code>
command. The result is two <code>.trunk</code> files, one for Postgres 16 on
Darwin and one for Postgres 16 on Linux.</p>
 
 
<p>There are also some JSON files that are annotations specifically for
OCI. We have a command where we can push these images to an OCI
registry.</p>
 
 
<p>Then we can then use an install command that knows to download and
install the version of the build appropriate for this platform
(macOS). And then I go into Linux and do the same thing. It also
knows, because of the OCI standard, what the platform is, and so it
installs the appropriate binary.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Another topic was ABI and API compatibility. There was some talk at the
Summit about what is the definition of an ABI and an API and how do we
define internal APIs and their use? Maybe there’s some way to categorize
APIs in Postgres core for red, green, or in-between, something like that.
There was desire to have more hooks available into different parts of the
system.</p>
<p>One of the outcomes of this session was that I worked with Peter
Eisentraut on some stability guidance for the API and ABI that is now
committed in the docs. You can <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-API-ABI-STABILITY-GUIDANCE" title="Postgres Docs: Server API and ABI Stability Guidance">read them now</a> on in the developer docs,
they’ll be part of the Postgres 18 release. The idea is that minor version
releases should be safe to use with other minor versions. If you compiled
your extension against one minor version, it should be perfectly
compatible with other minor versions of the same major release.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there was a release earlier this year, like two weeks after
Peter committed this, where there was an API break. It’s the first time in
like 10 years. Robert Treat and I spent quite a bit of time trying to look
for a previous time that happened. I think there was one about 10 years
ago, but then this one happened and, notably it broke the Timescale
database. The Core Team decided to release a fix just a week later to
restore the ABI compatibility.</p>
<p>So it’s clear that even though there’s guidance, you should in general
be able to rely on it, and it was a motivating factor for the a new
release to fix an ABI break, there are no guarantees.</p>
<p>Another thing that might happen is that I <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2025#ABI_Compliance_Checker" title="PostgreSQL Wiki/GSoC 2025: ABI Compliance Checker">proposed a Google Summer of
Code project to build an ABI checker service</a>. Peter
[embarrassing forgetfulness and misattributed national identity omitted]
Geoghegan <a href="https://postgr.es/m/CAH2-Wzm-W6hSn71sUkz0Rem=qDEU7TnFmc7_jG2DjrLFef_WKQ@mail.gmail.com">POC’d an ABI checker</a> in 2023. The project is to take Peter’s
POC and build something that could potentially run on every commit or push
to the back branches of the project. Maybe it could be integrated into the
build farm so that, if there’s a back-patch to an earlier branch and it
turns red, they quickly the ABI was broken. This change could potentially
provide a higher level of guarantee — even if they don’t end up using
the word “guarantee” about the stability of the ABIs and APIs. I’m hoping
this happens; a number of people have asked about it, and at least one
person has written an application.</p>
 
 
<p>Another topic at the summit last year was including or excluding
extensions in core. They’ve talked about when to add something to core,
when to remove something from core,  whether items in contrib should
actually be moved into core itself, and whether to move metadata about
extensions into catalog. And once again, support for multiple versions
came up; this is a perennial challenge! But I’m not aware of much work on
these questions. I’m wondering if it’s time for a revisit,</p>
 
 
<p>As a bonus item — this wasn’t a formal topic at the summit last year,
but it came up many times in the mini-summits — is the challenge of
packaging and lookup. There’s only one path to extensions in <code>SHAREDIR</code>.
This creates a number of difficulties. Christoph Berg has a patch for a
PGDG and Debian that adds a second directory. This allowed the PGDG stuff
to actually run tests against extensions without changing the core
installation of the Postgres service itself. Another one is <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="Run PostgreSQL. The Kubernetes way.">Cloud Native
Postgres</a> immutability. If that directory is part of the image, for
your CloudNative Postgres, you can’t install extensions into it.</p>
<p>It’s a similar issue, for <a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a> immutability. Postgres.app is a
Mac app, and it’s signed by a  certificate provided by Apple. But that
means that if you install an extension in its <code>SHAREDIR</code>, it changes the
signature of the application and it won’t start. They work around this
issue through a number of symlink shenanigans, but these issues could be
solved by allowing extension to be installed in multiple locations.</p>
<p>Starting with Christoph’s search path patch and a number of discussions we
had at PGConf last year, <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter Eisentraut</a> has been working on a search
path patch to the core that would work similar to shared preload
libraries, but it’s for finding extension control files. This would allow
you to have them in multiple directories and it will find them in path.</p>
<p>Another interesting development in this line has been, the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="Run PostgreSQL. The Kubernetes way.">CloudNativePG</a> project has been using that extension search path
patch to prototype a new feature coming to Kubernetes that allows one to
mount a volume that’s actually another Docker image. If you have your
extension distributed as an OCI image, you can specify that it be mounted
and installed via your CNPG cluster configuration. That means when CNPG
spins up, it puts the extension in the right place. It updates the search
path variables and stuff just works.</p>
<p>A lot of the thought about the stuff went into a <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/11/rfc-extension-packaging-lookup/" title="RFC: Extension Packaging &amp; Lookup">less formal RFC</a> I wrote
up in my blog, rather than on PGXN. The idea is to take these improvements
and try to more formally specify the organization of extensions separate
from how Postgres organizes shared libraries and shared files.</p>
 
 
<p>I said, we’re bringing the Extension Summit back! There will be another
Extension Summit hosted our team of organizers, myself, Floor, Keith Fiske
from Crunchy Data, and Yurii from Omnigres. That will be on May 13th in the
morning at <a href="https://2025.pgconf.dev" title="PostgreSQL Development Conference 2025">PGConf.dev</a>; we appreciate their support.</p>
<p>The idea of these Mini Summits is to bring up a number of topics of interest.
Have somebody come and do a 20 or 40 minute talk about it, and then we can
have discussion about implications.</p>
<p>Floor mentioned the schedule, but briefly:</p>
 
 March 12: <a href="https://justatheory.com/">David Wheeler</a>, PGXN: “State of the Extension Ecosystem” 
 March 24: <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter Eisentraut</a>, Core Team: “Implementing an Extension Search Path” 
 April 9: <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/author/christoph_berg/">Christoph Berg</a>, Debian: “Apt Extension Packaging” 
 April 23: 
 May 7: <a href="https://www.gabrielebartolini.it">Gabriele Bartolini</a>, CNPG “Extension Management in CloudNativePG” 
 
<p>So, what are your interests in extensions and how they can be improved. There
are a lot of potential topics to talk about at the Summit or at these Mini
Summits: development tools, canonical registry, how easy it is to publish,
continuous delivery, yada, yada, yada, security scanning — all sorts of
stuff that could go into conceiving, designing, developing, distributing
extensions for Postgres.</p>
<p>I hoe you all will participate. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to
me for half an hour. So I’d like to turn it over to, discussion, if people
would like to join in, talk about implications of stuff. Also, we can get to
any questions here.</p>
 Questions, comments, shout-outs 
<p>Floor: David, at one point you talked about, metadata taxonomy. If you can
elaborate on that a little bit, that’s Peter’s question.</p>
<p>David: So one that people told me that they found useful was one provided by
<a href="https://pgt.dev">Trunk</a>. So it has these limited number of categories, so if you’re interested
in machine learning stuff, you could go to the <a href="https://pgt.dev/?cat=machine_learning" title="Trunk Categories: Machine Learning">machine learning</a> stuff and it
shows you what extensions are potentially available. They have 237 extensions
on Trunk now.</p>
<p>PGXN itself allows arbitrary tagging of stuff. It builds <a href="https://pgxn.org/tags" title="PGXN: Release Tags">this little tag
cloud</a>. But if I look at this one here, you can see <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/uint128/1.0.1/" title="PGXN: uint128 v1.0.1">this one</a> has a bunch of
tags. These are arbitrary tags that are applied by the author. The current
metadata looks <a href="https://api.pgxn.org/src/uint128/uint128-1.0.1/META.json" title="PGXN: uint128 v1.0.1 META.json">like this</a>. It’s just plain JSON, and it has a list of tags.
The <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/3" title="RFC: Meta Spec v2">PGXN Meta v2 RFC</a> has a bunch of examples. It’s an evolution of
that <code>META.json</code>, so the idea is to have a classifications that includes tags
as before, but also adds categories, which are a limited list that would be
controlled by the core [he means “root”] registry:</p>
  <code>{
  "classifications": {
    "tags": [
      "testing",
      "pair",
      "parameter"
    ],
    "categories": [
      "Machine Learning"
    ]
  }
}
</code>   Announcements 
<p>Yurii made a number of announcements, summarizing:</p>
 
 
<p>There is a new library that they’ve been developing at Omnigres that
allows you to develop Postgres extensions in C++. For people who are
interested in developing extensions in C++ and gaining the benefits of
that and not having to do all the tedious things that we have to do with C
extensions: look for <a href="https://cppgres.org">Cppgres</a>. Yurii thinks that within a couple of
months it will reach parity with pgrx.</p>
<p>David: So it sounds like it would work more closely to the way PGXS and
C works. Whereas pgrx has all these additional Rust crates you have to
load and like slow compile times and all these dependencies.</p>
<p>Yurii: This is just like a layer over the C stuff, an evolution of that.
It’s essentially a header only library, so it’s a very common thing in the
C++ world. So you don’t have to build anything and you just include a
file. And in fact the way I use it, I amalgamate all the header files that
we have into one. Whenever I include it in the project, I just copy the
amalgamation and it’s just one file. You don’t have any other build chain
associated yet. It is C++ 20, which some people consider new, but by the
time it’s mature it’s already five years old and most compilers support
it. They have decent support of C++ 20 with a few exclusions, but those
are relatively minor. So for that reason, it’s not C++ 23, for example,
because it’s not very well supported across compilers, but C++ 20 is.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii is giving a talk about <a href="https://github.com/postgres-pm/pgpm">PostgresPM</a> at the Postgres Conference in
Orlando. He’ll share the slides and recording with this group. The idea
behind PostgresPM is that it takes a lot of heuristics, takes the URLs of
packages and of extensions and creates packages for different outputs like
for Red Hat, for Debian, perhaps for some other formats in the future. It
focuses on the idea that a lot of things can be figured out.</p>
<p>For example: do we have a new version? Well, we can look at list of tags
in the Git repo. Very commonly that works for say 80 percent of
extensions. Do we need a C compiler? We can see whether we have C files.
We can figure out a lot of stuff without packagers having to specify that
manually every time they have a new extension. And they don’t have to
repackage every time there is a new release, because we can detect new
releases and try to build.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii is also running an event that, while not affiliated with PGConf.dev,
is strategically scheduled to happen one day before PGConf.dev: <a href="https://pgext.day">Postgres
Extensions Day</a>. The Call for Speakers is open until April 1st. There’s
also an option for people who cannot or would not come to Montreal this
year to submit a prerecorded talk. The point of the event is not just to
bring people together, but also ti surface content that can be interesting
to other people. The event itself is free.</p>
 
 
<p>Make sure to join our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/" title="Postgres Extension Ecosystem Mini-Summit on Meetup">Meetup group</a> and join us live, March 26,

<p>デジタル学生証明による学割サービスの話は、かなり前から検討されている話題です。わたしの周りでも、遅くとも2012年には Student Identity Trust Framework として国立情報学研究所（NII）との間で検討がなされてきました。</p>

<p>今回発表されたものは、これらの線上に乗りながら、実装技術としてマイナンバーカードやデジタル認証アプリ、Microsoft Authenticator とVCを取り入れたものになっています。ある意味、紙やカードのアナロジーに載せることで一般の経験則的に「分かりやすく」なったところもあるかもしれません。以下はその概要です。</p>



 概要 



<p>JR西日本とデジタル庁は、大学生の在学証明確認にマイナンバーカードを活用する実証実験を大阪駅で実施しました。本実験は、学生がオンラインでデジタル在学証明書を取得し、デジタル乗車券購入時の本人確認にマイナンバーカードを用いることで、従来の紙の在学証明書提示による窓口手続きを不要とし、利便性向上と業務効率化を目指すものです。国立情報学研究所（NII）が提供するサービスとJR西日本のデジタルプラットフォーム「WESTER」の連携も視野に入れ、将来的には他の公共機関やサービスへの応用も目指しています。</p>



<p>発表されたのは主に以下のような項目です。</p>



 1. マイナンバーカードを活用した在学証明のデジタル化 



 
 従来、学生が学割乗車券を購入する際には、紙の在学証明書を駅の窓口で提示する必要がありました。 



 本実証実験では、学生がオンラインでデジタル在学証明書を取得し、マイナンバーカードを本人確認に利用することで、この手続きをオンラインで完結させます。 



 日経新聞の記事では、実証実験の様子として「マイナカードで在学証明を確認して購入したウェブ乗車券」の写真が掲載されています。 



 JR西日本のプレスリリースによると、学生はまず「デジタル認証アプリ」と「Microsoft Authenticator」をスマートフォンにダウンロードし、大学のウェブシステムで在学証明情報を取得、それをMicrosoft Authenticatorと連携させる流れとなります。 
 



<p>細かい流れは以下の図表１通りです。</p>



<p>図表１：JR西日本プレスリリースによる流れ</p>



 
 「デジタル認証アプリ」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6825/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6825" title="マイナンバーカードを使った本人確認を、安全・簡単にするためのアプリ。デジタル庁提供。OpenID Connectを使っている。">1</a>「Microsoft Authenticator」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6825/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-6825" title="マイクロソフト社が提供するパスワードを使用せずにすべてのアカウントにサインインするのに役立つ無料アプリ。ワンタイムパスワードの発行によく使われる。Verifiable Credential も格納可能">2</a>をスマートフォンにダウンロード 



 大学のウェブシステムに学生がログインし国立情報学研究所(NII)が提供する在学証明情報を取得 



 取得した在学証明情報を Microsoft Authenticator と連携し、情報を学生が保有するスマートフォンに格納 



 JR 西日本がサービス提供する電子チケット販売プラットフォーム「<a href="https://www.wow-tomo-ticket.jp/">まちのヲトモパスポート</a>」に「デジタル認証アプリ」でログイン 



 「デジタル認証アプリ」が立ち上がり学生本人のマイナンバーカードを読み取り認証を実施し、MAB<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6825/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-6825" title="Mobility Auth Bridge。利用者が同意すれば、1つのIDでMABに参画する自治体や企業のさまざまなサービスをご利用いただけるセキュアなIDサービスです。地域のインフラを支えるJR西日本が、NTTコミュニケーションズ株式会社（本社：東京都千代田区、代表取締役社長：小島克重）及伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ株式会社（本社：東京都港区、代表取締役社長：新宮達史）の支援を受け、国内鉄道事業者として初めて、デジタル社会に必要なインフラ基盤をアズ・ア・サービス化したものです。ユーザーファーストの思想を念頭に利用者が一つのIDで、どこでも、さまざまな利用サービスを選択することによって、移動・暮らしがより便利でおトクになります。また、導入する自治体や企業は、MABの利用によりデジタルサービスの個客データ収集・利活用ができることから、データインフォームドによる新たな価値の創出による地域への貢献が可能となります。">3</a> に登録した情報と本人情報が同一であることを確認

<p>と、言っても関係性がよくわかりませんね。なので、想像力バリバリで簡略版のシーケンス図（図表２）を書いてみました。</p>

<p>個人的に注意を引いた点としては、以下があります。</p>



 
 いわゆる認証連携ベース（SAMLやOpenID Connect）でやるのに比べて、図表１では手順3, 6 が増えている。その代わり、大学は学生がどこで学割を使ったかがわからないようになっている。（逆に言えば、大学にわかっても良ければこのステップは省略できる。） 



 このプレスリリースからは発行された在学証明情報がどのように失効させられるかがわからない。（やりかたによっては、大学に証明書利用がわかってしまうようになるので要注意。おそらく、VC Status List あたりを使うのであろう。） 



 いわゆる、属性ベースの名寄せを利用している。このためにマイナンバーカードとデジタル認証アプリを使っている。（そもそも、大学発行の証明書を信じることにすれば、マイナンバーカードからの基本４情報は不必要なはず。お一人様一回限りをやるなら、デジタル認証アプリの発行する利用し識別子の値（<code>sub</code>値）だけで十分なはず。複数の学校に所属しているようなケースを例外として忘れることにすれば、それすらも要らないはず。） 
 



 2. オンラインでの学割乗車券購入と顔認証による改札通過 



 
 実証実験では、大阪大学の学生が購入したデジタル乗車券を使用し、顔認証で改札口を通過しました。 



 阪大大学院の武内祐哉さんは「すべてオンラインで完結してスムーズに改札に入れた」と、その利便性を語っています（<a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF238T00T20C25A3000000/">日経新聞</a>）。 
 



<p>※ 顔認証に使う顔画像をどのステップで取得したのかがよくわからないので、そこは聞いてみたいところです。</p>



 3. 関係機関の連携 



 
 本実証実験は、デジタル庁の公募事業としてJR西日本が採択され、国立情報学研究所（NII）が提供するデジタル在学証明書発行サービスを利用して行われました。 



 デジタル庁の岸信千世大臣政務官は「将来的には複数の大学や公共機関での応用をめざしたい」と述べており、連携の重要性が示唆されています（<a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF238T00T20C25A3000000/">日経新聞</a>）。 
 



 4. JR西日本の狙いと今後の展望 



 
 JR西日本は、窓口業務の効率化に加え、「学生など若い人との接点を増やしてサービスを深化させたい」（JR西日本デジタルソリューション本部長 奥田英雄氏、<a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF238T00T20C25A3000000/">日経新聞</a>）と考えています。 



 2026年初頭にも大阪大学との間で、マイナンバーカードを用いた在学証明の本格的な開始を目指しています。 



 将来的には、JR西日本グループ共通ID「WESTER」との連携によるサービス拡大も検討されています。 



 <a href="https://k-tai.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1672015.html">ケータイ Watch</a>の記事では、本実証実験が「現在も多くの在学証明書が紙で発行されている状況を踏まえ、その代表的な事例として選ばれたもの」と説明されており、全国の大学への普及や他の資格情報への応用も視野に入れていることがわかります。 



 <a href="https://www.westjr.co.jp/press/article/items/250324_00_press_Mynumbercard_gakuseikatuyou.pdf">JR西日本プレスリリース</a>では、2025年度に大阪大学と連携し、学生にとって分かりやすく使いやすいスキームへの改良を進める方針が示されています。 



 長期的には、交通機関だけでなく、レンタカー、バス、航空券、美術館など幅広い分野での活用も見据えています（<a href="https://k-tai.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1672015.html">ケータイ Watch</a>）。 
 



 5. 技術基盤「Mobility Auth Bridge (MAB)」の活用 



 
 JR西日本のプレスリリースによると、本実証実験では、KANSAI MaaSでも導入されている「Mobility Auth Bridge（MAB）」というID基盤が活用されています。 



 MABは、利用者の同意があれば、一つのIDで様々なサービスを利用できるセキュアなIDサービスであり、デジタル社会に必要なインフラ基盤としてJR西日本がNTTコミュニケーションズ、伊藤忠テクノソリューションズの支援を受けて開発したものです。 



 MABの活用により、デジタルサービスの個客データ収集・利活用が可能となり、地域への貢献も期待されています。 
 



 6. SDGsへの貢献 



 
 JR西日本のプレスリリースでは、今回の取り組みがSDGsの目標のうち、特に「3. すべての人に健康と福祉を」「9. 産業と技術革新の基盤をつくろう」「11. 住み続けられるまちづくりを」「17. パートナーシップで目標を達成しよう」に貢献するとの考えが示されています。

My advice at this stage is to sign out of important apps (like your work email and encrypted messaging apps like Signal), turn off biometric logins like Face ID, and switch your phone off. That does mean you need to print out your boarding card, for example, and do a little pre-work to make sure your data is backed up. Clearly, this is a pain. But if you deal with any sensitive information, or have any vulnerable people in your family or community, you need to change your security stance to be a good steward of their safety.</p>

<p>Before we start: if you’ve already filled out the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/whatisyourtechstack">What is your tech stack? survey</a>: thank you! If you’ve not done so, your help will be greatly appreciated. It takes 5-15 minutes to complete. Those filling out will receive results before anyone else, and additional analysis from myself and Elin. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/whatisyourtechstack">Fill out this survey here.</a> </p><p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/whatisyourtechstack">Fill out the survey</a></p><p>Growth engineering was barely known a decade ago, but today, most scaleups and many publicly traded tech companies have dedicated growth teams staffed by growth engineers. However, some software engineers are still suspicious of this new area because of its reputation for hacky code with little to no code coverage.</p><p>For this reason and others, I thought it would be interesting to learn more from an expert who can tell us all about the practicalities of this controversial domain. So I turned to <a href="https://alexeymk.com/">Alexey Komissarouk</a>, who’s been in growth engineering since 2016, and was in charge of it at online education platform, MasterClass. These days, Alexey lives in Tokyo, Japan, where he <a href="http://alexeymk.com/growth-eng">advises on growth engineering</a> and teaches the <a href="https://www.reforge.com/courses/growth-engineering/details">Growth Engineering course</a> at <a href="https://www.reforge.com/courses/growth-engineering/details">Reforge</a>.</p><p>In today’s deep dive, Alexey covers:</p>  <p>What is Growth Engineering? In the simplest terms: writing code to help a company make more money. But there are details to consider: like the company size where it makes sense to have a dedicated team do this.</p>  <p>What do Growth Engineers work on? Business-facing work, empowerment and platform work are the main areas.</p>  <p>Why Growth Engineers move faster than Product Engineers. Product Engineers ship to build: Growth Engineers ship to learn. Growth Engineers do take shortcuts that would make no sense when building for longevity – doing this on purpose.</p>  <p>Tech stack. Common programming languages, monitoring and oncall, feature flags and experimentation, product analytics, review apps, and more.</p>  <p>What makes a good Growth Engineer? Curiosity, “build to learn” mindset and a “Jack of all trades” approach.</p>  <p>Where do Growth Engineers fit in? Usually part of the engineering department, either operating as with an “owner” or a “hitchiker” model.</p>  <p>Becoming a Growth Engineer. A great area if you want to eventually become a founder or product manager – but even if not, it can accelerate your career growth. Working in Growth forces you to learn more about the business.</p>  <p>With that, it’s over to Alexey:</p>   <p>I’ll never forget the first time I made my employer a million dollars.</p><p>I was running a push notification A/B test for meal delivery startup <a href="https://www.failory.com/cemetery/sprig">Sprig</a>, trying to boost repeat orders.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F314ab3cd-231c-4b85-9ac0-7ba617228fa3_918x752.png">          </a>A push notification similar to what we tested to boost repeat orders <p>Initial results were unpromising; the push notification was not receiving many opens. Still, I wanted to be thorough: before concluding the idea was a failure, I wrote a SQL query to compare order volume for subsequent weeks between customers in test vs control.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc244a94-c909-4695-937e-e951a765fe80_1488x650.png">          </a>The SQL used to figure out the push notification’s efficiency <p>As it turned out, our test group “beat” the control group by around 10%:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cb5cc04-40f8-49c2-9e7c-72d827a73f3b_1290x456.png">          </a>‘review_5_push’ was the new type of push notification. Roughly the same amount of users clicked it, but they placed 10% more in orders <p>I plugged the numbers into a <a href="https://abtestguide.com/calc/">significance calculator</a>, which showed it was statistically significant – or “stat-sig” – and therefore highly unlikely to be a coincidence. This meant we had a winner on our hands! But how meaningful was it, really, and what would adding the push notification mean for revenue, if rolled out to 100% of users?</p><p>It turned out this experiment created an additional $1.5 million dollars, annually, with just one push notification. Wow!</p><p>I was hooked. Since that day, I've shipped hundreds of experimental “winners” which generated hundreds of millions of incremental revenue for my employers. But you never forget the first one. Moments like this is what growth engineering is all about.</p> 1. What is Growth Engineering? <p>Essentially, growth engineering is the writing of code to make a company money. Of course, all code produced by a business on some level serves this purpose, but while Product Engineers focus on creating a Product worth paying for, Growth Engineers instead focus on making that good product have a good business. To this end, they focus on optimizing and refining key parts of the customer journey, such as:</p>  <p>Getting more people to consider the product</p>  <p>Converting them into paying customers</p>  <p>Keeping them as customers for longer, and spending more</p>  <p>What kinds of companies employ Growth Engineers? Places you’ve heard of, like Meta, LinkedIn, DoorDash, Coinbase, and Dropbox, are some of the ones I’ve had students from. There’s also OpenAI, Uber, Tiktok, Tinder, Airbnb, Pinterest… the list of high-profile companies goes on. Most newer public consumer companies you’ve heard have a growth engineering org, too.</p><p>Typically, growth engineering orgs are started by companies at Series B stage and beyond, so long as they are selling to either consumers or businesses via SaaS. These are often places trying to grow extremely fast, and have enough software engineers that some can focus purely on growth. Before the Series B stage, a team is unlikely to be ready for growth for various reasons; likely that it hasn’t found product-market fit, or has no available headcount, or lacks the visitor traffic required to run A/B tests.</p><p>Cost is a consideration. A fully-loaded growth team consisting of a handful of engineers, a PM, and a designer costs approximately 1 million dollars annually. To justify this, a rule of thumb is to have at least $5 million dollars in recurring revenue – a milestone often achieved at around the Series B stage.</p><p>Despite the presence of growth engineering at many public consumer tech companies, the field itself is still quite new, as a discipline and as a proper title.</p> Brief history of growth engineering <p>When I joined Opendoor in 2016, there was a head of growth but no dedicated growth engineers, but there were by the time I left in 2020. At MasterClass soon after, there was a growth org and a dozen dedicated growth engineers. So when did growth engineering originate?</p><p>The story is that its origins lie at Facebook in 2007. The team was created by then-VP of platform and monetization <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chamath/">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>. Reforce founder and CEO Brian Balfour <a href="https://brianbalfour.com/growth-machine/why-growth">shares</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Growth (the kind found on an org chart) began at Facebook under the direction of Chamath Palihapitiya. In 2007, he joined the early team in a nebulous role that fell somewhere between Product, Marketing, and Operations. According to his retelling of the story on Recode Decode, after struggling to accomplish anything meaningful in his first year on the job, he was on the verge of being fired.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg joined soon after him, and in a hail mary move he pitched her the game-changing idea that led to the creation of the first-ever growth team. This idea not only saved his job, but earned him the lion’s share of the credit for Facebook’s unprecedented growth.</p><p>At the time, Sheryl and Mark asked him, “What do you call this thing where you help change the product, do some SEO and SEM, and algorithmically do this or that?”</p><p>His response: “I don’t know, I just call that, like, Growth, you know, we’re going to try to grow. I’ll be the head of growing stuff."</p><p>And just like that, Growth became a thing.”</p></blockquote><p>Rather than focus on a particular product or feature, the growth team at Facebook focused on moving the needle, and figuring out which features to work on. These days, Meta employs hundreds if not thousands of growth engineers.</p> 2. What do Growth Engineers work on? <p>Before we jump into concrete examples, let’s identify three primary focus areas that a growth engineer’s work usually involves.</p>  <p>Business-facing work – improving the business directly</p>  <p>Empowerment work – enabling other teams to improve the business</p>  <p>Platform work – improving the velocity of the above activities</p>  <p>Let’s go through all three:</p> Business-facing work <p>This is the bread and butter of growth engineering, and follows a common pattern:</p>  <p>Implement an idea. Try something big or small to try and move a key business metric, which differs by team but is typically related to conversion rate or retention.</p>  <p>Quantify impact. Usually via A/B testing.</p>  <p>Analyze impact. Await results, analyze impact, ship or roll back – then go back to the first step.</p>  <p>Experiments can lead to sweeping or barely noticeable changes. A famous “I can’t believe they needed to test this” was when Google figured out <a href="https://archive.is/DiWOt">which shade of blue</a> generates the most clicks. At MasterClass, we tested things across the spectrum:</p>  <p>Small: should we show the price right on the homepage, was that a winner? Yes, but we framed it in monthly terms of $15/month, not $180/year.</p>  <p>Medium: when browsing a course page, should we include related courses, or more details about the course itself? Was it a winner? After lengthy experimentation, it was hard to tell: both are valuable and we needed to strike the right balance.</p>  <p>Large: when a potential customer is interested, do we take them straight to checkout, or encourage them to learn more? Counterintuitively, adding steps boosted conversion!</p>   Empowerment <p>One of the best ways an engineer can move a target metric is by removing themselves as a bottleneck, so colleagues from marketing can iterate and optimize freely. To this end, growth engineers can either build internal tools or integrate self-serve MarTech (Marketing Technology) vendors.</p><p>With the right tool, there’s a lot that marketers can do without engineering’s involvement:</p>  <p>Build and iterate on landing pages (Unbounce, Instapage, etc)</p>  <p>Draft and send email, SMS and Push Notifications (Iterable, Braze, Customer.io, etc)</p>  <p>Connect new advertising partners (Google Tag Manager, Segment, etc)</p>  <p>We go more into detail about benefits and applications in the MarTech section of Tech Stack, below.</p> Platform work <p>As a business scales, dedicated platform teams help improve stability and velocity for the teams they support. Within growth, this often includes initiatives like:</p>  <p>Experiment Platform. Many parts of running an experiment can be standardized, from filtering the audience, to bucketing users properly, to observing statistical methodology. Historically, companies <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-JP/blog/xp/">built reusable Experiment Platforms in-house</a>, but more recently, vendors such as <a href="https://www.geteppo.com">Eppo</a> and <a href="https://www.statsig.com/">Statsig</a> have grown in popularity with fancy statistical methodologies like “Controlled Using Pre-Experiment Data” (<a href="https://martech.zone/acronym/cuped/?noamp=mobile">CUPED</a>) that give more signal with less data.</p>  <p>Reusable components. Companies with standard front-end components for things like headlines, buttons, and images, dramatically reduce the time required to spin up a new page. No more "did you want 5 or 6 pixels here" with a designer; instead growth engineers rely on tools like <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> to standardize and share reusable React components.</p>  <p>Monitoring. Growth engineering benefits greatly from leveraging monitoring to compensate for reduced code coverage. High-quality business metric monitoring tools can detect bugs before they cause damage.</p>  <p>When I worked at MasterClass, having monitoring at the ad layer prevented at least one six-figure incident. One Friday, a marketer accidentally broadened the audience for a particular ad from US-only, to worldwide. In response, the Facebook Ad algorithm went on a spending spree, bringing in plenty of visitors from places like Brazil and India, whom we knew from past experience were unlikely to purchase the product. Fortunately, our monitoring noticed the low-performing campaign within minutes, and an alert was sent to the growth engineer on-call, who immediately reached out to the marketer and confirmed the change was unintentional, and then shut down the campaign.</p><p>Without this monitoring, a subtle targeting error like this could have gone unnoticed all weekend and would have eaten up $100,000+ of marketing budget. This episode shows that platform investment can benefit everyone; and since growth needs them most, it’s often the growth platform engineering team which implements them.</p><p>As the day-to-day work of a Growth Engineer shows, A/B tests are a critical tool to both measure success and learn. It’s a numbers game: the more A/B tests a team can run in a given quarter, the more of them will end up winners, making the team successful. It’s no wonder, then, that Growth Engineering will pull out all the stops to improve velocity.</p> 3. Why Growth Engineers move faster than Product Engineers <p>On the surface, growth engineering teams look like product engineering ones; writing code, shipping pull requests, monitoring on-call, etc. So how do they move so much faster? The big reason lies in philosophy and focus, not technology. To quote <a href="https://www.elenaverna.com/">Elena Verna</a>, head of growth at Dropbox:</p><blockquote><p>“Product Engineering teams ship to build; Growth Engineering teams ship to learn.”</p></blockquote> Real-world case: price changes at Masterclass <p>A few years ago at MasterClass, the growth team wanted to see if changing our pricing model to multiple tiers would improve revenue.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F977b1d38-4776-4a41-bab4-1f45cc13180f_1600x1190.png">          </a>Inspired in part by multiple pricing tiers for competitors such as Netflix (above), Disney Plus, and Hulu.  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27165d3f-aa18-4a34-a58c-7325910912fe_1600x1064.png">          </a>The “multiple pricing tier” proposal for MasterClass. <p>From a software engineering perspective, this was a highly complex project because:</p>  <p>Backend engineering work: the backend did not yet support multiple pricing options, requiring a decent amount of engineering, and rigorous testing to make sure existing customers weren’t affected.</p>  <p>Client app changes: on the device side, multiple platforms (iOS, iPad, Android, Roku, Apple TV, etc) would each need to be updated, including each relevant app store.</p>  <p>The software engineering team estimated that becoming a “multi-pricing-tier” company would take months across numerous engineering teams, and engineering leadership was unwilling to greenlight that significant investment.</p><p>We in growth engineering took this as a challenge. As usual, our goal was not just to add the new pricing model, but to learn how much money it might bring in. The approach we ended up proposing was a <a href="https://userpilot.com/blog/fake-door-testing/">Fake Door test,</a> which involves offering a not-yet-available option to customers to gauge interest level. This was risky, as taking a customer who’s ready to pay and telling them to join some kind of waiting list is a colossal waste, and risks making them feel like the target of a “bait and switch” trick.</p><p>We found a way. The key insight was that people are only offended about a “bait and switch”, if the “switch” is worse than the “bait.” Telling customers they would pay $100 and then switching to $150 would cause a riot, but starting at $150 and then saying “just kidding, it’s only $100” is a pleasant surprise.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05088b07-4ec3-4730-ad04-cc9f6908519c_740x700.png">          </a>The good kind of surprise. <p>So long as every test “pricing tier” is less appealing – higher prices, fewer features – than the current offering, we could “upgrade” customers after their initial selection. A customer choosing the cheapest tier gets extra features at no extra cost, while a customer choosing a more expensive tier is offered a discount.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b133445-e8da-40ee-8af9-d9995c2c817c_1252x1130.png">          </a>We created three new tiers, at different prices. The new “premium” tier would describe the existing, original offering. Regardless of what potential customers selected, they got this “original offering,” during the experiment. <p>The best thing about this was that no backend changes were required. There were no real, new, back-end pricing plans; everybody ended up purchasing the same version of MasterClass for the same price, with the same features. The entirety of the engineering work was on building a new pricing page, and the “congratulations, you’ve been upgraded” popup. This took just a few days.</p><p>Within a couple of weeks, we had enough data to be confident the financial upside of moving to a multi-pricing-tier model would be significant. With this, we’re able to convince the rest of engineering’s leadership to invest in building the feature properly. In the end, launching multiple pricing tiers turned out to be one of the biggest revenue wins of the year.</p> Building a skyscraper vs building a tent <p>The MasterClass example demonstrates the spirit of growth engineering; focusing on building to learn, instead of building to last. Consider building skyscrapers versus tents.</p><p>Building a tent optimizes for speed of set-up and tear-down over longevity. You don’t think of a tent as one that is shoddy or low-quality compared to skyscrapers: it’s not even the same category of buildings! Growth engineers maximize use of lightweight materials. To stick with the tents vs skyscraper metaphor: we prioritize lightweight fabric materials over steel and concrete whenever possible. We only resort to traditional building materials when there’s no other choice, or when a direction is confirmed as correct. Quality is important – after all, a tent must keep out rain and mosquitoes. However, the speed-vs-durability tradeoff decision results in very different approaches and outcomes.</p> 4. Tech stack <p>At first glance, growth and product engineers use the same tooling, and contribute to the same codebases. But growth engineering tends to be high-velocity, experiment-heavy, and with limited test coverage. This means that certain “nice to have” tools for product engineering are mission-critical for growth engineers.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/19/dutch_parliament_us_tech/">Brandon Vigliarolo at The Register</a>]</p><p>In the wake of <a href="https://creativerly.com/french-and-german-governments-join-forces-to-launch-open-source-notion-alternative-called-docs/">the French and German governments joining forces to build an alternative to Notion and Google Docs</a>, the Dutch government has passed eight motions to avoid US software and move to a home-grown stack.</p><blockquote><p>""With each IT service our government moves to American tech giants, we become dumber and weaker," Dutch MP Barbara Kathmann, author of four of the motions, told The Register. "If we continue outsourcing all of our digital infrastructure to billionaires that would rather escape Earth by building space rockets, there will be no Dutch expertise left."</p><p>Kathmann's measures specifically call on the government to stop the migration of Dutch information and communications technology to American cloud services, the creation of a Dutch national cloud, the repatriation of the .nl top-level domain to systems operating within the Netherlands, and for the preparation of risk analyses and exit strategies for all government systems hosted by US tech giants."</p></blockquote><p>Inevitably, these will be open source solutions that offer stronger privacy (with GDPR compliance from the beginning rather than as an afterthought) and fewer dependencies on third party centralized services. I see this as a very strongly good thing: everyone will see the benefit of such tools, and if you have values like "software shouldn't spy on you" and "you should have full control over your data", there will be more options for you to choose from.</p><p>The context is important:</p><blockquote><p>"The motions passed by the Dutch parliament come as the Trump administration ratchets up tensions with a number of US allies – the EU among them. Nearly 100 EU-based tech companies and lobbyists sent an open letter to the European Commission this week asking it to find a way to divest the bloc from systems managed by US companies due to "the stark geopolitical reality Europe is now facing.""</p></blockquote><p>It's sensible. I agree. This is what Europe should be doing.</p>

<p></p><p>I cleaned out my desk a little over five years ago. It feels like last week.</p><p>I was leading engineering at <a href="https://forusall.com">ForUsAll</a>, a fintech company that seeks to make it easier for small businesses to offer retirement plans for their employees. The co-founder, David, had been wearing a mask around the office for a month; he was following the growth of COVID-19 closely. The then-CEO agreed to close the office if the number of cases in San Francisco went beyond some small threshold; when it did, we picked up our laptops and left.</p><p>Of course, we all know what happened next: lockdowns, sourdough starters, and remote working on a scale never seen before.</p><p>I prefer remote working and always have. My first startup was mostly remote: my co-founder was in Edinburgh for a while, and spent some time in Vancouver, while I was in Oxford with occasional long stretches in California. I worked at my kitchen table, drank my own coffee, and set my own hours. It was flexible depending on what was going on at the time, and undoubtedly productive. When I joined a startup based in Austin but worked from Edinburgh and Berkeley, it felt like a natural progression.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, I couldn’t wait to return to that mode of working. I had another reason to feel like working from home was a silver lining: my mother’s health had been up and down following her double lung transplant, and now I could spend more time with her. What had been a regular Sunday visit became a much longer weekly stay. My dad was the primary carer, but I could help out. Many nights, I would help her up the short flight of stairs to her bedroom, help situate her in her bed, with brushing her teeth, and so on. Working from home gave me extra time with her, and I treasured that.</p><p>More recently, it allowed me to buy a house. There was no way I could buy in the San Francisco Bay Area. For literally half the price of a two-bedroom house in a troubled part of Oakland, I could get a house that would fit my family in Pennsylvania. We walk our child to and from daycare every day, have a garden and a driveway, and, although there’s no doubt that the house needs work, generally feel safe and secure.</p><p>I’m far from alone. Working from home has been a boon for carers, parents, and anyone who felt like they weren’t able to get on the property ladder in major business hubs like San Francisco and New York. It’s spread wealth from industries like tech to neighborhoods across the country, and in turn allowed tech companies to hire from anywhere, giving them access to talent that would previously have been out of reach. According to official figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-13/remote-work-productivity.htm">productivity rose</a>.</p><p>For remote work to be successful, communication, internal processes, and norms need to be explicit. Companies that had never spent much time thinking about culture now found that they were forced to, which was a positive outcome for their employees, many of whom had been suffering in silence. A renewed focus on employee power — in conjunction with the rise of social movements like Black Lives Matter — also led to a rise in unionization efforts, which also aimed to improve worker quality of life. Despite the overhead of the pandemic itself, these changes felt like they were part of a cohesive, positive movement.</p><p>So I read stories <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/03/18/san-francisco-in-office-work-era/">like this one in the San Francisco Standard</a> with something like a sense of dread:</p><blockquote><p>“Two years ago, I could not get anybody to go into the office a couple days a week,” said Jaimie Feliz, principal at San Francisco recruiting firm The Hire Standard. “Now, across the board, it’s pretty standard for companies to ask for a minimum of three days in office — it’s very rare to see any less than that.”</p></blockquote><p>Many tech companies are suspending hiring and promotions for workers outside of their hub cities, and there’s an assumption that, over time, employees who remain outside of those hubs will be laid off.</p><p>Given the negative impacts on carers, parents, people who have bought homes outside of those hub cities, and on the productivity of those companies, this feels like a regression.</p><p>This is doubly true when you look at the underlying statistics. One of the big reasons for calls back to the office&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itpro.com/business/business-strategy/business-execs-just-said-the-quiet-part-out-loud-on-rto-mandates-a-quarter-admit-forcing-staff-back-into-the-office-was-meant-to-make-them-quit-but-this-quiet-firing-practice-could-easily-backfire">is to perform backdoor layoffs</a>: management understands that a substantial percentage will quit.&nbsp;Research also suggests that <a href="https://www.workdesign.com/2024/10/reasons-behind-rto-mandates/">it’s about control</a>:</p><blockquote><p>RTO mandates may reflect a desire among certain leaders to reassert control and authority within the organization […] This perspective highlights the role of organizational power dynamics and the potential for RTO policies to serve as instruments for reinforcing traditional hierarchical structures, at odds with the trend towards greater autonomy and flexibility facilitated by remote work.</p></blockquote><p>The perceived gains aren’t evidence-based or in the best interests of company productivity; they’re more about CEO peace of mind. For companies that never stuck the landing on building intentional cultures, returning to the pre-pandemic status quo may feel reassuring.</p><p>Frustratingly, I now feel like these changes are inevitable.</p><p>Not everywhere, of course. There are some companies that have always been remote, and others have managed to establish strong hybrid cultures. But the majority will choose to simply snap back to the world as it was in 2019.</p><p>This is to their detriment: adding perspectives from across the country, and from people who would have been shut out of a traditional office job, was clearly valuable. A workforce made up only of people who can afford San Francisco’s $3,400 average rent is inherently less diverse — and less representative of the company’s customers — than one that is geographically diverse. Regardless, it is happening.</p><p>For companies that choose to stay remote, there are benefits to be made. There will be an ever-increasing workforce of potential employees who don’t want to move back to those hubs, with experience at tech companies like Google and Meta, who will be looking for new positions. That’s a competitive advantage.</p><p>On the other hand, for people who want to stay with their current employers, there are hard choices ahead. Do you move away from your comfortable house, or find ways to offload some of your caring or parental duties, in order to stay on the payroll? Depending on your salary, stock options, or tenure, there might be reasons for doing so.</p><p>But it’s not a choice I would make. I have a toddler these days, and I want to be more present, not less. I get a lot of value from in-person collaboration, but I prefer a hybrid model: I’ll gladly travel into the office for a few intense days to advance some specific goals and then go home. I’ve got little interest in doing so to make management feel at ease, but there really are some kinds of time-limited collaboration that are better in person.</p><p>I also know that some people can’t travel — for health reasons, because their caring commitments are too great, or these days, because they’re worried about their documents being stripped or suffering violence because of their identity. So even though I’m willing to travel, I don’t expect everyone else to. Even in specific, time-limited collaborations, hybrid accommodations must be made.</p><p>For these reasons, I’ve made the decision that I won’t work for a company that requires everyone to come back to the office. Should I start another company, I will not mandate that people work from the office, although I might provide one as an optional collaboration space. This is to protect my quality of life, and to ensure that I can hire the best people for each role, regardless of where they might live or what the rest of their life might look like.</p><p>It’s not a decision I take lightly. It’s limiting: it means, should I leave my current job, that there will be fewer places I can go and work. It might limit my salary and future prospects, or even the investment I can raise for a future venture. But I care about being home and present, and I care about building representative workforces.</p><p>The bottom line is this: forcing people back into offices isn’t a neutral decision. It’s a choice to exclude and disadvantage anyone who doesn’t fit a narrow definition of what a “worker” looks like. I’m not willing to join in that discrimination.</p>

See the episode transcript at the top of this page, and a summary at the bottom.</p> Brought to You By <p>• <a href="https://workos.com/">WorkOS</a> — The modern identity platform for B2B SaaS.</p><p>• <a href="http://vanta.com/pragmatic">Vanta</a> — Automate compliance and simplify security with Vanta.</p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>Linux is the most widespread operating system, globally – but how is it built? Few people are better to answer this than Greg Kroah-Hartman: a Linux kernel maintainer for 25 years, and one of the 3 Linux Kernel Foundation Fellows (the other two are Linus Torvalds and Shuah Khan). Greg manages the Linux kernel’s stable releases, and is a maintainer of multiple kernel subsystems. He is also the author of the books <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Nutshell-Desktop-Reference-ebook/dp/B0026OR3OY?ref_=ast_author_mpb">Linux Kernel in a Nutshell</a> and <a href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/">Linux Device Drivers</a>.</p><p>We cover the inner workings of Linux kernel development, exploring everything from how changes get implemented to why its community-driven approach produces such reliable software. Greg shares insights about the kernel's unique trust model and makes a case for why engineers should contribute to open-source projects. We go into:</p>  <p>How widespread is Linux?</p>  <p>What is the Linux kernel responsible for – and why is it a monolith?</p>  <p>How does a kernel change get merged? A walkthrough</p>  <p>The 9-week development cycle for the Linux kernel</p>  <p>Testing the Linux kernel</p>  <p>Why is Linux so widespread?</p>  <p>The career benefits of open-source contribution</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>1. Linux is the most widespread operating system globally. Linux runs on 4 billion Android devices – compared to which everything else is “a rounding error”. Still, Linux is the most popular operating system for servers and embedded devices. It’s also used on many smart TVs, air traffic control systems, and even on the International Space Station. Fun fact: Linux even runs inside many iPhones – as it is the firmware used for the Qualcomm 5G modems inside these devices!</p><p>2. Getting a change merged into the Linux kernel is surprisingly straightforward. Create the change (called a patch), test it locally, and send it to the right maintainer for review. The patch needs to go through a hierarchical tree of maintainers accepting it before it can make it into the kernel. We go through a specific change being merged up this tree.</p><p>3. Linux won because devs being “selfish” works! Developers contribute to Linux in a "selfish" way to solve their own problems. But turns out, many devs have the same problems: so every contribution makes Linux a better fit for other devs to use! Kernel maintainers only accept contributions that make sense for the whole project. For example, embedded device vendors helped make the Linux kernel more efficient. This efficiency later greatly helped Linux become the best choice for mobile OS on Android.</p><p>4. The Linux kernel is run in a very unique way – because the project is unique. The Linux kernel has 4,000 contributors per year, releases strictly every 9 weeks – and yet has practically no meetings, no project managers and uses email and git. This setup works because project management happens outside of the Linux kernel: contributors bring completed work. Also, the kernel team invests heavily in automation for e.g. triaging. And turns out, email scales really well – for this group, that is! (Note that other projects built on top of the Linux kernel – such as Linux distributions like Red Hat or Debian – all work differently. What works for the Linux kernel thanks to unique circumstances, won’t work for those projects).</p><p>5. Git was created as a solution for the Linux kernel’s source control needs. We talked about this story with Greg outside the podcast: it’s a fascinating story about how git was built and open-sourced after the Linux kernel group was unhappy with existing source control solutions.</p><p>In what is amusing: git has become the de facto source control product across tech thanks to products like GitHub and GitLab. The Linux kernel does not use GitHub – don’t forget, they already solved their source control workflow problems by writing git!</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-tpms-do">What TPMs do and what software engineers can learn from them</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-past-and-future-of-backend-practices">The past and future of modern backend practices</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/backstage">Backstage: an open-source developer portal</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=143s">02:23</a>) How widespread is Linux?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=360s">06:00</a>) The difference in complexity in different devices powered by Linux</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=560s">09:20</a>) What is the Linux kernel?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=840s">14:00</a>) Why trust is so important with the Linux kernel development</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=962s">16:02</a>) A walk-through of a kernel change</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=1400s">23:20</a>) How Linux kernel development cycles work</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=1795s">29:55</a>) The testing process at Kernel and Kernel CI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=1915s">31:55</a>) A case for the open source development process</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2144s">35:44</a>) Linux kernel branches: Stable vs. development</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2312s">38:32</a>) Challenges of maintaining older Linux code</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2430s">40:30</a>) How Linux handles bug fixes</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2680s">44:40</a>) The range of work Linux kernel engineers do</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=2913s">48:33</a>) Greg’s review process and its parallels with Uber’s RFC process</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=3108s">51:48</a>) Linux kernel within companies like IBM</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=3232s">53:52</a>) Why Linux is so widespread</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=3410s">56:50</a>) How Linux Kernel Institute runs without product managers</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=3721s">1:02:01</a>) The pros and cons of using Rust in Linux kernel</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=4195s">1:09:55</a>) How LLMs are utilized in bug fixes and coding in Linux</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=4333s">1:12:13</a>) The value of contributing to the Linux kernel or any open-source project</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2DSPj1cLk&amp;t=4600s">1:16:40</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  The Linux kernel   <p>The Linux kernel is around 40 million lines of code. The core kernel –the part every Linux platform runs – is about 5% of this. . The remaining code supports diverse hardware, drivers, devices, architectures, and chips.</p>  <p>A typical laptop runs approximately two to 2.5M million lines of kernel code; servers around 1.5M, while mobile devices around 4M.</p>  <p>The role of the kernel: abstract away underlying hardware and present a consistent interface to user space programs. This allows the applications to run on different hardware without modification.</p>  <p>A monolithic kernel</p>  <p>Drivers in Linux are part of the kernel</p>  <p>This is a monolithic architecture: all code, including drivers, operates in the same address space</p>  <p>The monolithic approach allows for more refactoring options and more code-sharing opportunities between drivers. This results in Linux drivers being, on average, one-third smaller than drivers in other operating systems because common functionalities can be identified and consolidated.</p>    <p>Do not break userspace. The core principle of Linux kernel development is to never intentionally break user space. This guarantee ensures that users can upgrade their kernel without fear of their existing applications crashing. Accidental breakages are treated as faults and are promptly addressed.</p>   Linux kernel development process   <p>Fixed 9-week cadence.</p>  <p>Following a release by Linus Torvalds, a two-week merge window opens.</p>  <p>During this merge window, maintainers submit all the new features that have been pending and proven to work in their respective development trees to Linus.</p>  <p>rc1: after the two-week merge window, Linus issues the first release candidate (rc1).</p>  <p>For the subsequent seven weeks, only bug fixes are accepted. No new features are introduced during this stabilization period; the focus is on regression fixes and reverting problematic changes.</p>    <p>Hierarchical structure of maintainers.</p>  <p>Around 4,000 developers contribute code every year</p>  <p>They send changes via email to maintainers responsible for specific kernel subsystems</p>  <p>Kernel subsystem maintainers then forward collections of accepted changes up the chain</p>  <p>Ultimately, these changes reach Linus for inclusion in the main kernel tree.</p>    <p>Trust is key in Linux kernel development. When a maintainer accepts code from a developer, they implicitly take responsibility for it. For critical parts of the kernel, maintainers need to have a high degree of confidence in the developer and the quality of their work, as the maintainer becomes accountable if the original developer disappears.</p>  <p>Email and git. These are the two tools used during development.</p>  <p>"Linux Next:" a separate development tree that integrates all the changes destined for the next kernel release on a daily basis. This allows for continuous testing and identification of potential integration issues.</p>   QA and stable releases   <p>Linux Next: automated testing. This includes building and booting the kernel across various architectures and virtual machines.</p>  <p>KernelCI: a project that provides a more extensive continuous integration infrastructure, running tests on a wider range of real hardware contributed by different labs.</p>  <p>The testing process involves a mix of automated tests and real-world usage by developers and testers. The "zero-day bot" automatically tests patches submitted to mailing lists.</p>  <p>Stable kernel releases: these are maintained independently of the main development branch. After each major kernel release by Linus, a stable branch is forked.</p>  <p>Greg&nbsp;and Sasha Levin maintain these stable branches.&nbsp;They issue new stable releases weekly, incorporating bug fixes that have first been merged into Linus's tree. This ensures that stable branches do not diverge from the main development line.</p>    <p>Long-term stable (LTS) kernels: Greg picks one kernel per year and supports it for an extended period, initially two years, sometimes up to six years. Android phones, for instance, often run on these older LTS kernels, which still receive backported bug fixes. Greg and Sasha concurrently maintain multiple LTS kernels.</p>  <p>Maintaining older codebases is more challenging. This is due to the ongoing evolution of the kernel. Changes made in newer versions to fix bugs might be difficult to backport to older, significantly diverged code. Context is often lost over time, making even seemingly simple backports complex.</p>   Contributors   <p>About 80% of kernel contributors are paid – by their employer! Companies invest in Linux development because it's often more cost-effective to contribute features and fixes than to develop their own operating systems.</p>  <p>Contributing to the Linux kernel is a valuable way for developers to also invest in their careers. It demonstrates the ability to collaborate, work with existing codebases, and solve real-world problems.</p>  <p>Core maintainers meet annually to discuss and refine the development process.</p>   Rust support?   <p>Most of Linux is written in C, but Rust is gaining momentum. Approximately 25,000 lines of Rust code are already in the kernel, primarily for bindings but also for some functionality like generating QR codes on kernel crashes.</p>  <p>Introducing Rust aims to improve memory safety in certain parts of the kernel. However, writing drivers in Rust presents challenges due to the need for bindings to the extensive C codebase and the different memory management models of C and Rust.</p>  <p>Memory safety in Rust primarily refers to the safety of object lifecycles and memory ownership, not necessarily the elimination of all bugs. Logic errors and even memory unsafety can still occur in Rust code.</p>  <p>The adoption of Rust is also driving improvements in the existing C codebase, as the need to create Rust bindings encourages a re-evaluation of C code for better safety and clarity.</p>    <p>Will the Linux kernel add Rust support?</p>  <p>There is resistance to introducing new languages from some core kernel developers, who prefer to maintain a single-language codebase.</p>  <p>Efforts are underway to write more drivers in Rust, including experimental GPU drivers. Rust can be particularly well-suited for simpler hardware drivers.</p>  <p>Governments increasingly mandate the use of memory-safe languages, which is another factor driving the adoption of Rust in Linux.</p>  <p>That said, the Linux kernel community is also actively working on improving the safety of existing C code through techniques like bounds checking and compiler extensions.</p>     Why contribute to Linux, and how?   <p>Building and testing the kernel locally is a prerequisite for submitting changes.</p>  <p>Contributing, even a single patch, offers significant professional benefits. It strengthens a developer's resume by demonstrating the ability to collaborate and work with complex, established codebases.</p>  <p>Contributing provides valuable learning opportunities, exposing devs to different perspectives, coding practices, and challenging technical problems.</p>  <p>Newcomers can find entry points by working on less critical parts of the kernel, such as fixing coding style issues or removing dead code in older drivers.

 [Freedom of the Press Foundation]  Wired is going to stop paywalling articles that are primarily based on public records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.   This approach makes a ton of sense:   "They’re called public records for a reason, after all.

When stories are based on public data, like FOIA requests, another level of public responsibility is added to the equation: these are public documents that belong to all of us.</p><p>I wish more online newsrooms would move to a patronage model (see The Guardian), but this isn't always possible. Someone always brings up micropayments in these conversations, but <a href="https://www.cjr.org/opinion/micropayments-subscription-pay-by-article.php">they do not work and have never worked</a>. This hybrid model - public service articles for free, the rest behind the paywall - may point to a way forward.</p>

Adults also didn’t feel properly informed of Amazon’s inclination to keep Alexa recordings unless prompted not to until 2019—five years after the first Echo came out."</p></blockquote><p>It was a nice idea, but it's time to give them a rest. There are plenty of use cases for smart agents, but they don't need to be listening to you all the time like you live in some kind of science fiction movie. You don't know who else is listening with them.</p>

<p>LIVE告知です。メタバース進化論の著者のバーチャル美少女ねむさんとYouTube Live を行います。</p>

<p>バーチャル美少女ねむさんは、黎明期の仮想世界で生きる「メタバース原住民」にして、その文化を伝える「メタバース文化エバンジェリスト」として活動しておられます。「バーチャルでなりたい自分になる」をテーマに2017年から美少女アイドルとして活動している自称・世界最古の個人系VTuber。メタバースの革命性を論じた著書『<a href="https://amzn.to/4hDlXQ4">メタバース進化論</a>』（2022年、技術評論社）で「<a href="https://www.shoeisha.co.jp/campaign/award/2023/result">ITエンジニア本大賞2023</a>」ビジネス書部門”大賞”を受賞。国連の国際会議「<a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/igfkyoto2023/">IGF京都2023</a>」でも登壇。MoguLive VTuber Award 2023では「<a href="https://www.moguravr.com/mogulive-vtuber-award-2024-vtuber/">今年最も輝いたVTuber</a>」に選出されています。2024年には定性調査レポート「<a href="https://note.com/nemchan_nel/n/n9a4ca9f667a2">メタバースでのアイデンティティ（Nem x Mila, 2024）</a>」を発表。<a href="https://unit.aist.go.jp/harc/daax/d_cns_standardization.html">産総研「アバター国際標準化の国内検討委員会」</a><a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6797/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-6797" title="ISO IEC/JTC1/SC35専門委員会関連">4</a>委員にも就任されておられます。</p>



<p>ねむさんが課題として捉えられていることに分人経済が新たな経済圏に昇華するためのID認証・経済・納税の仕組みがあります。たとえば、</p>



 
 バーチャルでアバターの形でしか会わない取引先にどうしてマイナンバーカードの表裏をコピーして郵送しなければならないのか？ 
 



<p>もちろん、適正な課税のためには税務当局がマイナンバーを使って支払いを把握することが必要であることは論を待ちません。しかし、だからといってマイナンバーカードのオモテ裏のコピーを郵送したりして身元確認情報を拡散させたり、望まない名寄せが行われるリスクをとる必要があるのでしょうか？多くのVTuberの方にしてみれば、「顔バレ」を含む「身バレ」は最大のリスクの一つです。こうしたリスクを抑えたうえで、ひとびとが経済活動を行い、一方税務当局は本人のマイナンバーを抑えることができて適正な課税をする仕組みはつくれないのでしょうか？これは実はVTuberだけでなく、ひろく一般の方々にかんしても言えることです。</p>



<p>こうしたことについて、目標1.5時間でいろいろお話をしたいと思います。</p>



<p>ねむさん曰く：</p>



<blockquote>
<p>次世代インターネットの扉を開くという「分人経済革命」とは果たして何なのか！？ 仮想空間「メタバース」ではアバターによって複数の自分（分人）を切り替え、自己の魂の在り方と社会との界面を能動的にデザインできる新時代が遂に実現しつつある。一方でそれを新たな経済圏に昇華するためのID認証・経済・納税の仕組みは全くの未整備なのが現状だ。インターネットにおけるデジタルアイデンティティの標準化に長年取り組んできたOpenID Foundation理事長「崎村夏彦」とメタバース住人にしてVTuber/作家「バーチャル美少女ねむ」が3/29にYouTube LIVEでこの問題を徹底対談！ 次世代インターネットの革命がここから始まる！？（出所：<a href="https://note.com/nemchan_nel/n/neac6dc0eee04">【告知】3/29「分人経済革命」ねむ ✕ 崎村夏彦 徹底対談【次世代ネットの扉を開く革命の起こしかた】</a>）</p>

<p>My first love was self-sovereign distributed data, where each person owns and controls their data, hosting it wherever they choose and permissioning it under their own terms. But I got lost in the complexity of building a robust distributed identity infrastructure. How can you give permission to someone if you can’t 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no point in saying "only John can access this" if Tom can show up and convincingly say, "I'm John."</p><p>This issue isn’t theoretical—many modern digital problems stem from weak identity foundations. Take email, for example. SMTP, the core protocol, evolved without a strong sense of identity. Had we designed email with a robust identity layer—and maybe a little reputation—spam might have been less rampant. Instead, we've had to patch identity onto email systems, mostly at the DNS layer. Could better choices early on have changed the landscape of digital trust?</p><p>As we enter the era of AI and Personal AI, this challenge resurfaces. We will increasingly rely on agents to interact, assist, and even make decisions on our behalf. But how can we trust these agents? How do we know they are who they claim to be, and whose interests they truly serve? When I ask my AI how to unwind after a long day, it might suggest a refreshing Diet Coke. But is that suggestion rooted in understanding my preferences, or is it influenced by unseen commercial incentives?</p><p>Recognition and Identity in AI</p><p>In the animal world, intelligence is often measured by the ability to recognize oneself and others. The mirror test is a classic example—when an animal identifies itself in a reflection, it demonstrates a form of self-awareness. Similarly, recognizing specific others—distinguishing one individual from another—marks advanced cognitive development.</p><p>AI, in contrast, remains limited in this capacity. While AI excels at pattern recognition, it lacks the ability to form a persistent sense of identity, either of itself or others. This limitation restricts its ability to build trust and context in interactions. Without a foundation for recognizing specific entities, AI systems risk becoming tools of confusion or exploitation.</p><p>Embedding Identity Systems into AI</p><p>One solution is to deeply embed identity frameworks into AI architectures from the outset. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and similar systems could provide AI with a structured way to "recognize" and differentiate entities.</p>  <p>Persistent Identity Chains: AI could track verifiable chains of identity, ensuring that when it reports information—like "Brad says buy this stock"—it can verify that it truly came from the Brad you trust.</p>  <p>Verification of Origin: By leveraging cryptographically verifiable credentials, AI can ensure that information hasn’t been tampered with and originates from a trusted source.</p>  <p>Reputation Frameworks: Identity systems could incorporate reputation mechanisms, helping AI prioritize information from sources that consistently meet a trust threshold.</p>  <p>Chain of Custody: AI could provide transparency on how information was received and processed, ensuring that its recommendations are based on data with verifiable origins.</p>  <p>The Path to Trusted AI</p><p>Trustworthy AI isn’t about making machines socially aware; it’s about ensuring that humans can trust the chain of custody behind AI-generated insights. When AI states that "Brad recommends this action," it should be able to prove that the recommendation came from the right "Brad"—the person you trust, not an imposter or manipulated data source.</p><p>The real question is: How do we create systems where AI is not just technically accurate but verifiably trustworthy? In an era where decisions increasingly rely on AI advice, embedding identity systems at the core isn’t just beneficial—it’s fundamental.</p>

<p>具体的には、GOV.UK One Loginは以下の特徴を持っています：</p>



 
 OpenID Connect準拠: OIDCプロトコルを使用して、ユーザー認証と属性の共有を行います。 



 認証フロー: 標準的なOAuth 2.0/OIDC認証コードフローを実装しています。これには以下のステップが含まれます：
 
 <code>/authorize</code> エンドポイントへの認可リクエスト 



 認可コードの発行 



 <code>/token</code> エンドポイントでのトークン交換 



 IDトークンとアクセストークンの取得 



 <code>/userinfo</code> エンドポイントでのユーザー情報の取得 
 
 



 セキュリティ強化: JWT-secured OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request (JAR)<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6766/#easy-footnote-bottom-17-6766" title="<a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9101/&quot;>Sakimura, et al. JWT-secured OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request (JAR) (RFC9101)</a>">17</a>を使用して、認証リクエストパラメータのセキュリティを向上させています。 
 



<p>ちなみにですが、OpenID Connect も JAR もわたしが主著者なので、なんとも喜ばしいことです。</p>

Gautam is the Co-Founder of <a href="https://gitar.ai/">Gitar</a>, an agentic AI startup that automates code maintenance. Gautam was mobile engineer no. 9 at Uber and founding engineer for the mobile platform team – and so he learned a few things about scaling up engineering teams.</p><p>We talk about:</p><p>• How Gautam accidentally deleted Uber’s Java monorepo – really!</p><p>• Uber's unique engineering stack and why custom solutions like SubmitQueue were built in-house</p><p>• Monorepo: the benefits and downsides of this approach</p><p>• From Engineer II to Principal Engineer at Uber: Gautam’s career trajectory</p><p>• Practical strategies for building trust and gaining social capital</p><p>• How the platform team at Uber operated with a product-focused mindset</p><p>• Vibe coding: why it helps with quick prototyping</p><p>• How AI tools are changing developer experience and productivity</p><p>• Important skills for devs to pick up to remain valuable as AI tools spread</p><p>• And more!</p>     Takeaways <p>Interesting parts of the conversation:</p><p>1. Submit Queue: Uber built a complex merge system to deal with the large number of commits, where each commit had to run long-running CI tests. It’s a problem that smaller and mid-sized companies don’t have, but Uber had: and so they scratched their own itch.</p><p>2. Local Developer Analytics (LDA): years ago, Uber started to measure the experience that devs had. Things like: how long did a build take, locally? How much CPU is used? They used this data to improve internal tooling.</p><p>3. Developer experience as a product team. Gautam’s team operated like a classic product team: except their customers were Uber’s internal developers. Gautam believes this is how all successful platform teams should work.</p><p>4. AI changing software development: this is happening. “Vibe coding” leads to faster prototyping. Gautam believes junior engineers will thrive with AI tools because they will hit the ground running faster, and will be free of biases that hold back more experienced developers.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/program-platform-split-uber?utm_source=publication-search">The Platform and Program split at Uber</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/uber-eng-productivity?utm_source=publication-search">How Uber is measuring engineering productivity</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/uber-move-to-cloud?utm_source=publication-search">Inside Uber’s move to the Cloud</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-uber-built-its-observability-platform?utm_source=publication-search">How Uber built its observability platform</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architect-archetypes">Software Architect Archetypes</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=131s">02:11</a>) How Gautam accidentally deleted Uber’s Java Monorepo</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=340s">05:40</a>) The impact of Gautam’s mistake</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=395s">06:35</a>) Uber’s unique engineering stack</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=615s">10:15</a>) Uber’s SubmitQueue</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=764s">12:44</a>) Why Uber moved to a monorepo</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=990s">16:30</a>) The downsides of a monorepo</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1115s">18:35</a>) Measurement products built in-house</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1220s">20:20</a>) Measuring developer productivity and happiness</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1372s">22:52</a>) How Devpods improved developer productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1657s">27:37</a>) The challenges with cloud development environments</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1750s">29:10</a>) Gautam’s journey from Eng II to Principal Engineer</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1920s">32:00</a>) Building trust and gaining social capital</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=2177s">36:17</a>) An explanation of Principal Engineer at Uber—and the archetypes at Uber</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=2707s">45:07</a>) The platform and program split at Uber</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=2895s">48:15</a>) How Gautam and his team supported their internal users</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=3170s">52:50</a>) Gautam’s thoughts on developer productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=3550s">59:10</a>) How AI enhances productivity, its limitations, and the rise of agentic AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=3840s">1:04:00</a>) An explanation of Vibe coding</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=4054s">1:07:34</a>) An overview of Gitar and all it can help developers with</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=4244s">1:10:44</a>) Top skills to cultivate to add value and stay relevant</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=4620s">1:17:00</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Uber's engineering culture and tools   <p>Gautam joined Uber in 2014 as an Android engineer. Back then, there were not even unit tests. Gautam wrote the first Android test, and set up Artifactory.</p>  <p>Uber built much of its engineering stack in-house because the cloud-native SaaS products were not built for their scale.</p>  <p>Even in the earlier years, Uber saw about one commit every minute – and the platforms at the time could not handle this (especially when considering that CI took 10-30 minutes to run!)</p>  <p>Build time was a problem. During the iOS and Android app rewrite in 2016, build times became very long. Gautam worked on getting it under control.</p>  <p>Submit Queue was a way to guarantee a green main. It serialised incoming commits to ensure they played nicely together. The company <a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=uber+submitqueue">published a paper</a> on this novel solution. Submit Queue tested changes and considered cross-dependencies between different commits. Machine learning models estimated potential failures and speculatively tried paths that might be green.</p>    <p>Monorepo: after starting as polyrepos, Uber moved to monorepos</p>  <p>Uber started with separate repos for Rider, Driver, and other apps (eg Eats). As the company grew, each team wanted its own repository, resulting in hundreds of repos. It became painful to upgrade and bump libraries.</p>  <p>The iOS team moved to a monorepo, followed by Android. The gains in productivity were massive because there was no need to bump libraries. This move really helped with standardisation.</p>  <p>The biggest initial pushback was that teams could no longer break an API without worrying about the consequences. There was concern about slower builds. In the end, the dev platform team solved these concerns.</p>     Developer experience and dev productivity   <p>Local Developer Analytics (LDA): an internal Uber system that ran on developers' machines and collected information about their systems. It integrated deeply into CLI tools and IDEs, tracked which files developers accessed most, and identified files with the most bugs. LDA helped identify bottlenecks in the development funnel.</p>  <p>Developer surveys: Uber ran these regularly. The dev tooling NPS went from negative 50 to positive 8 during Gautam’s tenure.</p>  <p>Things that made for a better developer experience: minimizing time to review code, time to build code, and reducing time spent in meetings.</p>    <p>DevPods: another internal Uber tool. These are basically cloud developer environments. They contain a container of code, build system artefacts and IDE indices in the cloud. DevPods make context switching quick.</p>  <p>Previously, onboarding involved running a bootstrapping script. The script was hard to maintain. Dev Pods moved the development stuff into a container. The containers can be huge.</p>     Career growth to Principal Engineer   <p>Going deep: getting into a niche and going deep can help over the long term, especially in areas others may not want to do.</p>  <p>Introspect regularly:&nbsp;Every two years, Gautam did some introspection to see if he was doing what he wanted and what could challenge him more.</p>  <p>Social capital and mentorship: these become very important at a big company. It helps to have connections. Helping people builds social capital. Gautam would drop everything to help people with their dev environment problems. He also held office hours on a regular basis, offering to help anyone who showed up.</p>  <p>Understand the business: Principal engineers need to understanding how engineering meets business, rather than just pure coding. It helps if you enjoy diving into this area – as well as if you like talking with people!</p>  <p>More of a peer relationship with your manager. As engineers grow in seniority, they become more like a peer to their manager and help their manager get stuff done. The relationship is more like a “peer” than a “boss”.</p>  <p>Tip for managers of senior+ devs: give them agency, check in often, and make sure they are unblocked.</p>     The impact of AI on software development   <p>Autocomplete: an obvious use case.

<p>デジタル技術の進化により、私たちの個人情報やデータへの依存がますます高まっています。しかし、多くの政府提供IDシステムは、ユーザーのプライバシーや自由を十分に考慮していないことがあります。その中で、ユタ州の「<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0260.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SB260法案</a>」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6848/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-6848" title="2025年5月7日施行">10</a>は、他のシステムとは異なるアプローチを取り、ユーザーのプライバシー保護とデータ管理の自主性を根底から強化していると話題になっています(<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/utahs-digital-id-law-sb260-is-the-new-frontier-for-user-controlled-identity/">Chang(2025)</a>他)。そこで、本記事では、その特徴と他のデジタルIDシステムとの差別化点について検討してみます。</p>



 



 SB260法案のユニークな特徴 



<p>SB260法案が他の政府提供IDシステムと大きく異なる点は、以下の特徴にあります。</p>



<p>個人の自主性を尊重<br>SB260では、「州が個人のアイデンティティを定義しない」と明確に規定されています (§ 63A-16-1202)。そして「州は特定の状況において、個人のアイデンティティを認識し承認することがある」とされています。従来の多くの政府IDは、政府が個人のアイデンティティを定義し、認識する権限を持っており、個人の存在は政府の承認に依存していました。これとSB260の新しいアプローチは根本的に異なります。SB260では、人間はすでに自分自身の権利で存在していることを認識し、州の役割は人間が認識され、法で規定された方法で州の承認を管理できるよう支援を提供する支援者という形になります。SB260は個人の自主性に重点を置いています 。前者のアプローチだと、政府に認識されないことによって存在が否定されうるのに対し、後者ではそれがおきません。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>監視とデータ共有の禁止<br>SB260では、デジタルIDが提示された際、政府機関やその他の関係者による監視や情報共有を厳しく禁止しています。例えば、提示されたID情報を、提示を受けた企業などがマーケティングや監視目的で使用することが許されません。このガイドラインは、ユーザーデータが不必要に共有されることを防ぎ、データ管理の透明性を促進します 。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>選択的な情報開示<br>多くの物理的な身分証明書では、住所や年齢といったすべての情報が開示されますが、SB260は「選択的開示」を可能にする技術を採用するとしています。例えば、年齢確認が必要な場合でも、実際の誕生日や住所を共有する必要がありません。これにより、個人情報が不必要に漏洩することを防ぎます 。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-6.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>デバイスの提供を強制しない<br>SB260は、デジタルアイデンティティ確認の際にモバイル端末を提供することを強制しないと規定しています。この規定は、法執行機関や他の政府関係者が端末へのアクセスを求める可能性を排除し、端末内の個人データの保護を保証します 。このあたりは、デバイスを確認者が預かって、あんなことやこんなことをできるような制度とだいぶ違うと言えます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>デジタルアイデンティティの利用は完全に任意<br>他のアイデンティティシステムとは異なり、SB260ではデジタルアイデンティティの利用が完全に任意であることが強調されています。政府機関はデジタルアイデンティティを強制したり、使用を推奨するためのインセンティブを提供することはできません。これにより、技術に不慣れな住民やデジタルツールの使用を望まない住民への配慮がなされています 。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6848/#easy-footnote-bottom-18-6848" title="とはいえ、わたしはどちらかというとデンマークのような「デジタル代書屋」の提供で支援するようなアプローチのほうが良いと思っています。">18</a></p>



 



 他のIDシステムとの比較：何が違うのか？ 



<p>多くの政府提供IDでは、監視とデータ収集が懸念されています。一部のシステムでは、個人情報がマーケティングやデータ解析に利用される可能性がありますが、SB260はこれを明確に禁止しています。また、他のシステムではデジタルIDが義務化される場合があり、ユーザーには選択肢がありません。一方で、SB260は完全に任意のシステムであり、ユーザー中心の設計が際立っています。</p>



<p>その結果、SB260はプライバシーを優先し、ユーザーのデータ管理を完全に可能にする未来型のデジタルIDシステムとして注目されています。このユーザー主導型のアプローチは、アメリカ全土だけでなく、世界中のデジタルID開発にも影響を与える可能性があります 。</p>



 



 結論：デジタル時代の新しい参照点 



<p>ユタ州のSB260法案は、デジタルIDの未来を形作る重要な節目と言えます。ユーザーの自主性、プライバシーの保護、選択の自由を包括的に保証するこの法案は、他の政府提供IDシステムとは一線を画すものです。</p>



<p>文書の出来自体に関して言うと、Identityの定義が「”Identity” means any attribute used to identify or distinguish a specific individual.」になっていたり、「(a)each individual has a unique identity;」となっているところなど、規格的な見方をするといろいろと気になる点はあります。が、SB260は、個人の自由とデータ管理の新しい基準を設定するだけでなく、技術と法律が調和してユーザー本位の世界を実現するモデルとして広く認知され、今後デジタルIDを制度化していく各種法域において、デジタル時代における安心・安全なIDシステムということに関して、何らかの影響を与えていくことでしょう。これを受けて、アメリカの各州がどう動くか、目がはなせません。</p>

<p>Imagine you’re the cofounder of a startup hiring its first few software engineers, and there’s a candidate who smashes the technical interview, and is the only one to complete the full coding interview – doing so with time to spare. Their communication style is a bit unconventional, but this could be explained by language differences, and isn’t a red flag. So, the promising candidate gets a thumbs up, and pretty soon they’re on screen in a non-technical final interview with the other cofounder, via video.</p><p>Then things get weird. Your cofounder pings you mid-interview to report that the candidate from Poland speaks no Polish whatsoever, and also that there is something just not right about their appearance on screen. The recruitment of this candidate gets derailed by suspicious details which erode everyone’s confidence in making the hire. Soon afterwards, the same thing happens again with another candidate.</p><p>Later, you discover that two imposters hiding behind deepfake avatars almost succeeded in tricking your startup into hiring them. This may sound like the stuff of fiction, but it really did happen to a startup called <a href="https://www.vidocsecurity.com/">Vidoc Security</a>, recently. Fortunately, they caught the AI impostors – and the second time it happened they got video evidence.</p><p>To find out more about this unsettling, fascinating episode from the intersection of cutting-edge AI and tech recruitment, the Pragmatic Engineer sat down with Vidoc cofounder, Dawid Moczadło. Today, we cover:</p>  <p>The first AI faker. Vidoc Security nearly made an offer to a fake candidate, but their back story raised too many questions.</p>  <p>The second AI faker. The next time a job candidate raised similar suspicions, the team was prepared and confronted the faker during the call – and recorded it.</p>  <p>How to avoid being tricked by AI candidates. Take the risk seriously, have applicants turn off video filters and verify that they do this, record interviews, and get firm proof of identity before any offer.</p>  <p>Foreign state interference? There’s evidence that many AI candidates could be part of a coordinated governmental operation targeting hundreds of western tech businesses. Full-remote workplaces are the most targeted.</p>  <p>Return of in-person final rounds? This looks an obvious consequence of these incidents.</p>  <p>New AI risks for tech businesses. Remote interviews may have to change, while devs also risk introducing security vulnerabilities by accepting AI suggestions without critique.</p>  <p>Hiring funnel. The story began with <a href="https://justjoin.it/job-offer/vidoc-security-lab-founding-backend-engineer---mid-senior-warszawa-javascript">this job posting</a> for a backend engineer. The startup shares its hiring funnel, giving a sense of how competitive full-remote startup positions are, currently. As context: from 500 applications, two hires have been made – and Vidoc is <a href="https://justjoin.it/job-offer/vidoc-security-lab-founding-backend-engineer---mid-senior-warszawa-javascript">still actively recruiting</a> for this position.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4184d0d-b473-4aeb-999c-e60dbd80396f_1600x750.png">          </a>Catching an AI imposter: the candidate (left) refused to place their hand in front of their face because it would blow their AI cover.

The first AI faker <p>Vidoc Security is a security provider offering automated code reviews to detect security issues. The idea for the company came from two security engineers and ethical hackers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawid-moczadlo/">Dawid Moczadło</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaudia-kloc-/">Klaudia Kloc</a>. Previously, they hacked top tech companies like Meta and then disclosed vulnerabilities to those places in order to collect bounties, and get on those companies’ ethical hacking leaderboards.</p><p>With the rise of LLMs in the past couple of years, Dawid and Klaudia spotted an opportunity to create a tool that works in the same way as they searched for security vulnerabilities: looking across the broader codebase, checking how components interact, which parts could be insecure, and more. Basically, an LLM can take their expertise about what works to hack well-designed systems, and build a tool with some of the same know-how.</p><p>Their idea attracted investors, and Dawid and Klaudia raised a $600K seed round in 2023, and a further $2.5M in seed funding in August 2024. With this seed funding in the bank: the company began hiring. They posted <a href="https://justjoin.it/job-offer/vidoc-security-lab-founding-backend-engineer---mid-senior-warszawa-javascript">a job ad</a> for a backend engineer, and started to interview candidates. (We share details on the exact hiring funnel and statistics below, in “The hiring funnel”)</p><p>One promising candidate was called Makary Krol. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/makary-krol-336923317/">His LinkedIn profile</a> is still active:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62e47648-a4a7-4798-a498-bd89c59c25f7_1272x1552.png">          </a>Fake profile. Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/makary-krol-336923317/">LinkedIn</a> <p>Below is a step-by-step summary of how the recruitment process for the imposter candidate went, based on Vidoc Security's records, including the bogus resume. By the end of step 5, the team were certain they were the target of a scam.</p><p>1. Resume screening: ✅Resume looks solid:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbb86dbc-8345-4c3f-b198-c38450d6a587_1260x1512.png">          </a>Page 1 of 2 from the fake resume. The resume looked convincing  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58fc44e-cebe-400b-a05a-075a1e01f73a_1206x1012.png">          </a>Page 2 of 2 of the fake, but convincing resume <p>2. First-round screening. ✅⚠️ A 15-30 minute call with Paulina, head of operations. It was a bit odd that the candidate did not speak any Polish, but was based there and graduated from Warsaw University of Technology. He spoke in broken English, and with a very strong accent that sounded Asian, but these weren’t warning big red flags, and the candidate sounded motivated.</p><p>3. Hiring manager interview. ✅⚠️ The candidate was clearly well-rounded and a technical screening was the obvious next step. Dawid’s only “yellow flag” was that their communication skills were poor, but he figured a technical interview would be a chance to show their core coding and technical skills.</p><p>4. Technical interview. ✅✅The candidate absolutely smashed it, being the first to finish all coding tasks and follow-up questions in the allocated time of 2 hours, which hadn’t happened before. Dawid was surprised by how competent they were at coding and technical problem solving. The coding abilities of this candidate were definitely not fake: they were a seasoned, very capable engineer.</p><p>5. Final hiring manager interview. ‼️⚠️ This was a non-technical interview with cofounder, Klaudia, who dug into the specifics of their background and grew suspicious. The candidate gave some details about previous positions, but she increasingly found herself disbelieving their back story and resume, the more time she spent with the candidate. Dawid shared the suspicion and they became certain that the figure on screen was far from what they claimed to be.</p><p>By the end of the recruitment process, Vidoc believed they had nearly been played, and had come worryingly close to extending an offer to a fake candidate using a false identity in their documents, and an AI filter to mask their face on screen. However, they had no evidence of this, and didn’t record the interviews, so had only their impressions and notes.</p><p>When Dawid recounted this episode to peers, he was met with disbelief. Founder friends – along with most other people – thought the team were overreacting and misguided. Eventually, Dawid stopped sharing the story and began to doubt the team’s suspicions about the candidate.</p><p>After the incident, Vidoc added an onsite interview as a final step in the recruitment process, and held a retrospective to figure out how to avoid something similar again. Interestingly, there wasn’t much that could be done about the potential risks of remote interviews being taken by applicants pretending to be someone else.</p> 2. The second AI faker <p>Two months after the suspected fake job candidate episode, another promising applicant appeared, going by the name Bratislav Rakočević, located in Serbia, with a university education there. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bratislavrako%C4%8Devi%C4%87-c197d9200/">His LinkedIn</a> was pretty basic:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4a2dbe6-a267-4dd8-a255-120d74bd5182_1203x1600.png">          </a>Another entirely made-up profile. Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bratislavrako%C4%8Devi%C4%87-c197d9200/">LinkedIn</a> <p>This application looked good, so the company ran the usual recruitment process, below (including the candidate’s made-up resume):</p><p>1. Resume screening: ✅⚠️ Solid on technologies, but with too many buzzwords for their current, self-employed role. Of course, it’s not unusual that some devs don’t thrive at writing resumes. Their credentials merited a call, especially as the “candidate” had “worked” at HubSpot and Woosh:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0e250-ed67-43a6-b62b-b3d3ff9d7cf7_1222x1598.png">          </a>Page 1 of 2 of another resume that later turned out to be fake  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2e01c19-006c-4996-b754-cb5db9b033c5_1194x1600.png">          </a>Page 2 of 2 of another resume that turned out to be fake <p>2. First-round screening. ✅⚠️ Communication was a bit choppy — then again, we’re talking about a non-native English speaker. The candidate did not speak Serbian, despite graduating from the University of Kragujevac, in Serbia. Once again, they sounded motivated, so proceeded to the next round.</p><p>3. Hiring manager interview: AI filter exposed‼️‼️Dawid conducted this interview, and immediately felt that something was off about the candidate. First of all, Dawid felt the candidate on the call looked somewhat unlike their low-resolution LinkedIn profile:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b95aaad-1265-4ed0-9a23-ea14ff7850b0_1402x780.png">          </a>First suspicion: Dawid felt the interviewee looked dissimilar to their profile picture <p>As a rule, Vidoc never records interviews, but the team had been burnt once before and had faced scepticism about it from peers afterwards. So he hit record, and asked the candidate to make a simple gesture which bamboozles the current crop of AI filters:</p><blockquote><p>“Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face and cover it partially?”</p></blockquote> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1518cc3-4acc-4426-81ce-1921c97a2926_1104x444.gif">          </a>Candidate (on the left) declines to place hand in front of face as the interviewer requests (right) <p>The candidate refused, so Dawid ended the conversation. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/klaudia-kloc-_story-of-how-an-ai-generated-polish-politician-ugcPost-7300929611511611395-QUeq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAIk0KwBsmE3oBadWSg2ettxmEyKbqZKG34">Watch the full video of the encounter.</a></p><p>Later, several people pointed out that the AI mask looked uncannily similar to a prominent Polish politician named Sławomir Mentzen:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c1b4a8a-2e03-43f0-ac57-696ca0547ecb_1366x800.png">          </a>Was this deepfake trained on video footage of a Polish politician? <p>Looking back on these twin incidents, the team suspects the same individual may have been behind the AI disguises of both fake candidates because:</p>  <p>Their voices sounded almost identical</p>  <p>The second candidate answered questions with surprising confidence – almost like he’d been asked them before</p>  <p>…a hunch that they had spoken before</p>  <p>The AI filter for the second faker was of much lower quality than the first. The first candidate slipped through undetected through several interviews, despite almost certainly using an AI filter as well. Dawid said the second candidate’s filter looked obvious on the screen – but on that occasion the Vidoc Security team were on high alert for any possible deception. It’s worth remembering that AI filters improve with time, so spotting a good one won’t always be easy.</p> 3. How to avoid being tricked by AI candidates <p>How can tech companies hiring engineers protect themselves, and prevent AI-disguised candidates? Some suggestions:</p><p>This is not a drill; take the threat seriously: If you think your company is too small to fall victim, think again. Vidoc Security was just a two-person startup in February 2023 with no funding raised, when it was first targeted. The first fake profile cold emailed them on LinkedIn to ask if they were hiring.</p><p>It’s possible there is a large, state-level operation running a pool of bogus applicants who hide behind fake resumes and AI filters in video interviews. If this operation can find the smallest of startups to target, it’s safe to assume they could apply to any other company, as well.</p><p>Don’t assume all job seekers on local job boards are genuine. Vidoc posted on local job boards, like the one in Poland. But whoever was behind this operation figured out that it’s profitable to pose as Serbian, Polish, and other eastern European profiles, and to apply via small, low-profile job boards. I didn’t even know about the job board “<a href="https://justjoin.it/">JustJoinIT</a>” (popular in Poland) but the fakers were already active on it.</p><p>Ask candidates to turn off all filters – including background ones. Filters that blur or replace the background are ubiquitous these days. During a video interview, it’s fair to ask a candidate to turn off all filters. After that, if there are still unusual minor details on their face or the background, then it’s safe to assume that a candidate did not turn off their filters. In an interview for a full-remote position, this could be justification enough to terminate the call.</p><p>Ask the candidate to do things that AI filters cannot handle – yet, such as:</p>  <p>A face turning side to side</p>  <p>A hand in front of a face</p>  <p>standing up and walking backward from the camera, showing more body detail</p>  <p>In the circumstances, It should be justifiable to run through some or all of these tests, as well as asking for all filters to be turned off. Stu Sjouwerman, CEO of KnowBe4, <a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/north-korean-it-worker-threat-10-critical-updates-to-your-hiring-process">shared additional details</a> on what his company learned from hiring a North Korean worker with a false identity:</p>  <p>Do not rely on email references alone. For reference checks, also do phone calls or video calls with references.</p>  <p>Absence of a digital footprint is suspicious. If there’s no trace of a candidate anywhere online, it could be a flag.</p>  <p>Use a phone carrier lookup tool before calling a candidate. Many fake candidates provide a VoIP number. Treat any such number as a red flag and refuse to call candidates on it.</p>  <p>Conduct all interviews using video. Fake candidates can slip through written application processes more easily</p>  <p>Expect identity theft. In the case of KnowBe4, the identity of the person they hired was real and stolen, meaning that a background check came back clean.</p>  <p>Put better internal monitoring in place. Monitor access to systems by onboarded employees – and pay extra attention to new joiners.</p>  <p>When suspicious, ask lowkey “cultural” questions. For example, if a candidate claims to be from Seattle but there is reason to suspect otherwise, ask a question like, “'I see you are from Seattle, what's your favorite place to eat, and what do you usually get?” Faking this knowledge in a convincing way is hard for someone who has never been to Seattle, and doesn’t know the local cuisine.</p>  <p>Different shipping address for laptop. If a candidate asks for an onboarding laptop to be shipped to a different address from where they are supposed to be living or working, it’s a red flag.</p>  <p>Additional tips:</p>  <p>Record video interviews and save them for later. AI-disguised candidates might be hard to spot in a live scenario, but analyzing the video later could be helpful. Note that recording the interview will most likely require disclosing this to a candidate, and them agreeing to this.</p>  <p>Get notarized proof of identity. This advice <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">comes from Google</a>, after they saw hundreds of US companies fall victim to North Korean workers by hiring them for tech roles.</p>  <p>Vidoc also created a guide to detect fake candidates in your hiring pipeline: <a href="https://www.vidocsecurity.com/ebook/ebook-detecting-fake-candidates-vsl.pdf">see this PDF document here</a>.</p> 4. Foreign state interference? <p>So, who or what might be behind these two incidents at Vidoc; a lone individual or individuals, or something else entirely? </p>

<p>Today I realized that even though the Web3 program is ramping up as demonstrated by Silicon Valley’s plans to turn Argentina into a “network state,” few understand what is unfolding with cybernetic governance. For that reason, I decided to take time off this spring to work on my garden and simply be with real people in the real world. I made a brief announcement to that effect tonight.</p>

<p>This is a clip I created (6 minutes) summarizing Protocol Lab’s Aleph project with Javier Milei, the guy who gave Musk the chainsaw at the CPAC gathering a few weeks ago. I get that it is difficult to navigate narratives and torrents of information. The current has been against the story I’ve been trying to tell for a decade. It simply didn’t stick, but I did try. I lost my old life in the process, but I gained a sunny yard filled with birdsong and time to read stacks of books on&nbsp;cosmology and consciousness. Until I pop in again, be well everyone.</p>

<p>This post is a more technical follow-up to the <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/utah-blazes-new-trail-for-ssi-sedi-441d8ce65ab8">post announcing the passing of SB 260 in Utah</a>, establishing the principles for state-endorsed digital identity (SEDI). While SEDI does not mandate any particular technology, its mandated principles close the door for technologies that do not comply, and open the door for technologies that do. This article explores what SEDI makes technically possible, in compliance with SB 260 principles.</p><p>State-endorsed digital identity (SEDI) introduces numerous foundational principles for a government-sponsored digital identity system, several of which were covered in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/utah-blazes-new-trail-for-ssi-sedi-441d8ce65ab8">Utah Blazes New Trail for SSI:&nbsp;SEDI</a>:</p>  “Endorse” vs. “issue” and “identity” vs. “credential”  Sovereign control  Guardianship  Privacy &amp; no surveillance  State-of-the-art security  <p>This post explores more technical and security principles enabled by SEDI that will be of interest to digital identity&nbsp;experts.</p> “Autonomic” Identifiers <p>SEDI doesn’t mandate any specific technology stack, but it does specify capabilities that are simply unachievable for most digital identity technologies. One foundational example is the requirement in lines (73) — (77) of the <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0260.html">Utah bill</a>, that individuals must first bring their “identity” to the state, after which it can be endorsed.</p><p>What kind of “identity” might that be? That will be specified as the details of Utah’s future identity program are fleshed out. As a Utah citizen and as an outside expert invited to consult on these new identity policies, I will push for stringent minimum standards for the security, utility, privacy, and autonomy of a digital identity to qualify for state endorsement. Needless to say, your social media login — or even your bank login — should not&nbsp;suffice.</p><p>One “identity” that meets my preferred standard is an “Autonomic Identifier” or AID, as first described in Dr. Samuel Smith’s seminal paper: <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI).</p><p>Some of the capabilities enabled by an AID-powered SEDI ecosystem include:</p><p>BYOID (Bring Your Own Identifier) — In the digital realm, for an identity to be self sovereign, it must begin with a unique identifier that is under the sovereign control of an individual. When a state endorses an identity, in practice they are endorsing an identifier that an individual has brought to the state that is provably under the individual’s control.</p><p>Persistent Identifiers — When that individual moves their residence to another state (within the U.S., for example), necessitating a new identity endorsement from the new state, the old state can revoke their endorsement of the same identifier that the new state will be endorsing; the identifier is persistent. This is a KERI capability that is very different from most PKI-based systems where the identifier is a public key that is discarded upon rotation or revocation.</p><p>Reputation — This persistence creates a continuity for the individual to retain and build their digital reputation independent from any particular government endorsement. In fact, it would be inclusive of every endorsement they have ever had, and all their provable behaviors using those endorsements, no matter how many states or countries have given them past endorsements of identity. And it would be inclusive of non-state endorsements such as educational, work, or anything else,&nbsp;too.</p> Putting It All&nbsp;Together <p>A simple depiction of SEDI built on AIDs might look like&nbsp;this:</p><p>AIDs enable true self-sovereignty as the foundation, right where it belongs and where it provides the greatest utility for all aspects of digital life. State endorsement is also situated right where it belongs: as only one of many endorsements an individual may receive through their digital lifetime.</p> State-Issued ‘Jenga’ <p>Conversely, building digital identity on top of a state-issued credential instead of a state-endorsed identifier lasts only until the state revokes that credential. An attached academic credential, for example, is lost when the individual moves from one state to another and obtains a new identity in the new state, and the old state revokes the now-obsolete issuance.</p><p>Look at this visually:</p><p>This is like a game of Jenga: pull out the state-issued ID — by moving from one state or country to another — and the whole stack falls down. When the state revokes the ID they’ve issued, you also lose everything cryptographically bound to it, and must start&nbsp;over.</p><p>Even if the old state kept their credential alive, there is no binding between old and new credentials, no way to build a growing, persistent reputation that connects a person to their cross-boundary behaviors in the digital world the same way a consistent legal name connects their behaviors across boundaries in the physical&nbsp;world.</p> Human-Friendly? <p>Autonomic identifiers cannot be human-friendly. Human-friendly namespaces require human management, recurring cost, and have scarcity problems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting">cybersquatting</a>, or missing the opportunity to register Timothy.com or timothy@gmail; the 1,000th Timothy won’t have much of a selection. AIDs are long random strings of letters and numbers, and are so incredibly random it would take a million computers a million years to guess one, which ensures universal uniqueness and brings a strong measure of security.</p><p>AIDs have cryptographic properties, so we can prove control over them in the digital realm and recover control when keys are compromised. And keys *will* get compromised (see “Expected Compromise” below). Without these special mathematical properties, they’d be just letters and numbers anyone can copy and use to impersonate, like a social security&nbsp;number.</p> Many Identifiers <p>In real life, we have identifiers that are public — our legal names — that typically remain constant throughout our lives. We use these identifiers to build reputations over time, as patterns of behaviors accumulate that are associated with them. With SEDI, the identifier that is endorsed by the state will work in the same manner: it will be persistent, and as public as one chooses to make it, used and disclosed (always under the hood) whenever one might disclose their legal&nbsp;name.</p><p>In digital situations where one prefers to not use their legal name, there’s nothing in SEDI preventing that individual from using a completely different identifier, unrelated to their endorsed one. In fact there is no limit on how many different unique identifiers one may create and use for whatever purpose they choose; and each state can choose whether or not only one at a time can be officially endorsed (Utah allows only one physical identity at a time, and may do the same digitally).</p> Potential Security Advantages <p>SEDI’s architecture enables numerous critical security advantages that could be implemented:</p><p>Zero Trust — ”Never trust, always verify” is the ideal of zero trust. SEDI can not only embrace zero trust, it can enable true zero trust, which does away with all shared secrets, described briefly&nbsp;below.</p><p>No Shared Secrets — SEDI doesn’t employ bearer tokens, symmetric keys, or phishable passwords, unless they are used in conjunction with digital signatures. (Pins and passwords can be helpful when used in addition to digital signatures or physical&nbsp;keys)</p><p>Anti-fragile — A breach of one person or system does not facilitate the breach of the entire system or another connected one, as with most current digital identity systems, which are predicated on shared secrets and perimeter security. With SEDI, most breaches can be detectable, preventable, and recoverable.</p><p>Expected Compromise — Key compromise should be expected and anticipated — and not surprising and catastrophic — in addition to robust prevention and detection capabilities, bringing powerful means for recovery.</p><p>Multi-signature — Keys and credentials can be protected with m-of-n weighted multi-signature capabilities, enabling creative familial, professional, and social protection and recovery&nbsp;schemes.</p><p>Mutual authentication — Individuals could authenticate each other, in any setting. For example, a citizen could authenticate a police officer as readily as a police officer can authenticate the citizen. Any person, organization, or thing claiming authority from the state could be instantly verified to have the claimed authority.</p> Artificially Intelligent Agents (“Agentic AI”) <p>IBM predicts that 2025 may be “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-agents-2025-expectations-vs-reality">the year of the AI agent</a>”, and the CEO of Microsoft predicts that agentic AI will “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=satya+nadella+agentic+ai">replace all software</a>.” Whether that happens or not, AI agents are coming and will soon affect the way we interact with organizations of all kinds. This can take the form of you interacting with some organization’s agent, some organization interacting with your agent, or two AI agents interacting with each&nbsp;other.</p><p>SEDI paves the way for verifying that an AI agent has the delegated authority it claims to have, and constraining what an agent is authorized to do. SEDI enables authority to be delegated to people, organizations, and things, and AI agents are things. SEDI is uniquely well suited for controlling, securing, and navigating a world of ubiquitous AI&nbsp;agents.</p><p>Many don’t like the idea of having to deal with AI agents in any form, and I can’t blame them. But like the digital transformation itself, that world is coming whether we like it or not, and the more controls and constraints we can have for it, the&nbsp;better.</p> Comprehensive Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>In sum, SEDI enables a cohesive, comprehensive digital identity system for a state or for any other ecosystem. It requires no proprietary platforms, products, or providers, though it doesn’t preclude their participation, and requires no shared or trusted intermediaries or blockchains. Through robust guardianship, delegation, and multi-sig, it extends digital capabilities to populations that have been previously excluded: minors (including infants), the elderly, disabled persons, homeless persons, migrants, and any other population. And it does this while maximizing individual autonomy and control over one’s data, with powerful means for consent, and numerous breakthroughs in security.</p><p>In short, SEDI heralds a new era of utility, security and autonomy for comprehensive digital identity ecosystems, and I am proud of my home state of Utah for introducing it to the&nbsp;world.</p>

SB 260 will likely soon become the law in Utah, and with it the possibility of an exciting new era for self-sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>Passage of SB 260 is the partial realization of a dream I’ve had for more than a dozen years, since co-founding <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a> with Jason Law in 2012. It is not the complete realization of that dream, but it lays the necessary groundwork and carries with it momentum to go the distance over the next few&nbsp;years.</p><p>SB 260 does not call for the creation of a new identity system for the state of Utah — yet — that will be done later, hopefully in next year’s session. This bill establishes the principles Utah politicians stand behind — unanimously — that any future Utah statewide identity system must adhere to. If you are an SSI aficionado, you will recognize and love the principles in this&nbsp;bill.</p> Is State-Endorsed Identity (SEDI) Still&nbsp;SSI? <p>For some in the SSI community, the concept of SSI does not involve a state actor — at&nbsp;all.</p><p>To these SSI purists, SSI becomes trustworthy through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">web of trust</a> that replaces the need for a state actor as a root of trust. While theoretically possible — and still a worthwhile end-goal — this ideal vision of SSI isn’t feasible anytime soon. In the meantime, the credibility of government can help accelerate SSI toward an end-goal of not needing government. How? By making ubiquitous the technologies and ceremonies necessary for a web of trust to&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>At the end of the day, if independent control of strong digital identity rests fully with the individual, with no visibility by the state for if, how, or when it is used, then advocates of SSI should be in favor of SSI strengthened by a state endorsement. That is how physical identity works today and how digital identity should work, too. And there’s no reason other, non-government flavors of SSI can’t continue to develop and&nbsp;coexist.</p> State-Endorsed Digital Identity&nbsp;(SEDI) <p>The words “state-endorsed” used throughout this bill carry a lot of meaning; most emerging digital identity systems use the word “issue“ instead of “endorse”. This is a distinction with a profound difference.</p><p>In real life, does a state issue identity or endorse it? When a baby is born, who gives the baby its identifier, its name? The parents do. The state waits for parents to pick a name, puts the name into a certificate, endorses the certificate, then gives it to the parents. Parents determine identity, the state endorses&nbsp;it.</p><p>A couple months ago, a 60 year-old friend of mine decided to change her last name. The decision was hers alone to make, but her new name would not be believable or provable to third parties until she has an endorsement of the new name from the&nbsp;state.</p><p>In real life the state issues credentials, not identity. In this bill Utah acknowledges this reality and explicitly states that individuals first assert identity and only then can the state endorse it. That will be the guardrails for any future state-endorsed digital identity system. (See “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/sedi-details-for-identity-nerds-e1949af5cc30">SEDI Details for Identity Nerds</a>” for more&nbsp;info.)</p><p>Through SEDI, SB 260 codifies several foundational SSI principles:</p> Control <p>In lines (65) and (120), it is explicit that the individual is in control of their digital identity.</p> Guardianship &amp; Age Verification <p>Lines (35–40) and (97–98) lay the groundwork for digital guardianship, bringing broad digital capabilities for the first time to dependent populations such as children (including infants), the elderly, disabled persons, homeless persons, and&nbsp;more</p><p>Of particular note in Utah, digital guardianship is how age verification can work for all ages and capabilities, something Utah has been on the forefront of, policy-wise. In the future, guardianship could even work for animals and things,&nbsp;too.</p><p>See “<a href="https://libertas.institute/privacy/finally-a-path-forward-for-online-age-verification/">Finally, a Path Forward for Age Verification</a>” by the Libertas Institute for more info about how SB 260 could facilitate age verification.</p> Privacy &amp; No Surveillance <p>SB 260 is explicit that individuals have the right to not be surveilled. This means that SEDI cannot have any form of “phone home”, which differentiates it from the mobile drivers license (mDL) systems based on ISO 18013, and from the federated identity systems now being implemented in Europe and Australia, which all have inherent phone-home surveillance capabilities.</p><p>In lines (78–79), (84–96), (99–102), (116–117), (122–125), and (128–139) the bill details the principles of privacy and autonomy that must guide any future state-endorsed digital identity system in&nbsp;Utah.</p> State-of-the-Art Security <p>Line (113) stipulates that Utah SEDI must incorporate “state-of-the-art safeguards” for protecting identity. Current industry standards are not good enough, and in fact are unacceptably fragile in my view. My interpretation of “state-of-the-art” means something akin to KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), where breaches are preventable, detectable, and recoverable in ways that current identity standards cannot do, and which is quantum-resistant. (See the ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/sedi-details-for-identity-nerds-e1949af5cc30">Details for Nerds</a>’ for more details about security.)</p> Now the Work&nbsp;Begins <p>In some ways SB 260 is the end of a long, hard journey for me, and the partial realization of an audacious dream. In reality it’s one bill, in one state, that establishes the principles and guardrails for a future identity system without creating one&nbsp;today.</p><p>In any case, it’s the closest thing I’ve seen to true self-sovereign identity being officially and legally embraced at a significant level, an entire state of the United States. The next step is far harder: turning concepts into&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>For more technical information, see <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/sedi-details-for-identity-nerds-e1949af5cc30">SEDI Details for Identity&nbsp;Nerds</a>.</p>

<p>A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now but might not always be. In an article titled “Science Must Step Away From Nationally Managed Infrastructure,” Dan Goodman writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many scientists put huge efforts into building networks to communicate with colleagues and the general public. But all that work and the value in those networks was lost when many scientists felt compelled to leave following Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform (now X). The process of rebuilding on Bluesky is underway, but it will take years and may never reach the same critical mass. Even if the transition is successful, the same thing may happen to Bluesky in a few years.</p></blockquote>
<p>How can we prepare for a future migration from Bluesky to Mastodon? Bridgy Fed — a service that enables you to connect together your website, fediverse account and Bluesky account — will help. But Bridgy Fed needs to be easier to use. So I recruited Claude’s new Sonnet 7 model to do that.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Claude Code quietly becoming the best AI coding agent, Microsoft cutting AI data center investment, EA releases Red Alert code, developers don’t want GPUs, DeepSeek keeps open sourcing innovation, and a US DOGE software engineer forgets to make their GitHub account for work private.</p>  <p>Ads startup demands a lot &amp; offers little → struggles to hire. An adtech startup using AI to generate ads seeks a founding engineer who will devote their heart and soul – and most of their awake time – to the company, and is struggling to hire. They’re now offering a $50K (!!) referral bonus. Feels like a classic case of overlooking that hiring is a two-way street: most standout devs don’t want to work 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>  <p>Cloudflare’s self-critical, transparent postmortem. The leading content delivery network recently had its object storage go down for an hour, and only a day later published a detailed incident review, with the CEO personally taking responsibility for fixing the systemic issues which triggered the downtime. Clouflare is a refreshing exception for promptly sharing incident summaries, and showing it’s serious about continuously improving reliability.</p>  <p>More signs of “cutthroat” Big Tech. Google hints at a 60-hour workweek for workers in its AI group, and Meta fires 20 people for leaking internal information.</p>   1. Industry Pulse  Claude Code quietly becoming the best AI coding agent? <p>Anthropic lowkey launched <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a>, an agentic coding tool, recently. Feedback I’ve seen from engineers is that the tool is pretty good, with capabilities on par with other AI agents – including Devin (which costs $500/month).</p><p>Until now, Anthropic has built the best LLM for coding (Sonnet 3.5 and Sonnet 3.7). In hindsight, it was only a matter of time until they expanded by building an agentic coding tool that’s at least equal to what other startups offer. After all, most startups will build their agents on top of Sonnet 3.5 or 3.7, as well.</p><p>A criticism is that Claude Code <a href="https://x.com/sirjoeldean/status/1897493893358264453">is expensive</a>, which should not be that surprising because AI agents are much more compute-intensive to run than LLMs. I’ll reserve judgement, Anthropic could turn into a major dev tools company if they keep building AI coding tools like this.</p> Is Microsoft really cutting AI data center investment?

See the episode transcript at the top of this page, and a summary at the bottom.</p> Brought to You By   <p><a href="https://workos.com/">WorkOS</a> — The modern identity platform for B2B SaaS.</p>  <p><a href="https://engguidebook.com/#buy">The Software Engineer’s Guidebook</a>: Written by me (Gergely) – now out in audio form as well</p>  <p><a href="http://augmentcode.com/pragmatic">Augment Code</a> — AI coding assistant that pro engineering teams love</p>  <p>—</p> In This Episode <p>Not many people know that I have a brother: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/balintorosz">Balint Orosz</a>. Balint is also in tech, but in many ways, is the opposite of me. While I prefer working on backend and business logic, he always thrived in designing and building UIs. While I opted to work at more established companies, he struck out on his own and started his startup, Distinction. And yet, our professional paths have crossed several times: at one point in time I accepted an offer to join Skyscanner as a Principal iOS Engineer – and as part of the negotiation, I added a clause to my contrac that I will not report directly or indirectly to the Head of Mobile: who happened to be my brother, thanks to Skyscanner acquiring his startup the same month that Skyscanner made an offer to hire me.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa58007dd-d7cc-44b8-b233-5bbabe719845_872x572.png">          </a>The Orosz brothers: both of us are working in tech, and have had professional overlaps. Like this podcast episode! <p>Today, Balint is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a>, a beloved text editor known for its user-friendly interface and sleek design – an app that Apple awarded the prestigious Mac App of the Year in 2021.</p><p>In our conversation, we explore how Balint approaches building opinionated software with an intense focus on user experience. We discuss the lessons he learned from his time building Distinction and working at Skyscanner that have shaped his approach to Craft and its development.</p><p>In this episode, we discuss:</p>  <p>Balint’s first startup, Distinction, and his time working for Skyscanner after they acquired it</p>  <p>A case for a balanced engineering culture with both backend and frontend priorities</p>  <p>Why Balint doesn’t use iOS Auto Layout</p>  <p>The impact of Craft being personal software on front-end and back-end development</p>  <p>The balance between customization and engineering fear in frontend work</p>  <p>The resurgence of local-first software and its role in modern computing</p>  <p>The value of building a physical prototype</p>  <p>How Balint uses GenAI to assist with complicated coding projects</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>Design-focused engineers find it harder to fit in. Engineers who focus on backend and distributed systems can usually verbalize their impact clearer, and could see faster career growth – including getting into leadership positions. This creates a reinforcing cycle: as most engineering executives have a backend engineering background: they will recognize and reward backend contributions more.</p><p>Balint didn’t like how he didn’t “fit in” as an engineer focused on design and UI: but he just kept building things he believed in – and years later, building up that “design muscle” helps him build products that backend-focused engineers might struggle in putting together.</p><p>Amazing companies cannot have a single engineering culture. Balint observed how every standout company that has a single engineering culture inherently biases towards either a backend-heavy engineering culture (e.g. Google, Amazon) or a UI-heavy one (Apple). For a company to be truly standout – more so than these Big Tech giants – it needs to have several engineering cultures: prioritizing both backend and UI excellence. This is what Craft is aiming to do internally.</p><p>To build something better than most other products: you might need to take a different approach. Craft does not use Apple’s UI components: they don’t use SwiftUI or Autolayout – something that 95% or more of iOS apps all take advantage of.</p><p>Craft, instead, built their own components from scratch, and came up with their own layout and animations system. This is a lot more work at first: but it’s how Craft can do smooth animations that most apps are unable to do so – and it’s a reason engineers at Apple have asked the team “how are you able to do such a smooth animation on the navigation bar?” (The native iOS navigation bar cannot be animated like Craft does it) Craft can do all this thanks to building and maintaining their own components. It’s simpler to do than most would assume: in the episode, we look at actual code.</p><p>A shared codebase is an underrated advantage for speed, consistency and efficiency. Craft has a total of 4 engineers building the respective apps for:</p>  <p>iOS</p>  <p>iPad</p>  <p>MacOS</p>  <p>VisionOS</p>  <p>They can do this, because it’s a single codebase! A single codebase also means that all features built on one platform immediately work on all others.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/hackathons">The AI hackathon at Craft Docs</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-career-paths">Engineering career paths at Big Tech and scaleups</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thriving-as-a-founding-engineer">Thriving as a Founding Engineer: lessons from the trenches</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-past-and-future-of-backend-practices">The past and future of modern backend practices</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=133s">02:13</a>) What it’s like being a UX-focused founder</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=540s">09:00</a>) Why it was hard to gain recognition at Skyscanner</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=792s">13:12</a>) Takeaways from Skyscanner that Balint brought to Craft</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1010s">16:50</a>) How frameworks work and why they aren’t always a good fit</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1235s">20:35</a>) An explanation of iOS Auto Layout and its pros and cons</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1393s">23:13</a>) Why Balint doesn’t use Auto Layout</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1463s">24:23</a>) Why Craft has one code base</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1666s">27:46</a>) Craft’s unique toolbar features and a behind the scenes peek at the code</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1995s">33:15</a>) Why frontend engineers have fear around customization</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2231s">37:11</a>) How Craft’s design system differs from most companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2553s">42:33</a>) Behaviors and elements Craft uses rather than having a system for everything</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2652s">44:12</a>) The back and frontend architecture in building personal software</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2891s">48:11</a>) Shifting beliefs in personal computing</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3015s">50:15</a>) The challenges faced with operating system updates</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3048s">50:48</a>) The resurgence of local-first software</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3151s">52:31</a>) The value of opinionated software for consumers</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3330s">55:30</a>) Why Craft’s focus is on the user’s emotional experience</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3410s">56:50</a>) The size of Craft’s engineering department and platform teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3560s">59:20</a>) Why Craft moves faster with smaller teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3686s">1:01:26</a>) Balint’s advice for frontend engineers looking to demonstrate value</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3875s">1:04:35</a>) Balint’s breakthroughs using GenAI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=4070s">1:07:50</a>) Why Balint still writes code</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=4184s">1:09:44</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Design-first engineering: less recognition?   <p>Balint has been writing code since he was 12. He’s always had a pull towards interactivity, animation, and found himself in the intersection of code and design.</p>  <p>Backend engineering is much easier to quantify than UI/UX work. Balint always felt that backend engineering was easier to quantify in impact – like saving millions in infrastructure costs or scaling to billions of users. How do you quantify that the UI is smooth and delightful?</p>  <p>Balint always felt that "hardcore engineers" did not consider him one of them – as his focus was on UX and UI – like making interactions faster, and animations smoother, and not on distributed systems or scalable algorithms. But designers and product managers also didn’t look at him as equals.</p>  <p>There’s a pull for engineers to move towards the backend and distributed systems. Exactly because these areas are seen as having hard problems to solve and are often more measurable in terms of impact.</p>     Engineering culture at Craft   <p>Craft started off as a text editor for mobile use. When starting to code the product, Balint didn't believe that established engineering patterns, code coverage, or even design components would be the right approach.</p>  <p>Principles in building craft:</p>  <p>Data principles: efficiency and zero data loss are both non-negotiatble. There’s not much to innovate in this area – it’s very well understood! Just refine the existing state of the art.</p>  <p>Fluency. Craft is designed to be used for hours each day, so it needs to feel snappy and fluent.</p>    <p>Having just one engineering culture is not enough. To create an amazing product, you cannot have either frontend or backend engineering principles dominate:</p>  <p>When the dominant engineering culture is UI-first: Apple is a good example. Apple builds delightful user experiences. However, their backend systems and web products are lacking.</p>  <p>When the dominant engineering culture is backend-first: Amazon and Google are good examples. Both focus on system design and backend engineering principles – in return their UIs don't feel as comfortable.</p>    <p>Craft uses the same codebase across 4 platforms: iOS, iPad, MacOS (desktop), and Vision Pro. 99% of the code is common, with some additional native bindings for each platform. Why the same codebase? Balint wanted the desktop app to always do the same thing as the mobile app, and a shared code base was the best way to do it.</p>   Team structure   <p>Craft's product engineering team is around 20 people. This includes product engineering, design, and QA.</p>  <p>They are split into a platform team, which means they have a web team, a native app team, and a backend team. Each of those teams has three to four people.</p>  <p>Balint observed that teams with more than 5 people start to have communications issues</p>   Architecture choices   <p>Prioritize control over abstractions and trends. Using core language patterns and framework elements gives you more control over what you want to do. High-level abstractions and frameworks require more time figuring out the bugs and what those frameworks allow or disallow.</p>  <p>Everything is a canvas. Craft treats everything as a canvas that they draw on. This allows building toolbars that look exactly like a Mac toolbar on the Mac and an iOS toolbar on the iPhone. However, Craft now has more control over these components than if they used the native ones.</p>  <p>Avoiding AutoLayout and SwiftUI. Every time Craft hires a new iOS engineer, the new joiner inevitably asks them why they don't use new technologies like AutoLayout or SwiftUI. Balint shows them one of their transitions and asks them to implement it with the same performance in AutoLayout – and if they can succeed, they’ll move over. So far, no one has managed: but it’s a good exercise to help understand that decisions are not arbitrary, but are following practical purposes.</p>  <p>AutoLayout promises that you no longer need to think in rectangles; you can just say it should be at the top and it can automatically grow. However, when you keep adding more things, the complexity increases and when you want to do something more sophisticated, it can become very performance-intensive.</p>  <p>With AutoLayout, you are trading off easier definition and work as a developer for more complexity on the device and less control when you want to do more advanced animations.</p>       Principles for personal software   <p>“How it makes me feel” matters more. When it comes to personal software, consumers choose a lot more on which one they feel resonates with them. Thus the best personal software is a lot more opinionated than B2B software is</p>  <p>Craft is aiming to build what Visual Studio Code is for engineers – Craft aiming to do the same for knowledge workers. Visual Studio Code feels lightweight and is a fresh breath of air because it's responsive, fast, and does everything you need.</p>  <p>A different take on design systems.</p>  <p>Most companies create an “atomic design system:” starting with base colours as atoms, then buttons that combine colors and shapes as components, and then building up from here.</p>  <p>Craft, instead, has systems for animation. They have an animation engine and library that synchronizes everything across everyone and they enforce usage of that.</p>     A local-first approach   <p>New technologies emerge on the server side. When you're dealing with personal software, the amount of content you're dealing with can fit on the user's device. A lot of the compute can be done locally.</p>  <p>Craft’s architecture is preparing for local-first approaches. They architected components so they can replace them with local or remote components anytime they decide it’s now possible to do so.</p>  <p>An example is search: instead of having a big elastic search cluster, they are looking at having 2 million search indexes on a disk in the cloud. Every time somebody does a search, they can either download that search index locally and use it there to execute the search, or a Lambda or serverless function can just read the search index.</p>    <p>The industry keeps swinging between cloud and local compute.</p>  <p>There is a new wave of personal computing powered by processors getting faster. The M4 Pro is a faster processor than anything you can buy on an AWS cloud.</p>  <p>Eventually, people will get tired of their personal computers holding them back and they’ll appreciate server-side components working faster. After a while, they will then start to get annoyed about how much the server-side project costs… and the pendulum keeps swinging</p>  <p>Local-first is experiencing a comeback because people are starting to travel again. It gets inconvenient when you need something badly, with poor connection – and you cannot access it.</p>    <p>Where to find Balint Orosz:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/balintorosz">https://x.com/balintorosz</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/balintorosz/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/balintorosz/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Craft: <a href="https://www.craft.do/">https://www.craft.do/</a></p><p>• Skyscanner: <a href="https://www.skyscanner.com/">https://www.skyscanner.com/</a></p><p>• Flash: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash</a></p><p>• Shader: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader</a></p><p>• Understanding Auto Layout: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html</a></p><p>• Mac Catalyst: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/</a></p><p>• Apple M1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1</a></p><p>• Elasticsearch: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch</a></p><p>• The Cloud Is a Prison.

<p>Hi – this is Gergely with the monthly, free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. If you’ve been forwarded this email, you can <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about">subscribe here</a>.</p><p>The most-frequently cited article I’ve ever written is still <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/">The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries in the Netherlands and Europe</a> – which is a deepdive published back in 2021. At the time, I had recently left my engineering manager job at Uber, and was trying to understand how tech compensation really works. At Uber in Amsterdam, I saw that comp for senior software engineering positions was 2-5x higher than for most “local” senior roles. </p><p>To find out why this gap exists, I gathered hundreds of data points and talked with dozens of recruiters and managers; was this comp gap a symptom of “bimodal” distribution, as Daan Luu <a href="https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com">posted</a> in 2016? After researching, I felt confident enough to say that tech compensation in the Netherlands and Europe was trimodal:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b8ae313-ab32-494a-abac-728b3b895ff6_1456x1031.png">          </a>High-level overview. “$X” varies per country and region, but trends are international <p>Last year, we returned to this topic in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">The Trimodal nature of tech compensation revisited</a>, which validated the distribution by using more than 1,000 data points from the Dutch market, and quotes from engineering leaders and software engineers in the US, UK, Canada, and Japan, which suggested that a “trimodal” model is real. Even so, this was partly anecdotal and in need of hard data to confirm it.</p><p>Today, we finally have the numbers, thanks to the <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Booking.com,ING,Miro&amp;track=Software%20Engineer">Levels.fyi</a> team,, and this article dives into the findings by region, covering:</p>  <p>US: entry-level software engineers. Categorizing the three tiers of compensation bands, based on 5,601 data points.</p>  <p>US: senior software engineers. More Tier 2 and 3 offers are at least twice as big as the Tier 1 median, based on 9,509 data points.</p>  <p>Best-paying US companies by tier. Hedge funds, top scaleups, and Big Tech lead the pack – with companies like Roku, MongoDB and Dropbox also ranking high.</p>  <p>UK numbers, tiers, and best-paying companies. Hedge funds and finance companies lead, with Stripe, Confluent, and BP also making it to the top 10, based on 6,219 data points.</p>  <p>India numbers and tiers. Rippling, Stripe, Uber, Coinbase, Atlassian, Broadcom, and LinkedIn, offer ₹1 crore-or-above packages for senior engineers ($118K and up), based on 2,078 data points</p>  <p>Note on equity. Startups and scaleups may offer more in total compensation than publicly traded companies, but equity in not-yet-public companies comes with risk.</p>  <p>The data on the US, UK, and India reveals a complex regional picture united by a trimodal model. See below:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae2bd5fc-3935-41ba-843b-37fadfed5fa5_1616x780.png">          </a>Three “tiers” in the US data.

They offer <a href="https://levels.fyi/services/resume/">resume review</a> and<a href="https://levels.fyi/services/"> salary negotiation services</a> with Big Tech recruiters. A neat feedback loop of this is that information from their salary negotiation services helps the team ensure that submitted data really is valid. Levels.fyi also has a<a href="https://levels.fyi/jobs"> job board</a> and provides <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/offerings/data/">compensation benchmarking services</a> for businesses.</p><p>Some stats about Levels.fyi:</p>  <p>2.5 million visitors per month</p>  <p>20,000 new data points added per month, on average</p>  <p>$100M: total value of increased comp offers achieved with its <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/services/reviews.html">compensation negotiation service</a> – not including raises negotiated by candidates using the site ad-hoc for comparison.</p>  <p>A team of 13 people is behind the site and app, and I recently grabbed coffee with several of them in San Francisco.</p><p>This article covers “total compensation” (TC), not only salary. TC includes all forms of annual comp:</p>  <p>Base salary</p>  <p>Cash bonus, or the cash bonus target of companies that share this information</p>  <p>Value of equity vested</p>  <p>For example, a $300K TC package might look like this:</p>  <p>$175K base salary</p>  <p>Plus $25K target bonus</p>  <p>Plus $100K in equity vesting over the first year (typically $400K vested over 4 years, with $100K vesting each year)</p>  <p>Equity is a tricky topic but also a key one, more on which is in the “Note on equity” section near the foot of this article.</p> 1. US: entry-level software engineers <p>Let’s start with entry-level software engineer offers submitted to <a href="http://levels.fyi">Levels.fyi</a> in the past year for the world’s biggest tech market. Here’s how these data points were filtered:</p>  <p>“Software Engineer” submissions</p>  <p>Offer date between 1 Jan 2024 and 1 Jan 2025</p>  <p>Years of experience: between 0 and 2</p>  <p>Region: US</p>  <p>Years at company: 0. This means we look at new offers, not existing employees’ comp changes at their current workplaces</p>  <p>We have 5,601 entry-level US data points after applying the filters. A visualization:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F438d619b-ea5d-4ffa-9f45-290c98d2537e_1600x732.png">          </a>5,601 entry-level software engineering offers in the US, visualized <p>At first sight, this distribution fits what looks more like a bimodal distribution, with a first peak at $100-110k, and a second peak at $170-180k:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1197426d-ef54-4132-8a9c-0515fde40d78_1600x796.png">          </a>Comp distribution has twin “local maximum” peaks <p>However, after sifting through the data and manually tagging companies by common traits, we find the data organizes itself differently. The chart below takes the same data and organizes it based on the assumption behind the original trimodal distribution: that companies compensate based on the market they compete in. We use three categories of business type:</p>  <p>Big Tech. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Netflix, alongside publicly traded, large tech companies competing with them, like Uber, Snap, and Pinterest</p>  <p>Top scaleups and hedge funds. Late-stage startups backed by well-known VCs that have not gone public, or IPOed only very recently. Plus hedge funds, and quantitative trading firms (quant)</p>  <p>Everyone else. startups, privately owned companies, and “traditional” ones</p>  <p>Here’s how the same data looks when broken down into these categories:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d0b53d-b55e-493d-852a-a4c2e8618e20_1600x732.png">          </a>Segmenting the data by three tiers <p>Now, let’s check each segment.</p> Tier 1: Everyone else <p>This category consists mainly of companies competing for local talent, which often are not driven by their engineering talent or digital products.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb1be272-60b0-448c-b6c8-c1b56bd9f6c9_1600x732.png">          </a>Distribution of the “everyone else” category: 3,262 data points (58% of total). Median: $105K, 75th percentile: $130K <p>This resembles the lowest tier (“Tier 1”) of the trimodal model. It’s interesting how drastically the distribution changes by removing Big Tech, top scaleup, and hedge fund data points!</p> Tier 2: Big Tech  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffad56830-433d-4e87-963c-4aaf176f45ab_1600x732.png">          </a>Big Tech. 1,914 data points (34% of all data). Median: $180K, 75th percentile: $203K <p>The largest publicly traded tech companies compensate engineers with increasingly large equity packages up the career ladder. I split this category for two reasons:</p>  <p>Commonly referenced. The terms “FAANG” and “Big Tech” are frequently their own category, and benchmarks for other companies’ offers.</p>  <p>Industry-leading comp. It’s hard to find bigger liquid compensation offers than this group offers. Later, we see it’s possible to win higher illiquid comp offers at not-yet-public scaleups, and some hedge funds can top what Big Tech offers.</p>   Tier 3: Top scaleups and hedge funds  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65758d28-0944-460c-aa01-56e391374a90_1600x732.png">          </a>Top scaleups and hedge funds, based on 493 data points (8% of all data). Median: $208K, 75th percentile: $247K <p>This is a very interesting category with a lack of high-quality data, outside of Levels.fyi, for two reasons:</p><p>Private scaleups issue not-yet-liquid equity. Many assume Big Tech companies offer the most, compensation-wise. And this is true in terms of liquid equity; shares that can be sold for cash is an area where Big Tech is near-impossible for scaleups to match.</p><p>However, top-tier startups and scaleups can – and do – offer more total compensation than Big Tech. But there’s a catch: their equity cannot be sold until a liquidity event happens like an IPO, or stock buyback. Scaleups which out-offer Big Tech in total comp include <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/databricks/salaries">Databricks</a> and <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/openai/salaries">OpenAI</a>.</p><p>It makes sense for late-stage scaleups to make bigger total comp offers than Big Tech because they target the same talent and must compensate for the fact their equity grants are illiquid, and may not become convertible to cash any time soon. Plus, there’s also the risk of a grant losing value like at Foursquare, where employees’ stock options <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-private-tech-company-that-let-employee-stock-grants-evaporate">ended up as worthless</a>.</p><p>Hedge funds are notoriously secretive. Places like <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/two-sigma/salaries">Two Sigma</a> want to keep their compensation details as confidential as possible. Levels.fyi has accurate data points, but not enough to make this group into its own category. So, they’re included with scaleups here.</p><p>The compensation philosophy of hedge funds is very different than at Big Tech and scaleups:</p>  <p>No equity: hedge funds do not issue equity, even though this element is almost always what makes Big Tech and scaleup compensation packages standout</p>  <p>Large cash bonuses: instead, hedge funds award hefty end-of-year bonuses, of up to 100% of annual salary. Hedge funds are the only category of company offering more liquid compensation than Big Tech and some scaleups. At the same time, hedge funds hire a lot less frequently</p>   Overlapping categories <p>Let’s look at all three categories of employer in a single graph:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fda2b5d-8bfd-4896-83ba-789ac92258e9_1600x798.png">          </a>All entry-level compensation data points, split into categories <p>And also let’s check out the median and 75th percentile total compensation packages of each category:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70750922-ac38-4b5b-9ff5-be4ca13f1b1d_1236x684.png">          </a>Data points for each category <p>There are a few interesting points about this distribution:</p>  <p>~2x difference between Tier 1 and 3. Tier 2 and 3 companies pay around 2x as much at the 50th and 75th percentiles than Tier 1 does. Tier 2 (Big Tech) is a lot closer to Tier 3 in TC. The 75th percentile of Tier 1 still doesn’t come close to the 50th percentile of Tier 2</p>  <p>Overlap from Tier 1 into Tier 2. The highest Tier 1 offers – at around the 90th-95th percentiles – do reach up to $200K, which is near the median range of tiers 2 and 3</p>  <p>Tiers 2 and 3 overlap a lot. The only real difference between Tier 2 and Tier 3 is that there are much more Big Tech data points in the sample. This could indicate a bias in user submissions towards Big Tech, or that scaleups and hedge funds hire far fewer entry-level engineers in the US</p>   2. US: senior software engineers <p>Compensation differences tend to grow with seniority, so let’s look at senior-and-above software engineers by adjusting the filters:</p>  <p>“Software Engineer” submissions</p>  <p>Offer date in the last 3 years (between 1 Jan 2022 and 1 Jan 2025)</p>  <p>Experience: 5 years minimum</p>  <p>Region: US</p>  <p>Years at company: 0. Similar to before, we only look at new offers</p>  <p>Let’s see how the same three categories map when looking at senior software engineers, split across the same tiers:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F800a878e-7f2b-4f3b-952e-a6999b896182_1600x775.png">          </a>All senior-and-above engineer compensation data points by category.

Some observations:</p>  <p>Tier 1 (everyone else): this category has the most data points (53% of the total). Also, while the median of this tier is significantly below the other two categories, there is overlap at the 75th and 90th percentiles. Simply put, it’s possible to earn as much in this group as in Big Tech, but it’s harder to do.</p>  <p>Tier 2 (Big Tech): compensation spread is very wide, starting from around $100K, all the way to $600K and above. This indicates the median value is less important, and things like career level, the specific company, and negotiation, could all matter more.</p>  <p>Tier 3 (top scaleups and hedge funds): this overlaps with Big Tech, and its top end goes even further. Also, there is far less data for this category, suggesting that these companies hire significantly fewer staff than Big Tech does, as mentioned above.</p>  <p>Outliers: these are much more distinct at the senior level, compared to the entry-level tier distribution</p>  <p>Big Tech and scaleups+hedge funds have many outliers. The median entry-level Tier 1 compensation package was $105K – and there were few offers in tiers 2 and 3 that offered twice as much ($200K and above.) The median senior Tier 1 compensation was $180K, but now there are far more offers in tiers 1 and 2 worth double that ($350K and above).

It feels like two tiers might be coupled here, based on the midpoint of the graph having several local maximums: £100K ($126K), around £125K ($158K), and circa £150K ($190K). I’d assume that if we split up Big Tech, the top scaleups+hedge funds, and everyone else, we’d see two distinct tiers. Still, it is US-HQ’d companies that offer the most comp to senior software engineers.</p>  <p>Like the US, the UK has hedge funds that offer as much – or more – than Big Tech. These firms are all based in London, often with offices in New York. This is the first time I’ve seen it broken down like this.</p>  <p>UK, but not US or UK-headquartered, are similar. The medians and 75th percentiles of these categories are almost the same. Non-US, non-UK HQed companies simply have fewer data points.</p>  <p>The data is likely to overrepresent US-HQ’d companies. It would seem there are more US-based companies employing software engineers in the UK, than UK-headquartered ones do. However, based on my understanding of the market this is incorrect: in reality, a lot more UK-based companies employ software engineers than US-based ones, but the data currently biases towards US-HQ’d companies.</p>  <p>My sense is that for the UK, the real three tiers are those <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">previously discussed</a>:</p>  <p>Tier 1: local market, meaning most UK HQ’d companies</p>  <p>Tier 2: startups and scaleups targeting the top of the local market.

Let’s take two compensation packages: one with a TC of $475K, and one with $423K. Which is better? It seems like $475K is clearly bigger, but some extra context is needed. The $240K package is from Rippling, a scaleup that is not yet publicly traded:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3443bf37-4796-47bd-ab75-11cd6011c56b_1600x398.png">   </a>A $475K package at Rippling. See the <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/offer/039e4d4a-a659-4408-91ec-ed9f2895b70a">original submission</a> <p>The $423K package is from Uber:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e380cd2-ee0f-4cce-b9ea-cf25ab363e4b_1600x398.png">   </a>A $423K package at Uber. See the <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/offer/ab7e12f5-7427-41e4-95a6-2169de3a477b">original submission</a> <p>The big difference between them is that at Uber, an engineer can sell their stock as soon as it vests, (usually, quarterly) if they wish. By doing so, they earn $423K worth of liquid compensation in the first year. At Rippling, the liquid compensation will be $335K ($240K in base salary and $85K bonus target), and equity can only be sold if and when a liquidity event occurs, such as:</p>  <p>Rippling organizes a secondary offer and allows employees to sell some stock. This usually happens with oversubscribed fundraising events</p>  <p>Rippling goes public. In this case, employees can sell their vested stock after a lockup period of around 6 months</p>  <p>Rippling is acquired and the buyer pays for employees’ stocks</p>  <p>For private companies, the big questions are when will equity become liquid, and how much will it be worth.</p><p>It’s worth remembering stock prices change, which makes equity compensation volatile. In 2022, we covered how <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/51386866/stock-price-woes-and-attrition">this can lead to compensation woes</a>. At the time, tech stocks like Stitch Fix, Redfin, and Zoom, dropped 50-80% in 12 months. At the same time, companies like NVIDIA, Tesla, and Apple, saw 50-100% stock price growth. Compensation packages for people working in the former group dropped significantly, while the latter group saw major increases. A $350K TC package became worth $510K at NVIDIA, and $231K at Stitch Fix:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0aeae87-2faa-4e54-ae42-ad1c0cf892be_1244x1344.png">          </a>Equity can be volatile, and equity-heavy packages similarly so.

It’s enabled us to visualize compensation distribution and tiers across international labor markets.</p><p>Levels.fyi gives free access to its compensation data points, and relies on users sharing their comp numbers. If you’ve gotten value out of this article, please consider <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/salaries/add">submitting the comp details of your current position</a>; this lets the site provide fresh, data-backed insights, like in this deepdive.</p><p>My biggest takeaways:</p><p>The US is unique in having a tier above Big Tech. Across the UK, India, and in the Netherlands, the highest compensation tier (Tier 3) is Big Tech. So it’s a surprise to learn there’s an even higher tier that exists only in the US. Hedge funds, quant firms, and top scaleups can pay more than the likes of Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, etc, with two important caveats:</p>  <p>At top scaleups, bigger-than-Big-Tech comp packages are usually reserved for workers already in Big Tech, who would not switch jobs for an illiquid TC package unless it exceeds their current, liquid one.</p>  <p>Hedge funds and quant firms seem like a different world. Switching between Big Tech and these companies looks harder to do, and happens less often than moving between Big Tech and scaleups.</p>  <p>US-HQ’d companies tend to pull up markets outside the US. Among tier 3 companies <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">in the Netherlands</a>, 95% of those which I know are US-headquartered, and the data shows this is also the case in the UK and India.</p><p>Higher-tier companies come with downsides. These workplaces pay more, but usually operate with a <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/">“Silicon Valley-style” engineering culture</a>: they expect a lot more in terms of autonomy, taking on product, DevOps, and testing work, and working longer hours – especially when collaborating with overseas teams. Adjusting to this can be tough if you’ve never worked in such an environment. Vice-versa, it can also be challenging to swap this pattern for a more traditional, hierarchical workplace.</p><p>Meanwhile, work stress can actually be higher at Tier 2 and Tier 3 companies, as covered in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146208867/tier-and-realities">part 2 of the Trimodal series</a>.</p><p>Today’s job market is a lot tougher than previously, and it’s harder to get into top-tier companies. In this deepdive, we’ve looked closely at the top tiers across several markets. With the job market tightening up, there are more qualified candidates than ever, and this can affect the size of offers. So, if you’re in the job market, I would not treat the numbers in this article as concrete and immovable. Instead, just focus on performing well in interviews, and getting an offer. Then these figures might be helpful in the negotiation phase.</p><p>Compensation is not everything; it’s just what is easiest to measure and make comparisons with, but there’s more to a job than the pay alone. Here’s what I used to think matters:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f501119-12dd-476d-ab9f-d9314a161099_1364x860.png">          </a>A way to think about a career <p>But is this all there is? I no longer think so. Other factors also make a job into a dream or a daily struggle:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14e4e532-85a6-4701-832f-066bb3d87255_1456x944.png">          </a>Less quantifiable, but still very important, aspects of a career <p>If you’ve gotten value out of this data-based article, why not contribute to the wealth of knowledge about global tech compensation by anonymously sharing <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/salaries/add">your current compensation</a> with Levels.fyi. I hope you’ve found the additional data points useful, especially the expanded details on the US, UK, and India.</p><p>For more on tech comp, check out other deepdives:</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/tech-compensation">Senior-and-above compensation in tech</a> (2024)</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/compensation-at-tech-companies">Compensation at publicly traded tech companies</a> (2023)</p>  <p><a href="https://www.levels.fyi/blog/software-internship-salaries.html">The trimodal nature of software internship salaries</a> (research by Levels.fyi, 2024)</p>  <p><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/">The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries in the Netherlands and Europe</a> (Part 1, 2021)</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">The trimodal nature of tech compensation revisited</a> (Part 2, 2024)</p>

<p>Emil Lundberg and I have published the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-lundberg-cose-two-party-signing-algs/">COSE Algorithms for Two-Party Signing</a> specification.  Its abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers used when the signing operation is performed cooperatively between two parties. When performing two-party signing, the first party typically hashes the data to be signed and the second party signs the hashed data computed by the first party. This can be useful when communication with the party holding the signing private key occurs over a limited-bandwidth channel, such as NFC or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), in which it is infeasible to send the complete set of data to be signed. The resulting signatures are identical in structure to those computed by a single party, and can be verified using the same verification procedure without additional steps to preprocess the signed data.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A motivating use case for this is for WebAuthn/FIDO2 Authenticators to use when signing application data, as described in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/pull/2078">proposed WebAuthn signing extension</a>.  Parts of this spec’s content were previously in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bradleylundberg-cfrg-arkg/">Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) algorithm</a> spec, which we’ve also been updated.</p>
<p>I plan to talk about the spec during <a href="https://www.ietf.org/meeting/122/">IETF 122 in Bangkok</a>.  I hope to see many of you there!</p>

Symbolic representation of Web Security applied to&nbsp;SSI.<p>Many children in Europe grew up with the tales of Baron Münchhausen, who claims to have lifted himself and his horse out of a mire by pulling his own hair. The image is so powerful because the problem of the circular dependency is so clearly visible. In real life, circular dependencies are often far less&nbsp;obvious.</p><p>Which is why the <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-over-before-it-started-661b4b0dbdc6">first article</a> in this series was primarily focused on looking behind the SSI smoke and mirrors around Web based identifiers and communication protocols. The resulting discussions in the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web Of Trust (RWOT)</a> community were quite enlightening, and included a deeper look at the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Technical+Specifications">EU Digital Identity Wallet Technical specifications</a>.</p><p>One of the mirrors basically broke when claims of OpenID4VC supporting decentralized identifiers were shattered when someone pointed out that while the EU Wallet is marketed on digital sovereignty and privacy, but in reality does not <a href="https://github.com/openid/federation-wallet/issues/43#issuecomment-2539862593">does not allow decentralized identifiers</a>:</p>The current EUDI approach: No decentralized identifiers allowed<p>So while it was clear that OpenID4VC and did:web* do not qualify as decentralized, Self-Sovereign Identity, some people advocated to just embrace the false marketing in the hope that it would create wider acceptance and the appearance of adoption for&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>But has that approach ever really&nbsp;worked?</p><p>More often this kind of “sovereignwashing” appears to run a high risk of creating false expectations, disappointment. Which would ultimately cement the status quo of the federated platform identity lock-in for the next 20 years. As a community we should focus on building actual decentralized identifiers, communication protocols, and applications.</p><blockquote>Because the true social and economic value of SSI is not just in the identity layer itself, it is in the decentralized applications enabled as a&nbsp;result.</blockquote><p>Some of which would be in direct competition to the champions of the platform age, who are investing their financial and political capital into OpenID4VC and Web based identifiers to prevent that competition from ever getting off the ground. A classic “old industry vs new technologies” battle.</p><p>There are real opportunity costs across most of economy and society if the old encumbents manage to postpone or kill innovation.</p>Symbolic representation of eIDAS 2.0 after successful lobbying by the platforms and trust intermediaries Security and privacy for a globally networked society <p>Technology and corresponding security have been head to head in a special kind of race for a long time, dating back to an Egyptian inscription around 1900 BC in the main chamber of the tomb of Khnumhotep II, over Julius Caesar using a ROT-3 cypher in 100 BC, all the way to the famous Enigma machine used in World War II. The more people potentially had access to a message, the harder the encryption had to&nbsp;become.</p><p>The encryption used by Julius Caesar was not particularly strong, because it relied on a supposedly secret algorithm. Once parties know the secret, encryption and decryption become trivial. Over time this moved to well-known algorithms using shared secrets. And even though the shared secrets are more complex on today’s internet, this fundamental principle hasn’t&nbsp;changed:</p><blockquote>If you know the shared secret, and can intercept the encrypted message, you will be able to read, and also impersonate and falsify communication.</blockquote><p>In contrast, Engima was quite strong for its day because it combined a rotating cypher with a codebook that was famously carried by U-Boats allowing them to choose the correct settings. Literally handed over to the commander of the boat by hand in a secure location before departure, these code books effectively represented a cryptographic key, shared over a second channel — the physical handover.</p><p>Which makes any well-designed encryption system almost impossible to break. Unless, of course, you have intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the rotating cypher, and can guess certain messages, like weather reports, to then use brute force to arrive back at the settings for the day. Those settings then allowed to read other messages, which would otherwise have been unbreakable.</p>Digital identity should be based on an&nbsp;advance<p>In other words: The cryptography of the Enigma machine itself was solid, and essentially unbroken. But the Allied Forces were able to exploit structural weaknesses designed into the operation of Engima to attack the key generation for the&nbsp;day.</p> Security in Swiss Healthcare <p>That particular race accelerated when the Internet was born. In 1996, when the internet was still young, the US Congress deliberated and passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). That same year, the <a href="https://www.fmh.ch/">Swiss Medical Association (FMH)</a>, realized patient data had to be better secured on the internet, leading to the creation of <a href="https://hin.ch">Health Info Net (HIN)</a>. Starting from encrypted email, Swiss doctors have relied on HIN for decades to keep their patient data&nbsp;safe.</p><p>But technology years are a lot like dog years. And 28 years is a very long&nbsp;time.</p><p>HIN is constantly working to innovate and improve its solutions. Which is how <a href="https://vereign.com">Vereign</a>, working closely with our partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/more-than-bits-gmbh">More than Bits</a>, started to run some POCs with HIN in 2023, and ended up working all of 2024 almost exclusively for the Swiss healthcare sector.</p><blockquote>Our challenge: Design a system that starts from what today’s users are used to, while re-thinking the system architecture using SSI and modern data ecosystem architectures, based on the work we had done for&nbsp;Gaia-X.</blockquote><p>The starting point was obvious: Email is the world’s largest distributed identity database and communication protocol. It is the use case with which HIN started, and it is the singular product that all users rely on mutliple times each day to communicate with colleagues, laboratories, and patients.</p><p>Email is also facing challenges of concentration and capture by the large, federated platforms. And its lack of an identity layer has made it a fertile ground for attacks by malicious governments, corporations, and common criminals.</p><p>Vereign showcased its first prototype to harden email using SSI in 2019, which earned us a nomination as the hottest new innovation for the Swiss <a href="https://www.digitaleconomyaward.ch/">Digital Economy Award</a> in Zurich. COVID-19 had other plans, but our experience proved invaluable when working on the POCs with&nbsp;HIN.</p><p>This time, we built out peer to peer email exchange via <a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a>. Secure, encrypted, authentic and designed in a way that it can be plugged into any legacy email system to gradually switch to a new, identity verified transport layer reaching all the way to the people themselves.</p> From prototyping to production: Quest for the identifier <p>We built these prototypes using did:web, because it is a great placeholder to stand in for decentralized identifiers while rapidly prototyping around user flow and experience.</p><p>But from the onset it was clear that did:web would not be the choice for production, because for all the reasons also <a href="https://medium.com/@ggreve/self-sovereign-identity-over-before-it-started-661b4b0dbdc6">highlighted in the last&nbsp;article</a>:</p><blockquote>Web based identifiers must never be used for personal identity.</blockquote><p>Our preferred choice would have been <a href="https://keri.one">KERI</a> due to its robust security and privacy architecture. But with the official implementation being Python only, we had concerns about efforts required in supporting a secure, long term solution across the range of platforms we anticipated.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/THCLab/keriox">Rust implementation</a> by the Human Colossus Foundation fared better on that front. But there seems to be a rift in the community, causing concerns of diverging implementations, as well as long-term support. Which are exacerbated by the choice for European Public License&nbsp;(EUPL).</p><p>We could not find information about adoption, nor community. And finally, the security of KERI as a concept critically depends on the networks of Witnesses and Watchers, for which we could not find information about size, health and long term viability of these networks for either implementation.</p><p>Had we chosen KERI in February 2024, we would not have been able to go productive before these issues had been resolved. And our time line dictated we had to be ready for initial production by late 2024. As a result, KERI was a non-starter.</p><p>Other methods, such as did:indy, have been in decline for some time, and Sovrin is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sovrin-foundation_to-the-sovrin-community-after-seven-years-activity-7253082729443930112-069C?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">shutting down</a> in just a couple of weeks. Methods like did:peer on the other hand are not great in scenarios where long-lived connections are desirable.</p><blockquote>So in the end, our search for production ready decentralized identifiers that could safely be used for natural persons left us empty&nbsp;handed.</blockquote>A classic. And good&nbsp;advice. Ignoring XKCD <p>The <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">competing standards</a> comic by XKCD is a classic. As far as rules go, it is a good one. But there are no rules without exceptions. Having exhausted every other path, we decided to ignore XKCDs’ best practice. Only, we did not aim to create the universal solution — that’s KERI — but to create the simplest possible, yet still sufficiently safe identifier for the requirements of our specific use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Like any good design, it should build on existing technologies as much as possible, be simple enough to be implemented within a reasonable time frame, and to be supportable for at least 5–10 years, when potentially it would be replaced by something better.</p> Designing a decentralized identifier <p>Our requirements asked for an identifier that was truly secure and private. We explicitly sought to minimize dependencies on infrastructure such as DNS, Web Servers and Certificate Authorities. Blockchain would have fit these criteria, but we do not require a global consensus. All we needed was a decentralized storage system that would guarantee integrity and availability of&nbsp;records.</p><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> might have been an option. It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content-Addressable Storage</a>, so objects are referenced by their hash, any modification creates a new object. But Git would add unnecessary overhead, and there is a central repository. The <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">Interplanetary File System (IPFS)</a> on the other hand is built for peer to peer distribution between nodes without a central&nbsp;server.</p><p>Like Git, IPFS is built on Content-Addressable Storage (CAS). Objects are referenced by their sha256 hashes. Users can request data at any node, and if that node does not have this particular object, it will use peer-to-peer network connectivity between nodes to obtain a copy of the data and provide it to the user. It is open, verifiable, and resilient.</p><blockquote>Its function allows DID documents to be uploaded onto any node and be referenced by their hash on any node in the network. Modifications to the document modify the hash, so documents are integrity protected by design. Simultaneously, the entire DID storage and distribution mechanism is robust regarding the well-known attacks against Web based identifiers.</blockquote><p>In addition, the hash for the document contains no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and unless we’d make the mistake of adding PII to the DID documents themselves, our design would not expose any kind of PII anywhere.</p><p>Of course we were not the first, nor the only ones to realize the potential of IPFS for decentralized identifiers. There has been a prior attempt at using IPFS for DID documents, the <a href="https://did-ipid.github.io/ipid-did-method/">IPID DID Method</a>. But it never got much traction, and its use of the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/">InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS)</a> made it less robust. Also, it did not have provisions for the rotation of keys, which is crucial for long-term connections with the same identifier, as well as the ability to switch wallets or upgrade crypto algorithms.</p>Swiss Healthcare: Innovating together toward the gold standard of decentralized, secure, private identity and applications An identifier for Sovereign Data Exchange&nbsp;(SVDX) <p>The result is did:svdx, our DID method for Sovereign Data Exchange.</p><p>Agents generate their active key locally, as well as a key that can be used for the update of the identifier later. The public key of the first key is used as the persistent identifier, creating a persistent Autonomous Identifier (AID).</p><p>The second key, which is used for the update of the identifier, is never shared. Only its hash is declared in the document as a next key commitment. Because this key is never actively used until it is time to rotate, it is well protected against being compromised.</p><p>Each revision of the decentralized identity documents representing a Decentralized Identifier has a Content Identifier (CID) when stored in IPFS, so the resulting identifier is always the combination of the AID with the CID of the latest revision of the identifier.</p><p>Since each revision of the identifier refers back to the previous version by its CID, the result is a sha-256 hash based Key Event Chain of IPFS objects, all the way back to the inception document, the root of the AID in question.</p><p>did:svdx:z6MknHKiY477mH97qryHv3zjuHaTLvBbbp6tHS5SvZv67uR4:QmecqVGBxvW7gjffxmYTGFZNPmJcWmYPdD8azB1cZYaY6F</p><p>Because the identifier also contains the CID of the current state, starting verification of the Key Event Chain is trivial: Just pull the corresponding object out of IPFS and verify. Check for ancestor, rinse and repeat until you’re at the beginning of the chain. Check whether the AID matches the initial key.&nbsp;Done.</p> Trivial to implement in web based tool&nbsp;chains <p>No native IPFS support? No problem. Just pick one of the <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">public IPFS gateways</a>, and with a single request pull the DID document, e.g. <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmecqVGBxvW7gjffxmYTGFZNPmJcWmYPdD8azB1cZYaY6F">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmecqVGBxvW7gjffxmYTGFZNPmJcWmYPdD8azB1cZYaY6F</a>.</p><p>Thanks to content based addressing, you will get the same document no matter which gateway you use. And you’re welcome to use as many of them as you would like to compare. Although for production use cases it is highly recommended to run your own, which is&nbsp;trivial.</p><blockquote>In other words, IPFS allows to integrate classic web based tool chains with decentralized storage and delivery of integrity protected DID documents. It’s as easy as any of the did:web* methods to work with, but does not suffer from the attack surfaces of DNS, TLS and Certificate Authorities.</blockquote><p>In addition, it is robust against a number of DDOS scenarios, allows for low impact self-hosting, and eliminates the web server as a central point of attack, surveillance and compromise.</p><p>Also, it plays well with DIDComm and other communication protocols, but if you really require web based interaction protocols, they can also be encoded into the identifier. But unlike web based identifiers, exchanging key material via did:svdx mitigates a substantial number of attack scenarios for web connection protocols.</p> Layering trust <p>By design did:svdx contains zero personal information. It is deliberately focused on secure key exchange of an Autonomous Identifier, only.</p><p>So any relationship starts from a reliable assumption the AID controllers have a strong connection to one another and can maintain it over a longer period of time, including throughout key rotation and changes in cryptography. But they start from zero trust in one&nbsp;another.</p><p>Trust is built gradually, through Verifiable Presentations securely exchanged over the connection. Similar to what Christopher Allen describes as “<a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/progressive-trust/">Building Trust in Gradients</a>.”</p><p>For SVDX, given it is built for a true P2P, decentralized ecosystem, we surmise that the party initiating a connection first authenticates itself toward the recipient of the connection request before requesting reciprocal information. That should also make data mining or identifier scraping much&nbsp;harder.</p> Limits of&nbsp;did:svdx <p>For any design, it is crucial to know its limits. Firstly, the identifier specification does not contain any of the multi-signature capabilities of systems like KERI. Because we did not require it for our use case at hand, we pushed that complexity, along the complexity of secure restore and key rotation, onto the clients — which we control for the use case at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Also, while IPFS plays a role similar to that of Witnesses in KERI, there are no Watchers. So there is no built-in detection of duplicity, as Sam Smith calls it. And while parties can update each other on key rotations using DIDComm, allowing each other to verify they are still talking to the same party, the design has no built-in protections against a controller forking their identity.</p><p>For our use case this was not an issue, because there is a central catalogue for the ecosystem to allow looking up the latest, known version of an AID. Which is not ideal for some scenarios. But we considered the solution good enough for what we needed to achieve, given that all controllers need to also maintain their identity and trustworthiness with HIN as the central ecosystem fiduciary.</p><p>That said, it should be possible to design a robust duplicity detection on top of did:svdx, and there may even be scenarios where duplicity is not a primary concern as long as agents always ensure to only consider the latest version of an AID authoritative.</p><blockquote>So did:svdx is not a replacement for KERI. But it is a replacement for web based DID methods, offering far better security, and similar efforts of adoption and support. From our own experience we know it took around 6-8 weeks to implement in JavaScript.</blockquote> What’s next? <p>The first application using did:svdx in production will have ramped up by April&nbsp;2025.</p><p>By mid 2025 we expect hundreds of thousands of production messages sent each month containing verifiable credentials backed by did:svdx. Our roadmap has us building out additional applications until all the institutions and eventually all the patients in Switzerland will have identifiers within the next 2-3&nbsp;years.</p><p>We have already Open Sourced the initial implementation and will continue to add additional implementations. Also, we would love to finalize the specification so that it can be maximally useful to others. And there may be features that would be required for additional use cases, as well as community-based methods for duplicity detection.</p> Open questions   Where is the right place to finalize, publish and maintain did:svdx?  Who would be interested in participating?  What are the critical capabilities that may still be&nbsp;missing?  What kind of best practice operational RFCs should we develop as a community?  <p>If you’re at <a href="https://diceurope.org/">DICE in Zurich</a> this year, I’d love to sit down and discuss these questions with you — alongside everything else you would like to know about our vision for the Sovereign Data Exchange.</p>

<p>This post shows how to implement phone (SMS) verification and two-factor authentication (2FA) using ASP.NET Core Identity. The solution integrates phone-based verification and 2FA mechanisms. The implementation uses ASP.NET Core Identity’s extensibility to incorporate SMS-based verification during user registration and login processes. SMS is no longer a recommended authentication method due to security risks but does provide a good solution for some business cases or user flows like onboarding phone users or phone applications, frontline workers with no desktop or other such solutions with limited security possibilities.</p>

<p>An SMS service are used to integrate the SMS, the SmsProvider class. In this demo, the <a href="https://ecall-messaging.com/">eColl</a> messaging service is used to send SMS. The implementation and the configuration would vary if you use a different service.</p>



<p>The SmsProvider is used to verify a phone number, to enable SMS 2FA and to force SMS 2FA. The service uses a HttpClient to access the SMS service rest API. </p>

 Flow 1: Verify phone 



<p>Once a user has authenticated with email and password, the user can verify a phone. To verify the phone, the user MUST be authenticated. If not, a malicious program may send multiple SMS and cause financial harm.   The Add phone number link can be used to start the verification process.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The VerifyPhone Razor page allows the user to enter an mobile phone number to send the SMS. This should be validated for real phone numbers at least. The StartVerificationAsync method is used to send the SMS. The ASP.NET Core Identity method GenerateChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync is used to generate the challenge for the verification.</p>


  var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
if (user == null)
{
    return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
}

var result = await _client.StartVerificationAsync(user, Input.PhoneNumber);
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI is not styled, just uses the standard bootstrap styles.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The confirm Razor Page accepts the verification code which was sent to the phone and uses the VerifyAndProcessCode method to validate. The ASP.NET Core Identity VerifyChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync method is used to validate the code.</p>


    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
  {
      if (!ModelState.IsValid)
      {
          return Page();
      }

      try
      {
          if (Input.PhoneNumber != null &amp;&amp; Input.VerificationCode != null)
          {
              return await VerifyAndProcessCode(Input.PhoneNumber, Input.VerificationCode);
          }
          else
          {
              ModelState.AddModelError("", "Input.PhoneNumber or Input.VerificationCode missing");
          }
      }
      catch (Exception)
      {
          ModelState.AddModelError("", "There was an error confirming the code, please check the verification code is correct and try again");
      }

      return Page();
  }

  private async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; VerifyAndProcessCode(string phoneNumber, string code)
  {
      var applicationUser = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);

      if (applicationUser != null)
      {
          var validCodeForUserSession = await _client.CheckVerificationAsync(applicationUser,
              phoneNumber, code);

          return await ProcessValidCode(applicationUser, validCodeForUserSession);
      }
      else
      {
          ModelState.AddModelError("", "No user");
          return Page();
      }
  }

  private async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; ProcessValidCode(ApplicationUser applicationUser, bool validCodeForUserSession)
  {
      if (validCodeForUserSession)
      {
          var phoneNumber = await _userManager.GetPhoneNumberAsync(applicationUser);
          if (Input.PhoneNumber != phoneNumber)
          {
              await _userManager.SetPhoneNumberAsync(applicationUser, Input.PhoneNumber);
          }

          applicationUser.PhoneNumberConfirmed = true;
          var updateResult = await _userManager.UpdateAsync(applicationUser);

          if (updateResult.Succeeded)
          {
              return RedirectToPage("ConfirmPhoneSuccess");
          }
          else
          {
              ModelState.AddModelError("", "There was an error confirming the verification code, please try again");
          }
      }
      else
      {
          ModelState.AddModelError("", "There was an error confirming the verification code");
      }

      return Page();
  }
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI displays the input for the code and the number it was sent to.</p>







<p></p>



 Flow 2: Enable phone 2FA 



<p>Once the phone is verified, it can be used for an SMS 2FA. </p>







<p></p>



<p>The EnableSms2FaAsync method is used to enable the SMS 2FA.</p>


  var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
if (user == null)
{
 return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
}

if (user.PhoneNumber != Input.PhoneNumber)
{
 ModelState.AddModelError("Input.PhoneNumber", 
	"Phone number does not match user user, please update or add phone in your profile");
}

await _smsVerifyClient.EnableSms2FaAsync(user, Input.PhoneNumber!);

return RedirectToPage("./VerifyPhone2Fa", new { Input.PhoneNumber });
  


<p></p>



<p>The EnablePhone2Fa Razor page is used to validate the phone number before activating the 2FA.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The VerifyChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync is used to validate and the 2FA is activated.</p>


  var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
if (user == null)
{
	return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
}

var verificationCode = Input.Code.Replace(" ", string.Empty).Replace("-", string.Empty);
var is2faTokenValid = await _userManager
	.VerifyChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync(user, verificationCode, user.PhoneNumber!);

if (!is2faTokenValid)
{
	ModelState.AddModelError("Input.Code", "Verification code is invalid.");
	return Page();
}

await _userManager.SetTwoFactorEnabledAsync(user, true);
  


<p></p>



<p>The Verify Phone 2FA Razor page displays the input field for the code.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Once activated, the user should persist some recovery codes.</p>







<p></p>



 Flow 3: SMS 2FA using phone 



<p>Next time the user authenticates, the SMS 2FA is required. The user can use multiple authentication methods, not only SMS. If possible, passkeys or strong authentication should be used.</p>


  if (user.Phone2FAEnabled)
{
 IsPhone = true;
 if (!user.AuthenticatorApp2FAEnabled)
 {
	 await _smsVerifyClient
		.Send2FASmsAsync(user, user.PhoneNumber!);
 }
}
  


<p></p>



 Further flows 



 Phone only authentication 



<p>Requires mass usage protection</p>



 Recover account using Phone authentication 



<p>Requires mass usage protection</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirdzhuvinov/">Vladimir Dzhuvinov</a> and I led a discussion on The Cambrian Explosion of OAuth and OpenID Specifications at the <a href="https://oauth.secworkshop.events/osw2025">2025 OAuth Security Workshop</a> in Reykjavík.</p>
<p>The abstract for the session was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The number of OAuth and OpenID specifications continues to grow.  At present there are 30 OAuth RFCs, two more in the RFC Editor queue, 13 OAuth working group drafts, and another eight individual OAuth drafts that may advance.  There are nine JOSE RFCs and seven working group drafts.  There are four SecEvent RFCs.  On the OpenID side, there are 12 final OpenID Connect specs, three final FAPI specs, one final MODRNA spec, three final eKYC-IDA specs, and 24 Implementer’s drafts across the OpenID working groups, plus another ten working group drafts.</p>
<p>The number of possible combinations boggles the mind.  And there’s no end in sight!</p>
<p>What’s a developer to do?  How have people and companies gone about selecting and curating the specs to implement in an attempt to create coherent and useful open source and commercial offerings?  And faced with such an array of combinations and choices, how are application developers to make sense of it all?  How can interoperability be achieved in the face of continued innovation?</p>
<p>This session will prime the pump by discussing choices made by some existing open source and commercial offerings in the OAuth and OpenID space and lead to an open discussion of choices made by the workshop attendees and the reasoning behind them.  It’s our goal that useful strategies emerge from the discussion that help people grapple with the ever-expanding sets of specifications and make informed implementation choices, while still fostering the innovation and problem-solving that these specifications represent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The slides used to queue up the discussion session are available as <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OSW_2025_The_Cambrian_Explosion_of_OAuth_and_OpenID_Specifications.pptx">PowerPoint</a> and <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OSW_2025_The_Cambrian_Explosion_of_OAuth_and_OpenID_Specifications.pdf">PDF</a>.  Also, see the <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OAuth_and_OpenID_Specifications_February_2025.docx">list of 101 OAuth and OpenID-related specifications</a> referenced during the discussion.</p>
<p>The topic seems to have touched a chord.  Many people were clearly already thinking about the situation and shared their views.  Some of them were:</p>
 
 Nobody actually expects everyone to implement everything. 
 Stopping things is super hard.  But sometimes it’s necessary (as Brian Campbell put it, “when they’re wrong”). 
 Timing can be fickle.  What may not be useful at one time can turn out to be useful later. 
 Some specs are highly related and often used together. But those relationships are not always apparent to those new to the space. 
 We need better on-ramps to help people new to the space wrap their arms around the plethora specs and what they’re useful for. 
 Well-written profiles are a way of managing the complexity.  For instance, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/fapi-security-profile-2_0.html">FAPI 2</a> limits choices, increasing both interoperability and security. 
 The amount of innovation happening is a sign of success! 
 
<p>Thanks to the organizers for a great tenth OAuth Security Workshop!  And special thanks to the colleagues from <a href="https://www.signicat.com/">Signicat</a> who did a superb job with local arrangements in Reykjavík!</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Amazon launches Alexa+, VS Code pulls “epic” but malicious theme, Meta cuts stock awards by 10%, Humane sells to HP, and more.</p>  <p>Swarm of AI coding tool launches. Anthropic launches Sonnet 3.7 (a supposedly even more capable LLM for coding) and Claude Code. GitHub ships Copilot Code Reviews, and Google makes Gemini Code Assist free for individual users (from $22.80 per month). Us devs are showered with new tools that all aim to improve workflows.</p>  <p>DeepSeek triggers higher GPU demand? It’s been predicted that more efficient LLMs will decrease demand for GPUs, but DeepSeek is 4-5x as efficient as some current LLMs, and appears to be driving up demand.

VC firms are increasingly shutting down, with overall funding levels dropping. AI-related funding is up – along with competition among startups to get funded. We <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">predicted</a> VC funding could dry up <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">due to interest rate changes</a>, and the data seems to show this happening.</p>  <p>What does “zero” mean for dates in COBOL? A reminder that “0” and “null” might not mean what you expect in some programming languages and systems.</p>   1. Industry Pulse  Amazon launches Alexa+ <p>A year ago, I analyzed how Alexa <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146756242/how-did-alexa-get-left-behind-in-conversational-ai">had become left behind</a> in the conversational AI race by missing the LLM wave, despite Amazon Alexa being a great use case for an integrated LLM, in order to provide better conversational experiences and new capabilities.</p><p>Well, 12 months later, Amazon seems to have caught up. This week, the online retail giant <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence">announced</a> Alexa+, which is a revamped, more capable conversational assistant. It promises to make reservations or book rides by using apps like OpenTable and Uber, buy things on Amazon (obviously), manage smart speakers in the home, discover new music, and more.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1894771550718484863">launch demo</a> looks very polished and capable. But then, Apple’s glossy launch demos for Apple Intelligence didn’t stop the feature still <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/156613118/apple-intelligence-half-baked">feeling half-baked</a> months later.</p><p>Under the hood, Alexa is partially <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-and-alexa-plus">powered by Claude</a>, which Amazon didn’t announce, and Anthropic did. This suggests Anthropic’s models are ahead of Amazon’s own <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/155552919/amazons-ai-models-fail-to-impress">Nova models</a>. Still, Amazon is clearly creating optionality for itself by not advertising Alexa’s dependence on Claude; when and if the Nova models are good enough, Amazon could replace Anthrophic’s solution with its own.</p><p>The Amazon+ pricing is puzzling: Alexa+ is free for Amazon Prime members ($14.99 monthly), and $19.99 per month for everyone else. This seems to make little sense; why charge so much more for a standalone subscription than for a bundle? Is it because Amazon wants to dis-incentivize customers just subscribing to Alexa+?</p><p>Either way, Amazon is making a stronger-than-ever case for customers to choose Amazon Prime for $14.99: which is probably the goal of upgrading Alexa.</p> VS Code pulls “epic” malicious theme

For today’s episode, I sat down with him, to go through more comics, why he created them, and the deeper meaning behind several of these.</p><p>Manu spent over a decade at Google, doing both backend and frontend development. He also spent a year and a half at Twitter before Elon Musk purchased it and rebranded it to X. But what Manu is most known for are his hilarious internet comics about the tech world, including his famous org chart comic from 2011 about Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.</p><p>In today’s conversation, we explore many of his comics, discuss the meaning behind them, and talk about the following topics:</p>  <p>The viral org chart comic that captured the structure of Big Tech companies</p>  <p>Why Google is notorious for confusing product names</p>  <p>The comic that ended up on every door at Google</p>  <p>How Google’s 20% time fostered innovation—and what projects came from it</p>  <p>How one of Manu’s comics predicted Google Stadia’s failure—and the reasons behind it</p>  <p>The value of connecting to users directly</p>  <p>Twitter’s climate before and after Elon Musk’s acquisition and the mass layoffs that followed</p>  <p>And more!</p>      <p>This is an unusually visual episode, offering the story behind several comics about Big Tech, Google and Twitter that you might have seen. With Manu, we discuss the deeper meaning behind several of these — ones that are pretty obvious to those who worked inside these companies, but might be less intuitive if you’re only seeing them for the first time.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode <p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/manu">How Manu creates comics</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/consolidating-technologies">Consolidating technologies</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/is-big-tech-becoming-more-cutthroat">Is Big Tech becoming more cutthroat?</a></p> Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=121s">02:01</a>) Manu’s org structure comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=430s">07:10</a>) Manu’s “Who Sues Who” comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=555s">09:15</a>) Google vs. Amazon comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=850s">14:10</a>) Confusing names at Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1200s">20:00</a>) Different approaches to sharing information within companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1340s">22:20</a>) The two ways of doing things at Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1515s">25:15</a>) Manu’s code reviews comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1665s">27:45</a>) The comic that was printed on every single door of Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1855s">30:55</a>) An explanation of 20% at Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2160s">36:00</a>) Gmail Labs and Google Stadia</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2496s">41:36</a>) Manu’s time at Twitter and the threat of Elon Musk buying</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2827s">47:07</a>) How Manu helped Gergely with a bug on Twitter</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2945s">49:05</a>) Musk’s acquirement of Twitter and the resulting layoffs</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=3540s">59:00</a>) Manu’s comic about his disillusionment with Twitter and Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=3757s">1:02:37</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  The org chart comic   <p>Manu created <a href="https://goomics.net/62">this comic</a> in 2011 featuring the org charts of big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Oracle, and Microsoft.</p>  <p>Manu almost didn't publish the comic because he didn't find it funny by the time he finished drawing it. The punchline was Oracle having a large legal department and a tiny engineering department.</p>  <p>The comic became very popular and has been referenced heavily.</p>     The culture inside Google   <p>Google has a problem naming things, which Manu attributes to its bottom-up culture and engineers starting competing projects.</p>  <p>There isn't much top-down pressure to consolidate efforts, leading to consumer confusion.</p>  <p>An example of Google's naming issues is the evolution from Google Wallet to Android Pay to Google Pay, with logo changes causing confusion for partners like Uber.</p>    <p>Manu created <a href="https://goomics.net/207">a comic about this</a>: how confusing it is to interact with Google products due to the different names.</p>  <p>The “<a href="https://goomics.net/291">Google Graveyard comic</a>” was prophetic: it predicted that Google's cloud gaming console Stadia would eventually be killed.</p>   Google vs Amazon   <p>Manu created a comic <a href="https://goomics.net/329">contrasting Google and Amazon</a> in their engineering culture, and how they treat customers</p>  <p>Amazon is known for bending over backwards for customers, including AWS clients.</p>  <p>Google focuses on building useful features but lacks strong customer service.</p>  <p>Amazon's on-call practices are tough, while Google's are more relaxed, with SREs taking on much of the on-call load.</p>     Google’s engineering culture   <p><a href="https://goomics.net/50">The comic about migrations</a> at Google: shows the challenges of adopting new systems before they are ready. One Google exec said, "There's two ways to do things at Google. There's the deprecated way and there's the way that doesn't work yet".</p>  <p>One on code reviews: shows the software engineer trying to replace a light bulb while being critiqued on how to screw it in.</p>  <p>Another comic depicts the author of the change who says, "Oh, I don't need to be too cautious about my code. If there's some problem, the reviewer will catch it," and the reviewer who says, "Oh, I don't need to review this too carefully if the author must've know what he's doing or what she's doing".</p>  <p>Google used Manu's "Beware the Tailgator" comic on office doors to prevent theft by reminding employees not to let unverified people into the building. He created updated versions each year.</p>  <p>Google's 20% time allowed employees to dedicate a portion of their time to projects of their choosing.</p>  <p>Gmail and Google News were started as 20% projects.</p>  <p>The company has become more traditional and less encouraging of 20% projects.</p>  <p>There may be a connection between Google's 20% time and the high number of products it shuts down.</p>  <p>Google could experiment internally without necessarily launching everything publicly.</p>  <p>Gmail Labs allowed people to launch things with lower scrutiny and made it clear that these were not officially supported and they may go out at any point.</p>  <p>Manu <a href="https://goomics.net/343">created a comic about ending of this practice</a> as well</p>     Move to Twitter and Musk’s takeover   <p>Manu left Google and joined Twitter because it felt like a younger version of Google, with a friendly culture and less red tape.</p>  <p>Shortly after Manu joined Twitter, Elon Musk began his attempt to acquire the company, creating uncertainty.</p>  <p>After Musk bought Twitter, there were massive firings, with at least 50% and ultimately around 80% of employees being let go.</p>  <p>Manu created a bunch of <a href="https://twittoons.com/">comics about the events at Twitter</a> – and later also published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twittoons-employees-chronicle-Twitters-accelerated/dp/1952629020">a comic book</a> about it</p>  <p>While Manu was also let go from Twitter: the cartoonist side of himself was having a great time witnessing the events at Twitter.</p>  <p>As a fun fact, Manu doesn't have a favorite programming language. He chooses the best tool for the job, and has been coding with Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, Objective-C, Swift, Rust, and C. He also <a href="https://ma.nu/faves/">built a site</a> with all his book, movie and music recommendations.</p><p>Where to find Manu Cornet:</p><p>• Mastodon: <a href="https://twit.social/@manu">https://twit.social/@manu</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manucornet/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/manucornet/</a></p><p>• Website: <a href="https://ma.nu/">https://ma.nu/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Code Review on Printed Paper: an Excerpt from the Twitoons Comic Book: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/code-review-on-printed-paper-an-excerpt">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/code-review-on-printed-paper-an-excerpt</a></p><p>• A much clearer insight into who sues who: <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/who-sues-who">https://bonkersworld.net/who-sues-who</a></p><p>• CEO's "Burning Platform" Memo Highlights Nokia's Woes: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2011/02/09/ceos-burning-platform-memo-highlights-nokias-woes/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2011/02/09/ceos-burning-platform-memo-highlights-nokias-woes/</a></p><p>• Guns and Roses: <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/guns-and-roses">https://bonkersworld.net/guns-and-roses</a></p><p>• The Full Circle on Developer Productivity with Steve Yegge: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/steve-yegge">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/steve-yegge</a></p><p>• Grab: <a href="https://www.grab.careers/en/">https://www.grab.careers/en/</a></p><p>• Comic about the confusing Google names: <a href="https://goomics.net/207">https://goomics.net/207</a></p><p>• Naming dashboard: <a href="https://goomics.net/239">https://goomics.net/239</a></p><p>• Access: <a href="https://goomics.net/370">https://goomics.net/370</a></p><p>• Welcome to Google: <a href="https://goomics.net/50">https://goomics.net/50</a></p><p>• Eric Schmidt on X: <a href="https://x.com/ericschmidt">https://x.com/ericschmidt</a></p><p>• Jonathan Rosenberg on X: <a href="https://x.com/jjrosenberg">https://x.com/jjrosenberg</a></p><p>• Code Reviews: <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/code-reviews">https://bonkersworld.net/code-reviews</a></p><p>• Beware the Tailgator: <a href="https://goomics.net/56">https://goomics.net/56</a></p><p>• 20% time: <a href="https://goomics.net/343">https://goomics.net/343</a></p><p>• Where did Gmail labs go?: <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/gmail-labs-missing/">https://zapier.com/blog/gmail-labs-missing/</a></p><p>• Google Stadia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Stadia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Stadia</a></p><p>• Google engineer who criticized the company in viral comics on why he finally quit: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-engineer-manu-cornet-comics-critique">https://mashable.com/article/google-engineer-manu-cornet-comics-critique</a></p><p>• Network effect: <a href="https://goomics.net/324">https://goomics.net/324</a></p><p>• The Twitter Worker Who Captured Elon Musk’s Takeover in All Its Cartoonish Glory: <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-cartoons-manu-cortnet.html">https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-cartoons-manu-cortnet.html</a></p><p>• Howl’s Moving Castle: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347149/">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347149/</a></p><p>• Tesla: <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">https://www.tesla.com/</a></p><p>• Twittoons: One employee's cartoon chronicle of Twitter's accelerated descent: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twittoons-employees-chronicle-Twitters-accelerated/dp/1952629020">https://www.amazon.com/Twittoons-employees-chronicle-Twitters-accelerated/dp/1952629020</a></p><p>• Javascript: https://www.javascript.com/</p><p>• C++: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B</a></p><p>• Python: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a></p><p>• Swift: <a href="https://www.swift.org/">https://www.swift.org/</a></p><p>• Rust: <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">https://www.rust-lang.org/</a></p><p>• CSS: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS</a></p><p>• Manu’s favorites: <a href="https://ma.nu/faves/">https://ma.nu/faves/</a></p><p>• Mind the Goof (Gomer Goof #1): <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Goof-Gomer-Franquin/dp/1849183589">https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Goof-Gomer-Franquin/dp/1849183589</a></p><p>• Building Software: <a href="https://bonkersworld.net/building-software">https://bonkersworld.net/building-software</a></p><p>—</p><p>Production and marketing by <a href="https://penname.co/">Pen Name</a>.

<p>Today, there’s an ever-growing number of startups, scaleups, and established companies like Boston Dynamics producing increasingly capable robots, including ones that look humanoid. Tech giants like Tesla have been building humanoid robots, and Meta is expected to invest billions in the technology. These and other factors point to the possibility that, after artificial intelligence, robotics could be the “next big thing” in tech.</p><p>But what’s the process of building intelligent robots, and what’s it like as a day-to-day job for the developers who do? It’s not always easy to find this out because robotics startups are famously shrouded in secrecy – and with such cutting-edge technology, it’s unsurprising.</p><p>Academia is often a bit more open, so I turned to MIT Robot Learning Researcher, <a href="https://sandorfelber.github.io/">Sandor Felber</a>. He’s a Humanoid Robot Learning Researcher at MIT in Boston, Massachusetts, and previously led a team that built a self-driving race car. Sandor’s also been a robotics intern at Tesla in Palo Alto, California, and a robotics R&amp;D engineer at the Edinburgh Center of Robotics.</p><p>Today, he takes us through:</p>  <p>Getting into robotics. From personal interest at high school in electric motors, through studying electrical and mechanical engineering at university, building a driverless race car, interning at Tesla, and researching humanoid robots at MIT.</p>  <p>Robotics industry overview. Industrial robots are becoming more widespread, academia focuses on smaller “long-shot” bests, and industry (the commercial sector) executes on proven concepts.</p>  <p>Planning a robotics project. This is similar to most projects: start with a vision, make a plan, and break it down into steps. It’s always useful to be clear on “critical” vs “nice-to-have” features.</p>  <p>Development phase. Control strategies (model-based control vs learned controllers), simulation and hardware deployment differences, and techniques to make simulations more realistic.</p>  <p>Tech stack and tools. Python, C, C++, and Rust are popular programming languages. A list of tools for experiment tracking and simulation.</p>  <p>Testing, demoing, and shipping. Common reasons why robot deployments fail, an example of deployment of an industrial robot, and why ongoing customer support is a baseline expectation.</p>  <p>Day-to-day as a robot builder. There’s a big difference between academia and industry, and Sandor shares an overview of both.</p>  <p>This topic is intriguing because it combines software, hardware, and cutting-edge tech: </p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4e97497-eb69-43bc-a6cc-35a446302309_1204x1248.png">          </a>Robotics as a field, and where generative AI techniques and autonomous decision-making fit in.

Getting into robotics, a personal account <p>My interest in robotics began in high school, where I wrote the junior equivalent of a dissertation on characterization methods for how electric motors behave under different conditions. This led me to pursue a degree in electrical and mechanical engineering at the University of Edinburgh, home to numerous renowned robotics and AI researchers.</p><p>Building a driverless electric race car was one of my bigger projects. At uni, I joined the Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS) team, where we designed, built, and raced a driverless electric race car. From a roboticist’s perspective, this is considered a wheeled mobile robot.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13984217-0029-431e-8314-60934e584fe1_1600x900.jpeg">          </a>My team’s driverless (but also human-drivable) electric vehicle, SISU23D, at launch.

Source: Nikita Jegorovs <p>Along the way, I discovered a passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>. Control systems engineers tend to concern themselves with crafting control strategies that ensure optimal performance, from spacecraft trajectories to insulin delivery in diabetics.</p><p>In robotics, you could think of control theory as the invisible puppeteer of a robotic arm, except that instead of pulling strings, it's using mathematics to orchestrate every joint's motion in real time. As a robotic arm needs to smoothly pick up an egg without crushing it, control theory provides the mathematical "muscle memory" that turns crude motor commands into precise, graceful movements. It does this with constant sensor feedback and adjustments, with the approach adjusted depending on how sensitive the control system is to the various feedback signals.</p><p>My interest in control theory and background in batteries, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain">powertrains</a> (vehicle motors), and electrical control systems from previous internships landed me one at Tesla's robotics department. Since then, I’ve worked with academic and industrial stakeholders on projects ranging from quadruped (quad- as in four, and -ped as in legged) dog-like robots, to humanoid systems.</p><p>I’m currently at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), focusing on teaching humanoid robots to perform complex, real-world tasks using learned controllers, powered by neural networks. I’m particularly interested in embedding intelligence into robots by leveraging various types of learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, offline and online deep reinforcement learning, and imitation learning.</p><p>I use these approaches for humanoid robot locomotion, manipulation, whole-body control, and teleoperation (remotely controlling the robot).</p> 2. Robotics industry overview <p>Robotics companies are raising more money than ever before. In the first eight months of 2024, global robotics companies <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/from-surge-to-sobriety-the-state-of-robotics-investment-in-2024/">attracted</a> a record amount of $10.8 billion in funding, averaging $1.35 billion per month! What’s all the hype fuelling this surge of capital?</p><p>In public debate, there’s no shortage of focus on labor shortages and stagnating productivity, which reduce growth and competitiveness. The US economy is <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/global-labor-market-outlook/press/global-labor-market-outlook-2024">estimated</a> to be missing up to 4.6 million workers annually needed to maintain levels of supply and demand, according to <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/global-labor-market-outlook/press/global-labor-market-outlook-2024">a recent study</a>. That number equates to 2% of the current US population. The same study suggests Germany needs to find an additional 1.6 million workers to keep current economic levels; 3% of its population.</p><p>This is one driver of industrial robots’ increased adoption, which shows no sign of slowing down. Sustaining economic growth amid shrinking labor pools is one viable path for robotics which is getting a lot of attention, as evidenced in the increased adoption of industrial robots, with global installations reaching nearly 600,000 units in 2024, as per <a href="https://www.robotics247.com/article/world_robotics_report_2023_shows_ongoing_global_growth_installations_finds_ifr">the World Robotics Report</a>. This figure surpassed previous benchmarks and shows that industries struggling with labor shortages can return to growth.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a02585a-17a1-4a22-8185-f673cda48fe9_800x450.png">          </a>Industry robots are reshaping the automotive industry as key parts of assembly lines traditionally operated by humans. Source: <a href="https://www.wevolver.com/article/automotive-robots">Wevolver</a> <p>If robots become ubiquitous, what will humans do? This is the most common concern I hear when I talk about my work. The question is an old one: on the New York subway, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/holidaynostalgiarides/">Holiday Nostalgia Ride</a>, which offers a trip in an old subway car from between the 1930s and 1970s. My coach looked like it was from the 1960s, and inside was an advert about upskilling for “tomorrow’s jobs:”</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bf4a0e4-4966-478d-91d9-cfe88313b373_1334x1334.jpeg">          </a>A poster on the New York subway in the 1960s <p>The world has changed massively since then, thanks in part to automation, without which our standards of comfort wouldn’t be possible or affordable; think of the dishwasher that automates the washing up and helps canteens to offer a cheaper menu, than if they had to hire extra people to wash dishes and pay for excess water (new dishwashers are very efficient).</p><p>Acquiring new skills in a quickly-changing world is as least as necessary today as it was back then; as illustrated by that subway ad from the mid-20th century.</p> Industry vs academia <p>Approaches to research and development have always differed between industry and academia. Having worked in both environments, here’s how I see them compare in robotics:</p><p>Academia: smaller “long-shot” bets, developed on a budget. Many projects take years to mature, due to the limited effort that a couple of post-docs, PhD students, and undergrads can dedicate.</p><p>Industry: execute on proven concepts with substantial backing. Industry prioritizes execution on feasible concepts. Once a concept is assumed to work – as usually verified by a proof-of-concept (POC), also known as a “minimum viable product” in startup lingo – industry players can raise vast amounts of money to build it.</p><p>Modern robotics may have reached an inflection point, where enough academic “long-shot” bets are delivering results, with feasible paths to building practical robots, including humanoid ones. Examples of bets made on robotic hardware:</p>  <p>Tesla’s Optimus humanoid prototype</p>  <p>Boston Dynamics bidding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EM5_VFlt8">farewell to hydraulics </a>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29ECwExc-_M">welcoming electric actuators</a> on its all-new humanoid platform, Atlas</p>  <p>1X building a humanoid robot, <a href="https://evjang.com/2024/08/31/motors.html">NEO</a></p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F063c47db-e26d-4dc0-a597-637cd6737783_1600x966.png">          </a>Three humanoid robots: These are calculated bets with significant investment  3. Planning a robotics project <p>Here’s how I’ve seen robotics projects get done.</p><p>Vision for a demo: many robotics projects start with the question: “What should the robot achieve when completed?” Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak’s “coffee test” is one such vision, now frequently referred to as the “New Turing Test.” <a href="https://koopingshung.com/blog/turing-test-is-obsolete-bring-in-coffee-test/">His definition</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“A machine is required to enter an average American home and figure out how to make coffee: find the coffee machine, find the coffee, add water, find a mug, and brew the coffee by pushing the proper buttons."</p></blockquote><p>In practice, on most projects I’ve seen, the vision gets watered down or descoped as deadlines approach, and material or human resources become limiting factors. However a demo that passes the test above could well serve as a benchmark for artificial general intelligence (AGI). As part of that test, a physically-embodied machine must demonstrate intelligence by entering a random home and successfully making a cup of coffee with tools available in a previously unseen kitchen.</p><p>After the vision is set, the next steps are:</p><p>Planning: goals, demoable outcomes, and target applications or target environments. The requirements of a good demo in a target environment can be very high!</p><p>Break things down. Translating deliverables into functional requirements. For each functional requirement, one or more features that show successful fulfillment need to be identified. When breaking things down, features are often separated into at least two subsets:</p>  <p>Critical: those that must be present in the final product. If missing, the project is considered a failure. An example is a humanoid robot weighing 50kg that is deployed in warehouse automation, that needs to carry 10kg payload per arm. If the electric motors moving the arms are too weak, or the ankles suddenly overheat, when operating at 68kg in total, then a client won’t be happy with the product or service (RaaS, or Robot-as-a-Service is a thing now). Therefore, this feature likely requires robust engineering all the way to the very left side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-model">V-model</a>. Identifying such interdependencies and making engineering design calls that aid the design, based on engineering intuition, is challenging and part of what makes for great technical leaders.</p>  <p>Nice-to-have: features that a final project could ship without, such as a higher control frequency in order to achieve smoother, less jittery motion. Note, these cannot be fully neglected but can be considered soft constraints, in contrast to critical features which tend to be hard constraints. A robot that gets the job done, even if not as smoothly, could still be counted as a success with room for improvement.</p>  <p>Critical vs nice-to-have thresholds can change over time. Hard constraints (“critical”) vs soft ones (“nice-to-have”) are often linked, and the difference lies in arbitrary measures of quantity and quality.</p><p>Being clear about the “minimum needed” (critical) and “nice-to-have” requirement thresholds is good practice in robotics projects. These can change as the project develops, turning nice-to-haves into critical ones. As long as everyone on the project is notified and on-board when changes happen, then a project should progress without hiccups.</p> 4. Development phase <p>During development, robotics engineers need to balance proof-of-concept experiments with the scaling of a project, including the supporting infrastructure. For example, one proof-of-concept experiment could be verifying that a parallel jaw gripper (the robot’s hand) can grasp a mug in specific setups.</p><p>Scaling can be hard because there are lots of problems in the real world to solve. Scaling the above example of holding a mug can be seen as:</p>

<p>In October 2023, my wife emerged from the bathroom one morning to report that we had no hot water. I found that our gas-fired, on-demand water heater had failed and was leaking a small amount. I called our plumber, who confirmed we needed a new water heater.</p>



<p>We immediately faced the following decision: Should we replace our water heater with a similar gas-fired on-demand unit or change to an electric heat pump water heater? We have been hearing a great deal about the efficiency and ecological benefits of heat pump water heaters, and on-demand gas units like the one we had are said to emit considerably more carbon than even gas-fired tank units.</p>



<p>Placement for a heat pump water heater would be a challenge. The water heater had been located in the attic, and the heat pump water heater was somewhat taller than even the gas-fired tank unit that was installed at the time we bought the house. That meant it could not fit in the attic and would need to be installed in the garage. We found a reasonable location, although we would lose storage space in the garage. It also meant that the loop for our hot water recirculating system needed to be extended down to the garage, making the loop longer.</p>



<p>The plumber said that he could replace the on-demand gas unit with a similar one in a couple of days, but it would take a week or so to obtain a heat pump unit, which would also cost considerably more. We had to make a snap decision because we didn’t want to be without hot water any longer than necessary. Wanting to be good ecological citizens, we opted for the heat pump unit despite the cost, complexity, and delay in installation.</p>



<p>As promised, the plumber obtained the heat pump water heater, an <a href="https://americanstandardwaterheaters.com/product/hybrid-heat-pump-water-heater/">American Standard</a> 50-gallon unit (model ASHPWH-50). Installation took about two days and involved running a considerable amount of pipe from the old location in the attic to the new location in the garage, installing a new 30-ampere 220-volt electrical circuit at the heater, and bracing against earthquakes. The installation went well, except a defective water leak sensor had to be bypassed.</p>



 First Impressions 



<p>The first thing I noticed about the new water heater was its significant noise. The specification sheet listed it as emitting 40.1 dBA, which is about the same as a refrigerator’s (and also an implausibly specific value). However, the water heater was much louder than this.</p>



<p>The on-demand water heater spoiled us: we never ran out of hot water. We soon found that not to be the case with the new water heater, and I turned the water volume for my showers much lower than before. Perhaps scarcity is a good thing.</p>



<p>The new water heater is a “hybrid” unit with a heat pump and also a conventional heating element. It has several modes: </p>



 
 Green (heat pump only) 



 Comfort (“rational use of the heat pump and, if necessary, the heating element”) 



 Fast (heat pump + heating element) 



 i-Memory (“learns your habits and replicates them autonomously”) 



 Electric (heating element only) 
 



<p>There’s also a Boost mode, which is like Fast, but reverts to the previous mode when it gets up to temperature. Initially, it was set for Comfort, but I couldn’t understand when it was and wasn’t running the heating element. I asked product support and the installer, but I still couldn’t make sense of Comfort mode, so we changed to Green. I manually turn on the Boost feature when we need extra hot water.</p>



 The noise issue 



<p>The noise generated by the water heater was bothersome, especially since it was noticeable in my office adjacent to the garage. I downloaded a sound level measurement app on my phone. I sent a video to American Standard (actually Ariston) product support. They told me I had not measured it under the right conditions. Of course, my garage is not an anechoic chamber.</p>



<p>I consulted “the internet” and found conflicting answers about the noise generated by heat pump water heaters. Some comments described them as very noisy, and others found them quite acceptable. I tried to find others locally with similar water heaters for comparison and failed. In late 2024, the behavior of the water heater changed: sometimes it had a loud “whirr,” and sometimes it didn’t. This prompted me to make several recordings of the sound (and analyze it with a spectrum analyzer app) and determine that much of the excess noise was coming from the fan in the heat pump. I again contacted product support, and they agreed to ship me a replacement fan. My plumber replaced it, and the noise is much better now.</p>



 The app 



<p>Like many new devices, the water heater connects to the internet through my WiFi and, through a cloud service, allows an app on my phone to control and monitor it. The app, called Comfort Link, is acceptable but less than excellent.</p>



<p>Good:</p>



 
 Allows me to remotely control the water heater, including turning on Boost mode when needed and turning off the water heater when we’re on vacation 



 Displays the water heater temperature so I can judge whether to take a shower 



 Shows the history of power usage by the water heater by month, day, and hour 
 



<p>Not so good:</p>



 
 The water heater has an icon that appears when it judges when it’s OK to shower. This isn’t on the app, but it would be very useful. 



 The water heater temperature shown on the app doesn’t agree with that shown on the water heater. The support people explained that the water heater has several temperature sensors, and the app displays (I think) the average between the tank top and tank bottom temperature. But that doesn’t explain why the front panel displays something different. 



 Limited history of power usage data (e.g., daily data for only the current and previous month) 



 Poor resolution of power usage data. Measurements seem only to be taken only once per hour, so the heating element usage is reported in 4.5 kWh increments and the heat pump in 0.5 kWh increments. 



 There seems to be no API to download data other than through the app. 
 



 Efficiency 



<p>The heat pump is indeed more efficient than the electric heating element. This is suggested by the usage graph, where the orange bars represent energy usage from the heating element:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/img_1319.jpg"></a>



<p>But of course, the days we used the heating element are also days where I turned on Boost mode because we were using more hot water, which exaggerates the difference. I measured the tank temperature over time as it heated up:</p>



 
 Heating element (4.5 kW): temperature rise 68.9°F/hr = 15.3°F/kWh 



 Heat pump (0.45 kW): temperature rise 17.3°F/hr = 38.7°F/kWh (77°F ambient) 



 Heat pump (0.45 kW): temperature rise 11.9°F/hr = 26.5°F/kWh (61°F ambient) 



 Heat pump (0.45 kW): temperature rise 11.4°F/hr = 25.3°F/kWh (57°F ambient) 
 



<p>As expected, the heat pump’s efficiency depends on the ambient temperature, which determines the amount of heat the heat pump can “harvest” from the air. Compared with the heating element, the heat pump’s overall efficiency ranges from a factor of 1.65 to 2.53.</p>



 Operating cost 



<p>The heat pump water heater is efficient, but is it more cost-effective than our previous gas water heater? As noted above, it isn’t possible to make an exact comparison because we don’t know how our usage may have changed. If we make the worst-case assumption that our usage hasn’t changed, we are now using an average of about 5.3 kWh per day (153 kWh/month divided by 29 days). At an off-peak rate of $0.44/kWh, that works out to $2.33/day. Counting only those days where we used only the heat pump, that’s about 4 kWh/day or $1.76/day. Before getting the new water heater, our gas usage was about 8 therms/month, virtually all of which was for hot water. At our current rate of about $2.50/therm, that works out to $20/month or $0.67/day.</p>



<p>As our plumber had hinted when we installed the new water heater, gas is relatively inexpensive compared to electricity at current prices (unless you’re generating your own electricity). While an electric heat pump water heater is efficient and ecologically responsible, don’t expect it to save you money at current rates.</p>

<p>Client assertions is a method of client authentication which can be used in OpenID Connect. This provides an alternative to client secrets. This approach enhances security by using signed tokens (JWTs) to authenticate clients during the token request process or the OAuth PAR request. In ASP.NET Core, client assertions is not supported per default, a small implementation is required.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-client-assertion">https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-client-assertion</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>A client assertion can be added to the token request which is sent from the ASP.NET Core backend to the OpenID Connect server. This is sent instead of the a client secret. The client is authenticated using the assertion. If using OAuth, the assertion is sent in the PAR request.</p>







<p></p>



 Create client assertion JWT 



<p>The application uses Microsoft Entra ID as the OpenID Connect server and the identity provider. The assertion was created using the Microsoft documentation.</p>



<p>Original src: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/web-apps-apis/confidential-client-assertions#crafting-the-assertion">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/web-apps-apis/confidential-client-assertions#crafting-the-assertion</a></p>



<p>A X509Certificate2 is used to create the certificate and validate the certificate. The audience, the clientId and the sub claims are sent in the JWT client assertion as well as the standard claims signed with the private key of the certificate used to validate the assertion in Microsoft Entra ID. As always, if using this against a different OpenID Connect server, JWT will be validated differently. Microsoft Entra ID requires a RSA key size 2048. </p>


  
public static class CertService
{
    public static string GetSignedClientAssertion(
          X509Certificate2 certificate, string aud, string clientId)
    {
        // no need to add exp, nbf as JsonWebTokenHandler will add them by default.
        var claims = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;()
        {
            { "aud", aud },
            { "iss", clientId },
            { "jti", Guid.NewGuid().ToString() },
            { "sub", clientId }
        };

        var securityTokenDescriptor = new SecurityTokenDescriptor
        {
            Claims = claims,
            SigningCredentials = new X509SigningCredentials(certificate)
        };

        var handler = new JsonWebTokenHandler();
        var signedClientAssertion = handler.CreateToken(securityTokenDescriptor);

        return signedClientAssertion;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Using Micrsoft Entra ID as the OpenID Connect server, the client assertion is created using the token endpoint. In production, the certificate can be generated using Azure Key Vault. The certificate can also be read from the operating system store. This can all be set in the app.settings.</p>


          // single tenant
        var aud = $"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{builder.Configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"]!}/oauth2/v2.0/token";

        var clientAssertion = CertService.GetSignedClientAssertion(
            X509CertificateLoader.LoadPkcs12FromFile("cert_rsa512.pfx", "1234"),
            aud,
            builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"]!);
  


<p></p>



 Use the client assertion in the OpenID connect client 



<p>Once ready, the OnAuthorizationCodeReceived event can be used to added the assertion in the OpenID Connect client. If using PAR, the par event is used.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, oidcOptions =&gt;
    {
        oidcOptions.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        oidcOptions.Scope.Add(OpenIdConnectScope.OpenIdProfile);
        oidcOptions.Scope.Add("user.read");
        oidcOptions.Scope.Add(OpenIdConnectScope.OfflineAccess);
        oidcOptions.Authority 
         = $"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{builder.Configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"]}/v2.0/";
        oidcOptions.ClientId = builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"];
        //oidcOptions.ClientSecret = builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientSecret"];
        oidcOptions.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
        oidcOptions.MapInboundClaims = false;
        oidcOptions.SaveTokens = true;
        oidcOptions.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType 
          = JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Name;
        oidcOptions.TokenValidationParameters.RoleClaimType = "role";

        oidcOptions.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
        {
            // Add client_assertion            
            OnAuthorizationCodeReceived = context =&gt;
            {
                context.TokenEndpointRequest!.ClientAssertion = clientAssertion;
                context.TokenEndpointRequest.ClientAssertionType 
                 = "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer";
                return Task.FromResult(0);
            }
        };
    });
  


<p></p>



 Setup Entra ID App registration 



<p>An Azure App registration is used to authenticate using Micrsoft Entra ID. The public key of the certificate can be uploaded to to the App registration. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Client assertions can be used for any OpenID Connect confidential client if the OpenID Connect server supports this. The assertion can be sent in the token request or in the PAR request depending on the flavor of the OpenID Connect code flow used.</p>



 Creating the certificate 



<p>The github <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-client-assertion/blob/main/CreateSelfSignedCertsConsole/Program.cs">repository</a> linked at the top, provides an example to create your own certificate which can be used in this flow. You can also use Azure Key vault or any other tool to create the certificate.</p>

So I could not be more excited to have Dr. Nicole Forsgren on the podcast. Nicole is the creator of the widely adopted DORA and SPACE frameworks, co-author of the award-winning book Accelerate and the DevOps Handbook (2nd edition), and author of the State of DevOps reports. She is currently a Partner at Microsoft Research, leading developer productivity research and strategy, and is currently working on a book about developer experience with Abi Noda. It’s safe to say that Nicole is one of the foremost experts in developer productivity — if not the foremost expert.</p><p>In this episode, we discuss:</p>  <p>Why PRs and Diffs are incomplete as a solo metric and how to view them in context</p>  <p>The importance of a holistic set of metrics for evaluating productivity</p>  <p>An overview of DORA’s four key metrics, its strengths, and its limitations</p>  <p>The evolution of processes and tools since DORA, including SPACE</p>  <p>What developer experience is—and concrete ways to improve it</p>  <p>Common characteristics of highly productive engineering teams</p>  <p>How faster onboarding might challenge Brook’s Law</p>  <p>How AI tooling is impacting developer productivity and best practices for experimentation</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this episode:</p><p>1. Measuring the number of PRs is controversial for a good reason. Measuring any single one “output” can be misused: and when devs know it is being measured, they will optimize for it.</p><p>However, measuring PRs is important: but to do it well, don’t look at it as an individual performance metric. Instead, use it to understand how well (or not well) systems across the team and company are working. For example, what systems are getting in the way of PRs taking long to merge?</p><p>2. DORA and SPACE both have their own limitations. DORA is very well-defined in the metrics it measures. However, a massive limitation it has is how it only measures from commit to production.</p><p>SPACE can be used to measure the complete developer workflow – including e.g. planning, coding, and even post-release. In turn, it is a more vague framework where you need to put in more effort to make it useful for your envirnment.</p><p>3. AI developer tools don’t change DevEx fundamentals. DORA and SPACE are still relevant. AI tools might be able to improve iteration speed, or make certain tasks more helpful. It’s really an open question how exactly this will play out. There’s a fair chance these tools significantly change how we do development. So if you’re a dev: experiment with them!</p><p>4. Developer experience (DevEx) is not necessarily great at large companies and poor at startups. Google is known to have standout developer experience thanks to so much investment it put into systems – but not all large companies are like this!</p><p>Startups have less resources to invest specifically in improving DevEx: but then again, they have less infrastructure in-place! The more custom infrastructure you have, the more painful DevEx tends to be (and the more in-house tools need to be built to mitigate this)</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-bae">Measuring Developer Productivity: Real-World Examples</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/developer-productivity-a-new-framework">A new way to measure developer productivity – from the creators of DORA and SPACE</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/linkedin-engineering-efficiency">Measuring Engineering Efficiency at LinkedIn</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/uber-eng-productivity">How Uber is Measuring Engineering Productivity</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-productivity">Measuring software engineering productivity</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=123s">02:03</a>) PRs and Diffs and how to view them in the right context</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=462s">07:42</a>) EngThrive at Microsoft</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=626s">10:26</a>) The importance of having a holistic set of metrics in evaluating productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1020s">17:00</a>) The four key metrics of DORA</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1437s">23:57</a>) The evolution of processes and tools since DORA, including SPACE</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1600s">26:40</a>) An explanation of developer experience — and ways to improve it</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1844s">30:44</a>) Devex at startups vs. larger companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=2060s">34:20</a>) Why measuring developer productivity is so difficult</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=2345s">39:05</a>) How to make a case for platform teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=2674s">44:34</a>) Common characteristics of highly productive teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3061s">51:01</a>) Brook’s law and how faster onboarding might make it irrelevant</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3169s">52:49</a>) Onboarding for internal transfers</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3258s">54:18</a>) Shifting culture towards technology first</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3516s">58:36</a>) How middle management can improve engineering culture</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3816s">1:03:36</a>) How AI tooling is impacting developer productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=4002s">1:06:42</a>) Potential use cases for AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=4120s">1:08:40</a>) A case for experimenting with AI coding tools and how to maintain flow state</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=4530s">1:15:30</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Measuring Developer Productivity   <p>PRs and diffs can be both good and bad signals when measuring developer productivity. Many leaders focus on the traditional economic definition of productivity: the rate of output or output per input.</p>  <p>PRs can give a view into the work being done, but senior engineers may have lower PR output due to other responsibilities like unblocking others, architecture, mentoring, and recruitment. It's important to consider the context and who is being measured.</p>  <p>A constellation of metrics is better than a single metric for a holistic view. So yes: it can be helpful to get data on PRs – as long as you get a lot more other data points as well!</p>    <p>Microsoft's EngThrive: this framework (which Nicole works on) uses multiple metrics across dimensions, inspired by the SPACE framework, alongside qualitative feedback.</p>  <p>Easy-to-operationalise measures can be useful. However, they only show a few things and may ignore important aspects.</p>  <p>SPACE: a framework that groups metrics into:</p>  <p>Satisfaction</p>  <p>Performance</p>  <p>Activity</p>  <p>Communication</p>  <p>Efficiency.</p>  <p>Nicole is a co-author of the framework. It’s one that is getting a lot wider adaptation. See <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/122054454/dora-space-and-the-need-for-a-new-approach">an overview of the SPACE framework</a></p>    <p>Absent engineering leadership is unhelpful. No matter what metrics you use: if engineering leadership is not connected with the work, outcomes are likely to be a lot worse.</p>  <p>Metrics collected in a holistic way, on the other hand, can guide decisions about company-wide blockers.</p>   DORA frameworkand its evolution   <p>Nicole is the co-creator of DORA</p>  <p>DORA can refer to the entire research program. More frequently though, people tend to refer to the 4 DORA metrics:</p>  <p>Deployment frequency</p>  <p>Lead time for changes</p>  <p>Change failure rate,</p>  <p>Time to restore service</p>    <p>These 4 metrics are a good indicator of how well a development pipeline is working</p>  <p>DORA can be adapted for different environments, such as air-gapped systems, by redefining the scope of the deployment pipeline.</p>  <p>DORA does not show the full picture. DORA metrics serve as a signal for how well a team is doing, but it does not show the complete picture. DORA focuses on commit to production. This is a part of the engineering process that can be made pretty efficient.</p>  <p>Fast feedback is important, as is the ability to set up environments and provision resources quickly.</p>  <p>SPACE evolved from DORA. SPACE considers the entire end-to-end toolchain. SPACE metrics can be applied to specific components, like PRs. DORA is essentially one of many instances of SPACE.</p>   Developer Experience   <p>Developer experience is a developer's lived experience. This can be “good” – it can also be “bad!”</p>  <p>A good developer experience minimises friction, blockers, and confusion</p>  <p>Security and compliance: these are important! However, automation can minimise manual processes for developers. A secure and compliant dev process does not need to be cumbersome.</p>  <p>Delays and cognitive load from inefficient processes negatively affect developer experience.</p>  <p>Both large and small companies can have good or bad developer experiences. Large companies have more resources but may struggle with legacy systems and bureaucracy. Startups can move fast but lack infrastructure. Google has an exceptional developer experience because they invest in it and don't tolerate friction.</p>   Improving Engineering Teams   <p>Most work in software is invisible, and systems are increasingly complex.</p>  <p>Leaders and executives often don't feel the pain of developers.</p>  <p>To make a case for investment in tooling: use both data and stories. Present the trade-offs realistically.</p>  <p>Acknowledge that there's a tipping point where further investments won't deliver much more progress.</p>  <p>Frame requests in terms of trade-offs and potential for repurposing teams.</p>    <p>High-performing teams:</p>  <p>Exhibit psychological safety, curiosity, and openness to better ways of doing things.</p>  <p>Onboarding time is a great indicator of team efficiency.</p>  <p>A “dummy pull request” early during the onboarding phase (e.g. day 1!) can significantly increase productivity. Try it!</p>  <p>If onboarding is slow: adding people to a late project can backfire. But if onboarding is fast: this can actually work!</p>      <p>Engineering culture transformations:</p>  <p>These require changing the entire company culture, not just the tech culture.</p>  <p>Changing how people do their work can lead to cultural impacts.</p>  <p>Introducing faster tools and ways of working changes people's lived experience.</p>  <p>To improve the engineering culture, summarize observations, seek feedback, and involve others in finding improvements.</p>  <p>Aim for quick wins with visible impact, like hack days to address paper cuts.</p>     Impact of AI on Developer Productivity   <p>DORA and SPACE relevance:</p>  <p>DORA metrics should remain relevant</p>  <p>SPACE is still applicable for assessing satisfaction, performance, activity, communication, and efficiency.</p>    <p>Changes AI is likely to bring:</p>  <p>There’s some chance that AI tools einvent development and software engineering, particularly in IDEs and testing.</p>  <p>Coding assistants: AI-powered ones can improve code readability and unit test success rates</p>  <p>PR reviews: an obvious place for AI to help</p>  <p>Support roles like release engineering and deployment: could be a use case</p>    <p>Experiment with AI!</p>  <p>Experimenting with AI tools and adapt to your workflows.</p>  <p>Assess AI tools to see what works, and focus on problem-solving and architecture.</p>  <p>When you find the workflows where AI is helpful: you might be able to preserve flow better</p>  <p>Turn off autocomplete and autosuggestions if they are an interruption!.</p>    <p>Consider AI as a different way to work, such as "driving and reviewing" or "guiding".</p>  <p>LLMs are changing software engineering rapidly.</p>   Book recommendations <p>Nicole recommends reading:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.svpg.com/books/inspired-how-to-create-tech-products-customers-love-2nd-edition/">Inspired</a> by Marty Cagan</p>  <p><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/outlive/">Outlive</a> by Peter Attia</p>  <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enders-Game-Ender-Quintet-1/dp/1250773024">Ender's Game</a> for some good fiction reading</p>   Resources &amp;

<p>It’s the end of an era: after eight incredible years, it felt like the right time to close the chapter on my story at <a href="http://www.uniken.com">Uniken</a>. When <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Uniken+Announces+Nishant+Kaushik+as+Chief+Technology+Officer/12739642.html">I joined as CTO</a>, Uniken was an ambitious startup with a unique core technology and a vision to make a global impact. What made the ensuing journey so rewarding was the team – exceptionally talented, deeply committed, and relentlessly innovative. Together, we navigated complex challenges, scaled through uncertainty (including a global pandemic), and built Uniken into a global cybersecurity leader with customer engagements on every continent (except Antarctica, because sadly it would appear that penguins aren’t really concerned about digital trust).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am incredibly proud of the team, and the platform we built – one that empowers businesses to engage securely and seamlessly with their customers, and creates lasting value for our customers and partners.&nbsp; I want to express my deepest gratitude to my colleagues and partners at Uniken. Our collaborative efforts transformed the company and positioned it for long-term success, and I look forward to seeing you scale new heights.</p>

<p>Last week, we looked into data from global hiring agency Indeed that found software development job listings are <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-124">at a five-year low</a>. To check how representative (or not) these numbers are of the tech jobs market, I pinged some tech recruiters. The response was not what I expected:</p><blockquote><p>“I can only talk about our own niche from seed-stage to Series C engineering recruitment, but we’ve never had so many positions to fill as in 2024.” – Asher Hoffman, cofounder of <a href="https://www.coastalrecruiting.co/">Coastal Recruiting</a></p><p>“In 2024, every month was a step up in the number of job searches we did for CTO, VP of engineering, director of engineering and product leadership positions. It just kept going up. 2024 was our second-best year ever for the number of searches done: only 2021 was better, and that was an incredible year; the peak of the job market.” – Glenn Murphy, managing partner at <a href="https://www.rivierapartners.com/">Riviera Partners</a></p></blockquote><p>These data points stick out and I was eager to learn more; after all, they’re bucking the trend in Indeed’s figures, with rising demand for tech professionals! I met Asher and Glenn to get their perspectives, and they also offered some tactics for engineers and engineering leaders to use when seeking new opportunities. Today, we cover:</p>  <p>What are boutique recruiters? Also, the differences between contingent and retained ones.</p>  <p>Hiring by tech stack at early-stage startups. Fifty percent of hires are backend, 25% fullstack, 10-15% AI/ML, and 5% are frontend. A big surprise is virtually no demand for native mobile developers, or for the .NET and Java tech stacks. Also, very few mentions of Angular or Vue.</p>  <p>More demand than before at Coastal and Riviera. Both recruitment businesses are seeing more engineering jobs to be filled coming their way.</p>  <p>Changes across the market. More money and demand from early-stage VC-funded startups, and private equity becoming more dominant in driving demand for engineering executive hiring.</p>  <p>Startups want ‘cracked’ engineers. These are professionals with a track record of ownership, curiosity, and the ability to “grind.” Length of experience doesn't matter after around the 2-year point.</p>  <p>Demand for engineering leadership positions. Data indicates that large parts of the job market are struggling more than the senior role segment, with director of engineering roles hardest to fill.</p>  <p>What search processes look like. Recruitment experts explain how a typical software engineer search and engineering executive search plays out.</p>  <p>For updates on how these two recruiters see the market, follow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asherhoffman/">Asher Hoffman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennmurphy24/">Glenn Murphy</a> on LinkedIn.</p><p>A quick programming note: there will be no The Pulse on Thursday — I’m taking a short winter break. More details in my <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about#§publishing-schedule-and-holidays">publishing schedule</a>.</p> 1. What are boutique recruiters? <p>Coastal Recruiting and Riviera Partners are specialized recruitment agencies; also known as "boutique search”, “contingent”, “retained”, or “executive” recruiters.</p><p>“Boutique” and “specialized” refer to recruiters which focus on a niche within tech, such as:</p>  <p>Software engineer and AI+ML engineer hiring for early-stage startups (Coastal Recruitment)</p>  <p>Director-and-above engineering leadership, and product/design leadership for scaleups and larger companies (Riviera Partners)</p>  <p>Executive recruitment is a subset of boutique recruitment. These companies recruit for executive roles like director of engineering, VP of engineering, head of engineering, CTO roles, etc. In the US, high-profile firms can charge $100K or more to recruit a key position like CTO for a late-stage scaleup.</p><p>Executive recruitment firms can also focus on individual contributor (IC) roles. Glenn Murphy advises that this usually happens only in the US at their firm, and comes with tradeoffs. For example, the cost becomes justifiable only when the vacancy’s comp package is several times higher than the search cost; usually $500K and above. It is this niche area in which an expert executive recruiter can make the most impact by finding truly standout candidates.</p><p>Within the boutique search sector, there are two main types of recruiter:</p> Contingent recruiters <p>These companies work on a “no hire, no fee” basis, and only get paid for successfully filling a position; usually 10-40% of the role’s first-year salary. This service is an easy sell; it’s low risk financially for an employer to work with a contingent recruiter due to no-hire-no-fee. Contingent recruiters also often have more clients than retained ones do.</p><p>Coastal Recruiting mostly does contingent recruitment, with a couple of retained contracts. This company specializes in hiring software engineers from the first hire to engineer number 20 to 30 at early-stage startups. In 2024 they worked with around 100 different startups.</p> Retained recruiters <p>Most executive recruitment companies operate a retainer model and charge upfront, regardless of whether a hire is made. Payment comes in a fixed number of instalments, perhaps in this order:</p>  <p>Initial retainer: the first third of the fee, paid at the start.</p>  <p>Progress retainer: second payment, usually tied to milestones being hit, such as:</p>  <p>Presenting a shortlist of qualified candidates who are ready to engage</p>  <p>Completing screening interviews and drawing up a interview shortlist of preferred candidates</p>  <p>Final interviews scheduled or completed</p>    <p>Final payment: upon successful placement. Depending on the agreement, there may be no payment if a candidate isn’t hired</p>  <p>A search company may also be paid monthly while conducting a search. Total retainer fees are usually 25-50% of the value of the successful candidate’s comp, which increases the more challenging the search is. For example, it’s challenging to find a new CTO for a 300-person scaleup growing at a 10x pace, who is hands-on, has worked with AI / machine learning (ML) before, and who has experience at a hypergrowth company, and also in Big Tech. There aren’t too many people who fit this profile, and not many of them may be interested in switching jobs.</p><p>Guarantee periods can also be an important part of retained searches, under which a portion of the fee may be refunded should a successful candidate quits shortly afterwards.</p><p>Retained recruiters are a lot more expensive than contingent ones, and are the go-to choice for executive recruitment where vacancies may not even be publicly listed by an employer.</p><p>Riviera Partners is one of the best-known executive recruiter companies. They hire for director+ roles in engineering, product and design. In our deepdive <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/43780977/engineering-leadership-positions">Finding the next company to work at</a>, they were the most recommended exec recruiter firm by engineering leaders.</p><p>Seed-stage and early-stage startups typically only use executive recruiters to hire for VP-and-above positions which report to the CEO. Later-stage startups also hire for director positions, and may pay for a search for senior-and-above hires and ICs. However, the cost means this is rare, happens mainly in the US, and by funded scaleups with very specific needs.</p><p>Given this process can be so expensive, it may not be immediately obvious what the upside is. Glenn explains:</p><blockquote><p>“We have 21 years worth of data and information on who has been successful, people’s interests and nuance that isn’t available on a LinkedIn profile.</p><p>We save companies a lot of time, in the end. This is due to the insights we have and our reach across the USA and Europe. We know what’s needed at Series A, all the way through to which profiles tend to succeed at publicly traded companies. We also have the know-how on how to interview people to assess if they’re up for the challenge.”</p></blockquote><p>Riviera’s pricing is atypical, compared to many other retained recruiters. Glenn shares:</p><blockquote><p>“We have time-based milestones as opposed to shortlists or incentives, which can be adjusted sometimes. However, for the most part, the fee is fully paid within 90 days.”</p></blockquote> 2. Hiring by tech stack at early-stage startups <p>At Coastal Recruiting, Asher hires early engineering teams at early-stage startups: from seed-stage startups to Series B and Series C companies. They work with some of the largest US VC investors (like a16z, Y Combinator, Sequoia, Index, Lightspeed, Founders Fund and others).</p> Types of engineers and tech stack <p>Asher sees the hiring demand split like this:</p><p>‘50% of hires we make are backend engineers. I don’t think this will always be the case for startup engineering. The first 3 hires for a company with technical cofounders are almost always backend engineers. It’s a bonus if they have some frontend skills, but I’d peg it at 80% backend, 20% frontend.</p><p>‘For backend tech stacks, these are the languages founders use, which candidates would be expected to pick up quickly. By popularity:</p>  <p>Typescript: easily the most common.</p>  <p>Python: surprisingly popular, usually with another language like Typescript or Go. I assume it’s because so much AI and ML work can be done with it, and it’s a generally useful language</p>  <p>Go: This has gotten somewhat more popular, over time</p>  <p>Rust: especially popular with crypto companies. About 15% of our portfolio is crypto, and Rust is very popular. We’re on the lookout for people with hands-on experience in Rust</p>  <p>Ruby: Out of around 100 clients in the past year, only 2 used Ruby; both of them are pretty big names. They told us “find us anyone who has touched Ruby or Ruby on Rails, and is good.”</p>  <p>Few to no mentions:</p>  <p>Flutter: we’ve gotten a single Flutter role in the past year</p>  <p>Elixir: once in a while, we have a startup that uses this and needs folks with experience with it. But it’s less common than Ruby.</p>  <p>Java / Scala: we don’t get any requests for this stack, at all. However, if someone has Java or Scala experience, and is open to working in Python, we usually move forward with them</p>  <p>C# / .NET: we’ve only come across a single hardware company asking for this in several years.</p>  <p>PHP: almost zero PHP these days</p>  <p>Haskell: it’s been a couple years since any company asked for this.</p>    <p>‘25% percent are fullstack. These roles almost exclusively employ the following technologies:</p>  <p>React for the frontend. React frameworks like Next or React Router are usually relevant. Overall, 95% of framework mentions are for React.</p>  <p>Typescript as the programming language. Of course, JavaScript is a given</p>  <p>Node as the backend framework</p>  <p>Python is often mentioned</p>  <p>React Native is by far the most popular mobile technology we see, often requested by mobile-first startups that build their app with it.</p>  <p>Angular / Vue: a combined 5% or less.</p>  <p>‘AI and ML is 10-15%,” says Asher. “This hire is almost always one of the first 10, and doesn’t need to be an “in-depth” ML specialist. They usually fit this profile:</p>  <p>Backend generalist</p>  <p>Has worked in an ML or AI-driven company</p>  <p>Is deep into what is going on in AI and how to use LLMs, practically</p>  <p>Hacked AI side-projects themselves. They probably hack on the side, and might use things like LangChain, LangGraph, and other popular LLM tools to play around with.</p>  <p>‘Someone we recently hired for such a role had worked for a year as an AI/ML engineer, not an in-depth, “research-caliber” ML candidate.</p><p>‘As startups grow and mature, eventually they tend to hire more in-depth ML and AI people. However, early-stage companies look for builders who can use AI tools effectively.</p><p>‘5% are frontend engineers. Almost universally, the seventh or eighth hire at a startup is the first frontend engineer. The reason almost always is – and I kid you not! – that the founder is fed up with owning the frontend themself, and is ready to bring in a frontend specialist.</p><p>‘Ironically, this role is one of the hardest to fill because technical founders whom we work with typically expect two things:</p>  <p>Be a great frontend person – this is easier to find</p>  <p>Be great at computer science basics – such as algorithms and CS fundamentals. This is why most people who pass #1 get rejected!</p>  <p>‘Another reason this role is so hard to fill is that the founder often looks for a staff-level frontend engineer. This person might be the first frontend hire, but they ideally want someone who will head up the frontend team, as it grows. It’s difficult to convince people with staff-plus frontend jobs at stable companies and who head up teams, to come and join an early-stage startup where they would be the only frontend person – at least at first!</p><p>‘The best startups are embracing AI – and look for devs who do the same. AI coding tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot are used by all the best startups we recruit for. Founders at these startups often mention that mastering these tools can 10x the productivity of their engineers with faster iteration and the ability to parallelize work.</p><p>‘We don’t see demand for native mobile engineers at all; only React Native. We work with a few “mobile-first” startups who have built impressive mobile apps. All use React Native and look to hire for such experience.</p><p>‘I would assume native hires might become more important after the Series B or Series C rounds. In the early-stage in the US, they are absent – or at least, we see no such demand.’</p><p>Startups don’t care that much if you’ve used their exact stack before. Asher told me:</p><blockquote><p>“I hear over and over again, that a great engineer is a great engineer - and if you don't have experience in the companies current stack - as a talented engineer, you shouldn't have much trouble picking it up quickly. Thus - if your stack doesn't align perfectly with the above most used, it's okay - you can still get the role!”</p></blockquote> 3. More demand than before at Coastal and Riviera <p>Both recruitment companies are seeing record, or near-record business in terms of the number of searches executed.</p><p>More demand from early-stage, VC-funded startups. Asher says:</p><blockquote><p>“In my niche, I’m seeing more hiring than in recent memory.</p><p>I'm seeing many “cracked” engineers with 5+ offers on-hand, and well-funded startups forced to compete by upping their offers to hire the best of the best. I’m seeing higher total comp packages in the early stage space than ever.”</p><p>As we’ll detail below, “cracked” refers to someone with a track record of ownership, who displays curiosity and the ability to grind when needed.</p><p>Asher: “It feels like this is a great time for many folks to leave Big Tech and take a gamble – but not too big a pay cut. Big Tech has done many layoffs and the startups I work with offer similar pay, with a massive equity upside.</p><p>The risks an engineer used to have to take when joining a startup are shrinking in this new market. Well-funded startups are meeting engineers with competitive salaries, health and wellness, and equity. Also, founders are being much more upfront with recruits about their ARR (annual recurring revenue) and progress towards PMF (product-market-fit) than before.</p><p>A disclaimer: I recruit in just the VC-funded, early-stage start-up space, with startups founded by technical founders and backed by well-known VC firms. These are companies that have the money to hire, and a bold vision to build a billion-dollar company. It’s a narrow view of the market.”</p></blockquote><p>Will more companies increase recruitment? At Riviera partners, Glenn Murphy does engineering leadership searches for startups and scaleups. He shares:</p><blockquote><p>“We signed up 58% more searches in 2024 than in 2023 for the US. In Europe, the growth was 61%. The most common search assignment in both continents was for VP Engineering. It feels to me this alone signals a return to a focus on growing teams, as VPs of engineering are hired in preparation to scale up the team’s headcount.”</p></blockquote> 4. Changes across the market <p>I asked both Asher and Glenn what changes have been surprising in their part of the tech hiring market.</p>

<p>This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows. In the previous post, the UI was customized per client, this post customizes inside a single client.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant">https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant</a></p>

 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/02/03/multiple-client-sign-in-customizations-using-duende-identity-provider/">Multiple client sign-in customizations using Duende identity provider</a> 



 Customizing a single client sign-in using parameters in Duende IdentityServer 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution is setup using three different ASP.NET Core applications. In the example code, the “admin” application has different federation authentication options compared to the “shop” client authentication sign-in experience. The client ID from the authentication context is used to customize the look and feel, i.e. the styles, the layout and the options of the client are used to define which federation and authentication options are possible. The shop client can be further customized using authentication parameters sent in the OpenID Connect redirect.</p>







<p></p>



 OIDC client implementation 



<p>In ASP.NET Core the OpenID Connect flow implementation provides multiple events which can be changed or extended. The OnRedirectToIdentityProvider can be used to send custom parameters to the OpenID Connect server. The OAuth Pushed authorization request on top of OpenID Connect Core is used used per default in .NET 9, if the OpenID Connect server supports this.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect(options =&gt;
{
    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    // other options ...

    options.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
    {
        OnRedirectToIdentityProvider = context =&gt;
        {
            context.ProtocolMessage.SetParameter("showadminsignin", "false");

            return Task.FromResult(0);
        }
    };
});
  


<p></p>



 Duende sign-in customization 



<p>In the previous post, a new sign-in UI was created for each client. The shop client has further customization. In this demo, the admin external provider can be hidden or displayed depending on what the client requests. The UI is implemented using ASP.NET Core Razor pages and a BindProperty is used for this.</p>


  [BindProperty]
public bool ShowAdminSignIn { get; set; } = true;
  


<p></p>



<p>When processes the authentication using Duende and ASP.NET Core Identity, the GetAuthorizationContextAsync method can be used to get the client requested parameters.</p>


  var context = await _interaction.GetAuthorizationContextAsync(returnUrl);
ShowAdminSignIn = !(context?.Parameters["showadminsignin"] == "false");
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI can implement any display logic using the client parameters sent in the request. In this demo, the admin UI is hidden or displayed using the client request data.</p>


  @foreach (var provider in Model.View.VisibleExternalProviders)
{
 if (!(!Model.ShowAdminSignIn &amp;&amp; 
	(provider.AuthenticationScheme == "AdminEntraID")))
 {
	 &lt;li class="list-inline-item"&gt;
		 &lt;a class="btn btn-secondary"
			asp-page="/ExternalLogin/Challenge"
			asp-route-scheme="@provider.AuthenticationScheme"
			asp-route-returnUrl="@Model.Input.ReturnUrl"&gt;
			 @provider.DisplayName
		 &lt;/a&gt;
	 &lt;/li&gt;
 }
}
  


<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This is an easy approach to implement UI customization on a per client basis. The is UI logic and not authorization. The different options  are just hidden or removed from the UI using the client parameters, the logic MUST not work if this is a security requirement. This is not authorization.</p>

Important, but of secondary importance to the business. But as computer systems come to intermediate almost every interaction the business has with employees, contractors, partners, and customers, dynamic authorization should be seen as a strategic business enabler. Investing in a robust, flexible, and pervasive authorization infrastructure can drive revenue growth, operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and competitive differentiation.</p> Reducing Operational Costs <p>Manually managing access using rigid, static authorization models like ACLs and groups is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Organizations that rely on static methods often have employees who are dedicated to managing permissions for employees and others. These employees also perform manual audits, track down problems, and manage groups. As the organization grows, these processes become more complex—scaling superlinearly due to interactions in the system.</p><p>Dynamic authorization automates many of these access control decisions, reducing the need for manual intervention. This has several benefits:</p>  <p>Lower administrative overhead—eliminating the need for manually managing permissions and groups reduces administrative costs.</p>  <p>Reduced risk of over-permissioning—accounts with permissions they no longer need are the source of many costly security breaches.</p>  <p>Reduced security insurance premiums—many organizations buy costly insurance for security breaches and ransomware. Better authorization practices and systems can reduce premiums.</p>  <p>Fewer support tickets for access problems—tickets that require IT to drop what they’re doing to sort out a permissioning problem take these critical employees away from work that advances the organization’s products and services.</p>  <p>Improved onboarding and offboarding efficiency—dynamic authorization can ensure new employees or contractors have all the access they need on day one and lose it as soon as they leave.</p>  <p>Improved operational efficiency gives the organization the freedom to explore and grow instead of constantly battling access management problems.</p> Enabling Business Agility and Innovation <p>As more and more business is conducted online, organizations are finding that it’s vital to quickly react to changing business needs. Whether an organization is launching a new product, expanding into new markets, reacting to new regulatory requirements, or enabling new partnerships, being able to flexibly adapt to emerging requirements and support innovation is table stakes for successful organizations.</p><p>As we’ve discussed, static authorization methods require manual changes to lists and groups to increase or decrease access to systems. For example, a financial services firm that is employing external auditors for compliance reviews must grant access for the duration of the engagement. A dynamic authorization system makes this as easy as a policy change. Even that might not be required if authorization policies have been written so as to anticipate this kind of need.</p><p>New products often require custom code to support authorization requirements for customers and administrators. A workforce management service provider launching a new employee onboarding product must ensure that customers can properly authorize varying access levels for their employees to administer and manage the service securely. A dynamic authorization system can be integrated with the new product, allowing developers to build in the right authorization controls without writing custom authorization code.</p> Improving Customer Experience <p>The compelling features of modern SaaS applications, marketplaces, and collaborative services depend on carefully controlling access. In these platforms, dynamic authorization isn’t just for security; it also enhances the user experience and provides enhanced revenue opportunities.</p><p>For example, platforms like Google Docs, Dropbox, and SmugMug all allow their customers to share content with specific people or groups. Dynamic authorization makes this functionality possible.</p><p>Or consider multi-tenant SaaS companies like Workday or Salesforce. Fine-grained authorization allows these companies to isolate customer data while simultaneously allowing granular access within each tenant that follows complex rules. These companies can’t build a single access management system because each tenant requires different access controls depending on their organization, regulatory environment, and internal access policies. Dynamic authorization lets them more easily meet customer needs.</p><p>Finally, many online businesses offer different features to different users depending on subscription levels. Dynamic authorization policies allow this to be done without custom code and give the business flexibility to add or modify subscription levels and features without changing the underlying code.</p> Strengthening Security and Compliance <p>Using dynamic authorization for improved security and regulatory compliance provides several business advantages. Industries like finance, healthcare, and government are heavily regulated. The regulations require organizations to enforce least privilege access, ensure auditability, and dynamically adjust access based on employee roles and changing risk conditions. Organizational benefits from using dynamic authorization include decreased compliance risk, better employee experience, fewer workarounds that introduce security problems, and reduced overall cost.</p> Competitive Differentiation <p>Using dynamic authorization inside products gives organizations a competitive edge by offering a more secure, flexible, and user-friendly product.</p><p>For example, a B2B SaaS company with a product built with fine-grained access control can better attract large enterprise customers who demand flexible, yet secure features. A financial services company that lets customers dynamically set transaction limits based on varying risk signals allows them to reduce fraud while maintaining a rich user experience. A collaboration tool that offers flexible, secure content sharing beats out competitors who use more rigid, static sharing models.</p><p>Organizations can more easily respond to competitor product changes when access management is as simple as a policy change. And dynamic authorization provides these benefits without developers having to write custom code.</p> A Business Necessity <p>The preceding sections offer multiple examples of how dynamic authorization goes well beyond enhanced IT security. Organizations that embrace dynamic authorization gain enhanced operational efficiency through automation, increased business agility to more easily pursue new opportunities, stronger security and compliance with less overhead, and better customer experiences that drive customer engagement and revenue.</p><p>In the era of multi-tenant, AI-enhanced, SaaS applications, dynamic authorization is essential for organizations to securely scale and effectively compete.

<p>Bitcoin failed.  J.P. Koning notes in <a href="https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2025/02/the-end-of-el-salvadors-bitcoin.html">The end of El Salvador’s bitcoin payments experiment</a>:</p>

  <code>But here was a government that was going to champion the stuff, nullifying all of the headwinds against bitcoin in one stroke! The government meddling hypothesis would be put to test.

The Salvadoran government used a combination of sticks and carrots to kick-start adoption. First, let's list the carrots. The capital gains tax on bitcoin was set to zero to remove the hassle of buying stuff with bitcoin. The government also built a bitcoin payments app, Chivo, for all El Salvadoreans to use. (Chivo also supports U.S. dollar payments.) Anyone who downloaded Chivo and transacted with bitcoin would receive a $30 bitcoin bonus—that's a lot of money in El Salvador. Gas stations offered $0.20 off of a gallon of gas for customers who paid with the app. People could also use Chivo to pay their taxes with bitcoin.

The biggest carrot was zero-transaction fees. Any payment conducted with Chivo was free, as was converting bitcoins held in the Chivo app into U.S. dollars and withdrawing cash at Chivo ATMs. These Chivo ATMs were rolled out across El Salvador and in the U.S., too, to encourage the nascent U.S.-to-El Salvador bitcoin remittance route. Bitcoin ATMs are usually incredibly pricey to use, but in El Salvador the government would eat all the transaction fees. What a fantastic deal.

As for the stick, Bukele introduced a forced-tender rule. Beginning in 2021, businesses were required to accept the orange coin or be punished. This was costly for them to comply with. They would have to update point of sale software, signage, train employees, and set up new processes for handling bitcoins post-sale.

By all rights, this combination of sticks and carrots should have led to a flourishing of bitcoin payments. But it didn't.
</code> 
 

<p>Koning concludes:</p>

  <code>The saddest thing about El Salvador's bitcoin experiment is that all sorts of time and resources have been wasted. El Salvador is not a rich country. The money spent on building and operating Chivo, compliance by businesses, bitcoin signage, and subsidies could have been better deployed on more important things like health and education.  One hopes that other countries learn from this experience and avoid going down the same route that El Salvador did.

<p>This blog shows how to implement a delegated OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange RFC 8693 flow in ASP.NET Core, and has a focus on access token management. It looks at how the OAuth Token Exchange can be implemented and how an application can request delegated access tokens on behalf of a user and another application, providing a seamless and secure access to protected resources using a zero trust strategy.</p>

 ASP.NET Core delegated OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange access token management 



 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/03/25/asp-net-core-delegated-microsoft-obo-access-token-management-entra-only/">ASP.NET Core delegated Microsoft OBO access token management (Entra only)</a> 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution implements an ASP.NET Core web application which authenticates using Microsoft Entra ID. The web application uses an API protected with a Microsoft Entra ID access token. This API uses another downstream API protected with Duende IdentityServer. The API exchanges the Microsoft Entra ID access token for a new Duende IdentityServer access token using the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange standard. Both APIs use a user delegated access token. The tokens are persisted on the trusted backend using the IDistributedCache implementation. This can be an in-memory cache or a persistent cache. When using this cache, it is important to automatically renew the access token, if it is missing or invalid.</p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per user session for delegated downstream API user tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. The tokens must be persisted safely in multiple instance setups. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per user session 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely (Safe and encrypted storage if not in-memory) 



 The token must be replaced after each UI authentication (per user) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 



 The application must handle a user logout 
 



 Client Implementation (Entra ID API) 



<p>An OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange token request is sent to the Duende IdentityServer using the ApiTokenCacheClient. The service persists the token in a cache per user. The cache is implemented using the IDistributedCache interface.</p>

 Duende IdentityServer implementation 



<p>Duende IdentityServer provides an IExtensionGrantValidator interface to implement the identity server support for OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange standard. This service must validate the access token and provide the data to issue a new Duende access token. Other validation checks are required like validating the sub claim which represents the user in the delegated access token. It is important to validate the access token fully. The new access tokens should only be issued for the same user. It is important to use a unique identifier from the access token to read data and issue new data for the user. An email is normally not a good solution for this as users can change their email in some IAM solutions.</p>

<p>I made a video today reflecting on how we manage (or don’t) our energy and how our engagement with digital information complicates our lives. I’m proposing that people consider dialing back their social media consumption to spend time reflecting on their thinking, what we have learned over the past five years, and how we can navigate future challenges with integrity and grace. In the space that is created I am hoping some people will experience ontopoetic synchronicities, conversations with the divine, as we become more intentional about how we direct our consciousness and bodies in this 3D world. I would love to hear back from anyone who gives this a try to see what your experience has been. Life is a stage and we are players. Consider this an unplugged improv opportunity where you get to riff with the quantum. </p>

 The People of DRCongo Shed Light on the “Heart of Darkness” as Our Media Looks the Other Way 
<blockquote>
<p><a href="mailto:soljacksteve@gmail.com">Steve Soloman</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping up with world events, important as it is, can nonetheless be fraught. Any Canadian who wishes to stay informed has seen the coverage: autocratic governments flexing their muscles, personality cults rather than responsible governments and the rule of law being threatened even in well-established democracies. The internal rot of misguided populism and hyper partisanship, challenging as they are, are only the first steps along a very rocky road.</p>
<p>Despite what we see and hear, the news is not all bad. There is a place, little noticed and even less understood by most Canadians, where democracy is growing stronger despite a history of violence and exploitation.</p>
<p>When we think of Africa - if we think of it at all - we picture a continent struggling to overcome its colonial past. Tragically for the people who live there, this image is not entirely wrong; Africa has seen nine military coups since 2020. But like elsewhere youth in Africa are the continent’s hope, and Africa is a very young continent, with an average age in 2023 of just under nineteen. Education levels are rising though progress has been slow, due in part to a largely indifferent West. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), despite almost innumerable setbacks, positive strides are being made and there are valuable lessons to be learned if only we would take note. DRC and its people are working to overcome deplorable handicaps to create a government that is, to borrow a phrase, by the people and for the people.</p>
<p>When DRC does get mentioned, it’s because of either disease or warfare. This is largely due to the nature of the media beast; both what it is and what it isn’t. The media consists of profit-seeking businesses, and like any business it provides us with what it knows, or at least believes, we want. What it’s not is a pacifier ready to soothe our jangled nerves. Simply put, bad news sells. The news we get out of DRC is very much a case in point. There are positive developments, but we won’t read about this in mainstream media, not because of any sort of cover-up but rather out of rational business decisions. Thus democracy is evolving in the midst of a continent deserving of far more attention than it gets.</p>
<p>But before we can get to those positives we need to illustrate the circumstances out of which they have grown. This is really the only way we can appreciate what the people of DRC have suffered and continue to endure in their ongoing and heroic attempts to free themselves and achieve what so many of the rest of us take for granted.</p>
<p>DRC lies at the very centre of the African continent. With an area of 2.3 million square kilometres, it’s the second largest African nation after Algeria. It became a Belgian colony in 1908 but Europeans had ‘discovered’ the country well before that; in 1890 Joseph Conrad spent time there and later used it as the setting for Heart of Darkness. The book is a critique both of Belgian exploitation and an attitude toward Congo, and by extension all of Africa, that persists to this day.</p>
<p>Many of us continue to think of Africa as if it was one big country when in fact it contains fifty-four fully independent nations. Ethnically and culturally it’s at least as diverse as any other continent. In terms of its natural resources, DRC is amongst the wealthiest nations on Earth but its people are amongst the poorest. The Belgian colonizers exploited the country’s rubber reserves and more recently many nations, including Canada, have taken advantage of DRC’s vast quantities of copper, cobalt, zinc, silver, gold, bauxite, uranium and coltan. In all, minerals account for 90 per cent of DRC’s exports. To illustrate just one example, eighty per cent of the world’s supply of coltan comes from DRC and that mineral is in all the cell phones and laptops you and I use every day.</p>
<p>Much of the mining in DRC is referred-to as ‘artisanal’, a euphemism which when put into plain English, means men and children, typically boys, working as miners with no safety gear and little or no equipment of any kind beyond pickaxes. The coltan in our phones and computers has very likely come from one of these ‘artisanal’ mining operations. This is in no way meant to suggest we shouldn’t own these things, only that we should be aware; that we should be ready to take positive steps to give back in some way; to end the exploitation.</p>
<p>DRC officially gained its independence from Belgium on June 30th 1960. But the country was utterly unprepared to run its own affairs since the Belgians had taken no steps to prepare their former colonials for the challenges of self-rule. A republican government was established, with both a President and Prime Minister. Patrice Lumumba, a leader of the independence movement, and the country’s first Prime Minister, was both an African nationalist and a member of the pan-African movement. This meant he supported national self-determination and believed in strengthening bonds between all indigenous Africans and the global African diaspora. He played a major role in taking the nation from colony to independence. But his left-of-centre political views, in the midst of the Cold War, made him dangerous in the eyes of several western nations, particularly the United States.</p>
<p>The independence celebrations were short-lived; within a very few days the new nation was faced with what came to be known as the Congo Crisis. With Belgian support the provinces of Katanga and South Kasai seceded and there was also a revolt by members of the military as Black soldiers were no longer willing to accept orders from white officers. The United Nations was preparing to send troops to aid the government against the secessionists but the Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, made a last minute decision not to do so. In response, Lumumba called for assistance from the Soviet Union, which sent ‘military advisors’. The Soviet presence caused a split in the government between Lumumba and the President, Joseph Kasa-Vubu. It was at this point that Joseph-Désiré Mobutu Sese-Seko, a lieutenant-colonel and Lumumba’s chief military advisor, stepped in to break the deadlock by leading a coup-d’etat. Supported by both Belgium and the United States, he expelled the Soviets and established a government that supported his view of Lumumba as a danger to the country. He led a second coup in 1965 that made himself President. About 100,000 people died during this period of political conflict, including Lumumba, who was assassinated on January 17, 1961. Mobutu ruled from 1965 to 1997. In 1971 he changed the country’s name to Zaire. His thirty-year rule also saw European investors expelled and the nationalizing of their companies. He looted the nation’s treasury. In 1990 he agreed to end the ban he had imposed on a multi-party state and formed a transitional government while retaining considerable political power. In 1994 he agreed to the appointment of Kengo Wa Dondo, an advocate for free-market reforms, as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>That same year in neighbouring Rwanda, between April and July, armed groups consisting of Hutu fighters committed genocide against the Tutsi people. Over 800,000 victims, mostly Tutsis, were killed and the violence spread into DRC as small groups of Hutu extremists formed militia groups. Such militias continue to operate in DRC to this day, funded largely by the Rwandan government under the leadership of Paul Kagame. Kagame, who is Tutsi, was a commander of a militia that sought, successfully, to put an end to the genocide. However he later initiated two rebel wars in DRC, the First Congo War, from 1996 to 1997, immediately followed by the Second Congo War of 1998 to 2003. Among horrific atrocities committed was the serial rape and murder of Congolese women. Canada’s Trudeau government, usually so ready to condemn such acts, has remained entirely silent about the continuing actions of the militia groups in DRC. As recently as July 13th of 2024, seventy-two people were killed by armed militia in a village about one hundred kilometres east of the nation’s capital, Kinshasa.</p>
<p>While the equally horrific acts occurring in Ukraine are breathlessly reported within hours, this slaughter in DRC was reported in a Toronto newspaper four days after the event and was buried at the bottom of page five.</p>
<p>Mineral wealth provides the incentive for the ongoing violence. Recent reports indicate that Rwanda’s national army, somewhat ironically named the Rwandan Defence Force, has deployed as many as four thousand soldiers to DRC. Their mission appears to be aiding the militia groups and facilitating the smuggling of minerals into Rwanda. In late January of this year, Rwanda sent even more troops into DRC, in numbers that indicated full-out invasion. Along with a militia group called M23, they captured the capital of DRC’s eastern region, Goma.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s Rwandan-backed militias have taken control of coltan and other mineral-mining operations. The Congolese government estimates that it loses $1 billion (U.S.) each year because of these illegal activities. The Congolese army is fighting to halt these operations but finds itself facing an enemy that is very well armed with modern weapons such as so-called mortar drones. Desertion is also a significant factor, as the militia groups pay their soldiers better wages than DRC can pay. People continue to be forced to flee their homes, a harsh reality in eastern DRC for almost thirty years. This violence has also resulted in severe food shortages as farms are abandoned in areas controlled by militia groups. The only realistic way to put an end to all this would be to confront the Rwandan government directly, with military force if needed. Why this has gone on all this time with no response from the West is a matter for conjecture, though it’s by no means far-fetched to suggest having access to relatively cheap minerals plays a role. A case can also be made that Western governments feel no pressure to act because their citizens are uninformed by media.</p>
<p>DRC has also been plagued by outbreaks of disease. In 1976 the country made headlines due to the outbreak of Ebola, a disease named after a tributary of the Congo River. The Ebola virus was first detected in a village about 110 kilometres from the river but it was decided to name the disease Ebola in order to avoid having the village become forever known as the starting point of this often - though not always - fatal pathogen. There have been subsequent outbreaks that have killed thousands of people. Work to create vaccines began to make progress in 2014. The World Health Organization did much to speed the process and an effective vaccine began to be used in 2016. Recent outbreaks have been quickly brought under control.</p>
<p>There are organizations in the West who lay claim to knowledge of the situation in DRC. Freedom House, a Washington D.C.- based non-profit that assesses how democratic various nations are, continues to list DRC as “not free”. However, a review of current trends suggests that the Freedom House ranking should be reviewed.</p>
<p>In January 2019, when Felix Tshisekedi became President, it marked the first time since independence that the presidency was peacefully transferred from one political party to another. Tshisekedi freed seven hundred political prisoners jailed by his predecessor. Understanding that education is vital to building a free and democratic state, he also invested heavily in schools for DRC’s next generation.</p>
<p>In December 2023 he faced another election, as the country’s constitution requires. Western media tended to focus on claims of voting irregularities that originated mostly with defeated candidates. Voter turnout was 48.8 per cent despite three provinces being unable to safely participate due to ongoing militia violence. That figure marks a small but important increase from the prior election in 2018 when 45.5 per cent of eligible voters cast a ballot (voter turnout in the Ontario election of 2022 was forty-three per cent). Tshisekedi was re-elected by a comfortable margin and reports from well-informed sources within DRC state that the majority of Congolais believe the election was run fairly, the results are credible and that the re-elected President had achieved some positive change that ordinary citizens could see for themselves. The really crucial point is this: if the majority of people in DRC see themselves as living in a democracy, how legitimate can it be for outsiders like Freedom House to claim otherwise?</p>
<p>DRC is just one of many countries that has had a long, hard struggle to achieve democracy, and the hard work of maintaining what has been won never stops. The people of that nation have overcome crushing obstacles, and the progress they’ve made continues to be under siege by those both in Africa and abroad who have very different interests.</p>
<p>Democracy doesn’t just happen by itself. It must be fought for and constantly supported by an informed and active electorate. The people of DRC have learned this vital lesson while too many of us in the West appear to have forgotten it.</p>

<p>Polen, das derzeit den Vorsitz im EU-Rat innehat, <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2025/01/2025-01-30-conseil-pl-compromis-reglement-csam.pdf">schlägt eine wichtige Änderung des viel kritisierten EU-Vorschlags zur Chatkontrolle vor</a>: Anstatt die generelle Durchsuchung privater Chats anzuordnen soll die Chatkontrolle wie bisher im Ermessen der Anbieter stehen. Vertreter der EU-Regierungen werden den Vorschlag in der EU-Arbeitsgruppe für Strafverfolgung <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVIII/EU/9693/imfname_11447708.pdf">am Mittwoch beraten</a>.</p>



<p>“Der neue Vorschlag ist ein Durchbruch und im Kampf um unser digitales Briefgeheimnis ein großer Sprung nach vorn”, kommentiert Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei), ehemaliges Mitglied des Europäischen Parlaments und digitaler Freiheitskämpfer. “Der Vorschlag würde sichere Verschlüsselung schützen und damit die Sicherheit unserer Smartphones. Allerdings blieben drei grundlegende Probleme ungelöst:</p>



<p>1. Massenüberwachung: Selbst wenn Anbieter wie Meta, Microsoft oder Google die Chatkontrolle “freiwillig” praktizieren, ist sie immer noch eine völlig ungezielte und wahllose Massenüberwachung aller privaten Nachrichten über diese Dienste. Nach Angaben der EU-Kommission sind etwa 75 % der Millionen privater Chats, Fotos und Videos, die jedes Jahr von den unzuverlässigen Chatkontrollalgorithmen der Industrie geleakt werden, nicht strafrechtlich relevant und lassen unsere intime Kommunikation in die Hände Unbekannter gelangen, bei denen sie nicht sicher ist und bei denen sie nichts zu suchen hat. Eine ehemalige Richterin des Europäischen Gerichtshofs, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04.pdf">Ninon Colneric</a> (S. 34 f.), und der <a href="https://www.edps.europa.eu/system/files/2024-02/24-01-24_opinion_sexuellen_missbrauchs_kindern_internet_de.pdf">Europäische Datenschutzbeauftragte</a> (Abs. 11) haben gewarnt, dass diese wahllose Überwachung gegen unsere Grundrechte verstößt, selbst wenn sie im Ermessen der Anbieter liegt. In Schleswig-Holstein und Bayern sind bereits zwei Klagen gegen diese Praxis anhängig. </p>



<p>Das Europäische Parlament <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/beitraege/chatkontrolle/#epmandat">schlägt einen anderen Ansatz vor</a>: Die Telekommunikationsüberwachung soll verpflichtend angeordnet werden können, aber auf Personen oder Gruppen beschränkt werden, die mit sexuellem Kindesmissbrauch in Verbindung stehen. Das Parlament schlägt außerdem vor, dass die Anbieter ihre Dienste durch eine Reihe von Voreinstellungen, Nachfragen und Warnungen sicherer für junge Menschen gestalten müssen.</p>



<p>2. Digitaler Hausarrest: Nach dem von Polen unverändert vorgeschlagenen Artikel 6 könnten Nutzer unter 16 Jahren künftig zu ihrem eigenen Schutz vor sexueller Annäherung alltägliche Apps aus dem App-Store nicht mehr installieren. Dazu gehören Messenger-Apps wie Whatsapp, Snapchat, Telegram oder Twitter, Social-Media-Apps wie Instagram, TikTok oder Facebook, Spiele wie FIFA, Minecraft, GTA, Call of Duty, Roblox, Dating-Apps, Videokonferenz-Apps wie Zoom, Skype, Facetime. Ein solches Mindestalter wäre leicht zu umgehen und würde Jugendliche bevormunden und isolieren, anstatt sie zu stärken.</p>



<p>3. Verbot anonymer Kommunikation: Nach dem von Polen unverändert vorgeschlagenen Artikel 4 (3) wäre es Nutzern künftig nicht mehr möglich, anonyme E-Mail- oder Messenger-Konten einzurichten oder anonym zu chatten, ohne einen Ausweis oder ihr Gesicht vorzeigen zu müssen, wodurch sie identifizierbar würden und das Risiko von Datenlecks entstünde. Dies würde z. B. sensible Chats zum Thema Sexualität, anonyme Pressekommunikation mit Quellen (z. B. Whistleblowern) sowie politische Aktivitäten einschränken.</p>



<p>Alles in allem ist der polnische Vorschlag im Vergleich zu den bisherigen Texten ein großer Fortschritt in Bezug auf unsere Sicherheit im Internet, aber er erfordert noch gravierende Nachbesserungen. Gleichzeitig geht der Vorschlag wahrscheinlich schon zu weit für die Hardliner-Mehrheit der EU-Regierungen und die EU-Kommission, deren Überwachungshunger bisher stets so extrem war, dass sie die Opfer lieber ohne Einigung ganz im Stich lassen als eine verhältnismäßige, gerichtsfeste und politisch mehrheitsfähige Alternative zur Chatkontrolle zu akzeptieren.”</p>

 Elevator Pitch for Quantum Realism 
 
<p>Quantum Realism proposes that the physical universe is not fundamental but instead a virtual construct generated by a self-sustaining quantum network or primal consciousness. The physical phenomena we observe, including space, time, energy and matter, are outputs of this underlying quantum process, more like a computational system where the quantum field serves as the substrate for reality. Unlike classical realism, which treats matter as independent and static, Quantum Realism views the universe as a dynamic, evolving system, continuously shaped by observation and interaction.</p>
<p>This theory aligns with the strange findings of modern physics, such as quantum superposition, entanglement, and the observer effect. These phenomena indicate that reality behaves more like information being processed than a collection of static objects. By grounding itself in the principles of quantum mechanics and information theory, Quantum Realism provides a framework that explains physical laws but also integrates consciousness as an active participant in the unfolding of reality.&nbsp;</p>
 
  How Quantum Realism Differs from Other Theories 
 
<p>Quantum Realism stands apart by uniting consciousness and matter within a single quantum substrate. Classical physics focuses on deterministic interactions of matter, while dualism separates consciousness from the material. Quantum Realism suggests that matter emerges from the consciousness field, which acts as a self-generative, non-physical substrate. This explains phenomena like wave-particle duality and the observer effect, where the act of measurement collapses probabilities into specific outcomes.</p>
<p>In contrast to other simulation theories, which claim an external programmer, Quantum Realism describes a holographic reality that is self-generating, requiring no external creator. The consciousness quantum network acts as both the origin and sustainer of reality, dynamically evolving through recursive feedback loops. By embedding consciousness within this process, Quantum Realism resolves the paradox of how non-physical awareness can influence a seemingly physical world, offering a more integrated perspective than either dualism or materialism.</p>
 
  What Led You to This Investigation? 
 
<p>Stemming from my childhood curiosity of electricity and of light, I started learning the math that was required. It was the whole concept of imaginary numbers that got me questioning reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that light oscillates into a imaginary 4th dimension emerged from the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. I later discovered Imaginary numbers are fundamental to describing oscillatory behavior in wavefunctions, suggesting that light and other quantum phenomena extend beyond the three spatial dimensions we perceive. This mathematical insight led me to consider whether these higher-dimensional oscillations underpin the strange behaviors observed in quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement.</p>
<p>For me this opened a pathway to investigate how higher-dimensional processes might generate the physical universe as a lower-dimensional projection. By focusing on the recursive nature of these oscillations, I began exploring how reality could arise from iterative feedback within a quantum network. This exploration ties into Quantum Realism’s premise that space, time, and matter are emergent constructs, projected from the recursive operations of the quantum field.</p>
 
  The Circle of Values 
 
<p>Everything in the universe oscillates (light waves, matter waves, and even biological rhythms) indicating an underlying recursive principle. This principle, that I refer to as the “Circle of Values,” describes how primal consciousness perpetuates creation through cyclic processes. Each oscillation represents a feedback loop in which information from the quantum field interacts with localized nodes, generating structure and coherence across scales. These cycles are fractal-like, with self-similar patterns appearing at every level of reality, from quantum fluctuations to galactic rotations.</p>
<p>This recursive behavior mirrors the properties of fractal mathematics, where complexity arises from simple iterative rules. In Quantum Realism, the Circle of Values represents consciousness in action, continuously manifesting and sustaining the fabric of reality. By oscillating through states, this process generates not only physical structures but also the informational coherence necessary for life and awareness to emerge, illustrating the very deep interconnection between consciousness and the material world.</p>
 
  Holographic Reality vs. Simulations 
 
<p>A holographic reality differs fundamentally from a simulation in that it requires no external programmer or hardware. Instead, it emerges intrinsically from within the quantum field itself, with every fractal part containing information about the whole. This self-generative nature is supported by quantum entanglement, where particles separated by vast distances remain instantaneously correlated. Such behavior suggests that reality operates like a hologram, where local phenomena reflect an interconnected structure.</p>
<p>In contrast to simulations, which rely on predefined algorithms and external input, a holographic reality evolves dynamically through feedback between consciousness agents and the quantum network. This perspective resolves the apparent separation between observer and observed, as both are integrated within the same system. Quantum Realism states that the universe is not a static construct but a living, self-referential system that adapts and evolves as consciousness interacts with it.</p>
 
  Free Will: Participants or Puppets? 
 
<p>Quantum Realism portrays localized consciousness as an active participant in shaping reality. While physical parameters provide constraints (such as natural laws and probabilities) free will emerges as consciousness influences the collapse of quantum states. The observer effect demonstrates this participatory role, where the act of measurement determines which potential becomes reality. Thus, consciousness is not merely a bystander but an integral component of the quantum network.</p>
<p>This dynamic allows for meaningful choice within the parameters of the system. While deterministic factors like genetics and environment play a role, the ability of consciousness to interact with the quantum field introduces variability and agency. In this way, Quantum Realism reconciles the apparent tension between determinism and free will, framing individuals as co-creators within an evolving reality.</p>
 
  What Is Quantization? 
 
<p>Quantization is the process by which continuous possibilities are restricted to discrete units, such as energy levels in an atom. This principle is essential for the stability of physical systems, as it prevents infinite regress and ensures coherence. Without quantization, systems would lack the precision needed for consistent behavior, leading to paradoxes like infinite energy densities in classical physics.</p>
<p>In Quantum Realism, quantization also reflects the underlying processing structure of the quantum network. By discretizing energy, time, and space, the system ensures that interactions remain finite and manageable, enabling the emergence of stable structures like atoms and molecules. This discrete framework not only resolves the infinities problem but also provides a foundation for understanding how coherence and order arise in a fundamentally quantum reality.</p>
 
  Time, Causality, and Superposition 
 
<p>In Quantum Realism, time is not an absolute backdrop but an emergent property of processing cycles within the quantum field. Each cycle represents a discrete step in the evolution of reality, giving rise to the ordered flow of events we perceive as time. Superposition, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously, reflects the quantum field’s ability to hold and process many potentials before they are collapsed into specific outcomes.</p>
<p>Causality emerges from this collapse, as interactions within the quantum network resolve probabilities into ordered sequences. This dynamic interplay between potential and actualization creates the linear progression we experience, while superposition ensures that the system retains flexibility and adaptability. Together, these principles demonstrate how time, causality, and quantum phenomena are deeply interconnected within the framework of Quantum Realism.</p>
 
  The Role of Our 3D Bodies 
 
<p>Our 3D bodies serve as localized nodes within the quantum network, enabling consciousness to interact with the virtual constructs of space and time. By acting as receivers and processors of quantum information, these bodies provide the specificity and coherence needed for complex interactions, such as perception, learning, and decision-making. This localized embodiment allows consciousness to experience and express reality in a focused and constrained way, facilitating exploration and growth.</p>
<p>At the quantum level, our bodies are composed of informational systems governed by quantized interactions, such as atomic vibrations and molecular bonds. These interactions provide the stability necessary for biological processes, while also linking us to the larger quantum network. This dual role (as both physical entities and conduits for consciousness) illustrates the magnificent integration of body, mind, and the quantum substrate.</p>
 
  Reflections on Itzhak Bentov’s Premise 
 
<p>Though admittedly I don’t know much about Bentov, his idea that life represents organized information gifted back to the cosmos aligns with Quantum Realism’s view of consciousness as a dynamic contributor to the quantum field. Each life accumulates unique experiences, which are reintegrated into the system upon death, enriching its informational density and coherence. This cyclical process mirrors the conservation of energy and information observed in physical systems.</p>
<p>By framing life as an exchange of information between localized consciousness and the quantum network, Quantum Realism provides a holistic view of existence. Death is not an end but a transition, where individual contributions are folded back into the universal substrate, furthering the evolution of the system as a whole. This perspective offers both a scientific, existential and spiritual understanding of life’s purpose and continuity.</p>
 
  Hope in Navigating 3D Reality 
 
<p>Quantum Realism offers a hopeful perspective by framing life as an integral part of a coherent, meaningful process. By recognizing that consciousness actively shapes reality, individuals can embrace their role as co-creators within this evolving system. This participatory view inspires purpose and creativity, transforming challenges into opportunities for growth and contribution.</p>
<p>The recursive and interconnected nature of the quantum network suggests that even small actions can have far-reaching effects. This reinforces the idea that every individual’s choices matter, contributing to the larger process of coherence and complexity. In this way, Quantum Realism not only explains the nature of reality but also provides a framework for navigating it with intention and hope.</p>

<p>In the wake of OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-can-operate-your-computer/">releasing Operator</a>, a Computer-Using Agent (CUA), in research preview, I’ve read many breathless posts about the future of Web-based Agentic AI (as opposed to API-based Agentic AI), and how it makes every website “programmable”, even without APIs. If you have worked in software development, you can visualize the mechanics easily – it’s like giving a QA Automation tool like Selenium WebDriver a brain, so that instead of just automating web applications for rinse-and-repeat testing, it can actually read the data, make decisions, adjust course, and take action. That framing should also make it easy to immediately grok how this will break the identity and security infrastructure we currently have, or are putting in place. I mean, we have been dealing with these in our QA Automation projects forever. I thought I’d share the thoughts that immediately jumped to my mind, mostly because I need to not be the only one worrying about these (#MiseryLovesCompany).</p>



<p>1) Bypassing/Breaking/Compromising Authentication Mechanisms</p>



<p>Since CUAs rely on web-based browsing, they necessarily run into some of the same break points that QA automation runs into – like multi factor authentication, bot verification techniques, and more. Any CUA would currently have to give the user back control of the browser to take these actions before proceeding. This high friction point is going to run head first into consumer dissatisfaction and business mandates to “just make it work”, and all of us in identity can guess exactly what will follow:</p>



 
 Users will hand over passwords to their Agent service so it can log in as them, or grant them access to their password managers (probably as a feature getting built into first the browser password manager and then the generic password managers). 



 Users will turn off MFA to allow their agents to work. 



 Any guesses on what will happen to passkeys? If syncing of the private key was the worst that you thought could happen…. 



 There will people looking at how authorized session hijacking can become a feature to leverage, much like how Selenium allows direct manipulation of cookies and local storage, enabling agents to hoover up valid session tokens and bypass login screens. Case in point: <a href="https://github.com/JoshMayerr/passport-mcp">Build MCP servers for any website with automatic browser auth syncing</a> 



 Just like Selenium can sometimes bypass automation (bot) detection protections using headless browsing and user-agent spoofing, expect Agentic AI tools to develop capabilities to do the same. 
 



<p>2) Violating Authorization Boundaries (When They Exist)</p>



<p>QA Automation scripts often execute actions as a high-privilege test user (e.g., an admin account) to avoid breaking tests that are verifying functionality but not data or access restrictions. The rush to deploy Web-based Agentic AI tools will mean that like other tools of the past, it won’t be built with proper scope controls, thereby driving implementors to grant it excessive privileges. You can guess the rest.</p>



<p>As for consumer applications, those rarely have differentiated access control models built in for their users. That means a customer that wants to use a CUA, but limit what it can and cannot do will be out of luck. We saw this play out in the days of screenscraping-based personal finance applications, and how long it took for us to move everyone over to OAuth2 and FAPI as the better and more secure approach.</p>



<p>3) Weakening Security Controls</p>



<p>(aka “Is that a DDoS attack, or an army of Agents here to take advantage of the limited time deal we announced?”)</p>



<p>It won’t just be Authentication controls that are impacted. There are many security protections that will likely be obstacles in the path of Web-based Agentic AI. Would any of us be surprised to find out that IT teams were told to weaken or disable security mechanisms (e.g., Content Security Policy, SameSite cookies, Bot and DDoS detection) to facilitate automated agents, inadvertently creating vulnerabilities?</p>



<p>And these are just what immediately jumped to mind. I am sure there are many more that I’m not even thinking of.</p>



<p>Identity vendors and practitioners everywhere really need to shift into high gear to help organizations properly prepare for what’s headed their way. The demand to support Web-based Agentic AI will put a great deal of pressure on them to enable safe acceptance, and being the “Agent of No” (see what I did there) is not likely to go well. As for what can be done – more on that later.</p>

<p>This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows.</p>

 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/02/03/multiple-client-sign-in-customizations-using-duende-identity-provider/">Customizing a single client sign-in using parameters in Duende IdentityServer</a> 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution is setup using three different ASP.NET Core applications. In the example code, the “Admin” application has different federation authentication options compared to the “Shop” client authentication sign-in experience. The client ID from the authentication context is used to customize the look and feel, i.e. the styles, the layout and the options of the client are used to define which federation and authentication options are possible.</p>







<p></p>



 Customization of the sign-in options 



<p>The EnableLocalLogin parameter and the IdentityProviderRestrictions parameter from Duende IdentityServer can be used to change the sign-in options for the end user of the applications. If the EnableLocalLogin  option is set to false, the define username, password login is disabled. The IdentityProviderRestrictions  setting can be used to define which federation options are allowed for the client sign-in.</p>


  new Client
{
    ClientId = "shop-client-ui",
    
	// more client options ... 

    // show/hide the local authentication screen
    EnableLocalLogin = false

    // federated authentication options to display
	// empty displays all
    IdentityProviderRestrictions = ["AdminEntraID"]
},
  


<p></p>



 Layout Customization for clients 



<p>Sometimes the identity provider application need to display a different look and feel for the different clients. To achieve this, a separate login screen is used and each login screen uses a different layout. The layout and the style are changed using the client ID from the authorization context. If the shop client is used, the user is redirect to a different Razor Page. The UseShopClientDisplay bool is used for this.</p>


  private async Task BuildModelAsync(string? returnUrl)
{
    Input = new InputModel
    {
        ReturnUrl = returnUrl
    };

    var context = await _interaction.GetAuthorizationContextAsync(returnUrl);
    if (context?.Client.ClientId == "shop-client-ui")
    {
        View = new ViewModel
        {
            UseShopClientDisplay = true
        };
        
        // Process in the shop client login
        return;
    }

    // standard code from duende template
}
  


<p></p>



<p>In the Login Razor Page on get method, the user is redirected to a different layout if the UseShopClientDisplay is true. The returnUrl is passed as a parameter.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnGet(string? returnUrl)
{
    await BuildModelAsync(returnUrl);

    if (View.IsExternalLoginOnly)
    {
        // we only have one option for logging in and it's an external provider
        return RedirectToPage("/ExternalLogin/Challenge", 
				new { scheme = View.ExternalLoginScheme, returnUrl });
    }

    if (View.UseShopClientDisplay)
    {
        return RedirectToPage("ShopClient", new { returnUrl });
    }
       
    return Page();
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The HTML part of the Razor Page uses a different Layout and the Layout is set explicitly in the Razor Page. </p>


  @page
@model IdentityProvider.Pages.Login.ShopClient
@{
    Layout = "Shared/_LayoutShopClient";
}
&lt;div class="login-page"&gt;
    &lt;div class="lead"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Shop Client Login&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choose how to login&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  


<p></p>



<p>Different, options, styles and layouts can be setup for any clients.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Or a different client display using the ClientID as the switch:</p>







<p></p>



<p>With this setup any CSS and any layout can be used for the different clients. This is one way of having a multi-tenant or multiple client setup. This setup uses a different Client ID to style and add or remove options.</p>



 Notes 



<p>This works well and does not require much effort. Sometimes customization is required within a single client. If you intend to use this in a multiple tenant solution, you should disable the default sign-in screen if building from the ASP.NET Core Identity templates. In a follow up post, I will look at further customization within a single client option.</p>

<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2218">Kim Cameron</a> first told me what Digital Identity is on February 1, 2005.  He said that the Internet was created without an identity layer. He encouraged me “You should come help build it with me.” I’ve been at it ever since!</p>
<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1367">What I wrote about digital identity a decade ago</a> remains as true today:</p>
<blockquote><p>
An interesting thing about digital identity is that, by definition, it’s not a problem that any one company can solve, no matter how great their technology is.  For digital identity to be “solved”, the solution has to be broadly adopted, or else people will continue having different experiences at different sites and applications.  Solving digital identity requires ubiquitously adopted identity standards.  Part of the fun and the challenge is making that happen.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to even try to list all the meaningful identity and security initiatives that I’ve had the privilege to work on with many of you.  But I can’t resist saying that, in my view, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Token (JWT), and OAuth 2.0 are the ones that we knocked out of the park.  I tried to distill the lessons learned from many of the initiatives, both successes and failures, during my 2023 EIC keynote <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2345">Touchstones Along My Identity Journey</a>.  And there’s a fairly complete list of the consequential things I’ve gotten to work on in my <a href="https://self-issued.consulting/standards-cv">Standards CV</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll also call attention to 2025 marking twenty years of the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>.  I attended the first one, which was held in Berkeley, California in October 2005, and all but one since.  What a cast of characters I met there, many of whom I continue working with to this day!</p>
<p>As a personal testament to the value of IIW, it’s where many of the foundational decisions about what became JWS, JWE, JWK, JWT, and OpenID Connect were made.  Particularly, see <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=361">my post documenting decisions made at IIW about JWS</a>, including the <code>header.payload.signature</code> representation of the JWS Compact Serialization and the decision to secure the Header Parameters.  And see the posts following it on <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=378">JWE decisions</a>, <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=386">naming decisions</a>, and <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=390">JWK decisions</a>.  IIW continues playing the role of enabling foundational discussions for emerging identity technologies today!</p>
<p>It’s been a privilege working with all of you for these two decades, and I love what we’ve accomplished together!  There’s plenty of consequential work under way and I’m really looking forward to what comes next.</p>

<p>My first attempt at building a decentralized app in this day and age will use Solid Pods and DIDs. The goal? A super simple “BooksWeLike” app—a place where I can review books and see what my friends are reading and enjoying.</p><p><br></p><p>What makes this app different is how it handles data. Unlike traditional apps where data lives in a centralized database, my app will let users store their own data in Solid Pods. Think of a Pod as your own personal data vault—you control who can access it and how it’s used. And instead of relying on centralized logins like Google or Facebook, I’ll use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which allow users to prove their identity on their own terms.</p><p><br></p><p>The plan for the app is straightforward:</p><p>	•	If you already have a DID or a Solid Pod, you can sign in using your existing accounts.</p><p>	•	If you don’t, the app will help you create them when you sign up.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, part of this journey is figuring out how practical and possible all of this really is. Beyond building the app, I’ll also evaluate the tools, SDKs, client libraries, and documentation available for Solid and DID developers. How well is the building community being enabled? I’ll compare my experience with other distributed ecosystems as I attempt to replicate this app in different environments in the future. Once the app exists across multiple ecosystems, I can explore broader topics like ecosystem interoperability and federation.</p><p><br></p><p>These technologies are still evolving, and I’m excited to explore what’s possible—and what needs improvement.</p><p><br></p><p>So, what about you? Have you already taken the plunge into the world of DIDs or Solid Pods? Or is this your first time hearing about them? Let’s find out together as I document this journey.</p><p><br></p><p>In my next post, I’ll dive into the nitty-gritty of authentication—getting users to log in with their DIDs and connecting them to their Pods. I suspect it’s trickier than it sounds, but that’s all part of the adventure.</p>

Traditionally, organizations have used access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC) based on groups to authorize activities. These methods are static, requiring that lists or groups be updated manually as people move between roles or leave employment. When this is extended to partners, suppliers, and other services, the problem is that much worse. And excess standing privileges are a real security risk.</p><p>Standing privileges are characterized by persistent access regardless of whether the person is using the resource or not, predefined scope where role is used to define broad access, and minimal oversight with little monitoring and accountability. Standing privileges increase the attack surface, letting attackers exploit broad permissions without further escalation. In addition, over time people accumulate permissions beyond what they need to perform their current job, a situation known as privilege creep.</p><p>In an ideal world, least privilege is like a shrink wrap, constantly adjusting the access perimeter as the needs of the employee change. Sometimes they expand and the shrink wrap expands to seamlessly grant any access to needed perform a job. Sometimes the needs shrink and the access perimeter of the employee contracts as well. By limiting access to just that necessary to perform tasks, least privilege ensures that the attack surface that an attacker can exploit is as small as possible.</p> Zero Trust <p>Sometimes it's easy to get least privilege and zero trust confused. Zero trust is an overall security framework that requires continuous trust verification. Zero trust is a strategic, overarching trust model for an entire organization. Least privilege, in contrast, is more tactical, determining who can access what and when they can do it.</p><p>To see how least privilege fits into a zero trust strategy, consider a database administrator (DBA). Least privilege might set access controls such that the DBA can manage databases, but cannot view customer data stored within them. If their credentials are compromised, the attacker cannot steal sensitive information because the DBA’s privileges are tightly scoped. Zero trust relies on the DBA's access being valid, but might also check for unusual activity such that if the DBA appears to be accessing the database from a new location or at an unusual time, access is curtailed until the DBA is re-authenticated.</p><p>As the example shows, least privilege is an important part of zero trust, but only part. Other tactics that play in a zero trust strategy include device management, multi-factor authentication, and segmenting applications and processes (i.e., microsegmentation) to make fine-grained access control possible. Still, least privilege is a core part of a zero trust strategy. And least privilege depends on eliminating standing privileges.</p> Eliminating Standing Privileges <p>Recent developments in dynamic authorization have made it easier than ever to eliminate standing privileges. Standing privileges are the result when automatically updating an employee's access in response to changing circumstances is difficult. Modern policy-based authorization systems like <a href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en">Cedar</a> allow organizations to control access though policies that state who can access what and under what conditions. These policies are managed like code, making them easier to manage. More importantly, they can automatically respond to changing circumstances.</p><p>For example, the first of the following two Cedar policies forbids anyone to access any resource that's considered "critical" unless they're on a managed device with an acceptable security posture. The second permits employees in the Finance group to access any finance application. These policies work together, so that if the finance application is also a critical resource, then finance employees would also have to be on a managed device with an acceptable security posture. As employees change roles that group is automatically updated from the HR system, growing or shrinking access as needed.</p> <code>forbid(  
    principal,  
    action,  
    resource in Category::"CriticalResources"  
) unless {  
    context.device.security.risk == "Secure" &amp;&amp;  
    context.device.security.assessment.overall &gt;= 80  
};

permit(  
    principal in UserGroup::"Finance"  
    action,  
    resource in Category::"FinanceApplications"  
);  </code> <p>While policy-based access control (PBAC) can be used to mimic a role-based access control system, proper system segmentation (i.e. being able to identify finance applications) and device management allows finer-grained access control where employee's actions can be restricted to specific systems and only when their using a company-owned device that is properly secured. Access control can be limited to certain times or from specific locations. All of these reduce the surface area of an employee's access perimeter for better security.</p> Just-in-Time Access Control <p>We can shrink the access perimeter even further using just-in-time access control. Just-in-time (JIT) access control is a mechanism that grants users, applications, or processes access to resources only for a limited time and only when it is explicitly needed. This minimizes the risks associated with long-term or persistent access privileges. While the principle of least privilege focuses on ensuring users or systems have the minimum permissions required to perform their roles or tasks, JIT access control refines this further with several other important features:</p>  <p>Time-Bound Privileges:—JIT ensures permissions are time-limited, reducing the window of opportunity attackers have to exploit rarely-used accounts. For example, a developer needing access to a production server might receive elevated privileges only for a specific task and only for a set duration.</p>  <p>Dynamic Privilege Assignment:—Even when policies are evaluated for each access, the permissions they allow are available indefinitely. JIT adds another dimension to the dynamic nature of PBAC where privileges are granted on demand and revoked automatically when no longer needed.</p>  <p>Granular Control:—Dynamic privilege assignment complements PBAC by making access more granular—not just who can access what, but also when and for how long.</p>  <p>JIT access control might, for example, be used to limit access to payroll functions except during the window when payroll is being processed. Another example is in so-called "break-glass" situations where access is granted to production resources in an emergency or in the case of unexpected failure. Other examples use dynamic roles (e.g., on call) to grant access or require a third party (like a manager) to approve access.</p><p>These scenarios can fit within a policy-based authorization architecture using mechanisms such as dynamically altering roles or adding information to the authorization request context based on querying other systems or utilizing permission tokens that carry time-based permissions with them. For example, the following policy makes use of an assignment to process payroll in the oncall tracking system to ensure only people with an oncall assignment of "payroll" can process the payroll.</p> <code>forbid(  
    principal  
    action == "Payroll::Process",  
    resource  
) unless {  
    context.oncall.assignment == "payroll"  
} </code> <p>For this to work, the authorization agent that creates the request for the policy authorizer has to ensure that the context for the request includes the correct oncall assignment and oncall assignments need to be automated.</p> Putting it All Together <p>Zero trust, the principle of least privilege, and just-in-time access work together to create a comprehensive security framework.</p>  <p>Zero trust enables an overarching strategy that mandates systems, resources, and actions be designed such that it is possible to continuously verify every action.</p>  <p>Principle of Least Privilege forms the heart of the zero trust strategy, mandating authentication and authorization systems that can dynamically grant fine-grained access through policy.</p>  <p>Just-in-time authorization augments the authorization system so that permissions can be granted not just based on who and where, but also only when they are needed to perform critical actions.</p>  <p>The well known adage that you can't buy security, applies to zero trust and JIT. There are products and technologies that make just-in-time, dynamic fine-grained access control possible, but besides putting them in place, you must also integrate them, make any necessary changes to other systems, and implement governance, monitoring, and auditing to ensure they work. These are organizational changes that take time, money, and perseverance. Done right, the payoff is not just a reduced attack surface and better security, but more productive employees as well. This may seem counter-intuitive, but poorly implemented, piecemeal security measures put much of the burden for keeping systems safe on employees who deal with tactics like frequent, yet ineffective password changes or requesting, and then waiting for, permissions to do their job.</p><p>When dynamic access control with JIT access is thoughtfully implemented, you shift the burden of security from employees to systems that automate protection, making it proactive and intelligent. Reducing friction so that employees can do their job while also enhancing security requires balance and a holistic approach that aligns technology, process, and culture. This transformation requires real effort but offers substantial rewards: resilient, secure systems; empowered employees; and peace of mind.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: Shrink Wrapped Computers from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: draw a wide format picture of several colorful, shrink wrapped computers and smartphones.</p>

<p>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them out for consideration. A quick glance at the finances of their pro-crypto / pro-blockchain Pac should be a wake up call to anyone doubting the rising tide of automated, smart contract law and global cyber governance. We need to wrap our heads around the fact that it’s less about money and power and more about information theory, token engineering, and the shift of social systems into a networked super intelligence operating under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for expanded “human potential.” It is a bipartisan effort. It is an international effort. It will be framed as a “populist uprising” to take back “the commons,” engineered of course by the world’s largest asset holders. In my opinion, meme-coins are biosemiotic aides facilitating emergent swarm intelligence. Tread carefully around those digital mind viruses folks. A lot of money, and tokens, are being thrown around trying to get their planned cyberphysical-sociotechnical future to stick.&nbsp;</p>

 Setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core web application authenticates using OpenID Connect and OpenIddict as the secure token server. The application needs to use data from an app-to-app resource. An OAuth client credential flow is used to get an application access token to access the API. The OAuth client credentials flow can only be used when it can keep a secret. This token has nothing in common with the delegated access token from the user authentication. The application is persisted once for the application. An in-memory cache is used for this. The application sends the application access token as a bearer token to the API.</p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per application for application tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. The tokens must be persisted safely in multiple instance setups. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per application 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely (Safe and encrypted storage if not in-memory) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 
 



 Implementation example  



<p>An ApplicationAccessTokenCache service is used to manage the access tokens for the application. The service is registered as a singleton and runs once for the whole application. Each request scope can use this. The application looks in the cache for a valid token and if no valid token is present, the service requests a new access token using the OAuth client credentials flow. The token is persisted to the cache using the client ID. This means only one token can exist per client definition.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The required services are added the the application in the program file. </p>


  builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;ApplicationAccessTokenCache&gt;();
builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;ApplicationUsersService&gt;();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
  


<p></p>



<p>The token cache works great when using in-memory cache. If using a persistent cache, care needs to be taken that the access tokens are persisted in a safe way. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSaMF7KbUME">this morning’s video</a> I somehow missed the fact that the inauguration coincides with MLK Day, which is an interesting sync with the “melanin as optical material” lens. I’m going to drop a few links to old blog posts that touch on the YMCA and “out of school time learning” as as well as my “Momo” read-aloud playlist. Maybe I should do a read aloud of Bentov’s “Stalking the Wild Pendulum,” too? I’m understanding it much better now. Look for a discussion of quantum realism with Joseph Gonzales in the coming week. I’ll just say it once again, I can’t believe I have to talk about any of this, but if you don’t take it too seriously, conjecturing can be rather fun.</p>

<p>In this video I draw connections between Gestalt theory and organizational development as applied to digital groupthink in the context of Christiana Figueres, a leader in the development of carbon trading, who trained at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. As a young woman, she attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution. The first wife of her father, three-time president of Costa Rica and MIT alumnus, had ties to Quaker expats (Henrietta Boggs’ uncle and aunt) who emigrated south from Alabama in the 1950s. </p>
<p>Kenneth Boulding, a Quaker economist who developed some of the first ideas around social impact investing, and his wife Elise, sociologist who built the field of peace studies, were affiliated with Swarthmore though Kenneth only did a year’s stint as a guest lecturer. </p>
<p>When our family toured the campus for a college visit, it was made clear that only the top-tier candidates would be accepted, because many slots were reserved for equity outreach. Interestingly a high percentage of students presenting that day asserted their intentions to become economists with aspirations of working at the World Bank and the IMF. That was an eye-opener for sure!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I use the visual of the optical illusion of paired silhouettes with a vase in the center to describe how two narratives can be presented, but often only one is truly “seen.” This Gestalt concept is applied to parallel narratives – one presented in two recent stories on Unlimited Hangout that foreground militarism and data surveillance in AI healthcare and the story I keep attempting to tell about gamified managed community “wellness” protocols linked to social impact finance deals on blockchain that on another level will be leveraged to catalyze emergent behaviors and possibly advance bio-hybrid information processing.</p>
<p>I also describe a strange encounter in which Aetna health care intended to target low-income communities of color for VR guided meditation in a digital “jungle” setting. The second hour of the video is a repeat of two site visits Jason and made in Denver in 2022 to the then new Palantir headquarters and the state capitol.</p>

<p>The article looks at managing user delegated access tokens for a downstream API in an ASP.NET Core web application. There are many ways of implementing this, all with advantages and disadvantages. The tokens are requested from an OpenID Connect server using the recommended standards. In this blog, the UI access token from the application authentication is re-used for the downstream API.</p>

 Setup 



<p>The solution uses a secure downstream API and requires user delegated access tokens for access. The UI application is implemented using ASP.NET Core and razor pages. The UI application authenticates against an OpenID Connect server implemented using OpenIddict. The application client is implemented using an OpenID Connect confidential client and the OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE. This flow returns an access token which is used for the downstream API. </p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per user session for user delegated tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust  to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per user session 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely 



 The token must be replaced after each UI authentication (per user) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 
 



 Implementation example using Duende Token Management 



<p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect">Duende Token Management OpenIdConnect</a> Nuget package can be used to implement these requirements for user delegated access tokens. This is not the only way to do this and can be implemented in numerous different ways. With this package, the AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement can be used to add the token management. </p>


  builder.Services.AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement();
  


<p></p>



<p>The different HTTP requests or the Razor pages can use the GetUserAccessTokenAsync method to get the access token for each user and session. The SaveTokens is set to true to persist the tokens in the session using a secure cookie per default. This is an option in the AddOpenIdConnect method. The defined scope is used to select the access token.</p>


   // token expires, token managment required
var accessToken = await HttpContext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync(
   new UserTokenRequestParameters
   {
      Scope = "myscope"
   });
  


<p></p>



<p>The AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient method can be used to add a named HttpClient client for the access token and the specific API.</p>


  builder.Services.AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient("profileClient",
    configureClient: client =&gt; 
    { 
        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(profileApiBaseUrl!); 
    });
  


<p></p>



<p>This client can then be used to access the API resource using the access token.</p>


  var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("profileClient");

var response = await client.GetAsync("api/Profiles/photo");
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    var data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    if (data != null)
        return data;

    return string.Empty;
}
  


<p>When the applications are started, the access token can be used to request data from the downstream API.</p>



 Notes 



<p>In follow up blogs, I will look at the different ways and the different types of strategies which are used to implement token management in ASP.NET Core web applications.</p>

<p>What will come of large language models when they mirror unsettled psyches defined by religious hero complexes into the cloud? We do ourselves and future generations a profound disservice when we choose not to make time to comprehend and interrogate how emerging technologies and narrative flows are being deployed to steer psychological states individually and as holon-based collectives through socio-technical, cyberphysical systems and the tokenized attention economy. </p>
<p>I recognize that rather than being a victim of Substack mania once again, I was merely a reflection of another’s discomfort in the world, an obstacle that gave someone a useful anchor point to exert his will and express his agency, however uninformed and misguided. It’s not a good feeling, but an informative lesson nonetheless. </p>
<p>It’s time to wrap our heads around tokenized spirituality and organized religion. My gut tells me Texas is ground zero for integration of the Drucker-Buford metaverse church model with digital community currencies tied to “moral” markets and social impact “charity” in ATT smart cities designed for community “wellness.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don’t think AI should be approached as a digital intercessor for “divine” moral guidance.” I view, web3 systems as linguistic scaffolds quietly mapping the terrain of our souls. Once harvested, our somatic pyschological GPS coordinates can be used ad infinitum to play us like instruments in the coming LARPy animist musical of blockchained cloud minds to solve gnarly problems that can only be untangled by a network of diverse, distributed intelligences – with digital wallets.</p>
<p>Follow your heart, think clearly, and ground yourself. It is easy to get swept away by the Sturm und Drang we generate around ourselves to make the hero roles we inhabit make sense. I’m not going to link to Andrew Corner’s Substack directly, but it’s not hard to find – I’m in the “energy” one. If you go there, fair warning, it’s a slog that’s equal parts disturbing and amusing. </p>
<p>What are we becoming folks? I don’t think the “hybrid” intelligence program is going to be a good look for many of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of the day this may very well have simply been another signals-intelligence operation. It doesn’t seem like anyone really pays attention to that Substack anyway. If so, I hope there are at least a few useful take aways regarding how we should engage with this systems.</p>

 Part 2: Issuing&nbsp;Badges <p>In <a href="https://blog.dcconsortium.org/explaining-verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-5bf2f482b383">part one</a> of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions. Credentials issued as Open Badges 3.0 are based on the <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/app/page/1b808YBAgwQgD8omWIWcyUb193SW2MvG3Fs5XCX7wHyE?p=1h1VJHHv2zSe0n9Ltg-KQevSuqWbGcExy">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> data model which describes how claims made online can be&nbsp;proven.</p><p>To explore this trust model, let’s explore the story of Olivia who has been taking classes at a local community college. Olivia is told that with each course she will be awarded and issued a badge that she can use to apply for employment.</p><p>Let’s start with what “issuing a badge” means using the most common approaches:</p><p>For older Open Badges (versions 0.5 to 2.1): The issuer saves completed course data in the format of an Open Badge that includes Olivia’s email address. When the issuer saves the data, the badge is considered “issued”. This data will be used to populate a web page or a file on the web. This web page or file must be public for Olivia to share online and be considered verifiable. In order for Olivia to do this, she must have an account on the issuing platform associated with the same email&nbsp;address.</p><p>For Open Badges 3.0 &amp; W3C Verifiable Credentials: The issuer decides that Olivia should be awarded a badge and provides a secure link for Olivia to retrieve it. Olivia uses a digital wallet to click the secure link which makes a request to the issuing software to produce the badge. The issuing software retrieves and digitally signs the badge data; at this moment the badge has been by definition “issued.” (Prior to this digital signature, the badge itself did not exist.) It is sent to Olivia’s wallet where she claims and secures it, now able to share it privately at her discretion. It is important to note that this credential is hosted locally on Olivia’s device. There is no web page or URL for this credential until Olivia decides to create a public&nbsp;link.</p> Different Trust&nbsp;Models   Older Open Badges are hosted on the web. In this model, trust in the credential is based on the reputation of the badging platform hosting the credentials. Perceptions of trust of websites or platforms can be based on elements like issuer identity confirmation, availability of content, and security of the web site (<a href="https://www.digicert.com/how-tls-ssl-certificates-work">how websites are secured</a>).  Open Badges 3.0 and Verifiable Credentials are digitally signed, portable files. In this model, trust is based on the cryptographic digital signature and privacy. The digital signature in the credential is readable to the verification software, which looks for information indicating which entity signed the credential and if the data has changed since it was signed. Confirmation of the issuing entity’s identity happens later using an issuer registry (to be explained in more detail in a future&nbsp;post).  <p>Olivia has unfettered access to the credential and can share it knowing that when she does, her actions aren’t being tracked or communicated to the issuer. When she shares her credential, it is signed by the digital identity associated with the credential issuer so that the verifier can trust that she has control of the digital identity and the credential.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Open Badges v3 and Verifiable Credential issuing platforms could still have public web pages for badges. Olivia may not want all of her badges digitally signed but with Open Badges 3.0 and Verifiable Credentials, she has that&nbsp;choice.</p><p>This blog post is Part 2 of a series of content explaining W3C Verifiable Credentials and Open Badges 3.0. Stay tuned for Part 3 — “What does it mean that a badge is digitally signed?”.</p><p>For more information on the DCC, including membership, projects, and events, visit our <a href="http://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">website</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/">wiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dccconsortium">Linkedin</a>.

<p>Is blogging still a thing?</p><p>If you’re reading this, please comment or like it so I know.</p><p><br></p><p>I am, at heart, still the XDI Guy. My passion for robust, secure, and scalable distributed data management hasn’t waned. Building one of the first XDI implementations (shout-out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821/">Markus Sabadello</a>, who might have built the only other one), I learned a lot about the challenges and opportunities of distributed data at scale. Over the years, I’ve reflected on qualities essential for data ecosystems, qualities that are often overshadowed by content-driven ecosystems. For example:</p><p>	•	Caching semantics: Apps need governance and management of caches to respect data ownership while maintaining local operational efficiency.</p><p>	•	Transactionality: Mature data protocols depend on it for consistency and reliability.</p><p>	•	Request batching: Optimizing network requests is vital for performance and scalability.</p><p><br></p><p>After years away, I’m ready to dive back in. There are a couple of apps I want to build, and I want to build them on a distributed data platform. My first idea is a fully distributed implementation of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-degraf-4521/">Brad deGraf</a>’s BooksWeLike concept—a way to share and discover books that resonate with you. (Brad, if you’re reading this and don’t like the idea, let me know!)</p><p><br></p><p>To make this happen, I’ve started scanning the distributed protocol space to see what’s out there. Here’s my initial list of protocols to evaluate:</p><p>	•	AT Protocol</p><p>	•	Nostr</p><p>	•	Solid</p><p>	•	ActivityPub</p><p>	•	Matrix</p><p>	•	IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)</p><p>	•	SSB (Secure Scuttlebutt)</p><p>	•	DID (Decentralized Identifiers)</p><p>	•	Libp2p</p><p>	•	Hypercore</p><p>	•	Waku</p><p>	•	Zero-Knowledge Identity Protocols (ZK Protocols)</p><p><br></p><p>What am I missing?</p><p>Are there protocols on this list that don’t belong? If so, why? Are there others I should consider? I haven’t started my evaluations yet, so I’m open to your insights. If you’ve built apps on these protocols or have opinions about them, I’d love to hear from you.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ll be capturing my journey of discovery here—sharing what I learn, where I stumble, and how I (hopefully) succeed. Let’s make distributed data a reality, by and for the people.</p>

These advantages make our scheme a promising candidate for privacy-preserving digital identity applications.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>当社のECDSAの証明書は60ミリ秒で生成できます。ISO MDOC標準のような完全に標準化されたアイデンティティプロトコルに組み込まれた場合、クレデンシャルのサイズにもよりますが、モバイルデバイス上でMDOCプレゼンテーションフロー用のゼロ知識証明書を1.2秒で生成できます。これらの利点により、当社の方式はプライバシー保護型デジタルアイデンティティアプリケーションの有望な候補となっています。</p></blockquote><p>mdocのプレゼンテーション時にゼロ知識証明を1.2秒で生成、このくらいなら実用性がありそうですね。</p><p>論文の本文もPDFで閲覧できるようになっているので、おいおい見ていこうと思います。</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p>

<p>In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). That’s a mouthful. I won’t go into how to setup Ollama and Llama 3.1 8b; this post assumes it is&nbsp;running.</p><p>First off, you can find the code for this in my <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LlamaIndex_Test">LlamaIndex_Test Github repo</a> under Test1/src folder. At the time of this writing there is a Test0 and a Test1. To see the post about Test0 code see <a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/using-llamaindex-part-1-openai-e96b3efa699a">Using LlamaIndex — Part 1&nbsp;OpenAI</a>.</p><p>The code uses a&nbsp;.env and load_dotenv() to populate the needed LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY. I recommend that if you have an OPENAI_API_KEY entry in the&nbsp;.env that you comment it out for this experiment to prove to yourself that the embedding and LLM are local and not OpenAI. See the part 1 post for more details on the LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY.</p> #OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY<br>LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY <p>The pip install dependencies I put as comments at the top of the python file. There is also a requirements.txt for the project as a whole that covers all the “Test” experiments package requirements.</p> # pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface<br># pip install llama-index-llms-ollama<br># pip install llama-index-core llama-parse llama-index-readers-file <p>The nice thing about LlamaIndex LlamaParse is that it provides an auto mode that will use premium mode when specified criteria are met. In this experiment, I have set auto mode on with triggers for mode change on in- page images or tables. Also, to save on parsing credit usage in LlamaParse and because, for this example, it is all that is needed, I have set the pages to be parsed to PDF page 9 only (note that PDF page 9 is target page 8 to LlamaParse because it uses a 0 based page index). Like the part 1 post, I am using an output of markdown because it provides greater context to the LLM; though, I did try it with result_type=text and received the proper query response despite the answer to the query being in a&nbsp;table.</p> # set LlamaParse for markdown output and auto_mode only parsing page 8<br>parser = LlamaParse(<br>    result_type="markdown", <br>    auto_mode=True,<br>    auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page=True,<br>    auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page=True,<br>    target_pages="8",<br>    verbose=True<br>) <p>So that you don’t have to open the PDF document that gets parsed to understand the input below is a screenshot of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>As in part 1, I use LlamaParse.load_data to read the page and parse it. Since it has a table in-page and we are in auto mode it will automatically use Premium mode to potentially better handle the page and table. This will cause the page parse to cost 15 credits on LlamaIndex. Note that LlamaIndex will cache your parsed page for 48 hours unless you specify otherwise or change the parse parameters which allows you to run the code more than once and only get the credit cost once. I did try using the default “accurate” mode by removing the auto_mode parameters on the LlamaParse and it still parsed the table properly and returned the proper answer to the query — but this is a sample for showing the use of “auto mode” so just pretend that is not the&nbsp;case.</p><p>If you want to see the output of the parser, uncomment the print command after the documents variable is populated. I like to then paste it into a markdown viewer to see it as rendered markdown output. See the below image for that&nbsp;output.</p> with open(f"../../sample_docs/{file_name}", "rb") as file_to_parse:<br>    # LlamaParse will cache a parsed document 48 hours if the parse parameters are not changed<br>    # thus not incuring additional parse cost if you run this multiple times for testing purposes<br>    # see the history tab in the LlamaParse dashboard for the project to confirm that <br>    # credits used = 0 for subsequent runs<br>    # <br>    # must provide extra_info with file_name key when passing file object<br>    documents = parser.load_data(file_to_parse, extra_info=extra_info)<br>    # to manually check the output uncomment the below<br>    #print(documents[0].text) <p>I like to set the default settings for LLM and embedding model so that I don’t need to pass them around as parameters. Here is where I set the embedding model to a Hugging Face provided model. When you run the python for the first time it will pull down the embedding model automatically — nice!</p> # set the default embeddings and llm so that it doesn't have to be passed around<br>Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")<br>Settings.llm = Ollama(model="llama3.1:latest", request_timeout=120.0) <p>The next part of the code does the same that it did in Part 1 except that this time the VectoreStoreIndex and the query engine use the models I set in the Settings singleton versus the LlamaIndex default of&nbsp;OpenAI.</p> # index the parsed documents using the default embedding model<br>index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)<br><br># generate a query engine for the index using the default llm<br>query_engine = index.as_query_engine()<br><br># provide the query and output the results<br>query = "What is the latency in seconds for Nova Micro?"<br>response = query_engine.query(query)<br>print(response) <p>If all goes well you should get the response output as 0.5 and if you look back at the table from the page you’ll see that is&nbsp;correct.</p> (.venv) PS C:\python\LlamaIndex_Test\Test1\src&gt; python parse_ollama.py<br>Started parsing the file under job_id 37dce328-aaa7-499b-afe9-498c32b63944<br>.0.5 <p>To validate that the value was coming from the RAG provided PDF page and not the the LLMs inherent “knowledge”, I asked a similar question via the command line to Ollama without providing the RAG context— output&nbsp;below:</p> PS C:\temp&gt; ollama run llama3.1:latest "what is the latency in seconds for Nova Micro Amazon LLM model?"<br>I don't have access to specific information about the latency of the Nova Micro Amazon LLM (Large Language Model)<br>model. The details regarding models like this, especially concerning their performance metrics such as latency,<br>are typically available from the developers or through official documentation and may be subject to change. If<br>you're looking for accurate and up-to-date information on this topic, I recommend checking directly with Nova<br>Micro's resources or contacting them for the most current data. <p>There you have it. But I am not done quite yet in reporting my results. In LlamaIndex’s examples, they used this PDF but used PDF page 1 which contains an image. See below an image of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>They use this page to demonstrate how LlamaParse in auto mode moves into premium mode for the page parsing because of the image and then creates a mermaid diagram from the image because it recognizes the image is of a diagram. Below is what they report as the outcome in&nbsp;part.</p> # The Amazon Nova Family of Models:<br># Technical Report and Model Card<br><br>Amazon Artificial General Intelligence<br><br>```mermaid<br>graph TD<br>    A[Text] --&gt; B[Nova Lite]<br>    C[Image] --&gt; B<br>    D[Video] --&gt; E[Nova Pro]<br>    F[Code] --&gt; E<br>    G[Docs] --&gt; E<br>    B --&gt; H[Text]<br>    B --&gt; I[Code]<br>    E --&gt; H<br>    E --&gt; I<br>    J[Text] --&gt; K[Nova Micro]<br>    L[Code] --&gt; K<br>    K --&gt; M[Text]<br>    K --&gt; N[Code]<br>    O[Text] --&gt; P[Nova Canvas]<br>    Q[Image] --&gt; P<br>    P --&gt; R[Image]<br>    S[Text] --&gt; T[Nova Reel]<br>    U[Image] --&gt; T<br>    T --&gt; V[Video]<br>    <br>    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style K fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style P fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style T fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    <br>    classDef input fill:#lightblue,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;<br>    class A,C,D,F,G,J,L,O,Q,S,U input;<br>    <br>    classDef output fill:#lightgreen,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;<br>    class H,I,M,N,R,V output;<br>```<br><br>Figure 1: The Amazon Nova family of models <p>When I tried this I did not get the same outcome from the parse.

Over a three-week period, hackers stole 40 million credit and debit card accounts from retail giant Target by exploiting the account of an HVAC contractor. The attack began with an email-based phishing scam that tricked an employee at the HVAC company into revealing their credentials. As a vendor to Target, the HVAC company had legitimate access to Target’s systems. Using the stolen credentials, the hackers infiltrated Target’s network and installed malware on the retailer’s point-of-sale systems, enabling them to collect customer data. The breach resulted in direct costs to Target of nearly $300 million, along with reputational damage that is difficult to quantify.1</p><p>The Target breach underscores the critical importance of not only knowing who is accessing your systems (authentication) but also controlling what they can access (authorization). The HVAC vendor had access to Target’s systems for electronic billing, contract submission, and project management. However, the hackers were able to extend this access beyond those legitimate uses to reach systems used to update point-of-sale devices. Target’s failure to properly restrict access to critical systems created a significant vulnerability that the hackers exploited.</p><p>But I don’t want you to get the idea that authorization is just about securing IT systems—it’s also fundamental to how modern cloud applications function, enabling features that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. For example, services like Google Docs and Dropbox rely on authorization to allow users to share documents with specific people while restricting access to others. Without this capability, these applications would not be possible.</p><p>Another example is Amazon Web Services (AWS), where authorization enables Amazon to securely provide hundreds of cloud services to millions of customers at scale in a cost-effective manner. As a global distributed system taking advantage of multi tenancy to service millions of customers, AWS uses a sophisticated policy-based authorization system to help customers control access to the services running inside their accounts.</p><p>Several trends make authorization a more important topic that it has been:</p>  <p>More and more software is being delivered as a service (so called Software as a Service, or SaaS). As we’ve discussed cloud-based services can’t provide the needed levels of functionality and security without strong authorization systems.</p>  <p>Perimeter-based security architectures like firewalls are giving way to zero-trust architectures. Rather than assuming everyone inside the perimeter is trusted, zero-trust systems assume breach and authorize every access. This isn’t possible without flexible authorization systems that can determine whether to grant access based on the context of the request.</p>  <p>Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected devices mean that more and more computer systems are talking to each other on their owner’s behalf. Restricting their access to the role they play protects them and prevents them from becoming a vector that hackers can exploit to break into other sensitive systems.</p>  <p>Regulatory compliance is yet another reason why authorization is increasingly important. Laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require that access to personal information be carefully controlled so that only the right people and systems can use it. Beyond controlling access, these laws also require that you be able to audit access to show compliance.</p>  <p>In addition to these, the rise of GenAI and particularly AI agents that can act on your behalf pour gasoline on the smoldering identity industry interest in authorization. Am I talking to a human? Does this agent have authority to make a doctor's appointment on the patient's behalf? These and other questions mean that making good authorization decisions, knowing what decisions were made, and easily incorporating authorization infrastructure into your apps and infrastructure is vital.</p>    Notes   <p>The story is interesting beyond the fact that it highlights the need to properly manage access. Target’s response, or rather lack of one, provides several important security lessons: <a href="https://coverlink.com/cyber-liability-insurance/target-data-breach/">Cyber Case Study: Target Data Breach</a> provides more details</p>  <p>Photo Credit: Hacker Stealing Credit Cards from DALL-E (public domain).

<p>Released yesterday: <a href="https://sqitch.org" title="Sqitch: Sensible database change management">Sqitch</a> v1.5.0. This version the MySQL driver
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql" title="DBD::mysql - MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)">DBD::mysql</a> with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::MariaDB" title="DBD::MariaDB - MariaDB and MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)">DBD::MariaDB</a>, both for its better backward compatibility
with MySQL as well as MariaDB driver libraries and for its improved Unicode
handling. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch">Docker image</a> likewise switched to the MariaDB <code>mysql</code>
client. I expect no compatibility issues, but you never know! Please file an
<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/issues" title="Sqitch Issues">issue</a> should you find any.</p>
<p>V1.5.0 also features a fixes for Yugabyte deployment, Oracle error handling,
existing Snowflake schemas, connecting to MySQL/MariaDB without a database
name, and omitting the <code>checkit</code> MySQL/MariaDB function when the Sqitch user
lacks sufficient permission to create it. Sqitch now will also complain when
deploying with <code>--log-only</code> and a deployment file is missing.</p>
<p>Find it in the usual places:</p>

 Using LlamaIndex Part 1 — OpenAI <p>I have started to experiment with <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/">LlamaIndex</a> for use in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) document parsing and indexing. My results were mixed on the simple page provided. This is part 1, where I make a short post on LlamaIndex with OpenAI as the LLM component. I expect part 2 to be LlamaIndex with Ollama and Llama3–8b as the LLM components.</p><p>This is a very short chunk of code. I also used the LlamaIndex Parse browser-based tool to see if I received different outputs. As one would expect, I did not. You can access the browser-based tool by opening a LlamaIndex account and choosing the “Parse” tool in your dashboard. You’ll need an account if you plan to use the code I provide and you will also need to generate an API key from your LlamaIndex dashboard. One of the great things about LlamaIndex is that for a paid tool it is generous in its free usage; 1000 credits PER DAY. In “accurate” mode, it is 1 credit per page; in “premium” mode, it is 15 credits per page. For my simple one page example the output between the two did not&nbsp;differ.</p><p>First the small snippet of&nbsp;code.</p> # pip install llama-index-embeddings-openai llama-index-llms-openai<br># pip install llama-index-core llama-parse llama-index-readers-file<br><br>from llama_parse import LlamaParse<br>from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex<br>from dotenv import load_dotenv<br><br><br>load_dotenv()<br><br>parser = LlamaParse(result_type="markdown", verbose=True)<br><br>file_name = "ssi-page-5.pdf"<br>extra_info = {"file_name": file_name}<br><br>with open(f"../../sample_docs/{file_name}", "rb") as file_to_parse:<br>    # must provide extra_info with file_name key when passing file object<br>    documents = parser.load_data(file_to_parse, extra_info=extra_info)<br>    # to manually check the MD output uncomment the below<br>    # print(documents[0].text)<br><br># index the parsed documents<br>index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)<br><br># generate a query engine for the index<br>query_engine = index.as_query_engine()<br><br># provide the query and output the results<br>query = "what are the principles of SSI?"<br>response = query_engine.query(query)<br>print(response) <p>You can find this code and a few sample documents, including the document used in this code in my <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LlamaIndex_Test">LlamaIndex_Test</a> Github repo with the code specifically under the Test0&nbsp;folder.</p><p>Note that I don’t set an LLM or an embedding model. LlamaIndex uses OpenAI as the default LLM and OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002. You will need an OpenAI API key to go along with the LlamaIndex key. My code loads them from the&nbsp;.env to environmental variables and if they are named appropriately those variables will be found by default. Below is a&nbsp;.env&nbsp;example.</p> OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY<br>LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY <p>In the code above I am using a single-page PDF, “ssi-page-5.pdf”. It is page 5 of the larger document, “Self-Sovereign Identity A Systematic Review Mapping and Taxonomy.pdf”. If you plan to send LlamaParse a larger document but use the API properties to tell it only to parse a subset of pages from the document keep in mind that LlamaParse starts at page 0. The first time I tried this I had an off-by-one issue because I assumed page 1 of the document was, you know, page 1. It was page 0. This is understandable from a programming standpoint but caught me off guard&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>In the example code, I opened a file directly but LlamaIndex provides a directory reader with filters, if you desire to use that instead. The results I got back on the LLM query were spot on as would be expected on a single page of context with a well-outlined section pertinent to my simple&nbsp;query.</p><p>You don’t really need the creation of the vector index, query engine and query/response to test out LlamaIndex parsing. Just uncomment line 23 in the above code (line 19 in the repo code) comment out everything below it and get the parsed&nbsp;output.</p> Premium Mode and Auto Mode and Less than Expected&nbsp;Outcomes <p>In the code, I didn’t try out premium mode or auto mode. I intend to make a separate post about auto mode. I did try them in the LlamaIndex Parse tool. In both, I expected the image at the top of the page to get output as an image in the “Images” tab of the Parse output tool, but it&nbsp;didn’t.</p><p>The image at the top of the page is below as a screen&nbsp;capture.</p><p>This was disappointing. I’m not sure why this did not provide the expected&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>There you have it. A simple bit of code to parse using LlamaIndex. What makes it different from other parsers I have tried (all open source) is that it spits out the results in markdown, if desired, which is better than the usual plain text I received in other tools. The markdown provides the LLM more context even if in my simple case it was not of value. The other is that in theory, it will better parse images, tables etc., but as I explained I did not get that result.&nbsp;:-( I’ll continue to experiment with it, especially on more complicated pages such as ones that contain a table and in auto mode via&nbsp;code.</p><p>You can find part 2 as “<a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/ai-rag-with-llamaindex-local-embedding-and-ollama-llama-3-1-8b-b0620116a715">AI RAG with LlamaIndex, Local Embedding, and Ollama Llama 3.1 8b</a>”. The example in part 2 uses LlamaParse auto&nbsp;mode.</p>

  The W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group published the Snapshot Second Candidate Recommendation of the Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE specification just before the holidays.

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/"></a>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a> published the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-jose-cose-20241219/">Snapshot Second Candidate Recommendation of the Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE specification</a> just before the holidays.  This was one of <a href="https://www.w3.org/news/2024/five-candidate-recommendation-snapshots-published-by-the-verifiable-credentials-working-group/">five Candidate Recommendation Snapshots</a> published by the working group at the same time, including for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-data-model-2.0-20241219/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0</a>, which I’m also an editor of.  A <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#candidate-recommendation-snapshot">W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot</a> is intended to become a <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR">W3C Candidate Recommendation</a> after required review and approval steps.</p>
<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2525">As I wrote about the First Candidate Recommendation</a>, VC-JOSE-COSE secures VC Data Model payloads with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html">JOSE</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">SD-JWT</a>, or <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052.html">COSE</a> signatures.  And while I’m admittedly not a fan of JSON-LD, to the extent that Verifiable Credentials using the JSON-LD-based VC Data Model are in use, I’m committed to there being a solid VC-JOSE-COSE specification so there is a simple, secure, standards-based way to sign these credentials.</p>
<p>One significant change since the First Candidate Recommendation was splitting the Controller Document text out into its own specification called <a href="https://w3c.github.io/cid/">Controlled Identifier Document 1.0</a>.  Publishing a Candidate Recommendation Snapshot for it is planned for next week.  Part of why it became its own specification is so that it can be referenced by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/04/did-wg-charter.html">planned update to the W3C DID specification</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to my co-editor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cohengabe/">Gabe Cohen</a> and working group chair <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bzundel/">Brent Zundel</a> for the significant work they both put in to help us reach this point!</p>

  Should Sqitch and URI::mysql use DBD::MariaDB instead of DBD::mysql? If so,
what are the implications for Sqitch deployment and usage?

<p>I seek the wisdom of the Perl Monks:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Sqitch project got <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/issues/825" title="sqitchers/sqitch#825 Support DBD::MariaDB">a request</a> to switch from <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a>
to <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::MariaDB">DBD::MariaDB</a>. DBD::mysql 5’s requirement to build from the MySQL 8
client library provides the impetus for the request, but in poking around, I
found a <a href="https://blogs.perl.org/users/grinnz/2023/12/migrating-from-dbdmysql-to-dbdmariadb.html">blogs.perl.org post</a> highlighting some Unicode fixes in
DBD::MariaDB, as well.</p>
<p>Now, Sqitch likely doesn’t have the Unicode issue (it always works with Perl
Unicode strings), but it depends on <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/URI::db">URI::db</a> to provide the DBI connection
string. For MySQL URIs, the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/URI-db/source/lib/URI/mysql.pm#L6">URI::mysql dbi_driver</a> method returns <code>mysql</code>.</p>
<p>Should it be changed to return <code>MariaDB</code>, instead? Is there general
community consensus that DBD::MariaDB provides better compatibility with
both MySQL and MariaDB these days?</p>
<p>I’m also curious what the impact of this change would be for Sqitch.
Presumably, if DBD::MariaDB can build against either the MariaDB or MySQL
client library, it is the more flexible choice to continue supporting both

<p>Happy New Year! 🎉🥳🍾🥂</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">JSONPath RFC</a> includes a section on defining <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-normalized-paths" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Normalized Paths">normalized paths</a>,
which use a subset of JSONPath syntax to define paths to the location of a
node in a JSON value. I hadn’t thought much about it, but noticed that the
<a href="https://serdejsonpath.live">serde JSONPath Sandbox</a> provides a “Located” switch adds them to query
results. For the sake of complementarity, I added the same feature to the <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/">Go
JSONPath Playground</a>.</p>

</code>  <p><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> of the <code>github.com/theory/jsonpath</code> Go package enables this feature
via its new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#Path.SelectLocated"><code>SelectLocated</code></a> method, which returns a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#LocatedNodeList"><code>LocatedNodeList</code></a> that
shows off a few of the benfits of pairing JSONPath query results with paths
that uniquely identify their locations in a JSON value, including sorting and
deduplication. It also takes advantage of <a href="https://go.dev/blog/range-functions">Go v1.23 iterators</a>, providing
methods to range over all the results, just the node values, and just the
paths. As a result, v0.3.0 now requires Go 1.23.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde_json_path">serde_json_path Rust crate</a> inspired the use of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#LocatedNodeList"><code>LocatedNodeList</code></a>
rather than a simple slice of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0/spec#LocatedNode"><code>LocatedNode</code></a> structs, but I truly embraced it
once I noticed the the focus on “nodelists” in the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-overview" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Overview">RFC’s overview</a>, which
provides this definition:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>A JSONPath expression is a string that, when applied to a JSON value (the
query argument), selects zero or more nodes of the argument and outputs
these nodes as a nodelist.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>It regularly refers to nodelists thereafter, and it seemed useful to have an
object to which more features can be added in the future.
<code>github.com/theory/jsonpath</code> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> thererfore also changes the result value
of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#Path.Select"><code>Select</code></a> from <code>[]any</code> to the new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#NodeList"><code>NodeList</code></a> struct, an alias for
<code>[]any</code>. For now it adds a single method, <code>All</code>, which again relies on <a href="https://go.dev/blog/range-functions">Go
v1.23 iterators</a> to iterate over selected nodes.</p>
<p>While the data type has changed, usage otherwise has not. One can iterate
directly over values just as before:</p>
  <code>for _, val := range path.Select(jsonInput) {
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", val)
}
</code>  <p>But <code>All</code> removes the need to alias-away the index value with <code>_</code>:</p>
  <code>for val := range path.Select(jsonInput).All() {
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", val)
}
</code>  <p>I don’t expect any further incompatible changes to the main <code>jsonpath</code> module,
but adding these return values now allows new features to be added to the
selected node lists in the future.</p>
<p>May you find it useful!</p>

<p>Based on the recently-released Go <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/" title="Go JSONPath Playground">JSONPath</a> and <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsontree/" title="Go JSONTree Playground">JSONTree</a> playgrounds, I’ve
updated the design and of the <a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/" title="Go SQL/JSON Playground">SQL/JSON Playground</a>. It now comes
populated with sample JSON borrowed from <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535</a>, as well as a selection of
queries that randomly populate the query field on each reload. I believe this
makes the playground nicer to start using, not to mention more pleasing to the
eye.</p>
<p>The playground has also been updated to use the recently-released
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/sqljson@v0.2.1/path">sqljson/path v0.2 package</a>, which replicates a few changes included in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936/" title="PostgreSQL 17 Released!">PostgreSQL 17 release</a>. Notably, the <code>.string()</code> function no longer uses a
time zone or variable format to for dates and times.</p>
<p>Curious to see it in action? <a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/" title="Go SQL/JSON Playground">Check it out!</a></p>

   こんにちは、富士榮です。  ついにこの日が来ました。           去年の正月休みに某猫とのチキンレースが始まってしまったので収まりがつかなくなって惰性で描き続けていましたが気がついたら本当に1年経ってしまいました。  ↓某猫のポスト

 Wenn du gesetzlich krankenversichert bist, wird deine Krankenkasse bis 15. Januar 2025 eine elektronische Patientenakte für dich einrichten – es sei denn, du widersprichst. Das gilt auch für private Krankenversicherungen, die freiwillig eine elektronische Patientenakte anbieten. Durch einen Widerspruch dürfen dir keine Nachteile entstehen. Die Anschreiben der Krankenkassen informieren <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/pressemitteilungen/elektronische-patientenakte-krankenkassen-informieren-unzureichend">unzureichend</a>. Bedenke bei deiner Entscheidung: 



<p></p>



 
 
<p>1. Inhalt und Datensicherheit: Ohne deinen Widerspruch wird künftig jeder Arztbesuch, jede Therapie und jede Medikation in einer zentral abrufbaren elektronischen Patientenakte gespeichert, darunter Arztbriefe, Entlassungsberichte und Diagnosekennungen. Hierunter fallen unter anderem auch Informationen zu deinen Suchtkrankheiten, Psychotherapien und psychischen Erkrankungen, Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen, Geschlechtskrankheiten und Reproduktionsstörungen (z.B. Impotenz), die gespeichert und zusammengetragen werden.&nbsp;Durch die zentrale Speicherung aller Behandlungen in einer elektronischen Patientenakte erhältst du eine einheitliche Zugriffsmöglichkeit auf deine Patientendaten. Andererseits waren in der Vergangenheit bereits mehrere zentralisierte, europäischen Gesundheitssysteme von umfangreichen Datenpannen betroffen. Bei der elektronischen Patientenakte in Deutschland ist noch nichts passiert. Sicherheitsforscher <a href="https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2024/ende-der-epa-experimente">warnen</a> jedoch, Kriminelle könnten mit wenig Aufwand auf beliebige Patientenakten zugreifen. Falls es zu Hacking, Datendiebstahl oder Datenverlust kommen sollte, können viel mehr Informationen verloren gehen als ohne elektronische Patientenakte.</p>
 



 

			
		
 
 



<p>2. Direkter Zugriff: Mit der elektronischen Patientenakte können behandelnde Ärzte, deine Apotheker, deine Physiotherapeuten, dein Pflegeheim, usw., sowohl in Deutschland als auch künftig im EU-Ausland deine elektronische Patientenakte direkt einsehen. Sie können sie auch in ihrer eigenen Praxissoftware speichern. Die Vorteile: Der Datenzugriff kann deine Behandlungen und Medikation wesentlich beschleunigen und verbessern, z. B. auch fehlerhafte Medikamentationen vermeiden. Unterlagen müssen nicht erst angefordert werden und liegen auch im Notfall unmittelbar vor. Doppeluntersuchungen entfallen. Ein möglicher Nachteil könnte sich daraus ergeben, dass für&nbsp;andere medizinische Stellen nicht relevante Behandlungen, Medikamentationen, etc. abgerufen und somit eingesehen werden können (z.B. dein Zahnarzt oder Apotheker könnte von deiner Psychotherapie oder Geschlechtskrankheit erfahren).</p>



<p>Ohne elektronische Patientenakte wirst du, so wie du es bisher kennst und möglicherweise erlebt hast, auf einem Anamnesebogen nach Vorbehandlungen, Medikamentationen, Unverträglichkeiten, Allergien, usw. gefragt. Gegebenenfalls werden weitere Unterlagen angefordert wie z. B. MRT-Aufnahmen, usw. Es gibt auch einen papierbasierten, bundeseinheitlichen Medikationsplan, den du dir ausdrucken lassen kannst. Dieser ist aber auch in der elektronischen Patientenakte speicherbar.</p>



<p>Mit elektronischer Patientenakte kannst du mündlich, über eine App oder über deine Krankenkasse einzelne (ärztliche) Leistungserbringer komplett vom Zugriff auf deine elektronische Patientenakte ausschließen. Dies ist mit gewissen Herausforderungen verbunden. Du hast auch das Recht, gegenüber Leistungserbringern der Übertragung von einzelnen Informationen in die elektronische Patientenakte zu widersprechen. Du kannst einzelne Dokumente auch nachträglich wieder aus ihrer elektronischen Patientenakte löschen (lassen) – leider wieder recht kompliziert. Bedenke, dass Löschungen Nachteile für deine Behandlung nach sich ziehen können.</p>



<p>3. Weitergabe an Dritte: Deine elektronische Patientenakte kann für bestimmte Zwecke auch an Politik und Behörden, Forschende und Wirtschaftsunternehmen (z.B. Technologieunternehmen und Pharmaindustrie) weitergegeben werden. Die Chancen: Anonymisierte Gesundheitsdatenanalysen ermöglichen bedeutende Fortschritte in der Pandemie- und Endemieeindämmung, z. B. durch Früherkennung, sowie in der Forschung, z.B. bei der Entwicklung sicherer Medikamente. Die Risiken: Nur teilweise werden Daten vor der Weitergabe anonymisiert. In anderen Fällen werden dein Name und deine Versichertennummer zwar entfernt, aber über andere Kennzeichen bleibst du eindeutig identifizierbar (sog. Pseudonymisierung). So kann es Dritten gelingen, deine Krankheitsgeschichte wieder dir zuzuordnen.</p>



<p>Hinweis: Auch wenn du die elektronische Patientenakte nutzt, kannst du ihrer Weitergabe an Dritte frühestens ab dem 15.01.2025 separat widersprechen (über eine App deiner Krankenkasse oder durch <a href="https://widerspruch-epa.de/widerspruch-gegen-uebernahme-forschungsdaten/">Brief an ihre Ombudsstelle</a>).</p>



 Ergebnis: Es ist letztendlich deine Entscheidung, ob du&nbsp;eine elektronische Patientenakte haben möchtest oder nicht. 



<p></p>



<p>Wenn du eine elektronische Patientenakte geführt haben möchtest, brauchst du nichts zu tun – sie wird ab 15. Januar 2025 automatisch eingerichtet.</p>



<p>Wenn du dich gegen eine elektronische Patientenakte entscheidest, hilft dir der <a href="https://widerspruch-epa.de/widerspruchs-generator/">Widerspruchs-Generator</a> ein Widerspruchsschreiben zu erstellen. Du kannst auch per Krankenkassen-App oder – bei einigen Krankenkassen – auch <a href="https://www.heise.de/ratgeber/Widerspruch-bei-der-ePA-fuer-alle-Was-bisher-bekannt-ist-9710212.html">über deren Website widersprechen</a>.</p>



<p>Du kannst ab dem Moment widersprechen, in dem deine Krankenkasse dich über dein Widerspruchsrecht informiert hat. Ein Widerspruch ist auch nach Ablauf der in dem Schreiben genannten 6-Wochen-Frist jederzeit möglich; dann werden alle bereits gespeicherte Daten wieder aus der elektronischen Patientenakte gelöscht.

Such deletion:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Must delete all mDL information, log information, and any metadata (e.g. settings) that could impart information about the deleted mDL or its use.&nbsp;  Must not require approval by the Issuing Authority.  Must be an option available to an mDL holder on the mDL device  Must be possible when the mDL device is offline.  Should be available to an mDL holder via a request to the Issuing Authority (see below).  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL保持者は、mDL保持者のデバイスからmDL保持者のmDLを削除する機能を持たなければならない。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  すべてのmDL情報、ログ情報、および削除されたmDLまたはその使用に関する情報を与える可能性のあるメタデータ（設定など）を削除すること  発行機関の承認を必要としないこと。  mDLデバイス上でmDL保持者が利用可能なオプションであること。  mDLデバイスがオフラインのときに可能であること。  発行機関（下記参照）へのリクエストにより、mDL保持者が利用可能であること。  <p></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;デバイスからmDL情報を削除する際の話です。基本的に利用者が自身で削除をすることができること（その際に発行者の承認や接続が不要であること）が求められています。難しいところですね。この章の中で発行したmDL関連情報が適切に扱われていること発行機関が責任をもって確認することが求められる一方で利用者の権利も守らないといけないわけです。まぁ、最低限ウォレット開発者が悪意を持って利用者のデータを扱えないように、というところまでは守りましょう、ってところですね。</p><blockquote><p>Should an mDL device (i.e. a device containing an mDL) be lost or get stolen, it could be beneficial for the mDL holder to have the mDL remotely deleted (or temporarily suspended) by the Issuing Authority. Besides the obvious advantage to the mDL holder, other considerations apply too:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  The mDL holder’s request must be authenticated. It must not be possible for someone other than the mDL holder or the Issuing Authority to delete (or suspend) an mDL.  A “push” capability (from the Issuing Authority to the mDL device) is needed for immediate deletion (or suspension) (see section 6).  Successful deletion (or suspension) depends on network connectivity to the mDL device  The mDL will automatically become unusable (although potentially not inaccessible) when the MSO expires (see section 6).&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLデバイス（mDLを含むデバイス）が紛失または盗難に遭った場合、発行機関によってmDLがリモートで削除（または一時的に停止）されることは、mDL保有者にとって有益です。mDL保有者にとっての明らかな利点の他に、他の考慮事項も適用されます：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  mDL保有者の要求は認証されなければならない。mDL保持者の要求は認証されなければならない。mDL保持者または発行機関以外の者がmDLを削除（または一時停止）することはできない。  即時削除（または一時停止）には、（発行局からmDLデバイスへの）「プッシュ」機能が必要である（セクション6参照）  削除（または一時停止）の成功は、mDLデバイスへのネットワーク接続に依存します。  MSOの有効期限が切れると、mDLは自動的に使用できなくなる（アクセスできなくなる可能性はないが）（セクション6参照）。  <p></p></blockquote><p>やはりスマートフォンベースの話なので当然紛失や盗難に関する考慮は十分に必要です。</p><p>mDLを利用するときはちゃんと認証するのは当たり前として、発行者から発行済みのクレデンシャルをプッシュ等を使って削除できるようにする、また有効期限切れたらウォレット側で自動的に使えなくする、などもちゃんと気を使う必要があります。</p><blockquote><p>In addition, mDL deletion may be needed when an mDL holder wants to transfer an mDL to a new device, when a person moves to another jurisdiction, or when a person dies.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities should weigh the benefits and challenges associated with a remote delete (or suspension) capability when considering its implementation (see Appendix A).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>An mDL holder must have the capability to delete activity log information (as defined in section 4.4) the mDL holder may previously have elected to maintain. It is recommended that this capability allows selective deletion (i.e. specific log entries, rather than only an “all or nothing” option).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>さらに、mDLの削除は、mDL保持者が新しいデバイスにmDLを移したい場合、別の管轄区域に移動する場合、またはmDL保持者が死亡した場合に必要となる可能性がある。</p><p>発行局は、リモート削除（または一時停止）機能の導入を検討する際、その利点と課題を比較検討する必要がある（付録A参照）。</p><p>mDL保持者は、mDL保持者が以前に保持することを選択した活動ログ情報（第4.4項に定義）を削除する機能を持たなければならない。この機能により、選択的な削除（すなわち、「全削除」オプションのみではなく、特定のログエントリーの削除）を可能にすることが推奨される。</p></blockquote><p>mDLを含めデジタルデータを持ち主だけが制御できるようにするのは大切な一方で死亡した場合などの考慮は非常に重要です。マイナンバーカードと保険証の統合をした結果、意識のない救急患者の保険者資格の確認ができない、なんて話も聞きますが、この辺りは例外処理も含めてちゃんとプロセス設計をしておくのが大切です。</p><p>また、ログの削除に関しても選択的に削除することができるようにすべきである、などかなり細かくガイドされている感じがあります。</p><p>4.6.&nbsp;NO TRACKING</p><blockquote><p>“Tracking” is the act of compiling information about an mDL holder and/or an mDL holder’s activity. Any stakeholder (including Issuing Authorities, technology providers, service providers and mDL verifiers) must not track mDL holders or the usage of any mDL except as required by law (e.g. when a drug store dispenses products containing ephedrine).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「トラッキング」とは、mDL保持者および/またはmDL保持者の活動に関する情報を収集する行為を指します。いかなるステークホルダー（発行局、テクノロジープロバイダー、サービスプロバイダー、mDLベリファイアーを含む）も、法律で義務付けられている場合（ドラッグストアがエフェドリンを含む製品を調剤する場合など）を除き、mDL保持者やmDLの使用状況を追跡してはなりません。</p></blockquote><p>トラッキングの禁止に関する条項ですね。法的根拠なくトラッキングしてはならない、と。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Tracking by an mDL verifier can be performed as soon as two different mDL transactions can be linked to each other. This can be countered by designing the solution to maximize anonymity (“characteristic of information that does not permit a personally identifiable information principal to be identified directly or indirectly”, from ISO/IEC 29100) and to maximize unlinkability. Anonymity can be hampered by metadata that may be associated with multiple mDL transactions, e.g. hardware or network addresses, long-term public keys, or session tokens. Consequently, Issuing Authorities must minimize the sharing of static or long-lived metadata.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL検証者による追跡は、2つの異なるmDLトランザクションが互いにリンクされるとすぐに実行できる。これは、匿名性（「個人を特定できる情報主体が直接的または間接的に特定されない情報の特性」、ISO/IEC 29100より）を最大化し、リンク不能性を最大化するようにソリューションを設計することで対抗できる。匿名性は、複数のmDLトランザクションに関連するメタデータ（ハードウェアやネットワークアドレス、長期公開鍵、セッショントークンなど）によって妨げられる可能性がある。そのため、発行局は静的または長期的なメタデータの共有を最小限に抑える必要がある。</p></blockquote><p>これはSD-JWT-VCでも同じ議論がなされていますが、Verifierの結託によるリンク可能性の話ですね。mdocにおける選択的開示については基本的にSD-JWTと類似の考え方なので単体ではリンク可能性に対する対応はできなかったはずです。そのため匿名性を担保するソリューションを別途検討することが必要とされています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Although pre-matched transactions hold the promise of maximizing anonymity at a user data level, anonymity in post-matched transactions is limited since the portrait image is always shared. For these transactions it is recommended that Issuing Authorities pursue regulatory protection against tracking by mDL verifiers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>事前照合取引は、ユーザー・データ・レベルでの匿名性を最大化することが期待できるが、事 後照合取引では肖像画像が常に共有されるため、匿名性は制限される。このような取引の場合、発行機関はmDL検証者による追跡を防ぐため、規制による保護を追求することが推奨されます。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Solutions using the server retrieval method also pose challenges in preventing tracking. As per design, the Issuing Authority is involved in real time each time an mDL is used by the mDL holder. The Issuing Authority would technically be able to keep track of when an mDL holder uses his/her mDL and keep track of what data is shared. Based on IP address analysis the Issuing Authority would also be able to track an mDL holder’s physical location to some extent. This can be mitigated by placing regulatory limitations on the Issuing Authority11, and will be of value to the extent an mDL holder trusts the Issuing Authority’s adherence to the regulatory limitations. Consequently, Issuing Authorities considering a server retrieval solution should carefully weigh the advantages of this approach against its privacy implications.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>サーバーリトリーバルを使用するソリューションは、追跡を防ぐという課題もある。設計の通り、発行局はmDL保有者がmDLを使用するたびにリアルタイムで関与します。発行局は技術的に、mDL保有者がいつmDLを使用し、どのようなデータが共有されたかを追跡することができます。IPアドレスの分析に基づき、発行局はmDL保持者の物理的な所在地をある程度追跡することもできます。この問題は、発行局に規制上の制限を設けることで緩和することができます11 。そのため、発行局はサーバー検索ソリューションを検討する際、このアプローチの利点とプライバシーへの影響を慎重に比較検討する必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>サーバーリトリーバルは基本的に従来のフェデレーションモデルと同様に発行者への問い合わせが発生するため、トラッキング耐性は低いとされます。この辺りはエコシステムのサイズや参加しているエンティティの関係性などを踏まえて設計していかないといけないポイントですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Since the activity log (see section 4.4) contains a full record of when and potentially where an mDL was used, it is reiterated that access to the activity log must not be possible by anyone other than the mDL holder.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>アクティビティログ（4.4項参照）には、mDLがいつ、どこで使用されたかについての完全な記録が含まれるため、mDL保持者以外の者がアクティビティログにアクセスできないようにする必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>今日もこの辺りにしておきましょう。</p><p><br></p>

As standards in this respect are still under development, each Issuing Authority should take great care to ensure that the design of its solution supports this requirement. At minimum, Issuing Authorities must adhere to the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局は、mDL保持者のデバイスに保存されたすべてのmDLデータが適切に保護されていることを確認する必要があります。この点に関する標準はまだ開発中であるため、各発行局はソリューションの設計がこの要件を確実にサポートするよう、細心の注意を払う必要があります。発行局は、最低限以下の事項を遵守しなければなりません：</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;原文でも太字で強調されているとおり、mDL App（ウォレット）に保持されているmDLデータが保護されていることを発行者が確認することが求められています。この責任分解の考え方は非常に重要ですね。欧州でもそうですが発行者となる国が認定したウォレットが必要になるのはこのような背景からきていると思います。しかしこうなるとApple WalletやGoogle Walletに格納されたクレデンシャルが適切に管理されていることをどこまで国は確認できるんだろうか、、、と気になってきますね。</p><p>具体的な要件が続きます。</p><blockquote><p></p>  mDL information must be stored in encrypted form  Private key material must be protected in a security module designed for the safekeeping of key material.  The mDL holder must be authenticated when any mDL data is accessed or released, at a point in time that is sufficiently close (as determined by the Issuing Authority) to the time of the access or release. Issuing Authorities that want to leverage device unlocking to protect mDL data must include measures to ensure that this feature has not been disabled by the mDL holder (also see section 7).  Example: If an app authenticates the mDL holder when the mDL app is accessed, an Issuing Authority should set a time limit after which authentication of the mDL holder is again required before the release of mDL data.&nbsp;  mDL data must be released to an mDL verifier only via the following:   an ISO/IEC 18013-5 compliant interface.  an ISO/IEC 18013-7 compliant interface.  As an alternative to ISO/IEC 18013-7, an over-the-Internet interface as envisioned in Appendix C that:   Complies with Appendix C items 2.b and 2.f, and&nbsp;  Has been approved by the AAMVA Identity Management Committee.    For sharing mDL data between apps on a phone via an interface other than those listed above, an interface compliant with Appendix C items 2.b and 2.f and that has been approved by the AAMVA Identity Management Committee&nbsp;  mDL情報は暗号化された形で保存されなければならない。  秘密鍵は、鍵の保管のために設計されたセキュリティ・モジュールで保護されなければならない。  mDL データがアクセスまたは公開される際には、アクセスまたは公開の時点に（発行局が決定する）十分 に近い時点で、mDL 所持者が認証されなければならない。デバイスのロック解除を活用してmDLデータを保護したい発行局は、この機能がmDL保持者によって無効化されていないことを保証する手段を含める必要があります（セクション7も参照）。  例 アプリがmDLアプリにアクセスしたときにmDLの所有者を認証する場合、発行局は、mDLデータの公開前にmDLの所有者の認証が再度必要となる制限時間を設定する必要があります。  mDLデータは、以下を経由してのみmDL検証者に公開されなければならない：   ISO/IEC 18013-5に準拠したインターフェース。  ISO/IEC 18013-7準拠のインターフェース。  ISO/IEC 18013-7 に代わるものとして、付録 C で想定されているインターネット上のインター フェース：   付録Cの項目2.bおよび2.fに準拠し、かつ  AAMVA アイデンティティ管理委員会によって承認されている。    上記以外のインタフェースを介して携帯電話のアプリ間で mDL データを共有する場合は、付 録 C 項目 2.b および 2.f に準拠し、AAMVA アイデンティティ管理委員会によって承 認されたインタフェース。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><p>かなり細かく要件が決まってますね。EUでも鍵をどこに置くかは色々と議論がありましたが、AAMVAではセキュリティ・モジュールになってますね。クラウドベースのHSMとかは選択肢に入らないのかな？あと、Holderのプレゼンスや認証のタイミング、ウォレットのアンロックが無効化されていないことの確認など色々とガイドがありますがどうやって確認するんだ？？って気もしますが。こうなってきるとやはり専用ウォレットみたいな話になってきそうですねぇ。。</p><blockquote><p>Note 1: This requirement prohibits the sharing of mDL data using the mDL as a “flash pass” (i.e. by showing an image of a credential to a verifier); also see section 8.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>注 1：この要件は、mDL を「フラッシュ・パス」（すなわち、検証者にクレデンシャルの画像を見せること）として使用して mDLデータを共有することを禁止している。</p></blockquote><p>これも重要ですね。以前紹介したパートにも書いてありましたが基本的にmDLは目視で確認するためのものではない、ということですね。</p><p>4.4.&nbsp;ACTIVITY LOG</p><blockquote><p>The mDL app must be capable of maintaining an activity log. The mDL app must allow the mDL holder to decide if an activity log must be maintained or not. It is recommended that the mDL app requires the mDL holder to explicitly choose for or against keeping an activity log upon setup (i.e. no defaults, and in addition to being able to change this subsequently). The activity log and related settings must be accessible only to the mDL holder (also see section 4.6). The activity log must allow for the recording of all mDL transactions. In this context, an mDL transaction is the sharing of information by an mDL holder with an mDL verifier, as well as any provisioning, update, or communication action between the mDL and the Issuing Authority. At minimum, the following must be recordable for any transaction: Transaction timestamp; type of transaction (e.g. update or data sharing); in case of a data sharing transaction the data that was shared, and to the extent that it can be gathered, information about the identity of the mDL verifier. It is recommended that the mDL app provides the mDL holder the capability to select what types of activities are recorded in the activity log (i.e. rather than only an “all or nothing” option). It is also recommended that the mDL app includes functionality to help the mDL holder monitor and manage the size of the activity log within the capabilities of the mDL holder’s device. The mDL app must provide an option to the mDL holder to export the activity log.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLアプリは、アクティビティログを維持できなければならない。mDLアプリは、アクティビティログを保持するかどうかをmDL保持者が決定できなければならない。mDLアプリは、セットアップ時に、mDL保有者がアクティビティログの保持の可否を明示的に選択することを推奨します（すなわち、デフォルトではなく、さらにその後変更できるようにします）。アクティビティログおよび関連する設定は、mDL保持者のみがアクセス可能でなければなりません（4.6項も参照）。アクティビティログは、すべてのmDLトランザクションの記録を可能にしなければならない。ここでいう mDL トランザクションとは、mDL 保持者が mDL 検証者と情報を共有すること、および mDL と発行局との間でプロビジョニング、更新、または通信を行うことである。どのようなトランザクションでも、最低限、以下の情報は記録可能でなければならない： トランザクションのタイムスタンプ、トランザクションのタイプ（更新またはデータ共有など）、データ 共有トランザクションの場合は共有されたデータ、および収集可能な範囲で mDL 検証者の身元に関する情報。mDLアプリは、活動ログに記録される活動の種類を選択する機能をmDL保持者に提供することが推奨される（すなわち、「all or nothing」オプションのみではなく）。また、mDLアプリには、mDL保持者がmDL保持者のデバイスの能力の範囲内でアクティビティログのサイズを監視および管理するのに役立つ機能が含まれることが推奨されます。mDLアプリは、mDL保持者がアクティビティログをエクスポートできるオプションを提供する必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>次はログの話題です。アクティビティログはプライバシーの観点からも非常に重要なものですので、Holderが完全に制御できるものである必要があることが強調されています。この辺りもウォレットソフトウェアを開発する際は留意したいポイントですね。</p><blockquote><p>If an Issuing Authority allows an mDL holder to hold the same mDL on more than one device, the activity log settings on each device should be independent of each other. It is recommended that there be no synchronization of the activity log or activity log settings between the two devices. Any synchronization features that are provided must adhere to the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Synchronization must be an option that can be enabled or disabled by the mDL holder. The process to enable synchronization must require the mDL holder to prove access to both devices.&nbsp;  Synchronization must occur directly between the devices in question. A synchronization action must not give visibility of any of the following to anyone other than the mDL holder, or to anyone other than entities that already know that the mDL holder has an mDL on more than one device:  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>   Activity log information.  Activity log settings.

 こんにちは、富士榮です。  <br>  引き続きAAMVAの<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">Mobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi85q8IPb56W5CIBBhWuklhFDxdF3kKtk_aGN65-fLtdEYJ5aX1p9So9JtqZQEMRGO4EW6Abqt41KCuQRb77IZFHKhFk-jcVGGWV1ETizuK3OgxNNvxgphB0CMgGG4CJQM3ASdfhzVQobyNMzl_KAXkHKmAcfk7amN5a8iOw9tj0BF657SbWgr4x347eSQs"></a> <br><br>  ようやく4章の「PRIVACY AND SECURITY」に入ります。4章も結構長いんですよね。。。ただ、結構重要な章なので細かくみていきたいと思います。  <br>  4.1.&nbsp;INTRODUCTION <blockquote> The privacy of an mDL holder has been paramount in the mDL design process from the start. Care was and is being taken in all the work to ensure that methods and means are available to protect mDL holder privacy. The subsections that follow elaborate in more detail on different aspects of privacy protection and security. </blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLの設計プロセスでは、当初からmDL保持者のプライバシーが最優先されてきました。すべての作業において、mDL保持者のプライバシーを保護する方法と手段が利用できるよう、細心の注意が払われています。以下のサブセクションでは、プライバシー保護とセキュリティのさまざまな側面について詳しく説明します。</p></blockquote><p>4.2.&nbsp;DATA MINIMIZATION AND SELECTIVE DATA RELEASE</p><blockquote><p>A primary component of privacy involves the ability of an mDL holder to only share some information. This is achieved by two related but distinct measures:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Data minimization: A decision by an Issuing Authority to record fractional information about an attribute in an mDL, thus empowering an mDL holder to share less information than would otherwise have been the case. For example, an Issuing Authority can decide to include9 the optional age_birth_year field in an mDL in addition to the (mandatory) date of birth. This will allow the mDL holder to share only a birth year as opposed to a date of birth. Another example would be to include the resident city in addition to a full address.&nbsp;  Selective data release: Allowing an mDL holder to decide which of the data fields requested by an mDL verifier will be released to the Verifier.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As noted in section 2, it is important for Issuing Authorities to understand that ISO/IEC 18013-5 primarily specifies interfaces. The interfaces support both data minimization and selective data release. It is recommended that Issuing Authorities implement and provision as many of the optional minimized data elements, defined in ISO/IEC 18013-5 and in this document, as possible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>プライバシーの主要な構成要素は、mDL保持者が一部の情報のみを共有する能力である。これは、2つの関連するが異なる手段によって達成される：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  データの最小化：データの最小化：発行局が、mDLに属性情報の一部を記録することを決定すること。例えば、発行局はmDLに、（必須である）生年月日に加え、オプションのage_birth_yearフィールドを含める9 ことができます。これにより、mDLの所持者は、生年月日ではなく、生年のみを共有することができます。他の例としては、完全な住所に加えて、居住地の市町村を含めることができる。  選択的データ公開：mDL保有者が、mDLベリファイアから要求されたデータフィールドのうち、どのフィールドをベリファイアに開示するかを決定できるようにすること。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>セクション2で述べたように、発行局はISO/IEC 18013-5が主にインタフェースを規定していることを理解することが重要である。インターフェースはデータの最小化と選択的なデータ公開の両方をサポートする。発行局は、ISO/IEC 18013-5 および本文書で定義されているオプションの最小化データエレメントを可能な限り実装し、提供することが推奨される。</p></blockquote><p>Privacy by designということです。ISO/IEC 18013-5ではデータの最小化と選択的情報開示の両方をサポートしているので、本書の原則を踏まえてちゃんと実装しなさいよ、と。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In addition, Issuing Authorities must ensure that mDL apps to which they provision data support at least the following:&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  In case the request was received electronically, the mDL app must clearly convey what data was requested, and whether the mDL verifier intends to retain the information. If the request is presented in summarized form in the user interface (e.g. “Identity and driving privilege data” as opposed to “First Name, Last Name, DOB, Driving privileges”), means must be available to give the mDL holder visibility of the details of such a summarized form, both before and during a transaction.  The mDL app must provide the mDL holder full control over which data elements to share with the mDL verifier.&nbsp;  ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires the portrait image to be shared if the portrait was requested and if any other data element is released (to enable the mDL verifier to tie the mDL information to the person presenting the information). The app must support a graceful and informed exit from the request if the holder opts not to share the portrait image when requested.  If blanket sharing options are used, measures must be implemented to ensure that the mDL holder remains aware of what is being released when such an option is in effect. An mDL holder must also be able to opt out of or cancel any blanket sharing function.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities (and their app providers) are encouraged to devise solutions that will minimize transaction friction without compromising the above requirements.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>さらに、発行局はデータを提供するmDLアプリが少なくとも以下をサポートしていることを確認する必要があります：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  要求が電子的に受信された場合、mDLアプリは、どのようなデータが要求されたのか、またmDLベリファイアがその情報を保持する意図があるかどうかを明確に伝えなければならない。要求がユーザーインターフェースに要約された形で提示される場合（例えば、「姓名、DOB、運転権限」ではなく「身分証明書および運転権限データ」）、取引の前および取引中の両方において、mDL保有者がそのような要約された形の詳細を可視化できる手段を利用できなければなりません。  mDLアプリは、どのデータ要素をmDLベリファイアと共有するかについて、mDL保持者に完全なコントロールを提供しなければならない。  ISO/IEC 18013-5では、肖像画が要求された場合、およびその他のデータ要素が公開された場合、肖像画を共有することが要求されています（mDLベリファイアがmDL情報を提示者に紐付けることを可能にするため）。アプリは、所持者が要求されたときに肖像画を共有しないことを選択した場合、その要求から 潔く、かつ通知された形で抜けることをサポートしなければならない。  包括的共有オプションが使用される場合、そのようなオプションが有効であるとき に、mDL保有者が何が公表されるかを確実に認識し続けるための措置が講じられなけれ ばならない。また、mDLの保有者は、包括的共有機能をオプトアウトまたはキャンセルできなければならない。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局（およびそのアプリプロバイダ）は、上記の要件を損なうことなく、取引の摩擦を最小化するソリューショ ンを考案することが推奨される。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>データを要求・共有する目的・意図を明確に伝える、そして提供しないことをユーザが選択できるようにする、オプトアウトできるようにもする、と。どれも基本的なことではありますが実装者にとってはどのようなUXを提供するかが腕の見せ所になると重要なポイントの一つでもあります。この辺りは日本でもウォレット開発をする方々も参考にすべき点だと思います。</p><p><br></p><p>細かくみていこうと思うので少し細切れにしていきます。</p><p>ということで今日はここまで。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p>こんにちは、富士榮です。</p><p>引き続き<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">AAMVAのMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjheuE0pW_Gibv8p14gefJol34or8iPp4a4pWzoPAcrwPFSnEcPxU_72Sm-ExWFQ9t2RCpx7ejVdNdfYlx6MQU7rbTTogPcw_g4eVMbXISy_BXiGxaohW_fWS5bYPAjua61aWqWhPNzM0qgsHk8hW6Nte3ErLLd_z4ctKlIPicw5_BHk-4BqaKmrCO3fdBu"></a> <br>まだ３章が続きますが今回で３章は終わりです。<p></p><p><br></p><p>3.6.&nbsp;IACA ROOT CERTIFICATE</p><blockquote><p>In Table B.1 of ISO/IEC 18013-5, on the table row for the “ISSUER” certificate component, replace:</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>stateOrProvinceName is optional.

This enables readers to always know which version of the data structure is present on a credential since the full data string is always read. This is not true for an mDL. An mDL reader has to explicitly request individual data elements, and does not know in advance which data elements are present or what version of a data set is supported.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>AAMVA カード設計仕様の 2D バーコードのデータ構造には、バージョン番号が含まれている。これにより、完全なデータ文字列が常に読み取られるため、読み手はデータ構造のどのバージョンがクレデンシャルに存在するかを常に知ることができる。これは mDL には当てはまらない。mDL リーダは個々のデータ要素を明示的に要求する必要があり、どのデータ要素が存在する か、またはデータ・セットのどのバージョンがサポートされているかを事前に知ることはできない。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One approach to address this is to add a “version” data element to the AAMVA namespace. To be useful an mDL reader would have to obtain this data element before making a subsequent request for additional data. Allowing the release of this data element without mDL holder approval is possible; requiring approval may confuse an mDL holder and increase transaction friction. Regardless, the 2-step process would add complexity (an mDL reader would still have to allow for not receiving a response to such a request) and add time to the transaction. Such an approach would also be unique to mDL in North America.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>これに対処する1つの方法は、AAMVA名前空間に「バージョン」データ要素を追加することである。mDLの読者は、追加データを要求する前にこのデータ要素を取得しなければならない。mDL保持者の承認なしにこのデータ要素の公開を許可することは可能です。承認を必要とすると、mDL保持者を混乱させ、取引の摩擦を増大させる可能性があります。いずれにせよ、2段階のプロセスは複雑さを増し（mDLリーダーは、そのような要求に対する返答を受け取らないことを許容しなければならない）、取引に時間を要する。また、このようなアプローチは北米のmDLに特有のものである。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Instead, versioning of the AAMVA mDL data element set is achieved as follows:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  If needed, create a new identifier. This applies if there is a change to an existing data element, or if a completely new data element is added. Set a date by which mDL apps and mDL readers must support the new identifier (Dayx in Figure 2). “Support” as used here means that an mDL app must allow an Issuing Authority to provision the identifier into the app, and that an mDL reader must be able to read the new identifier.&nbsp;  For the old identifier, set a date by which mDL apps and mDL readers do not need to support the old identifier anymore (Dayy in Figure 2). This is also the date by which Issuing Authorities must be provisioning the new identifier.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>代わりに、AAMVA mDLデータ要素セットのバージョニングは、以下のように行われる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  必要に応じて、新しい識別子を作成する。これは、既存のデータ要素に変更がある場合、またはまったく新しいデータ要素が追加される場合に適用されます。mDLアプリとmDLリーダーが新しい識別子をサポートしなければならない期日を設定します（図2のDay x）。ここでいう「サポート」とは、mDLアプリが発行機関に識別子をアプリにプロビジョニングできるようにすること、およびmDLリーダーが新しい識別子を読み取れるようにすることを意味します。  旧識別子については、mDLアプリとmDLリーダーが旧識別子をサポートする必要がなくなる日付を設定します（図2のDay y）。これは、発行局が新しい識別子をプロビジョニングする期日でもあります。&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Figure 2 also reflects other requirements on both the mDL reader and the mDL app. The main advantage of the approach illustrated in Figure 2 is that, in case of changing an existing identifier, the Issuing Authority will have the time between the two dates to provision the new identifier (and deprecate the old identifier) to all its mDLs with the knowledge that mDL readers should be able to accommodate either identifier (the highlighted option in Figure 2). In the case where a new identifier is added (i.e. when there is no change to an existing identifier), the two dates may be on the same day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>図2には、mDLリーダーとmDLアプリの両方に対するその他の要件も反映されています。図2に示されたアプローチの主な利点は、既存の識別子を変更する場合、発行局は2つの日付の間に、mDLリーダーがどちらの識別子にも対応できることを前提に、すべてのmDLに新しい識別子を提供する（古い識別子を廃止する）時間を持つことができることです（図2のハイライトされたオプション）。新しい識別子が追加される場合（既存の識別子に変更がない場合）、2つの日付は同じ日になる可能性があります。</p><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ideally mDL readers would ask for the old identifier up to Dayy and for the new identifier thereafter. However, it is likely that readers would, at least around the change date, ask for both. It is also likely that an mDL would, especially around Dayy, include both identifiers. How the request is presented to the mDL holder, and how approval to share is administered, is left to implementers. Nevertheless, a simple approach could be for the mDL to present only one request, for the new identifier, to the mDL holder.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>理想的には、mDLの読者はDay yまでは旧識別子を、それ以降は新識別子を要求するだろう。しかし、少なくとも変更日前後には、読者は両方の識別子を要求すると思われる。また、mDLは、特にDayyの前後には、両方の識別子を含むと思われる。どのようにリクエストをmDL保持者に提示し、どのように共有の承認を行うかは、実装者に委ねられている。とはいえ、単純なアプローチとしては、mDLがmDL保持者に提示する要求は、新しい識別子のための1つのみである。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjhpKZpmtHdpxVCCwwAKMtV_dcR9dTJ0qNOyEf6IeiqWqdvkGzDtfypoVDg1yyriuQFZUYGmH_-6Gwpmnk89D1VB673A4oDmpeJn3Y70AXiEZgh03qvwkd9zgCGiu41f1-Cf-evePqOQvlMxJyfiAfp56dM-gQ34jp1dJYCl-mphywPE6HYyO0or_fUrmhT"></a> <br>バージョニングに関するコンセプトがちゃんとしていますね。リードタイムをうまく作ってスムーズに移行できる様にすることができる様にしています。<p></p><p><br></p>3.8.&nbsp;ISSUING AUTHORITY SPECIFIC DATA<blockquote> ISO/IEC 18013-5 allows for the creation of additional namespaces, in like manner as the AAMVA namespace defined in this document (see clause 7.2.8 in ISO/IEC 18013-5). Issuing Authorities can use this mechanism to add additional fields to an mDL. The Issuing Authority would be responsible for communicating such an additional namespace to mDL verifiers that need to be able to read the Issuing Authority-specific data.  Note: ISO/IEC 18013-5 also lends itself to being adopted for the issuing of credentials separate from an mDL, for example fishing licenses, health credentials, or watercraft licenses.&nbsp; </blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5では、本文書で定義されているAAMVA名前空間と同様に、追加の名前空間を 作成することができる（ISO/IEC 18013-5の7.2.8項参照）。発行局はこのメカニズムを使用して、mDLにフィールドを追加できる。発行局は、発行局固有のデータを読み取る必要のあるmDL検証者に、このような追加名前空間を伝達する責任を負う。</p><p>注：ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、漁業免許証、健康証明書、水上バイク免許証など、mDL とは別のクレデンシャルの発行にも採用できる。</p><p></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>今回はここまでです。次は４章です。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

The portrait image therefore needs to be of suitable quality for this purpose. ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires the portrait to comply with Annex D of ISO/IEC 18013-2:2020, which in turn requires the portrait image to be at least 192 pixels wide and 240 pixels high. In addition, ISO/IEC 18013-2 requires portrait images intended for automated face recognition to comply with ISO/IEC 19794-5, which among other requirements requires 90 pixels between the centers of the eyes. However, it should be noted that these requirements were created in the context of storage on a physical card and in machine-readable formats with limited storage capacity compared to an mDL.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>肖像画像は、立会取引においてmDLを提示する人物とmDLを照合する主要な手段です。したがって、肖像画像はこの目的に適した品質である必要があります。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、肖像画がISO/IEC 18013-2:2020の附属書Dに準拠することを要求しており、この附属書Dは、肖像画が少なくとも幅192ピクセル、高さ240ピクセルであることを要求している。さらに、ISO/IEC 18013-2は、自動顔認識用の肖像画像について、ISO/IEC 19794-5に準拠することを要求しており、この要件では、特に目の中心間が90ピクセルであることが要求されています。ただし、これらの要件は、物理的なカードへの保存や、mDLに比べて保存容量が限られる機械読み取り可能なフォーマットでの保存を想定して作成されたものであることに留意する必要があります。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It would therefore be possible to include a portrait image of much higher resolution in an mDL. Arguments for going this route include higher accuracy when using the portrait image as a probe image in 1:n biometric searching, and making it easier for a human to compare the portrait image with the mDL holder. Arguments against going this route include the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>従って、mDLにはるかに高解像度の肖像画像を含めることが可能である。この経路をとることへの賛成意見には、1:nの生体認証検索でプローブ画像として肖像画を使用する際の精度が高くなること、人間が肖像画とmDLの所持者を比較しやすくなることなどがあります。このルートに反対する意見には、以下のようなものがあります：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. A larger portrait image can negatively affect mDL transaction times（より大きなポートレート画像は、mDLのトランザクション時間に悪影響を与える可能性があります）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2.&nbsp;A better-quality portrait image could arguably be less privacy preserving than a smaller portrait image.（より質の高いポートレート画像は、より小さなポートレート画像よりもプライバシーの保護に劣る可能性がある）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3.&nbsp;The primary purpose of the portrait image is a 1:1 match with the mDL holder. If this match is performed biometrically, the smaller portrait size should be sufficient.（肖像画像の主な目的は、mDLの所持者と1対1で照合することです。この照合が生体認証で行われる場合は、肖像画のサイズは小さくても十分です）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities should carefully consider all these points when deciding on a portrait image size. It is recommended that Issuing Authorities opt for a smaller rather than for a larger portrait image.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局は、肖像画のサイズを決定する際、これらの点を慎重に考慮する必要があります。発行局は、大きな縦長画像よりも小さな縦長画像を選ぶことを推奨します。</p></blockquote><p>結構細かいレベルで顔写真の要件が決まっているんですね。</p><p><br></p><p>3.4.&nbsp;SIGNATURE IMAGE</p><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not prescribe anything other than that the image shall be in JPEG or JPEG2000 format. Building on the requirements for a signature image in ISO/IEC 18013-1 and in the AAMVA Card Design Standard, if present the signature image must be an accurate and recognizable representation of the original signature. Care should be given to image capture, processing, digitization, and compression.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、画像が JPEG または JPEG2000 フォーマットであること以外には何も規定していない。ISO/IEC 18013-1およびAAMVAカード設計基準における署名画像の要件に基づき、署名画像が存在す る場合は、元の署名を正確かつ認識可能な形で表現しなければならない。画像のキャプチャ、処理、デジタル化、および圧縮には注意を払う必要がある。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>3.5.&nbsp;MDL CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTOCOLS</p><blockquote><p>In line with recommendations from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, certain cryptographic constructs must not be supported for mDL solutions built in accordance with this document. At the same time, interoperability needs to be retained so mDL readers can successfully interact with an mDL originating from elsewhere.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>米国国立標準技術研究所（NIST）およびカナダ・サイバーセキュリティセンターの勧告に従い、この文書に従って構築されたmDLソリューションでは、特定の暗号構造をサポートしてはなりません。同時に、mDLリーダーが他の場所から発信されたmDLと正常にやり取りできるよう、相互運用性を維持する必要があります。</p>  To this end, the AAMVA mDL Implementation Guidelines require the following changes to be applied to ISO/IEC 18013-5:  </blockquote><blockquote><p>このため、AAMVA mDL実装ガイドラインでは、ISO/IEC 18013-5に以下の変更を適用することを要求している：</p></blockquote><p>ここも量が多いので割愛しますが、Cipher SuiteをNISTの要求に従って変更したりしていますので、他の国が単純にmdocだからISO/IEC 18013-5に従ってリーダーを実装してもAAMVAのmDLは読めないって言う状態になるんだろうなぁ。。。と思います。</p><p><br></p><p>ということでここまでです。３章がもう少しだけ続きます。</p>

<p>こんにちは、富士榮です。</p><p>引き続きAAMVAの<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">Mobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhBEDtZGMY8KAvIcWmF_nr7Yae50KCINUkNzovO1xmrtAspfVN2sSwB2GfcvrW57NmqFULeLGPxOnGCZ84E-CSILP6uuEaHW9Rne1Adv0oXwwa3qzw7MXsdEf6PbeBw_42rQJwErsEYbxCQUt3k_3iCGGqOu_76BLge31-ltvFySpfSQ19FBewhEgHSYLcA"></a> <br>今回は２章のmDL Solution Overviewを見ていきます。<p></p><blockquote><p>An mDL can be described as leveraging a mobile device to transfer (or cause to be transferred) driver’s license information to an mDL verifier, who cryptographically authenticates the information using the Issuing
Authority’s public key. A visual rendering of a DL on a mobile device’s display (and which can be misused as a
“flash pass”) therefore does not qualify as an mDL (also see section 8).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL は、発行局の公開鍵を使用して情報を暗号的に検証する mDL検証者に運転免許証情報を転送する （または転送させる）ために、モバイル機器を活用するものと説明できる。したがって、モバイル機器のディスプレイ上に DL を視覚的に表示するもの（「フラッシュパス」として悪用される可能性があるもの）は、mDL として認められない（セクション 8 も参照）。</p></blockquote><p>スクショやオレオレはダメってことですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>An mDL solution can be described in terms of the following three properties:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLソリューションは、以下の3つの性質で説明できる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Data retrieval method. The device retrieval method (sometimes referred to as the offline model) works without outside connectivity (for both the mDL holder’s device and the mDL reader) at the time the transaction takes place, thus requiring the mDL data to reside on the mDL holder’s device. Under the server retrieval method (sometimes referred to as the online model, and not to be confused with use of an mDL in an unattended transaction setting such as over the Internet) mDL data is retrieved in real time directly from the Issuing Authority. ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires an mDL to support device retrieval, and allows a device to additionally support server retrieval.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. データ検索方式。デバイス検索方式（オフラインモデルと呼ばれることもある）では、取引時に外部（mDL保持者のデバイスとmDLリーダーの両方）に接続することなく動作するため、mDLデータはmDL保持者のデバイスに存在する必要がある。サーバー検索方式（オンラインモデルと呼ばれることもあり、インターネット経由のような無人トランザクションでのmDLの使用と混同されないよう注意）では、mDLのデータは発行機関からリアルタイムで直接取得される。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、mDLがデバイスの検索をサポートすることを要求しており、さらにデバイスがサーバーの検索をサポートすることを認めている。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. Transaction type. An attended transaction is one where the mDL holder and the mDL verifier are in close proximity to each other. The engagement mechanisms currently reflected in ISO/IEC 18013-5 (QR code, NFC) were selected to support such close proximity. An unattended transaction is one where the mDL holder and the mDL verifier are not in close proximity, e.g. when an mDL holder wants to provide identity or proof of age to an online retailer. ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not currently support unattended transactions. However, work is ongoing to standardize a solution.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. トランザクションの種類。対面型トランザクションとは、mDL保有者とmDL検証者が近接しているトランザクションのことである。現在ISO/IEC 18013-5に反映されているエンゲージメントの仕組み（QRコード、NFC）は、このような近接をサポートするために選択された。無人トランザクションとは、mDL 保持者と mDL 検証者が近接していないトランザクショ ンのことであり、たとえば、mDL 保持者がオンライン小売業者に ID または年齢証明を提供する場合などである。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は現在、無人トランザクションをサポートしていない。ただし、ソリューションを標準化する作業が進行中である。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. Timing of (and responsibility for) matching. This property is about the responsibility for confirming, at transaction time, that the person presenting the mDL data is the person described by the mDL data. In a post-matched transaction, the link between the mDL Presenter and the mDL data is made after the mDL data is shared and is performed by the mDL verifier. This happens by comparing the portrait image in the mDL with the person presenting the mDL. ISO/IEC 18013-5 supports postmatched transactions. In a pre-matched transaction, the link between the mDL Presenter and the mDL is made right before the mDL data is shared. Although the Issuing Authority should not be involved in real time, the Issuing Authority does take responsibility for certifying the link. The mDL verifier receives only the confirmation that the person presenting the mDL data is the person described by the shared mDL data. ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not currently support pre-matched transactions. However, work is ongoing to standardize a solution (and notably one that does not involve the Issuing Authority at transaction time).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. 照合のタイミング（および責任）。このプロパティは、mDLデータの提示者がmDLデータに記述された本人であることをトランザクション時に確認する責任に関するものである。マッチング後のトランザクションでは、mDL提示者とmDLデータのリンクは、mDLデータが共有された後に行われ、mDL検証者によって実行される。これは、mDL内の肖像画像とmDL提示者を比較することで行われる。ISO/IEC 18013-5 はポストマッチトランザクションをサポートしている。事前照合トランザクションでは、mDL提示者とmDLのリンクは、mDLデータが共有される直前に行われる。発行局はリアルタイムで関与すべきではないが、発行局はリンクを認証する責任を負う。mDLの検証者は、mDLデータの提示者が共有されたmDLデータに記述された本人であることの確認のみを受ける。ISO/IEC 18013-5は現在、事前照合トランザクションをサポートしていない。しかし、（特にトランザクション時に発行局が関与しない）ソリューションを標準化するための作業が進行中である。</p></blockquote><p>デバイスリトリーバル、サーバーリトリーバルの２方式があること、対面、非対面のシナリオが定義されていること、そして検証者がHolderバインディングを行うことが求められている、ということです。本人確認書類として利用することを考えると当然ですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>With this as background, Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of the mDL ecosystem described in ISO/IEC 18013-5.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>これを背景に、図1はISO/IEC 18013-5で説明されているmDLエコシステムのハイレベルな概要を示している。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjlRKfp1Zh0yZz5SYXLjnkGDTY3J4rdF0dFbsr3NDGiLK4sQllx_gBpLQHsCgRQRxq3QwFboS6_54Tsfqzw1afoJT3-iI95mHWXrXE1HDvhY2iQrpAAAGXYg3pJqyCIvz6fy5agtv-Rogt03J4w8gbf9HE00N3Rt1CVPCFDReQiQ4hrxKYZz-6_RBFRh_1U"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>Three interactions are involved:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3つの相互作用が関係している：&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Interaction between the Issuing Authority and the mDL. This interaction results in getting everything onto an mDL holder’s device that is needed to use the mDL. There is also subsequent interaction between the Issuing Authority and the mDL to keep the mDL information updated. Technical components of this interaction will be standardized in the ISO/IEC 23220 series.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. 発行局とmDLの間のインタラクション。このやりとりの結果、mDLを使用するために必要なすべての情報がmDLホルダーのデバイスに取り込まれます。また、発行局とmDLの間には、mDLの情報を更新するための相互作用があります。このインタラクションの技術的なコンポーネントは、ISO/IEC 23220シリーズで標準化される予定です。</p></blockquote><p>Issueの時の仕組みですね。OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuanceでもmdocを扱うことができますので、そちらを非対面のシナリオでは使うケースもありますが、ここではISO 23220が挙げられています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2. Interaction between the mDL and the mDL reader infrastructure of the mDL verifier. This interaction comprises the transfer of technical information to set up a secure communication channel between the two parties, and the subsequent exchange of the driver’s license information (or of a point from where it can be retrieved) that the mDL holder agreed to share. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes an interface describing this interaction.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. mDLとmDL検証装置のmDL読み取りインフラ間のインタラクション。このインタラクションは、両者間の安全な通信チャネルを設定するための技術情報の転送と、それに続く mDL 保持者が共有に同意した運転免許証情報（またはそれを取得できるポイント）の交換で構成される。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、このインタラクションを記述するインタフェースを完全に標準化する。</p></blockquote><p>こちらはPresentationの話ですね。こちらもOpenID for Verifiable Presentationでも対応ができる範囲です。ここではISO 18013-5での対応が挙げられています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>3. Interaction between the mDL reader infrastructure and the Issuing Authority. This interaction can be used for different purposes, depending on the data retrieval method involved:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Device retrieval method: The interaction is used by the mDL verifier to obtain the public keys needed to authenticate mDL information. Such interaction can also involve an intermediary entity that aggregates and disseminates certificates. (In North America, AAMVA’s Digital Trust Service performs this function – see section 5.) Regardless, the mDL verifier must trust that the certificate truly comes from a valid Issuing Authority. This interaction does not need to occur at the time of an mDL transaction. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes a method supporting this interaction.  Server retrieval method: The interaction is used by the mDL verifier for two purposes:   As in the case for the device retrieval method, to obtain the public key of the Issuing Authority  To pass to the Issuing Authority, in real time, a token that identifies the mDL holder and the mDL, and to receive the actual mDL information back from the Issuing Authority. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes an interface describing this interaction   <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. mDLリーダーインフラと発行局との間のインタラクション。このインタラクションは、関係するデータ検索方法に応じて、異なる目的で使用することができる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  デバイスの検索方法： このインタラクションは、mDL 検証者が mDL 情報の検証に必要な公開鍵を取得するために使用される。このようなインタラクションには、証明書を集約し普及させる仲介エンティティが関与することもできる。(北米では、AAMVA のデジタル・トラスト・サービスがこの機能を果たす。） いずれにせよ、mDLの検証者は、証明書が本当に有効な発行機関から発行されたものであることを信頼しなけれ ばならない。この相互作用は、mDLのトランザクション時に発生する必要はない。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、この相互作用をサポートする方法を完全に標準化している。  サーバーの検索方法： このインタラクションは、mDL検証者によって2つの目的で使用される：   デバイス検索方式と同様に、発行局の公開鍵を取得する。  mDLの所有者とmDLを識別するトークンをリアルタイムで発行局に渡し、実際のmDL情報を発行局から受け取ること。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、このインタラクションを記述するインタフェースを完全に標準化している。   <p></p></blockquote><p>ここはデバイスリトリーバルなのかサーバーリトリーバルなのかで異なりますが、mDLリーダーがIssuerへの問い合わせを行うケースについて記載されていますね。いわゆるDIDを使ったVCとの大きな違いはIssuing Authorityが完全に中央集権であることかと思います。（免許なので当然ですね）そのため、検証用の公開鍵を取得する場合は堂々とVerifierからIssuerへのインタラクションが発生しています。（ここは若干プライバシーとのトレードオフはありますが）&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Note that ISO/IEC 18013-5 specifies system interfaces and a certificate exchange method, and on purpose does not address the user interface (e.g. the look, feel and functionality of an mDL app residing on an mDL holder’s device). It is left up to Issuing Authorities (and their implementers) to innovate in this area.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5は、システム・インターフェースと証明書交換方法を規定するものであり、ユーザ・イン ターフェース（例えば、mDL保有者のデバイスに常駐するmDLアプリのルック、フィール、機能性）については、 意図的に触れていないことに留意されたい。この分野での技術革新は、発行局（およびその実装者）に委ねられている。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>ということで、本日はここまで。</p><p><br></p>

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  先日、<a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/12/blog-post.html">用語を見た</a>ついでにAAMVAが出しているMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4を読んでいこうと思います。  <br>   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjjSCs0hVWK7schMxMWxX_jNjarDUUlvDhZPWDkVuJSY_CSHh2gdAgW92RcC-0unJodQBwWYdiJj7Inhz0_So2plM4W9fRQ0xb8dQGFtcXoezjCup5Wn5ll9BxKRxVBW0D-UzCxiuZkmyzJFZXWQb-F6IyfGlYGctpLzkUPnQdVb0mzDjvVKfT_wMRMtF1H"></a> <br>  <a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">こちら</a>が原文です。  <br>  まずはIntroductionから。 <blockquote> The AAMVA Joint Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) Working Group (WG) has been active around mobile identification since 2012. As the mDL evolves, the mDL WG continues to identify and address topics on which guidance to Issuing Authorities can be helpful. This document represents the bulk of the current guidance, and points to additional resources as needed. </blockquote><blockquote><p>AAMVA 合同モバイル運転免許証（mDL）ワーキンググループ（WG）は、2012 年以来、モバイル ID を中心に活動してきました。mDL の進化に伴い、mDL WG は、発行機関へのガイダンスが役立つトピックを特定し、対処し続けています。この文書は、現在のガイダンスの大部分を示し、必要に応じて追加のリソースを示します。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The goal of this document is to inform and equip Issuing Authorities, and to some extent mDL verifiers, to achieve the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>この文書の目的は、発行局、そしてある程度mDLの検証者に対し、以下のことを達成するための情報を提供し、装備させることです：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Technical interoperability between different Issuing Authorities’ mDL programs, i.e., an Issuing Authority being able to read an mDL issued by any other Issuing Authority.  Trust in different Issuing Authorities’ mDLs.  Privacy preserving implementations.&nbsp;  異なる発行局のmDLプログラム間の技術的な相互運用性。つまり、発行局は他の発行局が発行したmDLを読むことができる。  異なる発行局のmDLに対する信頼性  プライバシーの保護  <p></p></blockquote><p>まずは目的からですが、アメリカでは州ごとに免許証を発行しているため、相互運用性は非常に重要になってくる、というところだと思います。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>It is up to Issuing Authorities to determine the extent to which the guidance in this document is followed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the minimum measures deemed necessary to achieve the above are labeled as mandatory requirements in this document (i.e. “shall” or “must”). A summary of minimum measures can be found in Appendix B.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>本文書のガイダンスにどの程度従うかは、発行当局の判断に委ねられます。とはいえ、上記を達成するために必要とみなされる最低限の対策は、本文書では必須要件（すなわち「しなければならない」または「しなければならない」）と表示されています。最小限の措置の要約は付録Bに記載されています。</p></blockquote><p>先にも書いた通り、州ごとに発行しているのでこのガイドラインの強制力も一定程度にとどまる感じなんですね。確かに後半に出てくるリテンション期間の話や複数枚数の発行の可否などはかなり現場に判断を委ねているところもあります。このあたりは念頭に読み進める必要がありそうです。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The following topics are outside the scope of this document:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>以下のトピックは本文書の範囲外です：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  The identity establishment, management and recordkeeping that precedes the creation of an identity credential.  Responsibilities of mDL verifiers.&nbsp;  </blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  ID クレデンシャルの作成に先立つ、ID の確立、管理、および記録管理。  mDL 検証者の責任。  </blockquote><p>あくまでmDLの発行と管理に関するところがスコープっぽいですね。</p><blockquote><p>This document leverages and expands on ISO/IEC 18013-51 (also available as INCITS/ISO/IEC 18013-5), an international mDL standard. Although ISO/IEC 18013-5 specifies an mDL solution, it was intentionally designed to support any type of mobile identity credential. ISO/IEC 18013-5, as qualified in this document, will therefore enable Issuing Authorities to issue both mobile driver’s licenses and mobile identification cards.</p><p>The term “mDL” as used in this document covers both credential types. Qualifications made in this document also allow for identifying an mDL as being REAL ID compliant or not, and/or as a credential issued under the Enhanced Driver’s License program (“EDL”; see the AAMVA DL/ID Card Design Standard).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>本文書は、国際 mDL 標準である ISO/IEC 18013-5（INCITS/ISO/IEC 18013-5 としても利用可能）を活用し拡張したものです。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は mDL ソリューションを規定していますが、意図的にあらゆるタイプのモバイル ID クレデンシャルをサポートするように設計されています。このため、本文書で規定する ISO/IEC 18013-5 により、発行機関はモバイル運転免許証とモバイル ID カードの両方を発行できるようになります。</p><p>本文書で使用する「mDL」という用語は、両方のクレデンシャル・タイプをカバーします。この文書で行われる認定は、mDL を REAL ID 準拠かどうか、および／または拡張運転免許証プログラム（「EDL」；AAMVA DL/ID カード設計基準参照）の下で発行されたクレデンシャルとし て識別することも可能にします。</p></blockquote><p>本書はISO/IEC 18013-5がベースであり、モバイル運転免許証とモバイルIDカードの両方を対象に書かれている、というところが肝ですね。そしてやはりリアルID法に関しても視野に入っています。</p><blockquote><p>Additional guidance on mDL administration in the areas of legislation and procurement can be found in two other documents produced by the mDL Working Group. Those are the mDL Model Legislation, and the mDL Procurement Guidance (see the jurisdictional member area on the AAMVA website). AAMVA also conducts regular outreach to stakeholders on the topic of mDL, including town hall meetings, podcasts, and training.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLに関する法律や調達に関するガイダンスは、mDLワーキンググループが作成した2つの文書に記載されています。これらは、「mDLモデル法案」と「mDL調達ガイダンス」です（AAMVAウェブサイトの管轄メンバーエリアを参照）。AAMVAはまた、タウンホールミーティング、ポッドキャスト、トレーニングなど、mDLに関するステークホルダーへの定期的な働きかけも行っています。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It should be noted that mDL and related technologies are ever evolving. As a result, this document will continue to be updated to synchronize its content with the latest standards and practices. For this reason, readers of this document are encouraged to periodically check the AAMVA website for new versions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLと関連技術は常に進化しています。そのため、本書は最新の基準や慣行と内容を同期させるために更新され続けます。このため、本書の読者は、定期的にAAMVAのウェブサイトで新バージョンを確認することが推奨されます。</p><p></p></blockquote><p>AAMVAのウェブサイトを見ると色々な情報が掲載されていますので、このガイドライン以外にも参照すべき情報は多そうです。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>As a follow-up to the JSONPath module and playground I released <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/11/go-jsonpath-playground/" title="Introducing RFC 9535 Go JSONPath and Playground">last month</a>,
I’m happy to announce the follow-up project, called JSONTree. I’ve implemented
it in the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree">github.com/theory/jsontree</a> Go package, and built a <a href="https://webassembly.org" title="WebAssembly">Wasm</a>-powered
browser <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsontree/" title="Go JSONTree Playground">playground</a> for it.</p>
 JSONTree? 
<p>While a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535 JSONPath</a> query selects and returns an array of values from
the end of a path expression, a JSONTree compiles multiple JSONPath queries
into a single query that selects values from multiple path expressions. It
returns results not as an array, but as a subset of the query input,
preserving the paths for each selected value.</p>
<p>In other words, it compiles multiple paths into a single tree of selection
paths, and preserves the tree structure of the input. Hence JSONTree.</p>
 Example 
<p>Consider this JSON:</p>

</code>  <p>Note that the original data structure remains, but only for the subset of the
structure selected by the JSONPath queries.</p>
 Use Cases 
<p>A couple of use cases drove the conception and design of JSONPath.</p>
 Permissions 
<p>Consider an application in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list" title="Wikipedia: Access-control list">ACL</a>s define permissions for groups of users
to access specific branches or fields of JSON documents. When delivering a
document, the app would:</p>
 
 Fetch the groups the user belongs to 
 Convert the permissions from each into JSONPath queries 
 Compile the JSONPath queries into an JSONTree query 
 Select and return the permitted subset of the document to the user 
 
 Selective Indexing 
<p>Consider a searchable document storage system. For large or complex documents,
it may be infeasible or unnecessary to index the entire document for full-text
search. To index a subset of the fields or branches, one would:</p>
 
 Define JSONPaths the fields or branches to index 
 Compile the JSONPath queries into a JSONTree query 
 Select and submit only the specified subset of each document to the
indexing system 
 
 Go Example 
<p>Use the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree">github.com/theory/jsontree</a> Go package together with
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath">github.com/theory/jsonpath</a> to compile and execute JSONTree queries:</p>
  <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/theory/jsonpath"
	"github.com/theory/jsontree"
)

func main() {
	// JSON as unmarshaled by encoding/json.
	value := map[string]any{
		"name":  "Barrack Obama",
		"years": "2009-2017",
		"emails": []any{
			"potus@example.com",
			"barrack@example.net",
		},
	}

	// Compile multiple JSONPaths into a JSONTree.
	tree := jsontree.New(
		jsonpath.MustParse("$.name"),
		jsonpath.MustParse("$.emails[1]"),
	)

	// Select from the input value.
	js, err := json.Marshal(tree.Select(value))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", tree.Select(value))
}
</code>  <p>And the output:</p>
  <code>{"emails":["barrack@example.net"],"name":"Barrack Obama"}
</code>  <p>Note that the index position of the selected email was not preserved. Replace
<code>New</code> with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree#NewFixedModeTree" title="github.com/theory/jsontree: NewFixedModeTree"><code>NewFixedModeTree</code></a> to create a “fixed mode” JSONTree that
preserves index positions by filling gaps with <code>null</code>s. Its output of the
above example would be:</p>
  <code>{"emails":[null,"barrack@example.net"],"name":"Barrack Obama"}
</code>   Status 
<p>The public interface of the <code>jsontree</code> module is quite minimal and stable. But
I suspect there may remain some flaws in the merging of JSONPath selectors.
Please report bugs via <a href="https://github.com/theory/jsontree/issues/" title="theory/jsontree: Issues">GitHub issues</a> and I’ll get them fixed up ASAP.</p>
<p>Otherwise, please share and enjoy!</p>

Web security, symbolized<p>Monty Pythons <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnciwwsvNcc">parrot sketch</a> is an all time classic because it plays on a very human experience of being defenseless when someone is just blatantly refusing to acknowledge the obvious. Shared reality is a matter of perception, not objective observation. Supported also by various mental biases, including the sunk cost fallacy, and the desire to agree with people we perceive as sympathetic or competent, virtually all humans can fall into this trap. Technical experts on Self Sovereign Identity included.</p><p>Instead of recognizing that the parrot of Web security is deceased, has gone to meet its maker, is pushing up the daisies, some people keep insisting that it is merely napping, and use trinkets and all kinds of strings and wires to hold it&nbsp;up.</p><p>The result is did:tdw, recently rebranded to did:webvh.</p> Web based DID methods belong to the family of federated identity methods, not Self Sovereign Identity <p>Using the web for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) violates some of the basic principles of Self Sovereign Identity, and effectively restricts the possible properties of the system to that of a classic federated identity protocol, such as&nbsp;OpenID.</p><p>Federated identity systems have their uses, and are often “good enough” for usage by large corporations and governments. But they also enable and encourage platform strategies, which has dramatic implications for personal usage, as well as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The result has been the Surveillance Industry, and a dependency of 95% of our economy on a few, large platform companies.</p><blockquote>Self Sovereign Identity has been developed as a concept to break that dependency, and give people control over their own privacy, security and data. Instead, thanks to did:web and its descendants, it increasingly looks like an exercise of putting SSI lipstick on the pig of the federated Web.</blockquote><p>You may think this is just hyperbole. So let’s go back to the beginning.</p> About the principles of&nbsp;SSI <p>The design goals of Decentralized Identifiers are listed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#design-goals">Section 1.2 of the W3C DID specificaton</a>:</p>W3C DID: Design goals for Decentralized Identifiers (DID)<p>So how well do Web based DID methods meet these&nbsp;goals?</p><p>All web based methods, including did:web, did:tdw, did:webvh, and any other web based method anyone might ever come up with depend on a domain name pointing to a web server. The method specific identifier is always being transformed into a HTTPS request. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/next/#the-did-to-https-transformation">DID to HTTPS Transformation</a> is the same for did:webvh as it is for&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/#method-specific-identifier">did:web</a>.</p><p>Reaching the correct web server is therefore contingent on access control by the administrator of the web server, the security of the web server, the longevity of the organization operating the web server, the Certificate Authority issuing the certificates identifying the web server, the configuration of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) parameters, and the Domain Name System to identify which web server to&nbsp;contact.</p><p>Users have two&nbsp;choices:</p>  Operate their own web server,&nbsp;or  Use the web server of some organization that provides them their “decentralized” identifier.  <p>The former is the “let them eat cake” of modern technologies.</p><p>Despite many people working for decades to make self-hosting easier and more attractive, self-hosting has been declining. But even if we reverted that trend and enabled and motivated people to self-host with some amazing self-hosting offers: How hard would it be to correlate did:tdw:QmfGEUAcMpzo25kF2Rhn8L5FAXysfGnkzjwdKoNPi615XQ:petermueller.ch to did:tdw:QmdfTbBqBPQ7VNxZEYEj14VmRuZBkqFbiwReogJgS1zR1n:petermueller.ch&nbsp;?</p><p>How difficult would it be to figure out these might both belong to the same person, whose name might be Peter Müller? Especially considering that the web server at petermueller.ch presents a certificate that lists the owner of the certificate to be a “Peter Müller”, and the whois record for the domain lists his full name, address and phone&nbsp;number?</p><p>Which brings us to the second choice, above, which is today’s reality for most people in a federated identity world: Trust the platform intermediary.</p><p>How much decentralization is there in Apple Mail? How decentralized are today’s Certificate Authorities? How much privacy and control do users of Gmail have? How secure are today’s web services? How well does today’s world fare in terms of data protection from compromise and loss? How good is today’s Web security?</p><blockquote>In reality, Web based DID methods give up on Decentralization, Control, Privacy and Security to the same level that today’s federated identity solutions have given up on&nbsp;them.</blockquote><p>They use protocols like OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VC &amp; OIDC4VP) because they ARE OpenID methods. Which is why if use cases building on top of Web based DIDs were using truth in labelling, they would inform their users about being based on&nbsp;OpenID.</p><p>But much of the technology world thrives on buzzwords and hypes, and too often, the technical reality is obfuscated by layers of technical complexity and marketing. So the market rarely penalises false advertising.</p>did:web(vh), EV&nbsp;edition<p>Using the Web for “Decentralized” Identifiers and advertising it as revolutionary SSI technology is a bit like selling an “Electric Vehicle” that avoids all the complexities of battery development by using a diesel generator on a towed trailer to power the car. Yes, the propulsion is now electric.</p><p>But is the end result fundamentally better than a diesel&nbsp;car?</p> But what about the added security? <p>When reading about did:webvh, one could get the impression a lot of security is being added. In reality, it's mostly added complexity because everything goes over a single channel, the same one that is being used by did:web, as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote>It adds security in the same way that web sites get more secure if you ask users to enter not a single password, but three passwords, subsequently, in the correct&nbsp;order.</blockquote><p>There is a reason no-one does that. Three passwords are not fundamentally more secure, because there is no additional channel. Add a real second factor, and security actually goes up. Which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)</a> has been invented.</p><p>Most likely the Web based DID methods can be developed to the point they will provide actual MFA security at a similar level to today’s federated identity protocols. Maybe did:webvh is even close to that&nbsp;point.</p><blockquote>But that only makes it just as secure as “Login with Google”, today. And it does nothing to make it meet the SSI criteria of Decentralization, Control and&nbsp;Privacy.</blockquote><p>Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that this parrot is not just a heavy&nbsp;sleeper.</p> Embrace, Extend, Extinguish <p>So what’s the problem if some people like did:web and its relatives? As long as we are aware of the limitations, and never use it for systems that are supposed to be used in production by end users or SMEs, there is nothing wrong with&nbsp;did:web.</p><p>As I’ve written in a <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/coming-full-circle-how-self-sovereign-identity-could-lose-its-way-069b480c4399">previous article,</a> it’s really useful for rapid prototyping, and can be used as a placeholder during experimentation before switching to a real Decentralized Identifier. We’ve done so ourselves when <a href="https://vereign.com">Vereign</a> has been working on Proof of Concept for the Swiss health sector in 2023. But once we started working on the production system in 2024, we switched to an Autonomous Identifier (AID) that meets the definition of Self Sovereign Identity.</p><p>The problem starts when people put Web based identifiers into production.</p><p>Not only is it an issue of misleading users with false promises of decentralization, control, privacy and security. It runs much deeper than that. Increasing adoption of Web based identifiers under the moniker of Self Sovereign Identity makes it impossible for actual Self Sovereign Identity to differentiate itself from federated identity protocols. It sucks the air out of the room for actual&nbsp;SSI.</p><blockquote>At a technology strategy level, adoption of Web based identifiers makes SSI susceptible to something it was originally designed to prevent: Platform&nbsp;capture.</blockquote>Depiction of did:web(vh) being welcomed by Self Sovereign Identity community<p>Whether accidentally or by design, the movement for Web based identifiers perfectly executes a strategy coined by Microsoft in the 90s, labelled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</a>. I’ve gotten to study that particular script extensively when coordinating the technical and communication activities of the <a href="https://fsfe.org">Free Software Foundation Europe</a> around the EU Microsoft <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.en.html">antitrust case</a> in order to obtain much needed interoperability information for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>.</p><p>The script is not super complicated. First, become a champion of Self Sovereign Identity, embrace it visibly, participate in the conferences, champion it at the political level. Then come up with ideas to extend it, for instance by proposing to speed up adoption by falling back on “proven”” technologies from the Web. Provided enough Kool-Aid, nobody might notice that it violates the principles of SSI and you’ll find many willing participants.</p><p>And lastly, once it has become the dominant flavour to however misleadingly claim the label Self Sovereign Identity, extinguish what is left in terms of actual SSI by aggressively using your economic and political might to push a platform play to suck the air out of the market. While Sovrin had its issues, including political, it undoubtedly lived up to all the SSI principles. Recently, the Sovrin Foundation announced that it was <a href="https://idtechwire.com/the-community-moved-on-sovrin-announces-mainnets-likely-shutdown/">shutting down in March 2025</a> due to its community moving to the&nbsp;Web.</p> So, what’s&nbsp;left? <p>Microsoft had originally championed did:ion, a fully Self Sovereign Identifier based on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> specification. But as of 2023, it unsurprisingly also <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/verified-id/verifiable-credentials-faq#does-microsoft-entra-verified-id-support-ion-as-its-did-method">switched to did:web</a>. Old habits die hard. Other large tech platforms are also pushing in the same direction, as are several of the former governmental monopolists with strong political ties, such as T-Systems.</p><p>The most promising design for a decentralized identifier is the <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a>, and at conceptual level it solves some very hard problems that no other method even attempts to address. The problem is how long it has been the promising next thing, without achieving sufficient adoption, and without finding its way into the regulatory documents in the European Union <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS (for “electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services”)</a> working group, which is strongly pushing in the direction of Web based identifiers.</p><blockquote>Unsurprisingly, technical experts have raised <a href="https://www.cryptomathic.com/blog/key-vulnerabilities-of-eudi-arf">security</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/issues/200">privacy</a> concerns. In fact, it seems the current draft of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Technical+Specifications">EU Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF)</a> may be in violation of the EU privacy provisions it is supposed to&nbsp;provide.</blockquote><p>Also, and it’s already been a topic in the <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/dice-2024-retrospective-b20372f13a65">DICE2024 retrospective</a>, KERI is currently available in Python only. Which leaves adoption hamstrung. Not everyone in the KERI community agrees with that, but I’m aware of a number of people and initiatives who would love to adopt KERI, but not in Python. And its completeness as a concept puts the effort required for implementation in another language outside what is feasible for any of these parties individually.</p><p>So, when looking at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-traits/#comparison-of-did-methods">W3C DID Traits</a> draft, the table looks pretty bleak, with two actual SSI methods left on it: did:key and did:peer. Both limited in relation to quite a few use&nbsp;cases.</p> What we ended up&nbsp;doing… <p>We anticipated this picture when designing our use case and solution for the Swiss health sector back in January 2024. The Web identifiers were obvious non-starters, as were did:key and did:peer, due to them being overly limited for our&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>We also did not like the idea of putting Python into a mission critical production application for large number of users. Especially since we did not want to put Python on the phone, and also did not want remote wallets that do not actually live on the&nbsp;phone.</p><p>So we did what XKCD told us <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">not to do</a>. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>EDIT ON 3. March 2025: The follow-up is finally available at <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/a-future-for-self-sovereign-identity-c237caa5e46f">https://ggreve.medium.com/a-future-for-self-sovereign-identity-c237caa5e46f</a></p>

<p>BILL VAN ESVELD: This is the first time that we’ve made a finding of genocidal acts in Gaza. It is not an accusation that we level lightly. We have not done this very often in our history. We accused the Myanmar military of genocidal acts against the Rohingya in 2017, and we found full-blown genocide against the Kurds in Saddam Hussein’s Anfal campaign in Iraq in the ’80s — sorry, in the ’90s, and we found genocide against — also in Rwanda in the ’80s. It is, you know, an extremely difficult crime to prove. It is, you know, mass killing deliberately to destroy people because they’re part of the group, not something we level lightly, but, yes, we found it here.</p>

They are issued in a secure process, and include technology that makes travel easier. EDLs are a low-cost, convenient option for entering the United States from Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, in addition to serving as a permit to drive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>強化運転免許証（EDLs）は、自動車で米国国境を越える際に身分証明と米国市民権を証明する州発行の強化運転免許証である。EDLは安全なプロセスで発行され、渡航を容易にする技術も含まれている。EDLは、カナダ、メキシコ、カリブ海諸国から陸路または海路で米国に入国する際に、低コストで便利なオプションであり、運転許可証としての役割も果たす。</p></blockquote><p>使い道としては2025年から施行されるReal ID法（州が発行する運転免許証や身分証明書に対して最低限のセキュリティ基準を定めるもの）に対応したものっぽいです。米国国内で飛行機に乗るときにReal ID法に準拠した身分証明書の提示が必要になる、って話です。（日本人は外国政府発行のパスポートを使うことになると思います）</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>mDL。いわゆるMobile Driver's License、モバイル運転免許証ですね。</p><p>こんな解説が書いてあります。</p><blockquote><p>driver’s license or identification card that resides on a mobile device or requires a mobile device as part of the process to gain access to the related information</p><p>Note to entry: Adapted from ISO/IEC 18013-5</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>運転免許証または身分証明書であって、モバイル・デバイス上に存在するもの、または入国時に 関連情報にアクセスするためのプロセスの一部としてモバイル・デバイスを必要とするもの： ISO/IEC 18013-5 からの引用。</p></blockquote><p>まだ18013-7:2024と18013-5:2021の差分をとれていませんが、AAMVAとしては18013-5ベースです。</p><p><br></p><p>mDL app。いわゆるWalletに当たるものですね。</p><blockquote><p>software running on an mDL holder’s device; within the context of this document this includes a standalone app as well as a wallet type app</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL保持者のデバイス上で動作するソフトウェア。本書の文脈では、スタンドアロン型アプリおよびウォレット型アプリを含む。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>mdoc。クレデンシャルフォーマットがmdoc、運転免許証として使えばmDLっていう整理でいいのかと思います。</p><blockquote><p>document or application that resides on a mobile device or requires a mobile device as part of the process to gain access to the document or application</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>モバイル・デバイス上に存在する、または文書やアプリケーションにアクセスするためのプロセスの一部としてモバイル・デバイスを必要とする文書またはアプリケーション</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>mobile security object。MSOなんて言われたりします。mdocの構造化されたデータセットの話です。中にはデバイスアテステーションなども含まれるのでHolderバインディングの保証をすることが目的とされます。</p><blockquote><p>structured data set that enables an mDL verifier to authenticate (for both accuracy and origin) other mDL data elements received during an mDL transaction</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLベリファイアが、mDLトランザクション中に受信した他のmDLデータエレメントを（正確さと出所の両方について）認証できるようにする構造化データセット</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>provisioning。これは特殊用語lじゃないのかな？と思うのはIdentity界隈の人だからなのかもしれません。</p><blockquote><p>initial loading of mDL information into an mDL app</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLアプリへのmDL情報の初期読み込み</p></blockquote><p>要するにウォレットへのモバイル運転免許証をインストールすることですね。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>ということで、まずは用語解説からでした。</p><p>概念を理解するためにもこのあたりはちゃんと押さえておきましょう。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  先週はTaiwan Digital Identity Wallet International Forumで登壇してきましたので、キーノートとしてお話した内容をメモしておきたいと思います。  イベントについてはこちら  <a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/11/taiwan-digital-wallet-international.html">https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/11/taiwan-digital-wallet-international.html</a>  <br>  <br>   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgLdUITMo8-0WkN9eDPJPAeSBVYxbJlZtXx7dCVQPLVArTRWr9jbnobZOXl7rVLRBMZkDRDsWJTzXG41M3cu1akZPLKjFhulfjbL3A8QA4ANSNLOPMoyKLb5JHQYoGySeLTNKL0Fi2yS4-4oe5AUIdiDo1cMSDlgvbsWpaGQi1WJdwJULHo-uwAbptt6OO7"></a> 自己紹介は置いておいて、テーマは相互運用性でした。 <blockquote>  As you know, the Digital Identity Wallet has recently become an emerging topic in the digital identity space. For example, the European Committee has started implementing the European Digital Identity Wallet, which allows citizens to bring their own digital identity documents, such as national ID cards or mobile driver's licenses. At the same time, interoperability is essential for adopting these wallets in the real world because we have an existing ecosystem without the digital identity wallet today.  So, today’s my talk is about interoperability between current identity ecosystems and a Digital Identity Wallet.  </blockquote><blockquote><p>ご存知のように、デジタルIDウォレットは最近、デジタルID分野で新たなトピックとなっています。例えば、欧州委員会は欧州デジタルIDウォレットの導入を開始しました。これにより、国民は国民IDカードや携帯電話運転免許証などのデジタルID文書を携帯できるようになります。同時に、現実世界でこれらのウォレットを採用するには相互運用性が不可欠です。なぜなら、今日、デジタルIDウォレットのない既存のエコシステムが存在しているからです。</p><p>そこで、本日の私の講演では、現在のアイデンティティ・エコシステムとデジタル・アイデンティティ・ウォレット間の相互運用性についてお話します。&nbsp;</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiA3n4-wCR4DNYo_k3sK3z-I4R5-SaDuVUF8Zslk_xqZDA6GQUZ3Dt2O5q3vc3zXbzT0s-gbMATmbaPywiwnZv57PiofbMYQJU16YjB5906Jmu5j0ehK6xfYS2tUUinvbtqsfrZmYKWpy6s85tSjhZcXSkn_32zVAM0sB0sETtHGtIwRt_IFOPGTSK3_xZb"></a> <br> <blockquote>  First, let’s think about our current situation when considering the term “interoperability.”  Since the fall of the Tower of Babel, we have been living in a world divided by different languages, different tribes, different cultures, and different social systems.  In other words, we have been living in a world where we have not been able to communicate well for a long time. This continued until the Age of Exploration, when trade between countries worldwide became more active.  For people like me who have lived in Asia, we have lived in a world that is very different from Western languages and cultures, and we are still living behind language barriers.  However, since the spread of the Internet began in the 1990s, the breakdown of regional divisions, including countries, has started. We have finally been freed from the constraints of physical location, and the need to communicate globally has arisen.  So, did a technology break down these barriers to allow us to communicate and trade freely globally?  </blockquote><blockquote><p>まず、「相互運用性」という言葉について考える前に、現在の状況について考えてみましょう。</p><p>バベルの塔が崩壊して以来、私たちは異なる言語、異なる部族、異なる文化、異なる社会制度によって分断された世界に生きてきました。</p><p>つまり、私たちは長い間、うまくコミュニケーションを取ることができない世界に生きてきたのです。この状況は、大航海時代を迎え、世界各国間の貿易が活発になるまで続きました。</p><p>私のようにアジアで生活してきた人間にとっては、西洋の言語や文化とはまったく異なる世界で生きてきましたし、今でも言葉の壁に阻まれて生活しています。</p><p>しかし、1990年代からインターネットが普及し始め、国を含めた地域的な区分が崩れ始めました。私たちはようやく物理的な場所の制約から解放され、グローバルにコミュニケーションを取る必要性が生じてきたのです。</p><p>では、こうした障壁を打破し、世界中で自由にコミュニケーションや取引ができるようになった技術は登場したのでしょうか？</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi5y9anTn_NhSR-d4KY5iBnhoJg5ukODYAT_19gYSWnWqoC3GO47P0ybB5WPxL3k3umxO0z8joXuwN0R-OKCXXpfGUk3qUe5P0tEW1JYG2SfB009l6ztXWS8C2Da0P_wZAs7LzTEPlW-7Yy5PPgVfQa7wNNWrAYdS6gJ4HE_S9K7L_LVudbB6qGz3T2KND5"></a> <br><br> <blockquote>  At the moment, the answer is no.  We are currently living in a world divided by silos created by technology.  Even now, to transfer data freely across systems, we have to design and implement interfaces between systems each time, and even when it comes to identity, which is the theme of today's talk, it is still managed on a system-by-system basis. We often have to manage multiple accounts for each systems.  </blockquote><blockquote><p>現時点では、答えはノーです。</p><p>私たちは現在、テクノロジーによって作られたサイロによって分断された世界に生きています。</p><p>今でも、システム間でデータを自由にやりとりするためには、その都度、システム間のインターフェースを設計し実装しなければなりませんし、本日のテーマであるアイデンティティにしても、システムごとに管理されています。 システムごとに複数のアカウントを管理しなければならないこともよくあります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjc3RHuXPN49Srpkp-ay7jH8qc8-AcVI5zU8YgT-PhPezrvj357_jwm2aj43ei3VTGSKcaxzBEnyZZOe8aL6pWCuYZAbeyMPWoeDoEJIIm8L-ooSZGMOIqh69lVyCfb7M2Dx9RK5wBQwzpRh6BU8Q75DQXhwYUroOMt921Nenn6_UdEjbgwJLLTn52Zarct"></a> <br><br> <blockquote>  We need a way to communicate across countries, jurisdictions, and systems.  And we already know of some examples that have been developed to some extent.  Email can be delivered anywhere in the world without a centralized system, and the telephone system allows us to make calls to people worldwide. In these systems, we can communicate without depending on the email user agent or telephone type.  Also, in the real world, we use passport to identify people on traveling to other countries.  Those of us involved in digital identity need to follow the example of these previous cases and work to create a world where interoperability is guaranteed.    国や管轄区域、システムを越えてコミュニケーションを行う方法が必要です。  そして、ある程度まで開発された例がすでにいくつか存在しています。  電子メールは中央集権的なシステムなしで世界中のどこへでも配信できますし、電話システムは世界中の人々との通話を可能にしています。これらのシステムでは、電子メールユーザーエージェントや電話の種類に依存することなくコミュニケーションを行うことができます。  また現実の世界では、パスポートを使って他国への渡航者の身元確認を行っています。  デジタルアイデンティティに関わる私たちは、これらの過去の事例を手本とし、相互運用性が保証された世界を実現するために取り組む必要があります。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhslNQ8t7ykKyYZ4KsncE8XYjiqmEZrVn2iEer_BlhMTAjRVDzlVNpybLpv2xlxLlmOx-OvShv6X7a_BC8Vg62RvBnNDAKTYtaGD0Jo4QoJod9GEqlzkPbq3AeKWYqis0TTPbrLnZOOvp3yeWDbXgS4PqaCAcIP1d8rr7Vkge8x19y4qQ1Mfh1rhnIO-W-K"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>And digital identities are not just for natural persons. There are various things in the real world, such as IoT devices and legal entities, are connected to the internet, and daily business transactions are carried out. Now is the time to design and implement a system so that all digital identities can be mutually operated with minimal friction.</p> また、デジタルアイデンティティは自然人だけのものではありません。現実世界には、IoTデバイスや法人など、さまざまなものがインターネットに接続され、日常的な商取引が行われています。今こそ、すべてのデジタルアイデンティティが相互に最小限の摩擦で運用できるようなシステムの設計と実装を行うべき時なのです。 </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjqKIO8M86eL17l9NBAcUA36CHs6y2pOvo5uw0MnzSg1uwZMtKZcZ18JgGGkt4h1SkX0m4FvDqlNUxIAArC8lT0PHIoKjrQ8JMljwhDR89WXx44XfmhcnzPFvX-MHPFf9Mamjuwasmn4T6Ka2rdUP_7G7HznrDEg5jv0ga1xtQtqD-gIXJgWkmXjdyK5hss"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Let's now take a closer look at interoperability. Even though we use the word 'interoperability,' it can be roughly divided into technical and non-technical aspects. When many engineers talk about interoperability, they often only focus on the technical side, but it is also essential to consider the non-technical side.</p><p>First, let's look at the technical aspects. We must consider the identifier format, transfer protocol, and data model, including the schema and signature algorithm.</p><p>In addition, on the non-technical side, we need to agree on the semantics that expresses what meaning the exchanged data has, the rules and framework within which the data is generated, and the trust framework that ensures the reliability of the entity state, etc.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at each of these elements from the next slide.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>それでは、相互運用性について詳しく見ていきましょう。相互運用性という言葉を使っていますが、大まかに技術的な側面と技術的ではない側面に分けることができます。多くの技術者が相互運用性について語る場合、技術的な側面のみに焦点を当てがちですが、技術的ではない側面も考慮することが不可欠です。</p><p>まず、技術的な側面について見ていきましょう。識別子のフォーマット、転送プロトコル、データモデル（スキーマや署名アルゴリズムを含む）を考慮する必要があります。</p><p>さらに、技術面以外の側面では、交換されたデータがどのような意味を持つのか、データが生成されるルールや枠組み、エンティティの状態の信頼性を確保する信頼フレームワークなどを表現するセマンティクスについて合意する必要があります。</p><p>それでは、これらの要素について、次のスライドから詳しく見ていきましょう。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhvFDgGZXLcax7V5-cA-q2Q2oXP0vSu_GzbeW3UwM9ZuBw8PXahIh7W7PWksvkZ-tQ8OolqYXGSbHEBSdBIJGZSOVsBpJcH093UlZohL6M7aZW7WUbz8Tm47xtppP-41MPpW8S4saIXVRKfykMWdfrE6qK5uUyXFzfGr_34uvJbuB4wwuDa8on4uckjbwj7"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>First of all, let's talk about identifiers. An identifier is an attribute identifying a particular entity within a specific set. This attribute can be a single attribute or multiple attributes.</p><p>The design of the identifier depends on the size of the set that contains the target entity. For example, designing an identifier within a local set differs significantly from creating one within an international or global set. For example, my family name is Fujie, but there may be no one else in this room with the same family name. In this situation, my family name could function as an identifier. However, when I go home to Japan, my family name does not function as an identifier because, as you know, all of my family members have the family name Fujie.</p><p>Finally, it is essential to consider privacy and persistence when considering identifiers. For example, suppose control of an identifier is taken away from you. In that case, there is a possibility that control over the identity information linked to that identifier will also be taken away from you. Also, suppose you are logged in to multiple services using the same identifier. In that case, there is a possibility that the services will collide with each other and merge your attribute information in an unintended way. To deal with such cases, it may be necessary to devise ways to ensure that users use different identifiers.</p><p>On the other hand, if users are not allowed to use the same identifier for an extended period, they may not be able to use the service continuously or may not be able to access past data.</p><p>From the perspective of interoperability, it is necessary to design systems that can correctly identify entities while considering privacy and persistence, not only in the current but also in a broader set in the future.</p><p>Identifiers may seem simple, but they must be designed very carefully.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;まず、識別子についてお話しましょう。識別子とは、特定の集合内の特定のエンティティを識別する属性です。この属性は単一の属性であることも、複数の属性であることもあります。</p><p>識別子の設計は、対象のエンティティを含む集合の規模によって異なります。例えば、ローカルな集合内で識別子を設計することは、国際的またはグローバルな集合内で設計することとは大きく異なります。例えば、私の姓は富士榮ですが、この部屋には同じ姓の人は誰もいないかもしれません。このような状況では、私の姓は識別子として機能するでしょう。しかし、私が日本に帰国した場合、ご存知のように私の家族全員が富士榮という姓なので、私の姓は識別子として機能しません。</p><p>最後に、識別子を考える際には、プライバシーと永続性について考慮することが不可欠です。例えば、ある識別子の管理が自分から奪われたとします。その場合、その識別子と紐づけられたID情報についても管理が奪われる可能性があります。また、同じ識別子を使って複数のサービスにログインしているとします。その場合、サービス同士が衝突し、意図しない形で属性情報がマージされてしまう可能性がある。このようなケースに対応するためには、ユーザーに異なる識別子を利用させる工夫が必要となる可能性があります。</p><p>一方で、長期間にわたって同一の識別子を利用できないと、サービスを継続的に利用できなくなったり、過去のデータにアクセスできなくなったりする可能性があります。</p><p>相互運用性の観点では、プライバシーや永続性を考慮しつつ、現在だけでなく将来にわたって、エンティティを正しく識別できる仕組みを設計する必要があります。</p><p>識別子は一見単純に見えるが、非常に慎重に設計しなければいけません。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiKAB88-R_zRe_U7x8Bg9R4RIL98VLqqc-BLoHNVl0MNXyFjhF1cCDK02M9KyJRJ0-RYlrHLDylKmnUDAr84p6R5VS_xyn4o4jSORmYaf2BwduEgtainFdpQoF-23OBAj-GottskC-jd0r8qEsZTO0IuLgRjrdsyBGzBenVQKD-3rH1i495lXHsh6P4JvE_"></a> <br>&nbsp;<p></p><blockquote>  Next, we will consider transport protocols. Transport protocols define the methods by which entities communicate with each other. In the context of digital credentials, transport protocols include issuing credentials to wallets, presenting credentials to verifiers, and revoking issued credentials by issuers.  To ensure interoperability, the multiple issuer, wallet, and verifier components must communicate using a method that has been agreed upon in advance.  次に、トランスポートプロトコルについて検討します。トランスポートプロトコルは、エンティティが相互に通信する方法を定義します。デジタルクレデンシャルの文脈では、トランスポートプロトコルには、クレデンシャルをウォレットに発行すること、クレデンシャルをベリファイアに提示すること、発行者によって発行されたクレデンシャルを取り消すことが含まれます。  相互運用性を確保するには、複数の発行者、ウォレット、ベリファイアのコンポーネントが、事前に合意された方法で通信する必要があります。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjurXoMAA89tiSW9Esp45fMx0C7A7DsZ71iIG-vx3-lbEZ4i8saprScEXHgtmUszZ6vjEFDPLIk_Ma1l07_gpImkTclXvPCq7z6vul9AzK07R5p7HFwu3OCNyWRt6XUnjHpQEPAZ99Bnv1HwIWHxtgC2hVypArM6Y7hg8thjOLDTrp_f-ZNCesuXx3TPtaJ"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>Let's also consider data models. Schemas need to take into account the types and namespaces of attributes. Generally, gender is expressed using letters such as M and F, but in some cases, it is expressed using numbers such as 0 and 1. In addition, the attribute name family_name is sometimes used to express the family name, and the attribute name surname is sometimes used. In any case, related entities must agree on the names and types of attributes to achieve interoperability.</p><p>The algorithm used for digital signatures is also a very important factor. In general, it is necessary to verify digital signatures to verify the authenticity of digital credentials. Still, verification will not be possible if the issuer uses a signature algorithm that differs from what the verifier expects.

Let's ask the same question as on the previous page. Just because you have verified the digital signature on the credential you have received, does that mean you can trust the issuer of that credential? For example, if you have obtained the digital data of a graduation certificate with a digital signature, how can you confirm that the university that issued the certificate exists?</p><p>This is where a system called a trust framework comes into play. There are various types of trust frameworks, but general laws and regulations are also a type of trust framework. For example, the recipient of a certificate of qualification may believe that the issuer is operating under the country's laws and regulations that control the bank and that the government regularly audits the bank. In this case, the verifier believes in the laws and regulations of the country, so there is no need to visit the bank to confirm that the individual issuer is an actual bank. In this way, it is possible to reduce the cost of individual verification by designing and operating a system that includes certification and auditing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>次に、トラストフレームワークについて考えてみましょう。前ページと同じ質問をしてみましょう。受け取ったクレデンシャルに付与された電子署名を検証したからといって、そのクレデンシャルの発行者を信頼できるのでしょうか？例えば、電子署名の付与された卒業証明書の電子データを受け取った場合、その証明書を発行した大学が実在していることをどのように確認できるのでしょうか？</p><p>そこで登場するのが「トラストフレームワーク」と呼ばれる仕組みです。トラストフレームワークにはさまざまな種類がありますが、一般的な法律や規則もトラストフレームワークの一種です。例えば、資格証明書の受領者は、発行者が銀行を管理する国の法律や規則に従って運営されており、政府が定期的に銀行を監査していると考えるかもしれません。この場合、検証者はその国の法律や規制を信頼しているため、個々の発行者が実際に銀行であることを確認するために銀行を訪問する必要はありません。このように、認証と監査を含むシステムを設計・運用することで、個々の検証にかかるコストを削減することが可能となります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiGzca6bl5wy7EJ9-gOhZxgZIokb7OcltZlEWAllIDnpylfBVdge4miWc5s1EjC-vpf3VGKC1-yKDIIgx4PPAXUkWMo_rsLoSSsaFazlwZcrvLazs8gKRC5Oj5uFiYbx8ema85rABr84EtFe91jaIlPKeUL7EvEc7yc_Qf9I8N9eIGnr2tzTI1v-efXGmk9"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>In a few previous pages, we discussed the need for profiles.

In the real world, we must consider interoperability between these systems.</p><p>In this slide, I want to explain the recent paradigm shift in digital identity systems.</p><p>This diagram shows how the identity paradigm has changed from a centralized world to a decentralized one.</p><p>In the centralized identity system, as I mentioned earlier, it is crucial to manage identity information in the centralized database. However, there are various side effects, such as the need to keep a non-active user account in the database, making license costs expensive. It may cause identity theft attack because nonactive user cannot be aware their identities were stolen since they are not using their accounts.</p><p>Also, a centralized authentication system is quite helpful in gathering sign-in logs. Still, the system's availability is quite crucial because if the system fails, all users cannot log in to all applications.</p><p>On the other hand, in the decentralized identity world, users' identity data is stored in the user's wallet, which is typically installed on smartphones. So, users can bring their identity and authenticate it through their purse, and there is no effect on other users if the user’s wallet is offline.</p><p>In addition, users can aggregate attributes from multiple data sources in a single wallet, aggregate them, and present them to the application. The application can get various attributes from the user’s wallet and determine access permission.</p>  システムアーキテクチャは日々変化しており、複数のアプローチに基づくシステムが共存することは明らかです。現実の世界では、これらのシステム間の相互運用性を考慮する必要があります。  このスライドでは、デジタルIDシステムにおける最近のパラダイムシフトについて説明したいと思います。  この図は、IDのパラダイムが中央集権型から分散型へとどのように変化したかを示しています。  集中型のIDシステムでは、先ほど申し上げたように、ID情報を集中データベースで管理することが重要です。しかし、さまざまな副作用があります。例えば、データベースに非アクティブなユーザーアカウントを維持する必要があるため、ライセンスコストが高額になることがあります。また、非アクティブなユーザーはアカウントを使用していないため、自分のIDが盗まれたことに気づくことができません。そのため、ID盗難の被害に遭う可能性があります。  また、中央集権型の認証システムはサインインログの収集に非常に役立ちます。しかし、システムが故障した場合、すべてのユーザーがすべてのアプリケーションにログインできなくなるため、システムの可用性は非常に重要です。  一方、分散型のアイデンティティの世界では、ユーザーのアイデンティティデータは、通常スマートフォンにインストールされているユーザーの財布に保存されます。そのため、ユーザーは自分のアイデンティティを持ち歩き、財布を通して認証することができます。また、ユーザーの財布がオフラインの状態でも、他のユーザーには影響がありません。  さらに、ユーザーは複数のデータソースから属性を収集し、それを集約してアプリケーションに提示することができます。アプリケーションはユーザーの財布からさまざまな属性を取得し、アクセス許可を決定することができます。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjjpt2WhbfdLj_-EyePeQi4OFyTwJXxatukt_LD73dpvW8mu9xe8pkI1h_gl0Ug0HFFZPVXJXLkzrZmhRYYRQNnyYM1O4YlE0YxIAg1VQP4Hex10JBiXbjpFX3KsYIGJoKQmDMFMlOVL5w0e3KfSRUgI-1EKK_g61uwBfLdsNrxR9s1l5RgILayabDRn6tT"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>We at the OpenID Foundation support the SIDI Hub, a community established to ensure interoperability in global digital identity.

In addition, the learning management system in question was developed based on a middleware called Moodle, and it was necessary to implement a unique API to issue credentials.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>実際の利用事例を一つ紹介したいと思います。</p><p>これは国立情報学研究所の学習歴証明の電子化プロジェクトです。このプロジェクトでは、既存の学習管理システムから発行される学習記録をウォレットに発行し、その資格情報を論文投稿時などの資格証明に利用します。</p><p>このプロジェクトを実施するにあたっての課題は、日本に限らず多くの学術システムがSAMLプロトコルを使用しており、日本でも学認という学術フェデレーションのエコシステム内で多くのSAMLベースのIDシステムが稼働していることでした。また、対象の学習管理システムはMoodleというミドルウェアをベースに開発されており、独自のAPIを実装してクレデンシャルを発行する必要がありました。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgqowi_IT205Q-vXWV1nX28fwx7lfyN7oDpHOPwhqDKpxRyxWJRjvZLj-YRTN7UiRAzLNHwVJfFeA3dmi4fYHwmEyweM9d-Ae7U870a12dddkpvOlqp3HWcNv0aM3mtBuAYlN7UlNjdYIj38ZcNf6g9ye3BzaOe85bgQJwYpLxABXBpiCUaJxcsU4m0wf7c"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>This diagram shows an overview of the GakuNin ecosystem that we explained earlier.</p><p>The National Institute of Informatics provides the trust framework, and certified universities and research institutions' identity providers and certified applications such as learning management systems and research databases are deployed as relying parties within the ecosystem.</p><p>By being authenticated by the university or institution's identity provider, students and researchers can securely single sign-on to many applications, creating a very convenient and secure environment.</p>  この図は、先に説明した学認エコシステムの概要を示しています。  国立情報学研究所がトラストフレームワークを提供し、認定を受けた大学や研究機関のアイデンティティプロバイダーと、学習管理システムや研究データベースなどの認定済みアプリケーションが、エコシステム内の依拠当事者として展開されています。  学生や研究者は、大学や機関のアイデンティティプロバイダーによって認証されることで、多くのアプリケーションに安全にシングルサインオンでき、非常に便利で安全な環境を実現できます。  </blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiMIkaRuffCDf8U3HHvKFISQJGLiDuUoHEbLrXSErhWvWItGkSRSy_xg8DFgOWHtdwuzktFfT2aodwVxZCprmp-PSXtCauD3kWqJ72YAogBsZYHr95FvkFOYbKAZHgccLxs41NHG0xJOKVuPTCR3BiDC5KdYdVc-DKmQ1mznJeb1qEDtISQJC1h8fgQlS30"></a> <br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We decided to introduce a wallet-based system into this federated environment.</p><p>For this reason, we took these approaches to the challenge of interoperability.</p><p>First, we embedded the OpenBadge credential the Learning Management System issued using its own API into the Verifiable Credential. We placed a gateway service between Moodle and the wallet and constructed it as an issuer that issues verifiable credentials based on the OpenBadge issued by Moodle. In other words, from the wallet's point of view, the gateway service appears as an Issuer.</p><p>Secondly, the Verifiable Credential presented by the wallet was embedded inside the SAML assertion. Since the existing Relying Party supports the SAML protocol, it was impossible to show the Verifiable Credential directly. Therefore, the OpenBadge extracted from the Verifiable Credential was embedded as one of the attributes inside the SAML assertion, and the credential was presented to the Relying Party. To achieve this, we developed a Wallet to SP Connector component. We configured it to appear as a Verifier to the Wallet and an Identity Provider to the Relying Party.</p><p>Of course, the Relying Party still needs to implement the appropriate logic to extract the OpenBadge from the SAML assertion, verify it, and use it. Still, there was no need to modify to support new protocols such as OpenID for Verifiable Presentation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>この統合環境にウォレットベースのシステムを導入することを決定しました。</p><p>そのため、相互運用性の課題に対して、以下のアプローチをとりました。</p><p>まず、LMSが独自のAPIを利用して発行するOpenBadgeクレデンシャルを、検証可能なクレデンシャルに埋め込みました。Moodleとウォレットの間にゲートウェイサービスを配置し、Moodleが発行するOpenBadgeに基づいて検証可能なクレデンシャルを発行する発行者として構築しました。つまり、ウォレットから見ると、ゲートウェイサービスは発行者として表示されます。</p><p>次に、ウォレットが提示した検証可能なクレデンシャルはSAMLアサーション内に埋め込まれました。既存のリライングパーティはSAMLプロトコルをサポートしているため、検証可能なクレデンシャルを直接提示することはできません。そのため、検証可能なクレデンシャルから抽出したOpenBadgeをSAMLアサーション内の属性の1つとして埋め込み、リライングパーティにクレデンシャルを提示しました。これを実現するために、私たちは Wallet to SP Connector コンポーネントを開発しました。 Wallet に対してはベリファイアとして、また、リライングパーティに対してはアイデンティティプロバイダーとして表示されるように構成しました。</p><p>もちろん、リライングパーティは、SAML アサーションから OpenBadge を抽出し、それを検証し、使用するための適切なロジックを実装する必要があります。それでも、OpenID for Verifiable Presentation などの新しいプロトコルをサポートするために修正する必要はありませんでした。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhhiK-H70IUy-2lphu2saFh89mZq0zRuJouHar_JAvWxtRrpMN4tM7s32bN7_pj22MoO70uUNrNYtNJ5rhLgEBNb_rLnhAV_j0lEwdgCKYEAM6JnkC-QD7923lmJUhGw5rtJkC7qb9TxAynfG_QLiPBN4d0p67CubAzZz8JAoh_Hzbc1d5VyGhV1Xz2faxS"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>This is an overview of the system.</p><p>First, the user issues a badge using the Learning Management System. At this point, the user is authenticated using the existing Identity Provider.</p><p>Next, the badge is issued to the user's wallet. When the user accesses the gateway, the gateway is also federated with the same Identity Provider as the Learning Management System, and the user is prompted for authentication. This way, the user is granted the appropriate permissions to execute the Moodle API. The gateway service then performs the Moodle API to obtain the issued badge and generate a verifiable credential. The gateway then issues the verifiable credential to the user's wallet as the issuer.</p><p>The issuance is now complete.</p><p>Finally, let's look at the presentation. In this case, we want to present the credential to the Gakunin RDM research database, but Gakunin RDM only supports the SAML protocol so we will use the Wallet to SP Connector. When the user accesses a specific page on Gakunin RDM, Gakunin RDM uses the SAML protocol to start the Wallet to SP Connector. This is the same operation as a standard SAML-based federation, so it is very easy to implement. When the Wallet to SP Connector is started, it requests the user's wallet to present a verifiable credential per the OpenID for Verifiable Presentation protocol. When the user presents the credential in their purse, the Wallet to SP Connector verifies the signature of the credential, extracts the embedded badge information from the credential, and configures it as a SAML assertion, then sends it to Gakunin RDM using the SAML protocol.</p><p>This allows Gakunin RDM to obtain the desired learning credential information, which can then be used to perform access control and other processing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>以下にシステムの概要を示します。</p><p>まず、ユーザーは学習管理システムを使用してバッジを発行します。この時点で、ユーザーは既存のアイデンティティプロバイダを使用して認証されます。</p><p>次に、バッジがユーザーのウォレットに発行されます。ユーザーがゲートウェイにアクセスすると、ゲートウェイも学習管理システムと同じアイデンティティプロバイダとフェデレーションされており、ユーザーに認証が求められます。これにより、ユーザーにはMoodle APIを実行する適切な権限が付与されます。次に、ゲートウェイサービスがMoodle APIを実行して発行済みのバッジを取得し、検証可能な資格情報を生成します。次に、ゲートウェイが発行者として、検証可能な資格情報をユーザーのウォレットに発行します。</p><p>これで発行は完了です。</p><p>最後に、プレゼンテーションについて見てみましょう。このケースでは、学認RDM研究用データベースにクレデンシャルを提示したいのですが、学認RDMはSAMLプロトコルしかサポートしていないので、Wallet to SP Connectorを使用します。ユーザーが学認RDM上の特定のページにアクセスすると、学認RDMはSAMLプロトコルを使用してWallet to SP Connectorを開始します。これは標準的なSAMLベースのフェデレーションと同じ操作なので、実装は非常に簡単です。Wallet to SP Connectorが起動すると、OpenID for Verifiable Presentationプロトコルに従って、ユーザーのウォレットに検証可能なクレデンシャルの提示を要求します。ユーザーが財布内のクレデンシャルを提示すると、Wallet to SP Connectorはクレデンシャルの署名を検証し、クレデンシャルから埋め込みのバッジ情報を抽出し、それをSAMLアサーションとして構成し、SAMLプロトコルを使用して学認RDMに送信します。</p><p>これにより、学認RDMは必要な学習クレデンシャル情報を取得でき、アクセス制御やその他の処理に使用できるようになります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgau6fIEPYKGurnBK6dhvh04y9UPBo-xmcnP6X004UVGvSmWIxQ88HUGurZNWicYm1nT34kxNtfvd-XciYT6pgQg4UceunyKCXp8zoc_TaxZlA2VeEjkc8rfNpwtA_2TcstBvS40KumqVvOe3Chuj4UooA7Igdtlh6k3D7sbAEicyfSgYonpWhXSNYYT1lk"></a> <br><p></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>We will also introduce activities that address other non-technical considerations.</p><p>Open Identity Exchange is working to map the trust frameworks of each country and identify differences.</p><p>For example, this will enable the EU to understand what rules were used to issue the credentials issued by Japan and to determine whether additional measures are necessary.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>また、技術以外の考慮事項に対処する活動についても紹介します。</p><p>Open Identity Exchangeは、各国の信頼フレームワークをマッピングし、相違点を特定する作業を行っています。</p><p>例えば、これによりEUは、日本が発行したクレデンシャルを発行する際にどのような規則が用いられたかを理解し、追加の措置が必要かどうかを判断することができます。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhDFjscYoiOWigxm93OXMFSWREtQZTLepeNIH8el6Z9jnUykMh8LncWZCuiN0OPLfIMgxQTaplNvL-av8lycqfrlsuLbDNIwldX5sbe-Y4zNctT7gwrdOYcrTRwCqL5siP5yIiYtwZCfXsCm8OODNoIvyHYhiZRyD202nbffUGDTr0vzflTctniFppbVL4G"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>There are also activities in the academic world to map frameworks related to qualification levels.</p><p>In the academic world, there are two main types of credentials: micro-credentials, mainly learning records, and macro-credentials, which are qualifications such as degrees and credits.</p><p>While micro-credentials are becoming increasingly digitized, as in the case of the NII example mentioned earlier, OpenBadge, it is tough to standardize the difficulty of skills. I think this will continue to be a challenge. On the other hand, about macro-credentials, UNESCO has established standards for skill levels so that each country can define levels based on these standards.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>学術界でも、資格レベルに関連する枠組みをマッピングする活動があります。</p><p>学術界では、主に学習記録であるマイクロ資格と、学位や単位などの資格であるマクロ資格の2つの主要な資格があります。</p><p>マイクロ・クレデンシャルは、先ほど例に挙げたNIIのOpenBadgeのように、どんどんデジタル化が進んでいますが、スキルの難易度をどう標準化するかは難しい。これは今後も課題になっていくと思います。一方、マクロ・クレデンシャルについては、ユネスコが技能レベルの基準を定めており、各国がそれをベースにレベルを定義できるようになっています。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj_tIiMKI14xnhqQfZachoYstaGE3B9oGpbrDM885MsBdREw2gu_SU24bgJNusgWSJWVoZALBfesb4i_rIjV6KIivOZsjHQnBvbCwTltwpe2p4Tjz1fZ6kzcmomNvBS0P2KnK1x0ur64KfBjIVKeb0xm7T4uRDhhnDSNTSkeYSc0UYEHb-ZCDVrYIbgZ2vU"></a> <br>&nbsp;<p></p><blockquote><p>This is the approach to global standards and mapping as defined by UNESCO.</p><p>In this example, the EQF developed by Europe based on UNESCO standards is mapped to the frameworks of other countries.</p><p>For example, EQF Level 4 is mapped to Country X Level 5 and Country Y Level 3.</p><p>これは、ユネスコが定義するグローバルスタンダードとマッピングへのアプローチです。</p><p>この例では、ユネスコの基準に基づいてヨーロッパが開発したEQFが、他の国のフレームワークにマッピングされています。</p><p>例えば、EQFレベル4は、国Xのレベル5および国Yのレベル3にマッピングされています。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhixiO4yGRKxUsq-xA-pbgNoo967OlFkUbSg1wBOH1Q8K8NgiI6D7pQTxCYDv45Tf8BueK3qjPJnAj-TdKNzgCgVakI_9ijuj92Huv9J-33-PUTFictKCwnb3EBDe_2qLAJZPQbeLnAtdz8TPvt5wQEylxjUd39pea6zQr3Lif6oQcdKHQGV9Thp2J--GVa"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;In addition, we will introduce some of the activities that have been taking place in Japan recently.</p><p>Trusted Web has been underway since 2020, and research into digital identity wallets is being carried out.

It is essential to reach agreement on technical matters such as identifiers, transport protocols, and data models. I also explained that semantics and trust frameworks are necessary from a non-technical perspective.</p><p>I also explained that we need to respond to the recent paradigm changes of identity systems. To introduce a wallet-based system into a federation-type system that has been used in the past, it is thought that it will be necessary to use components such as proxies and gateways temporarily. I also mentioned that by comparing trust frameworks, it will be possible to clarify what additional processing the systems require to be connected.</p><p>In the future, we will need to connect many systems to overcome the silo-based society that has continued since the fall of the Tower of Babel. I hope that we can continue to have discussions like this with everyone.</p><p>Thank you.</p>  最後にまとめます。  まず、相互運用性は技術的な問題と、ルールやフレームワークなどの技術的でない考慮事項の両方を含んでいます。識別子、通信プロトコル、データモデルなどの技術的な事項について合意に達することが不可欠です。また、技術的でない観点からは、セマンティクスや信頼フレームワークが必要であることを説明しました。  また、アイデンティティシステムの最近のパラダイム変化に対応する必要があることを説明しました。これまで使われてきたフェデレーション型システムに、ウォレット型システムを導入するには、プロキシやゲートウェイなどのコンポーネントを一時的に使用する必要があると考えられます。また、信頼フレームワークを比較することで、システムを接続するためにどのような追加処理が必要かを明確にできることを述べました。  今後は、バベルの塔の崩壊以来続いてきた縦割り社会を乗り越えるためにも、多くのシステムを接続していく必要があります。今後も皆さんとこのような議論を続けていければと思います。  ありがとうございました。  </blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>プロンプターが欲しかったプレゼンでした・・・&nbsp;</p><p>ちなみに始まる前にオープンニングトークをしてくれた台湾のデジタル副大臣（私の左側）と登壇者全員で記念写真を撮りました。なんかセレモニーみたいでいいですね。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgcqOC1PiECCsjXoKm676xGTTtf0y9y7V1_ccAgwKlVQJ4RbIQ5uMIyZ5QKyU86iHUMqMOxnFp_XdA08Ub_RsSB_OqgX0i5C7ygmUxCNud79kLCNQKp9kOd275ASi3rOz50vMcufhsBLkpUvwWVUowYVSIZEUzbORE7a1rHstID1qxflxcQNm-89EeeeRGA"></a> <br><br><p></p><br><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>When I first heard the quote “We shape our tools then our tools shape us” from Orie Steele (A quick web search attributes it originally to John Culkin) I didn’t quite understand the profound wisdom in the statement. It’s one of those clickbait sounding quotes that sticks with you for a bit and has to ruminate for longer like it’s an idea slow cooking in a crockpot on thanksgiving dinner. But the wisdom in it rings true as I see it playing out repetitively within the technology space and I’m sure it makes a difference in many other aspects of our life.</p>

<p>When we build a technology, tool, web app, or even language we first build the tool to solve a problem. Over time though, new problems arise and they inevitably change based on the tools we choose to use to solve them. For example, language in its most primitive form was likely just a means to express emotions such as danger. Eventually it evolved and specialized so much that we can hear the sounds, piece together their grammatical structure, but only if we’re listening are we able to unpack the meaning. Whether that’s because the language being spoken is foreign (in which case we might not even understand the grammatical structure) or because we’re speaking with such abstract jargon the impact of the language as a tool remains the same. We cannot convey our intentions well enough such that our audience understands why we chose to make a noise in the first place. So we end up stuck in this sempiternal cycle of solving problems only for new ones to arise and the evidence we leave is in the iterative design of our tools. Or in the case of language in the semantic drift of words and change of mediums over time.</p>

<p>This has had me wondering lately, how do our newest tools on the Web used for communication shape our conversations? Looking back on the various forms of communication we’ve had throughout history might shed some light on this, but I’m not exactly sure so bear with me as I explore this idea further and hopefully my wandering thought leads to a moment of reflection for you the reader rather than loss of attention already.</p>

<p>Starting with speaking, since that seems to be the most primitive form of communication, when we speak with people we use tone, pauses, and word choice as our primary tools to convey different meanings. This form of communication hasn’t failed us yet so it’s still just as ever present now as it was at the beginning of humanity. But that’s just within the noises we make - when speaking we also express ourselves through our body language both as a speaker and as an audience. The speaker can convey a point with conviction through standing taller, speaking louder, and pausing longer. At the same time, without saying a word an audience can convey a lack of interest without even saying a word such as by yawning or diverting their attention elsewhere. So how does this appear in other forms of communication?</p>

<p>In written form, we lose the ability to convey emphasis through our body language so we had to modify our language to express it. Things like exclamation points, question marks, and even a parenthetical are evidence of that. But we also gained something rather noteworthy as well. With writing, because we have time to pause and reflect on our thoughts, edit them, and think through them we are able to build better structure into our writing to role play as both the author and the audience to make sure our intent isn’t lost. Additionally, because we’re not as restricted by the same social considerations we can write in both a more expansive or condensed form to convey our intent and reflect on our impact.</p>

<p>What becomes interesting though about both forms of communication is that we can both add and lose properties just by changing the medium that we use as well. For example, when speaking we can do this face to face with an individual, behind a podium to a variable sized audience, or even recorded as a video with or without editing. In writing, we can write books, essays, emails, messages, or social media posts. Each comes with their own nuances and social contracts in how we communicate within the medium chosen. And this is how we now shape our tools and then our tools shape us. We create new mediums of communication, and the new mediums form new rituals and social contracts in “acceptable” forms of communication via those mediums. So why does that matter?</p>

<p>It’s important because this informs us about how the methods we choose to communicate with  affects not only the cohesiveness of the community, but also the norms and the values reflected. Thereby changing the values we expect from one another. As an example, many collectives have adopted social media as a common form of communication. With that though, particularly with Twitter, comes the limited forms of editing, condensed writing that skips the rationale, and an algorithm that chooses to reinforce rhetoric through amplifying ideas with more likes and speakers with more followers/subscribers/friends.</p>

<p>Social media then instills values such as lack of reflection in our communication, attention grabbing ideas, and a bit of group think. With each new medium comes a different collection of properties that encourages emergent behavioral changes in us that show up in our collective shared values. So the final question I want to leave the reader with to reflect upon… Are the values you want within your communities being encouraged by the tools you use or is there a different tool that is needed to better reflect how you want to communicate with others?</p>

<p>This post looks at implementing an Open ID Connect identity provider in Microsoft Entra External ID. Auth0 is used as the identity provider and an ASP.NET Core application is used to test the authentication. Microsoft Entra External ID federates to Auth0. </p>



<p>Client code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam</a></p>



<p>Microsoft Entra External ID supports federation using OpenID Connect and was used to create the Auth0 OpenID Connect client. The settings configured in the portal must align with those in the Auth0 identity provider. The Entra External ID OIDC client would work with most IDPs, since standard OpenID Connect is used.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The corresponding client configuration was created in Auth0:</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Auth0 client in this setup returns the email in the name claim. This must match in the claim mapping in Entra External ID. The email claim is switched to use the name claim. Depending on the mappings, different claim mappings are required. The values are read from the id_token.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The correct callback URLs MUST be set on the Auth0 client configuration. Entra External ID requires the following redirectly URLs:</p>


  https://&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.ciamlogin.com/&lt;tenant-ID&gt;/federation/oauth2

https://&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.ciamlogin.com/&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.onmicrosoft.com/federation/oauth2
  


<p></p>



<p>The values are added to the Auth0 client. See the Entra External ID <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-custom-oidc-federation-customers#set-up-your-openid-connect-identity-provider">docs</a>.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Once the OpenID Connect client is setup, the identity provider can used in the Entra External ID user flow. Select the required user flow:</p>







<p></p>



<p>And select the Identity Providers and add the OpenID connect IdP.</p>







<p></p>



<p>To test, an <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">ASP.NET Core application</a> using Microsoft.Identity.Web was implemented to authenticate against Entra External ID. When the user is redirected the authenticate, the sign-in with Auth0 option is displayed.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This works well, but setting up the mappings can be difficult if you don’t know the mapping. With this it is possible now to use identities from almost any identity provider. </p>

<p>I’m writing to highly recommend the article “<a href="https://connect2id.com/blog/how-to-link-an-app-protocol-to-an-openid-federation-trust-layer">How to link an application protocol to an OpenID Federation 1.0 trust layer</a>” by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirdzhuvinov/">Vladimir Dzhuvinov</a>.  In it, he defines two kinds of integrity for Federations, and describes how to achieve them:</p>
 
 Federation Integrity, which is defined as: 
<blockquote><p>
This ensures mutual trust between two entities is established always from a common trust anchor. Any resolved metadata and policies that govern the client application and the OpenID provider in a transaction will then fall under the rules of the same federation and thus will be aligned and consistent with one another.
</p></blockquote>
 Metadata Integrity, which is defined as: 
<blockquote><p>
It ensures the trust chains for an entity to a given trust anchor will invariably result in consistent metadata and policies. The natural way to achieve this is for the federation topology under a trust anchor to form a tree. Topologies that lead to multiple paths from a leaf entity to a trust anchor are to be avoided.
</p></blockquote>
 
<p>The article also explores how application protocols, such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> or digital <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-wallet-1_0.html">wallet protocols</a>, can achieve those properties in practice (and when they do and don’t need to).</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll note that, as a result of Vladimir’s and others’ thinking about the topic, we just added a section on <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-41.html#name-federation-topologies">Federation Topologies</a> to the OpenID Federation specification, which provides concrete guidance on how to achieve Metadata Integrity.</p>
<p>I’ll stop here so as not to repeat all the useful content in Vladimir’s article.  By all means, <a href="https://connect2id.com/blog/how-to-link-an-app-protocol-to-an-openid-federation-trust-layer">give it read</a>!</p>

<p>Many digital identity proponents love the meme “the internet was built without an identity layer” and claim this as a bug to defend the need for a universal digital identity system. They’ve got it wrong though. This is a feature of the Web that has allowed the Web to flourish not a bug that must be fixed. The reason we should be preserving it extends beyond privacy and is more than ever relevant to the impact the Web has on our society.</p>

<p>Instead, we have to look beyond about the purpose the Web serves in our greater lives. Today, many of us use the Web as a means to learn, challenge our beliefs, and ultimately shape who we are by being exposed to new and challenging ideas. However, without pseudonyms it’s hard for us to refine and grow ideas. This is because pseudonyms are a hallmark to challenging the Overton’s window.</p>

<p>What is an Overton window though and why does it matter? The idea of an Overton window is that there’s a limited number of acceptable policy or discussion points that are acceptable to a mainstream populous. For example, if we were to debate the concept of inequality and someone were to propose the idea of getting rid of money in today’s time it would not be a widely accepted solution in a discussion or debate. The reason for this is that it’s impractical relative to our cultural and social norms and therefore sits outside the Overton window of today.</p>

<p>Similarly, slavery is a well understood concept that is no longer acceptable in today’s society. We understand it no longer aligns with our values as humans and therefore sits outside the Overton window as well as a regressive policy that was once acceptable, but is definitely not now. So, in any good faith discussion or debate there’s a range of believes that are acceptable as a path forward for the majority of people and that’s what makes an Overton window interesting in the broader perspective of the Web. It serves as a tool for us to consider and evolve our beliefs in society today. This range of acceptable beliefs changes though, but how?</p>

<p>Essentially, in any discussion people stake their credibility to put forth ideas that they believe have merits to the stakeholders of a problem and one that aims to solve such problem. The issue is though that some ideas exist too far outside the range of acceptable policies such that the idea of even proposing them would instantly affect the credibility of the author of the idea. Therefore, in order to reduce the risk while still moving the discussion forward we need the ability to submit and refine ideas that exist outside the Overton window until they’re good enough to shift the window. So why is pseudonymity important to guiding this?</p>

<p>Pseudonymity serves as a way to reduce the risk while still contributing to the overall broader conversation without running the risk of hurting our credibility within the broader context. Often times, the people with the most interesting ideas are those who are most involved within the topic, but may not be willing to contribute under their true moniker. Benjamin Franklin is one such example of a person who famously used pseudonyms in this way. Silence Dogood was a pseudonym that Benjamin Franklin developed at the age of 16 in order to test his political ideas and refine his writing style. It’s likely the case that this ability to submit publications under this pseudonym and listen to the feedback of readers anonymously contributed to his ability to shape the founding of the United States beneficially. So should we remove or reduce that ability from the Web which is now the primary place for us to engage in political discussions? Furthermore, how is that happening?</p>

<p>With the advent of digital credentials coming to your phone soon we’re about to make it very easy for any social media platform, forum, or site to link our online identities to our real life identities. In fact, in some places like Australia they’ve recently passed a bill to require the collection of this information for the purposes of protecting children. Since these digital credentials of our true monikers will be easily accessible, as they become collected within places on the Web where political discussions occur we will see a reduction in the use of pseudonyms on the Web. Instead, people will either be forced to remain silent or they will be forced to overcome a greater barrier of entry in order to shift the Overton window under true monikers. Is that beneficial for society as a whole?</p>

<p>I’d argue not - clearly it’s been beneficial both for the purposes of the progress of a nation and for the progress of us as people to have pseudonymity to in political discussions previously. Therefore, it seems risky to accept the path of reducing the pseudonymity on the Web and ultimately reducing the shifting of the Overton window by chilling political speech on the Web  via the allowance of digital credentials. Instead, we should be limiting digital credentials usage as much as possible in order to continue making progress in our political discussions and ultimately progressing our shared values together.</p>

<p>This article looks at setting up an ASP.NET Core application to use Azure Key Vault. When deployed to Azure, it works like in the Azure documentation but when working on development PCs, some changes are required for a smooth developer experience. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/UsingAzureKeyVaultInDevelopment">https://github.com/damienbod/UsingAzureKeyVaultInDevelopment</a></p>



<p>I develop using Visual Studio and manage multiple accounts and test environments. However, I frequently encounter access errors when using DefaultAzureCredentials. These errors typically occur because the account and tenant do not match the filter set in Visual Studio, or the user lacks access to the tenant. This issue arises often:</p>







<p></p>



<p>The problem can be resolved by using an application client secret to access the Azure Key Vault, implemented with the ChainedTokenCredential. The access client can be specified in the project’s user secrets, allowing it to function independently of the user account and the last filter used in Visual Studio. To set this up, a new Azure App registration was created, and a client secret was added. This client secret is then included in the dotnet user secrets for the project.</p>







<p></p>



<p>A Role assignment was added to the Azure Key Vault for the application service principal, and the necessary access role was configured. With the correct configuration in the user secrets on the development PC, the application can access the Azure Key Vault. This setup eliminates the need for Azure RBAC changes for each developer.</p>







<p></p>



 Setup local development credentials 



<p>The following Nuget packages can be used to integrate a Key Vault client in an ASP.NET Core application. Depending on how the client is setup, or what data is used from the Key Vault, different packages can be used.</p>



 
 Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets 



 Azure.Identity 



 Azure.Security.KeyVault.Certificates 



 Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets 
 



<p></p>



<p>A ChainedTokenCredential is used to access the Key Vault, preventing the access issues associated with DefaultAzureCredential. In local development, a client credential is used via a secret, which can be stored in the dotnet user secrets. When a new developer joins the team, these user secrets can be shared, eliminating the need to modify Azure Key Vault RBAC settings for each new developer. This setup is ideal for development, as it avoids problems caused by incorrect tenants or user accounts in Visual Studio. For production or other deployments, a system-assigned managed identity is used.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;

namespace DevelopmentAspNetCoreKeyVault;

public static class AppAccessCredentials
{
    public static ChainedTokenCredential GetChainedTokenCredentials(IConfiguration configuration, bool isDevelopment)
    {
        if (!isDevelopment)
        {
            // Use a system assigned managed identity on production deployments
            return new ChainedTokenCredential(new ManagedIdentityCredential());
        }
        else // dev env
        {
            var tenantId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:TenantId", string.Empty);
            var clientId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:ClientId", string.Empty);
            var clientSecret = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:ClientSecret", string.Empty);

            var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
            {
                AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
            };

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(tenantId)) // DevOps
            {
                // Use DefaultAzureCredential if AzureCliCredential is not used in your DevOps
                return new ChainedTokenCredential(new AzureCliCredential());
            }

            // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
            var devClientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
                tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

            var chainedTokenCredential = new ChainedTokenCredential(devClientSecretCredential);

            return chainedTokenCredential;
        }
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The user secrets would have something like this:</p>


  {
  "EntraId": {
    // aspnetcore-keyvault-development-access
    "TenantId": "--tenant_id--",
    "ClientId": "--client_id--",
    "ClientSecret": "--secret--"
  }
}
  


<p></p>



 Using Key Vault directly in the application 



<p>The secret from the Azure Key Vault can be used directly in the code by using the SecretClient class from Azure.Identity. The AppAccessCredentials is used to return the chained credentials and the application is authenticated if the service principal from the App registration has the correct RBAC.</p>


  // Azure SDK direct
var client = new SecretClient(new Uri(_configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"]!),
    AppAccessCredentials.GetChainedTokenCredentials(_configuration,
        _hostEnvironment.IsDevelopment()));

var secret = await client.GetSecretAsync("demosecret");
DemoSecret = secret!.Value.Value;
  


<p></p>



 Using Key Vault as a configuration 



<p>The AddAzureKeyVault method can be used to use the Azure Key as a further configuration option. I like this as all configuration is abstracted with the IConfiguration interface in the application. The AddAzureKeyVault takes the chained credential as a param.</p>


  var keyVault = builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"];
if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(keyVault))
{
    builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault(
    new Uri($"{builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"]}"),
    AppAccessCredentials.GetChainedTokenCredentials(builder.Configuration,
        builder.Environment.IsDevelopment()));
}
  


<p>The secret can be read anywhere in the code using the IConfiguration interface. This can be used in different ways and provides type safe ways of using the properties.</p>


  // ASP.NET Core configuration
// From from key vault using ASP.NET Core configuration integration
// Or from user secrets if offline, or fast startup is required
DemoSecretConfig = _configuration["demosecret"];
  


<p></p>



 Using user secrets for local development 



<p>Sometimes, you need to work offline or frequently restart the application. Constantly connecting to Azure Key Vault can slow down development. In such cases, it’s often more efficient to use dotnet user secrets instead of Azure Key Vault.</p>



 Note 



<p>This is a good and simple approach for developing applications which use Azure Key Vault. You can use a local key management system or whatever local developers use. The client secret should not be used in production deployments as the secret expires and there are better ways to secure the access for the application to Key Vault. System assigned managed identity is the best way to implement application access in Azure in production environments.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect working group</a> recently adopted three new specifications that build upon and provide new capabilities to <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>.  But I’m not only happy about these because of the engineering benefits they bring.</p>
<p>I’m particularly happy because they bring new active contributors to the work, specifically <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-f-1495aa133/">Michael Fraser</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%82ukasz-jaromin-54355647/">Łukasz Jaromin</a>, as well as continuing the strong work by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giuseppe-de-marco-bb054245/">Giuseppe De Marco</a>, who’s become a leader in the space.  They’re also supported by a few veterans: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandhedberg/">Roland Hedberg</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ve7jtb/">John Bradley</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/selfissued/">yours truly</a>, plus now the full OpenID Connect working group.</p>
<p>Here’s the three new specifications, along with an abstract for each of them:</p>
<p>1.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-extended-listing-1_0.html">OpenID Federation Extended Subordinate Listing</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification acts as an extension to OpenID Federation 1.0. It outlines methods to interact with a given Federation with a potentially large number of registered Entities, as well as mechanisms to retrieve multiple entity statements along with associated details in a single request.
</p></blockquote>
<p>2.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-wallet-1_0.html">OpenID Federation Wallet Architectures</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
As digital wallets become increasingly deployed for managing identity credentials, establishing an architecture for trusted communication is required to allow each participant in the ecosystem to evaluate other participants’ compliance with mutual trust frameworks and accomplish secure and trusted transactions.</p>
<p>This specification defines how to use OpenID Federation 1.0 to enhance the security and interoperability of wallet ecosystems, facilitating trust establishment among the parties and enabling secure metadata exchange and policy application across large scale deployments. It outlines the general architecture of a federated trust infrastructure for wallet ecosystems, identifying participant roles and describing the use of those roles.
</p></blockquote>
<p>3.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rp-metadata-choices-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Relying Party Metadata Choices</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification extends the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 specification to enable RPs to express a set of supported values for some RP metadata parameters, rather than just single values. This functionality is particularly useful when Automatic Registration, as defined in OpenID Federation 1.0, is used, since there is no registration response from the OP to tell the RP what choices were made by the OP. This gives the OP the information that it needs to make choices about how to interact with the RP in ways that work for both parties.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the members of the OpenID Connect working group who helped refine them before adoption, and are now working on progressing them in the working group.</p>

<p>One of the wonderful, yet also daunting, aspects of being in the Identity industry is realizing just how far-reaching and all-encompassing its scope and boundaries are. It’s why we need more than just technologists and standards wonks engaged in driving the future of this industry. I’ve been on stage at Identiverse and other conferences for many years challenging the Identirati to bring in people from other fields like User Experience Research, Law, Privacy, and more.</p>



<p>This is the challenge that the <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/">Digital Identity Advancement Foundation</a> has taken on. You can check out how they are doing this on their website, via the Kim Cameron Award and the Vittorio Bertocci Award. Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arynn-crow-821761103/">Arynn Crow</a>, I had the chance to spend some time chatting with the 2024 Kim Cameron award winner, legal scholar <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-klutke-3ba8a1228/">Grace Klutke</a>, at Authenticate 2024. We talked (in my usual rambling sort of way) about ethics in Identity, and the broader impact on human rights, inclusion, and access (in the human and not the technical Authorization sense). You can read her reflection on her experience at the conference <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/news/2024-kim-cameron-awardee-reflections-grace-klutke/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Oh, and <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/donate/">support DIAF</a> if you can. They’re doing good, and necessary, work!  If DIAF continues to bring smart, talented, and motivated individuals like her from other fields into our industry, then we’ll be doing it right.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, I started <a href="https://postgr.es/m/2CAD6FA7-DC25-48FC-80F2-8F203DECAE6A%40justatheory.com">a pgsql-hackers thread</a> proposing a new
extension file organization and a search path <a href="https://pgpedia.info/g/guc.html" title="GUC - Grand Unified Configuration">GUC</a> for finding extensions.
The <a href="https://postgr.es/m/E7C7BFFB-8857-48D4-A71F-88B359FADCFD@justatheory.com">discussion</a> of <a href="https://www.df7cb.de">Christoph Berg</a>’s <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/50/4913/"><code>extension_destdir</code> patch</a>
inspired this proposal. These threads cover quite a lot of territory, so I
want to pull together a more unified, public proposal.</p>
<p>Here goes.</p>
 Challenges 
<p>A number of challenges face extension users, thanks to extension file
organization in the Postgres core. The common thread among them is the need to
add extensions without changing the contents of the Postgres installation
itself.</p>
 Packager Testing 
<p>On Debian systems, the user account that creates extension packages lacks
permission to add files to Postgres install. But testing extensions requires
installing the extension where Postgres can find it. Moreover, extensions
ideally build against a clean Postgres install; adding an extension in order
to run <code>make installcheck</code> would pollute it.</p>
<p><a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/50/4913/">Christoph’s patch</a> solves these problems by adding a second lookup
path for extensions and dynamic modules, so that Postgres can load them
directly from the package build directory.</p>
<p>Alas, the patch isn’t ideal, because it simply specifies a prefix and appends
the full <code>pg_config</code> directory paths to it. For example, if <code>--sharedir</code>
outputs <code>/opt/share</code> and <code>extension_destdir</code> GUC is set to <code>/tmp/build/myext</code>,
the patch will search in <code>/tmp/build/myext/opt/share</code>. This approach works for
the packaging use case, which explicitly uses full paths with a prefix, but
would be weird for other use cases.</p>
<p>Peter Eisentraut proposed an <a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">alternate patch</a> with a new <code>GUC</code>,
<code>extension_control_path</code>, that provides a more typical search path pattern to
find extension control files, but doesn’t account for shared modules that ship
with an extension, requiring that they still live in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>. Installing into custom directories requires the
undocumented <code>datadir</code> and <code>pkglibdir</code> variables:</p>
  <code>make install datadir=/else/where/share pkglibdir=/else/where/lib
</code>  <p>This pattern can probably be simplified.</p>
 OCI Immutability 
<p><a href="https://opencontainers.org" title="Open Container Initiative">OCI</a> (née Docker) images are immutable, while a container image runs on a
writeable but non-persistent file system. To install persistent extensions in
a container, one must create a persistent volume, map it to
<code>SHAREDIR/extensions</code>, and copy over all the extensions it needs (or muck with
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ongres/postgres-extensions-in-kubernetes?slide=14" title="Postgres Extensions in Kubernetes: StackGres">symlink magic</a>). Then do it again for shared object libraries (<code>PKGLIBDIR</code>),
and perhaps also for other <code>pg_config</code> directories, like <code>--bindir</code>. Once it’s
all set up, one can install a new extension and its files will be distributed
to the relevant persistent volumes.</p>
<p>This pattern makes upgrades tricky, because the core extensions are mixed in
with third-party extensions. Worse, the number of directories that must be
mounted into volumes depends on the features of an extension, increasing
deployment configuration complexity. It would be preferable to have all the
files for an extension in one place, rather than scattered across multiple
persistent volumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">Peter Eisentraut’s patch</a> addresses much of this issue by adding a
search path for extension control files and related data/share files
(generally SQL files). One can create a single volume with a <code>lib</code> directory
for shared modules and <code>share/extension</code> directory for control and data/share
files.</p>
 OCI Extension Images 
<p>However, an additional wrinkle is the ambition from the <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CloudNativePg</a>
(<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CNPG</a>) community to eliminate the need for a persistent volume, and rely
instead on mounting images that each contain all the files for a single
extension as their own volumes, perhaps using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/image-volumes/" title="Kubernetes Docs: Use an Image Volume With a Pod">Kubernetes image volume
feature</a>, (currently in alpha).</p>
<p>This feature requires all the file in an extension to live in a single
directory, a volume mounted to an extension image contains all the files
required to use the extension. The search path patches proposed so far do not
enable this behavior.</p>
 Postgres.app Immutability 
<p>The macOS <a href="https://postgresapp.com" title="Postgres.app: The easiest way to get started with PostgreSQL on the Mac">Postgres.app</a> supports extensions. But installing one into
<code>SHAREDIR/extensions</code> changes the contents of the Postgres.app bundle,
breaking Apple-required signature validation. The OS will no longer be able to
validate that the app is legit and refuse to start it.</p>
<p>Peter Eisentraut’s <a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">new patch</a> addresses this issue as well, with
all the same caveats as for the <a>packager testing</a>
challenges.</p>
 Solution 
<p>To further address these issues, this RFC proposes to change file organization
and lookup patterns for PostgreSQL extensions.</p>
 Extension Directories 
<p>First, when an extension is installed, by default all of its files will live
in a single directory named for the extension. The contents include:</p>
 
 The Control file that describes extension 
 Subdirectories for SQL, shared modules, docs, binaries, etc. 
 
<p>Subdirectories roughly correspond to the <code>pg_config --*dir</code> options:</p>
 
 <code>bin</code>: Executables 
 <code>doc</code>: Documentation files 
 <code>html</code>: HTML documentation files 
 <code>lib</code>: Dynamically loadable modules 
 <code>locale</code>: Locale support files 
 <code>man</code>: Manual pages 
 <code>share</code>: SQL and other architecture-independent support files 
 
<p>This layout reduces the cognitive overhead for understanding what files belong
to what extension. Want to know what’s included in the <code>widget</code> extension?
Everything is in the <code>widget</code> directory. It also simplifies installation of an
extension: one need add only a directory named for and containing the files
required by the extension.</p>
 Configuration Parameter 
<p>Add a new <code>pg_config</code> value that returns the directory into which extensions
will by default be installed:</p>
 <code> --extdir   show location of extensions
</code> <p>Its default value would be <code>$(pg_config --sharedir)/extension</code>, but could be
set at compile time like other configuration parameters. Its contents consist
of subdirectories that each contain an extension, as described in <a>Extension
Directories</a>. With a few extensions installed, it
would look something like:</p>
  <code>❯ ls -1 "$(pg_config --extdir)"
auto_explain
bloom
isn
pair
plperl
plpgsql
plv8
xml2
semver
vector
</code>   Extension Path 
<p>Add an extension lookup path GUC akin to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>, called
<code>extension_path</code>. It lists all the directories that Postgres will search for
extensions and their files. The default value for this GUC will be:</p>
  <code>extension_path = '$extdir'
</code>  <p>The special string <code>$extdir</code> corresponds to the <code>pg_config</code> option of the same
name, and function exactly as <code>$libdir</code> does for the <code>dynamic_library_path</code>
GUC, substituting the appropriate value.</p>
 Lookup Execution 
<p>Update PostgreSQL’s <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> command to search the directories in
<code>extension_path</code> for an extension. For each directory in the list, it will
look for the extension control file in a directory named for the extension:</p>
  <code>$dir/$extension/$extension.control
</code>  <p>The first match will be considered the canonical location for the extension.
For example, if Postgres finds the control file for the <code>pair</code> at
<code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/pair.control</code>, it will load files only from the
appropriate subdirectories, e.g.:</p>
 
 SQL files from <code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/share</code> 
 Shared module files from <code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/lib</code> 
 
 PGXS 
<p>Update the extension installation behavior of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> to install extension
files into the new layout. A new variable, <code>$EXTDIR</code>, will define the
directory into which to install extension directories, and default to
<code>$(pg_config --extdir)</code>. It can be set to any literal path, which must exist
and be accessible by the PostgreSQL service.</p>
<p>The <code>$EXTENSION</code> variable will be changed to allow only one extension name. If
it’s set, the installation behavior will be changed for the following
variables:</p>
 
 <code>EXTENSION</code>: Creates <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION</code>, installs
<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/$EXTENSION.control</code> 
 <code>MODULES</code> and <code>MODULE_big</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/lib</code> 
 <code>MODULEDIR</code>: Removed 
 <code>DATA</code> and <code>DATA_built</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/share</code> 
 <code>DATA_TSEARCH</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/share/tsearch_data</code> 
 <code>DOCS</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/doc</code> 
 <code>PROGRAM</code>, <code>SCRIPTS</code> and <code>SCRIPTS_built</code>: Installed into
<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/bin</code> 
 
<p>Each of these locations can still be overridden by setting one of the
(currently undocumented) <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/Makefile.global.in#L82-L90">installation location options</a> (e.g., <code>datadir</code>,
<code>pkglibdir</code>, etc.).</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note</p>
      <p>External projects that install extensions without using PGXS, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>,
must also be updated to either follow the same pattern or to delegate
installation to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
 Control File 
<p>The <code>directory</code> control file parameter will be deprecated and ignored.</p>
<p>The <code>module_pathname</code> parameter should only name a shared module in the <code>lib</code>
subdirectory of an extension directory. Any existing use of a <code>$libdir</code> prefix
will be stripped out and ignored before replacing the <code>MODULE_PATHNAME</code> string
in SQL files. The implication for loading extension dynamic modules<a>1</a>
differs from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-C-DYNLOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Dynamic Loading">existing behavior</a> as follows:</p>
 
 If the name is an absolute path, the given file is loaded. 
 If the name does not contain a directory part, the file is searched for in
the in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the extension’s directory
(<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/lib</code>). 
 Otherwise (the file was not found in the path, or it contains a
non-absolute directory part), the dynamic loader will try to take the name
as given, which will most likely fail. (It is unreliable to depend on the
current working directory.) 
 
 Use Cases 
<p>Here’s how the proposed file layout and <code>extension_path</code> GUC addresses the
<a>use cases</a> that inspired this RFC.</p>
 Packager Testing 
<p>A packager who wants to run tests without modifying a PostgreSQL install would
follow these steps:</p>
 
 Prepend a directory under the packaging install to the <code>extension_path</code>
GUC. The resulting value would be something like
<code>$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/$(pg_config --extdir):$extdir</code>. 
 Install the extension into that directory:
<code>make install EXTDIR=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT</code> 
 Make sure the PostgreSQL server can access the directory, then run
<code>make installcheck</code> 
 
<p>This will allow PostgreSQL to find and load the extension during the tests.
The Postgres installation will not have been modified; only the
<code>extension_path</code> will have changed.</p>
 OCI/Kubernetes 
<p>To allow extensions to be added to a OCI container and to persist beyond its
lifetime, one or more <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/" title="Docker Docs: Volumes">volumes</a> could be used. Some examples:</p>
 
 Mount a persistent volume for extensions and prepend the path to that
directory to the <code>extension_path</code> GUC. Then Postgres can find any
extensions installed there, and they will persist. Files for all
extensions will live on a single volume. 
 Or, to meet a desire to keep some extensions separate (e.g., open-source
vs company-internal extensions), two or more persistent volumes could be
mounted, as long as they’re all included in <code>extension_path</code>, are
accessible by PostgreSQL, and users take care to install extensions in the
proper locations. 
 
 CNPG Extension Images 
<p>To meet the <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CNPG</a> ambition to “install” an extension by mounting a single
directory for each, create separate images for each extension, then use the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/image-volumes/" title="Kubernetes Docs: Use an Image Volume With a Pod">Kubernetes image volume feature</a> (currently in alpha) to mount each as a
read-only volume in the appropriate subdirectory of a directory included in
<code>extension_path</code>. Thereafter, any new containers would simply have to mount
all the same extension image volumes to provide the same extensions to all
containers.</p>
 Postgres.app 
<p>To allow extension installation without invalidating the Postgres.app bundle
signature, the default configuration could prepend a well-known directory
outside the app bundle, such as <code>/Library/Application Support/Postgres</code>, to
<code>extension_path</code>. Users wishing to install new extensions would then need to
point the <code>EXTDIR</code> parameter to that location, e.g.,</p>
  <code>$ make install EXTDIR="/Library/Application Support/Postgres"`
</code>  <p>Or the app could get trickier, setting the <code>--extdir</code> value to that location
so that users don’t need to use <code>EXTDIR</code>. As long as <code>extension_path</code> includes
both the bundle’s own extension directory and this external directory,
Postgres will be able to find and load all extensions.</p>
 Extension Directory Examples 
<p>A core extension like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/citext.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: citext — a case-insensitive character string type">citext</a> would have a structure similar to:</p>
 <code>citext
├── citext.control
├── lib
│   ├── citext.dylib
│   └── bitcode
│       ├── citext
│       │   └── citext.bc
│       └── citext.index.bc

</code>  Phase Two: Preloading 
<p>The above-proposed <a>solution</a> does not allow shared modules
distributed with extensions to compatibly be loaded via <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Shared Library Preloading">shared library
preloading</a>, because extension modules wil no longer live in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>. Users can specify full paths, however. For example,
instead of:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>One could use the path to the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the extension’s directory:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = '/opt/postgres/extensions/pg_partman_bgw/lib/pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>But users will likely find this pattern cumbersome, especially for extensions
with multiple shared modules. Perhaps some special syntax could be added to
specify a single extension module, such as:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = '$extension_path::pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>But this overloads the semantics of <code>shared_preload_libraries</code> and the code
that processes it rather heavily, not to mention the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: LOAD"><code>LOAD</code></a> command.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a follow up to the <a>solution</a> proposed above, this
RFC proposes additional changes to PostgreSQL.</p>
 Extension Preloading 
<p>Add new GUCs that complement <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Shared Library Preloading">shared library preloading</a>, but for extension
module preloading:</p>
 
 <code>shared_preload_extensions</code> 
 <code>session_preload_extensions</code> 
 <code>local_preload_extensions</code> 
 
<p>Each takes a list of extensions for which to preload shared modules. In
addition, another new GUC, <code>local_extensions</code>, will contain a list of
administrator-approved extensions users are allowed to include in
<code>local_preload_extensions</code>. This GUC complements <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-LOCAL-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: local_preload_libraries"><code>local_preload_libraries</code></a>’s
use of a <code>plugins</code> directory.</p>
<p>Then modify the preloading code to also preload these files. For each
extension in a list, it would:</p>
 
 Search each path in <code>extension_path</code> for the extension. 
 When found, load all the shared libraries from <code>$extension/lib</code>. 
 
<p>For example, to load all shared modules in the <code>pg_partman</code> extension, set:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_extensions = 'pg_partman'
</code>  <p>To load a single shared module from an extension, give its name after the
extension name and two colons. This example will load only the
<code>pg_partman_bgw</code> shared module from the <code>pg_partman</code> extension:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_extensions = 'pg_partman::pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>This change requires a one-time change to existing preload configurations on
upgrade.</p>
 Future: Deprecate LOAD 
<p>For a future change, consider modifying <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> to support shared
module-only extensions. This would allow extensions with no SQL component,
such as <code>auto_explain</code>, to be handled like any other extension; it would live
under one of the directories in <code>extension_path</code> with a structure like this:</p>
 <code>auto_explain
├── auto_explain.control
└── lib
   ├── auto_explain.dylib
   └── bitcode
       ├── auto_explain
       │   └── auto_explain.bc
       └── auto_explain.index.bc
</code> <p>Note the <code>auto_explain.control</code> file. It would need a new parameter to
indicate that the extension includes no SQL files, so <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> and
related commands wouldn’t try to find them.</p>
<p>With these changes, extensions could become the primary, recommended interface
for extending PostgreSQL. Perhaps the <code>LOAD</code> command could be deprecated, and
the <code>*_preload_libraries</code> GUCs along with it.</p>
 Compatibility Issues 
 
 The <code>module_pathname</code> control file variable would prefer the name of a
shared module. The code that replaces the <code>MODULE_PATHNAME</code> string in SQL
files would to strip out the <code>$libdir/</code> prefix, if present. 
 The behavior of loading dynamic modules that ship with extensions (i.e.,
the value of the <code>AS</code> part of <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code>) would change to look for
a library name (with no directory part) in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the
extension directory. 
 The <code>directory</code> control file parameter and the <code>MODULEDIR</code> PGXS variable
would be deprecated and ignored. 
 <code>*_preload_libraries</code> would no longer be used to find extension modules
without full paths. Administrators would have to remove module names from
these GUCs and add the relevant extension names to the new
<code>*_preload_extensions</code> variables. To ease upgrades, we might consider
adding a PGXS variable that, when true, would symlink shared modules into
<code>--pkglibdr</code>. 
 <code>LOAD</code> would no longer be able to find shared modules included with
extensions, unless we add a PGXS variable that, when true, would symlink
shared modules into <code>--pkglibdr</code>. 
 The <code>EXTENSION</code> PGXS variable will no longer support multiple extension
names. 
 The change in extension installation locations must also be adopted by
projects that don’t use PGXS for installation, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>. Or perhaps
they could be modified to also use PGXS. Long term it might be useful to
replace the <code>Makefile</code>-based PGXS with another installation system,
perhaps a CLI. 
 
 Out of Scope 
<p>This RFC does not include or attempt to address the following issue:</p>
 
 How to manage third-party shared libraries. Making system dependencies
consistent in a OCI/Kubernetes environment or for non-system binary
packaging patterns presents its own challenges, though they’re not
specific to PostgreSQL or the patterns described here. Research is ongoing
into potential solutions, and will be addressed elsewhere.

<p>The first time I heard a critique of mediated experience, the critic was my dad. He was an avid photographer who, during our family’s year in India, when I was a young child, used his 35mm Exacta to capture thousands of photos that became carousels of color slides we viewed for many years thereafter. It was a remarkable documentary effort that solidified our memories of that year. But dad was aware of the tradeoff. A favorite joke became: “Q: How was your trip?” “A: I won’t know until the film is developed!” He realized that interposing a camera between himself and the people he encountered had altered the direct experience he and they would otherwise have had.</p>
<p>This weekend I heard <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/392-technology-culture">Christine Rosen’s</a> modern version of that critique in a discussion of her new book <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1454717522">The extinction of experience: Being human in a disembodied world</a>. I listened to the podcast on a hike, my noise-canceling Airpods insulating me from the sounds of the creek trail and from the people walking along it.</p>
<p>It’s complicated. When hiking alone I greatly value the ability to listen to interesting people and ideas while exercising, breathing fresh air, and moving through the natural world. The experience is embodied in one sense, disembodied in another. Reading the same material while lying on the couch would be a different, and arguably more extreme, form of disembodiment. But when I passed a family of four, all walking along looking at their phones, that felt wrong. When people are together they should actually be together, right? You’ve doubtless felt the same when seeing people in this together-but-not-together state.</p>
<p>Lately Pete Buttigieg has been urging us to spend less time online, more time IRL having face-to-face conversations. I think that’s right. There’s no doubt that the decline of social capital described in Robert Putnam’s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone">Bowling Alone</a> has accelerated in the 30 years since he wrote that book. America’s tragic polarization is a predictable outcome. Without the institutions and cultural traditions that once brought us together, face-to-face, in non-political ways, we’re all too vulnerable to being herded into competing online echo chambers that magnify our differences and erase our common humanity. </p>
<p>I won’t be abandoning my mediated and disembodied life online, but I do need to participate in it less and more critically, and prioritize my unmediated and embodied life IRL. The pendulum has swung too far away from the direct experience of shared reality, and that hasn’t been good for me nor for my country, </p>

<p>I quit Twitter in November 2022, when it became clear that Phony Stark would
take control of the company. No regrets; I’ve been active <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> since
then, via <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>, where I’ve enjoyed the Twitter ca. 2010 vibe.</p>
<p>But I hadn’t deleted my Tweets or my accounts until this week. The change was
finally triggered by the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/x-sees-largest-user-exodus-musk-takeover-rcna179793" title="X sees largest user exodus since Musk takeover">latest announcement</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>On Friday, X will adopt a new terms of service policy that for the first
time explicitly says all users agree to let their posts be used to train
artificial intelligence, like the company’s generative AI service, Grok.
Currently, X users can go to the site’s settings and opt out.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>I have no interest in feeding Grok or any other large language model. So this
week I deleted all my tweets and then my accounts. I tried to transfer my
personal username to a new, empty account, but in the second between changing
it and switching to another tab to take it, it was somehow acquired by an
account created in 2011 with no posts. Not sure how that worked. Pretty scummy.</p>
<p>So, just to be clear, anyone using these usernames on Twitter are not me
anymore:</p>

<p>Heute vor einem Jahr <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/durchbruch-im-europaeischen-parlament-piraten-feiern-klare-absage-an-chatkontrolle-und-garantie-sicherer-verschluesselung/">haben wir im Ausschuss für bürgerliche Freiheiten, Justiz und Inneres (LIBE) des EU-Parlaments eine fraktionsübergreifende Position gegen anlasslose Chatkontrolle beschlossen</a>. Damit haben wir den wahnwitzigen Überwachungsplänen eine Absage erteilt, welche die von der Leyen-EU-Kommission vorgelegt hat.</p>



<p>Neben dem Europäischen Parlament müssen die EU-Regierungen im Rat eine Position zu dem Gesetzentwurf beschließen. Schon drei Mal wurde die notwendige Mehrheit dort verfehlt. Sowohl die spanische Ratspräsidentschaft im Oktober 2023 als auch der belgische Vorsitz im Juni 2024 haben die Abstimmung über die Chatkontrolle kurzfristig von der Tagesordnung des Rats der EU genommen, als sich ein Scheitern bei der Abstimmung abgezeichnet hat – ein Riesenerfolg der Zivilgesellschaft.</p>



<p>Die Europäische Kommission wird gerade neu gebildet. Bisher tat EU-Innenkommissarin Ylva Johansson (S&amp;D, Schweden) als Mutter der Chatkontrolle alles, um ihr Vorhaben durchzuprügeln. Nun soll Magnus Brunner (EVP, Österreich) auf sie im Amt folgen und das Projekt weiterführen. Er hat in seinem Anhörungsverfahren gegenüber dem Europäischen Parlament auf die Frage der Piratin <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/de/197549/MARKETA_GREGOROVA/home">Markéta Gregorová</a> schon signalisiert, <a href="https://hearings.elections.europa.eu/documents/brunner/brunner_writtenquestionsandanswers_en.pdf">dass er die Verhandlungen zur Chatkontrolle zum Abschluss bringen will</a>. Ein Bekenntnis zum Schutz vor flächendeckender Chatkontrolle oder Schutz sicherer Verschlüsselung kam ihm nicht über die Lippen. Das ist ein Fehler: die EU-Kommission muss sich endgültig von Massenüberwachung verabschieden. Die anlasslose Chatkontrolle muss vom Tisch!</p>



<p>Im Europaparlament habe ich mich als euer Abgeordneter der Piratenpartei Deutschland federführend in den Verhandlungen eingesetzt, um die Chatkontrolle zu verhindern und auch die Abgeordneten der anderen Fraktionen in unzähligen Beratungen davon überzeugt. Heute trägt Markéta Gregorová für die europäischen Piraten die Fackel der Digitalen Freiheitskämpfer*innen im Europäischen Parlament weiter und setzt sich dort gegen die Chatkontrolle ein.</p>



<p>Im Rat der EU konnten wir bisher nur dank des unermüdlichen Engagements und des lautstarken Protests der Zivilgesellschaft totalitäre flächendeckende Chatkontrollen verhindern. Möglich war das dank jeder Aktivistin und jedem Einzelnen, die sich telefonisch, per E-Mail oder per Brief immer wieder an Politik und Regierung gewendet haben. Danke für euren Einsatz! Wir müssen stark bleiben und auch bei jedem weiteren Anlauf gegen die extreme und weltweit einzigartige Bedrohung des digitalen Briefgeheimnisses und sicherer Verschlüsselung durch die Chatkontrolle kämpfen!</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/pgconf-future-ecosystem/" title="PGConf.dev 2024">PGConf.dev report</a> a couple days ago, I mentioned that a few actionable
items came out of the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Developer_Unconference#Improving_extensions_in_core">Improving extensions in core</a> unconference session. One
was the need to document the heretofore unofficial policy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" title="Wikipedia: API">API</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" title="Wikipedia: Application binary interface">ABI</a>
stability between major and, especially, minor versions of Postgres.</p>
<p>A frequent topic at the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/extension-ecosystem-summit/" title="Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024">Extension Summit and Mini-Summits</a> and a number of
PCConf sessions has been concern regarding compatibility changes between minor
releases of Postgres. At <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/05/mini-summit-five/">Mini Summit Five</a>, for example, Yurii Rashkovskii
presented a few examples of such changes, leading him to conclude, along with
several others in the community, that C API-using extensions can only be used
when built against the minor release with which they’re used.</p>
<p>In the Unconference session, core committers reported that such changes are
carefully made, and rarely, if ever, affect extensions compiled for different
minor releases of the same major version. Furthermore, they carefully make
such changes to avoid compatibility issues. In <a href="https://x.com/petervgeoghegan/status/1785720228237717627" title="Peter Geoghegan on Twitter: You must be referring to my commit 714780dc…">the case Yurii
found</a>, for example, a field was added to a struct’s padding,
without affecting the ordering of other fields, thus minimizing the risk of
runtime failures.</p>
<p>It became clear that, although the committers follow a policy — and read new
committers into it via patch review — it’s not documented anywhere. The
result has been a bunch of sturm und drang amongst extension developer unsure
what level of compatibility to depend on and what changes to expect.</p>
<p>The week after the conference, I started a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> proposing to
document the committer policy. Following some discussion and review of
potential ABI breaks in minor releases, the consensus seemed to be that the
committers strive to avoid such breaks, that they’re quite uncommon in minor
releases, and that most of the reported issues were due to using more obscure
APIs.</p>
<p>As a result, we started drafting a policy, and after a few iterations, <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter
Eisentraut</a> pulled things together from the perspective of a core team member,
reframed as “Server API and ABI Guidance”. I converted it into a <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/48/5080/" title="Commitfest — Docs: API &amp; ABI Guidance">patch</a> (and
<a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a>) to add it to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: C-Language Functions">C Language docs</a>. A key statement on minor
releases:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>In general, extension code that compiles and works with a minor release
should also compile and work with any other minor release of the same major
version, past or future.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>I hope this document clarifies things. Even if it’s not as strict as some
might hope, it at least documents the project approach to compatibility, so we
have a better idea what to expect when using the C APIs. If you see gaps, or
you have additional questions, please respond to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> — or
the <a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a> (I’ll propagate comments to hackers).</p>
