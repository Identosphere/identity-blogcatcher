<p>
The new release of Steampipe is all about relationship graphs. Our <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-18-0">blog post</a> shows how these graphs provide contextual awareness for devops and security pros who can now see all the resources related to an EC2 instance, or determine at a glance whether the permissions related to an IAM role are properly scoped. As always, developers can explore and remix the code that builds these graphs to adapt them for their own purposes. And as always this is general-purpose tech that can be applied in any domain.</p>
<p>
These relationship graphs are driven by SQL queries that define nodes and edges. Such queries can use any column of any table provided by <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">any Steampipe plugin</a> to form nodes, and then edges between nodes. If you want to see connections among the people and objects represented by diverse APIs, you can now use SQL idioms to graph them. The only limit is your imagination.</p>
<p>
Naturally I imagined graphing Mastodon relationships. So far I’ve built two graphs that visualize my home timeline. Here’s the first one.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-from-selected-server.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Here we’re looking at the most recent 50 boosts (the Mastodon version of retweet) in my homeline. This is the query to find them.</p>
 select
  *
from
  mastodon_toot
where
  timeline = 'home'
  and reblog_server is not null
limit
  50
 
<p>
If we focus on Brian Marick we can see that:</p>
 
 Brian belongs to mastdn.social
  Brian boosted a post by Tim Bray
  Tim belongs to hachyderm.io
  
<p>
So this graph shows people on a selected server boosting people on other servers. In this case mastdn.social is the selected server, but we can refocus the graph on any other server that’s sending boosts. </p>
<p>
The second graph zooms out to show the web of boost relationships among servers. If anyone on infosec.exchange boosts anyone on mastodon.world, there’s an edge connecting the two nodes. Although it’s not happening anywhere in this graph, the arrow can point both ways and would if anyone on mastodon.world were also boosting anyone on infosec.exchange.	</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-server-to-server.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Let’s build up the first graph step by step. </p>
 Step 1: Identify the selected server 
<p>
Here’s the definition of the node that represents the selected server.</p>
 node {
  category = category.selected_server
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      server as id,
      server as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'server', server
      ) as properties
    from
        mastodon_boosts()
    where
        server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
Per the <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/node">documentation</a>, a node’s query must at least select a column aliased as id. Here it’s the server column in a row returned by the above query. I’ve packaged that query into a SQL function, mastodon_boosts, to hide details (timeline = 'home' reblog_server is not null limit 50) and make it easier to focus on what’s special about each node. In this case the special quality is the server column that gives the node its identity matches the selected server.</p>
<p>
If the <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/graph">graph</a> block includes only this node, and mastdn.social is the selected server, here is the rendering. Not much to see here yet!</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-1.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
The node defines a bag of properties that can be any of the columns returned by the underlying query; these appear when you hover the node. The node also refers to a category that governs the node’s icon, color, and link. Here’s the category for the selected server.</p>
 category "selected_server" {
  color = "darkgreen"
  icon = "server"
  href  = "https://{{.properties.'server'}}"
}
 
 Step 2: Identify boosted servers 
<p>
Now we’ll add boosted servers. This node uses the same set of records: the 50 most recent boosts in my feed. Again it finds just those whose server column matches the selected server. But the id is now the reblog_server which is the target, instead of the origin, of boosts from the selected server.</p>
 node {
  category = category.boosted_server
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      reblog_server as id,
      reblog_server as title
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
    EOQ
}
 
<p>
Here’s the graph with both selected_server and boosted_server nodes. We’ve used another category to differentiate the boosted nodes.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-2.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
There’s only one selected server but it can send boosts to more than one boosted server. The default rendering folds them into one node but you can click to unfold and see all of them.</p>
 Step 3: Identify people who boost others 
<p>
Where are the people? Let’s add them next, starting with the people who are sending boosts.</p>
 node {
  category = category.person
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      username as id,
      display_name as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'instance_qualified_account_url', instance_qualified_account_url
      ) as properties
    from
        mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-3.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
The username column gives the node its identity. Note also the property instance_qualified_account_url. That’s the synthetic column we added to the Mastodon plugin <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">last time</a> to ensure that links to people and toots will work properly in the Mastodon client. Because it’s included in a property here, and because category.person refers to that property, links representing people in the graph will resolve properly.</p>
 Step 4: Identify people who are boosted 
<p>
This node takes its identify from the reblog_username column, and uses the synthetic column instance_qualified_reblog_url to provide the link.</p>
 node {
  category = category.boosted_person
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      reblog_username as id,
      reblog_username as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'instance_qualified_reblog_url', instance_qualified_reblog_url
      ) as properties
    from
        mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-4.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Step 5: Connect boosters on the selected server to that server 
<p>
So far we’ve seen only nodes, whose queries minimally return the id property. An <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/edge">edge</a> connects nodes by way of a query that minimally returns columns aliased to from_id and to_id. </p>
 edge {
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      username as from_id,
      server as to_id,
      'belongs to' as title
    ) as properties
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
You’ll also want to provide a title to label the edge. Here this edge occurs twice to represent “John Mashey belongs to mstdn.social” and “Brian Marick belongs to mstdn.social.”</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-5.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Step 6: Connect people on boosted servers to their servers 
<p>
This edge works the same way, but captures the relationship between boosted people and their servers.</p>
 edge {
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      reblog_username as from_id,
      reblog_server as to_id,
      'belongs to' as title
    from
        mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-6.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Step 7: Connect boosters to the people they boost 
<p>
Finally we add an edge to connect boosters to the people they boost.</p>
 edge {
  category = category.boost
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      username as from_id,
      reblog_username as to_id,
      'boosts' as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'reblog_username', reblog_username,
        'reblog_server', reblog_server,
        'content', reblog -&gt;&gt; 'content'
      ) as properties
    from
        mastodon_boosts()
    where
        server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
And now we’ve completed the first graph shown above.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-7.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Graphing GitHub relationships 
<p>
You can use this grammar of nodes and edges to describe relationships in any domain. Here’s a graph that looks across all the Steampipe-related repos and shows recently-updated PRs from external contributors.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-github-external-prs.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
And here’s one that uses <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">any Steampipe plugin</a> to show recently-updated pull requests for a selected repo. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-github-mod-pr-updates.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
These two views share a common SQL query and serve complementary purposes. The table is handy for sorting by date or author, the graph highlights one-to-many relationships.</p>
 Lifting the burden of context assembly 
<p>
In <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2670157/what-timedance-got-right.html">What TimeDance got right</a> I mourned the passing of a tool for scheduling meetings that had excelled at bringing together the messages and documents related to a meeting. I called this “context assembly” — a term I’d picked up from Jack Ozzie, cofounder of Groove, another collaboration tool whose passing I mourn. Context assembly is hard work. Too often the burden falls on people who only need to use that context and would rather not spend time and effort creating it.</p>
<p>
We’ve seen how SQL can <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3648648/how-sql-can-unify-access-to-apis.html">unify access to APIs</a>. Now it can also help us see relationships among the data we extract from those APIs.</p>

<p>The article looks at the different way a Microsoft Graph application client can be implemented and secured in an ASP.NET Core application or a .NET application. This type of client is intended for applications or application logic where no user is involved. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftGraphAppToAppSecurity">https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftGraphAppToAppSecurity</a></p>



<p>Accessing Microsoft Graph can be initialized for app-to-app (application permissions) security in three different ways. The flows can only be used in a trusted host. The different implementation types are as follows:</p>



 
 Using Managed Identities 



 Using Azure SDK and Graph SDK directly with client credentials 



 Using Microsoft.Identity.Client and MSAL to acquire an access token which can be used directly against Microsoft Graph or using GraphServiceClient with the DelegateAuthenticationProvider class 
 



 Using Managed Identities 



<p>Using managed identities for the Azure deployments is the most secure of the three ways to implement this client. This is because no secret or certificates are shared and so cannot be abused and there is no need for secret rotation. </p>



 Setup 



<p>We use a web application deployed to an Azure App Service to setup the security. A managed identity is created for this Azure resource. If the Azure App Service is deleted, so is the managed identity and the assigned Graph roles. Only this Azure resource can use the managed identity. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Once the Azure resource is created, the Graph App roles can be assigned to the managed identity.</p>



 Powershell scripting 



<p>I created the Powershell script using a blog from Microsoft. This powershell script finds the managed identity and assigns the User.Read.All application permission to the managed identity.</p>


  $TenantID = "&lt;your-tenant-id&gt;"
$DisplayNameServicePrincpal ="&lt;your-azure-app-registration-or-other-azure-resource&gt;"
$GraphAppId = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
$PermissionName = "User.Read.All"

Connect-AzureAD -TenantId $TenantID

$sp = (Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq '$DisplayNameServicePrincpal'")

Write-Host $sp

$GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$GraphAppId'"

$AppRole = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles | Where-Object {$_.Value -eq $PermissionName -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"}

New-AzureAdServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId $sp.ObjectId -PrincipalId $sp.ObjectId -ResourceId $GraphServicePrincipal.ObjectId -Id $AppRole.Id
  


<p>This can be checked in the Azure portal using the Enterprise applications blade and filtering for managed identities.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The permissions contains the Graph User.Read.All application permission.</p>







<p></p>



 Implementing the client 



<p>The client is implemented using Azure.Identity and Graph SDK. We have two setups, one for the production and all other Azure deployments and one for development. The managed identity is used everywhere except the dev deployments and only this can be used. The local dev uses an Azure App registration with the client credentials flow. The GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentity method returns the  GraphServiceClient Graph SDK client setup for the correct deployment. The correct ChainedTokenCredential is used to secure the client. It is important that only the correct managed identity for the exact resource can be used in production. No secret or certificates is required for this solution, the managed identity and Azure takes care of this. The GraphServiceClient is for the application and handles the HttpClient creation so the service is created as a singleton.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Graph;

namespace GraphManagedIdentity;

public class GraphApplicationClientService
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    private readonly IHostEnvironment _environment;
    private GraphServiceClient? _graphServiceClient;

    public GraphApplicationClientService(IConfiguration configuration, IHostEnvironment environment)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
        _environment = environment;
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// gets a singleton instance of the GraphServiceClient
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
    public GraphServiceClient GetGraphClientWithManagedIdentityOrDevClient()
    {
        if (_graphServiceClient != null)
            return _graphServiceClient;

        string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };

        var chainedTokenCredential = GetChainedTokenCredentials();
        _graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(chainedTokenCredential, scopes);

        return _graphServiceClient;
    }

    private ChainedTokenCredential GetChainedTokenCredentials()
    {
        if (!_environment.IsDevelopment())
        {
            return new ChainedTokenCredential(new ManagedIdentityCredential());
        }
        else // dev env
        {
            var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];
            var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
            var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

            var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
            {
                AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
            };

            // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
            var devClientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
                tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

            var chainedTokenCredential = new ChainedTokenCredential(devClientSecretCredential);

            return chainedTokenCredential;
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The service is added to the IoC and can be used anywhere in the application. Once deployed, the managed identity is used, otherwise the dev setup runs.</p>


  builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;GraphApplicationClientService&gt;();
builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;AadGraphSdkApplicationClient&gt;();
  


<p>I use it in a service then:</p>


  using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets;
using Microsoft.Graph;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

namespace GraphClientCrendentials;

public class AadGraphSdkApplicationClient
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    private readonly GraphApplicationClientService _graphService;

    public AadGraphSdkApplicationClient(IConfiguration configuration, GraphApplicationClientService graphService)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
        _graphService = graphService;
    }

    public async Task&lt;int&gt; GetUsersAsync()
    {
        var graphServiceClient = _graphService.GetGraphClientWithClientSecretCredential();

        IGraphServiceUsersCollectionPage users = await graphServiceClient.Users
            .Request()
            .GetAsync();

        return users.Count;
    }
}
  


 Dev setup 



<p>An Azure App registration is used to implement the OAuth client credentials flow and uses the Graph SDK client in development. The Graph application is added to the single tenant Azure App registration. An enterprise application is created from this.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The ChainedTokenCredential uses the app.settings and the user secrets to configure the client. The client uses the OAuth client credentials flow to acquire an access token. I normally use secrets for development for simplicity but if more security is required, a certificate can be used and the secret/certificate can be used directly from an Azure KeyVault.</p>


    "AzureAd": {
    "TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
    "ClientId": "3606b25d-f670-4bab-ab70-437460143d89"
    //"ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
    //"CertificateName": "[Or instead of client secret: Enter here the name of a certificate (from the user cert store) as registered with your application]",
    //"Certificate": {
    //  "SourceType": "KeyVault",
    //  "KeyVaultUrl": "&lt;VaultUri&gt;",
    //  "KeyVaultCertificateName": "&lt;CertificateName&gt;"
    //}
  },
  


 Using Azure SDK and Graph SDK directly 



<p>A Microsoft Graph client can be setup to to use the client credentials flow to initialize the Graph SDK GraphServiceClient. This is a good way of creating the OAuth client credentials flow if it is used outside the Azure tenant. It is recommended to use a certificate and this is normally stored in an Azure Key Vault. This uses the OAuth client credentials flow and uses the client assertions to acquire a new access token. </p>



<p></p>



<p>The flow can be setup to use a secret:</p>


  private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClientWithClientSecretCredential()
{
	string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
	var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
	var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

	// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
	var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

	return new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
}
  


<p>Or setup to use a certificate:</p>


  private async Task&lt;GraphServiceClient&gt; GetGraphClientWithClientCertificateCredentialAsync()
{
	string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
	var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");

	var certififacte = await GetCertificateAsync();
	var clientCertificateCredential = new ClientCertificateCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, certififacte, options);

	// var clientCertificatePath = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:CertificateName");
	// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientcertificatecredential?view=azure-dotnet
	// var clientCertificateCredential = new ClientCertificateCredential(
	//    tenantId, clientId, clientCertificatePath, options);

	return new GraphServiceClient(clientCertificateCredential, scopes);
}

private async Task&lt;X509Certificate2&gt; GetCertificateAsync()
{
	var identifier = _configuration["AzureAd:ClientCertificates:0:KeyVaultCertificateName"];

	if (identifier == null)
		throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(identifier));

	var vaultBaseUrl = _configuration["AzureAd:ClientCertificates:0:KeyVaultUrl"];
	if(vaultBaseUrl == null)
		throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(vaultBaseUrl));

	var secretClient = new SecretClient(vaultUri: new Uri(vaultBaseUrl), credential: new DefaultAzureCredential());

	// Create a new secret using the secret client.
	var secretName = identifier;
	//var secretVersion = "";
	KeyVaultSecret secret = await secretClient.GetSecretAsync(secretName);

	var privateKeyBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(secret.Value);

	var certificateWithPrivateKey = new X509Certificate2(privateKeyBytes,
		string.Empty, X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet);

	return certificateWithPrivateKey;
}
  


<p>I usually use a secret for development and a certificate for production.</p>



 Using Microsoft.Identity.Client and MSAL 



<p>A third way of implementing the Graph client is to use Microsoft.Identity.Client or Microsoft.Identity.Web. This uses the ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder to create a new IConfidentialClientApplication instance and can use a secret or a certificate to acquire the access token. </p>



<p>Microsoft.Identity.Client with a secret:</p>


   var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
    .WithClientSecret(config.ClientSecret)
    .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
    .Build();

app.AddInMemoryTokenCache();
  


<p>or with a certificate and client assertions:</p>


   var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
    .WithCertificate(certificate)
    .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
    .Build(); 
  
app.AddInMemoryTokenCache();
  


<p>The GraphServiceClient can be created using the DelegateAuthenticationProvider. As I understand you should avoid using the DelegateAuthenticationProvider if possible.</p>


  GraphServiceClient graphServiceClient =
    new GraphServiceClient("https://graph.microsoft.com/V1.0/", 
        new DelegateAuthenticationProvider(async (requestMessage) =&gt;
        {
            // Retrieve an access token for Microsoft Graph (gets a fresh token if needed).
            AuthenticationResult result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes)
                .ExecuteAsync();

            // Add the access token in the Authorization header of the API request.
            requestMessage.Headers.Authorization =
                new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);
        }));
}
  


 Notes 



<p>There are three different ways of creating Microsoft Graph application clients and it is sometimes hard to understand when you should use which. This is not for the delegated clients. In an ASP.NET Core application you would use Microsoft.Identity.Web for a delegated client which then uses Microsoft Graph on behalf of the user. System assigned managed identities do not require managing secrets or certificates but can only be used in the same tenant. The client credentials flow can be used from anywhere. Microsoft recommends using certificates when using the client credentials flow. </p>

<p>“The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying, “You’re too this, or I’m too this.” That judging mind comes in. And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.</p>

<p><a href="https://songwhip.com/public-image-ltd/hawaii">This is nothing like a PiL track</a>. It is also nothing like a John Lydon track. That said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Public Image Ltd. (PiL) have been selected for the 67th annual Eurovision Song Contest airing on February 3. The band will represent Ireland with their new single ‘Hawaii.’.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/john-lydon-dedicates-eurovision-entry-hawaii-to-wife-3380808">NME</a> and <a href="https://americansongwriter.com/former-sex-pistol-john-lydon-enters-eurovision-pil-song-hawaii/">American Songwriter</a> are both ‘kind of saying’ that;</p>
<p></p>Public Image Ltd are representing Ireland in the next Eurovision song contest.<p></p>
<p>‘kind of’ because i THINK that there is an Irish ‘run off’ in February before the final decision to compete in May(?)
<a href="https://americansongwriter.com/former-sex-pistol-john-lydon-enters-eurovision-pil-song-hawaii/">This article</a> is one of many providing a little back story to the song.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The song … is a love letter to Lydon’s wife. Nora Forster, Lydon’s wife of nearly 45 years (who) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It goes on ..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A deeply personal track for Lydon, ‘Hawaii’ is sobering reflection of the couple’s life together. The song is punctuated by one of their most special memories, a trip they once took together. Some begin again / We’re here / You and me … Remember me / I remember you / Hawaii. Written by Lydon, “Hawaii” professes the power of love through the good and the most traumatic of times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All good. No problem. Sorry to read about his wife’s diagnosis. The song is nice enough - though to these untrained ears a little schmaltzy - if not to say ‘derivative’ - as in ever since Elvis went to Hawaii, songwriters have been picking up their instruments and writing <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/the-best-songs-with-hawaii-in-the-title/ranker-music">yet another song about Hawaii</a>. John is no different.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing</p>
<p>1] Lydon was born in London. Yes to Irish parents (and holds an Irish passport) but he also has American citizenship and is on record as saying “I view myself as British first and foremost.”</p>
<p>Let me take you back to Eurovision ’81. The winner? Buck’s Fizz, with a song called ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4-lKMGII_k">Making Your Mind Up</a>’ .. maybe John should acquaint himself with a little Eurovision history and decide who he is.</p>
<p>2] An entire song called Hawaii - whoever thought of doing that … <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/the-best-songs-with-hawaii-in-the-title/ranker-music">oh wait</a> - to represent IRELAND - the home of some of the greatest writers and musicians in the world. Is there really not a real Irish choice?</p>
<p>Fun fact - Ireland is the ONLY entry ever to win the competition twice with the same singer songwriter - not only that,he wrote a third song … that also won.</p>
<p>3] The chintzy Hawaiian sound does a massive disservice to the real music that emerges from those islands.</p>
<p>Just on Maui … there are superb professional musicians that I know, including;</p>
<p>🔸 <a href="http://randallrospond.com">Randall Rospond</a><br>
🔸 <a href="https://mauitomcat.com">Tom Conway</a><br>
🔸 <a href="http://www.gailswanson.com">Gail Swanson</a><br>
🔸 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jamiegallomusic/">Jamie Gallo</a> (sorry - Facebook link)<br>
🔸 <a href="https://vinceesquire.com">Vince Esquire</a><br>
🔸 <a href="https://kanekoa.live">Kanekoa</a></p>
<p>Not to mention Alana Cini, Joel Katz, Peter Kater, Chris Sendrey, John Grover and so many others I know and love - and even that list doesn’t include even more famous musical residents like</p>
<p>🔸 Willie Nelson<br>
🔸 Lukas Nelson<br>
🔸 Alice Cooper<br>
🔸 Mick Fleetwood<br>
🔸 Lily Meola<br>
🔸 Steven Tyler<br>
🔸 Kris Kristoferson (I think - he certainly used to.)</p>
<p>None of them … NONE .. produce music that the world associates with that Hawaiian sound. Even a ‘Ukulele band like Kanekoa play their Ukuleles less like Tiny Tim and more like well - Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>Kanekoa : <a href="https://kanekoa.live/music/">Going to California</a></p>
<p>Led Zeppelin :  <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/_/Going+to+California">Going to California - </a></p>
<p>I don’t dislike his song - but I really hope somebody Irish with Irish music wins the chance to represent their country and that yet another piece of misappropriated Hawaiiana is stopped from taking the world by storm.</p>

   If you've spent any time with GPT-3 or ChatGPT, you've likely thought about how useful it would be if you could point them at a specific, current collection of text or documentation and have it use that as part of its input for answering questions. 
 It turns out there is a neat trick for doing exactly that. I've been experimenting with it using my Datasette web application as a rapid prototyping

  <p>If you've spent any time with GPT-3 or ChatGPT, you've likely thought about how useful it would be if you could point them at a specific, current collection of text or documentation and have it use that as part of its input for answering questions.</p>
<p>It turns out there is a neat trick for doing exactly that. I've been experimenting with it using my <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> web application as a rapid prototyping platform for trying out new AI techniques using custom SQL functions.</p>
<p>Here's how to do this:</p>
 
 Run a text search (or a semantic search, described later) against your documentation to find content that looks like it could be relevant to the user's question 
 Grab extracts of that content and glue them all together into a blob of text 
 Construct a prompt consisting of that text followed by "Given the above content, answer the following question: " and the user's question 
 Send the whole thing through <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions">the GPT-3 API</a> and see what comes back 
 
<p>I've been calling this the semantic search answers pattern.</p>
<p>This is a form of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/promptengineering/">prompt engineering</a> (and hence is prone to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/">prompt injection attacks</a>, so bear that in mind). You need to fit your overall prompt into the token limit for GPT-3, which is currently 4,000 tokens. A token is more-or-less the same thing as a word.</p>
<p>Since publishing this post I've been pointed to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb">Question Answering using Embeddings</a> notebook in the OpenAI cookbook which describes this exact same technique.</p>
<p>In this post I'll show how I implemented this pattern using SQLite, Datasette and some custom SQL functions and tools written in Python.</p>
 First, some demos 
<p>I've implemented this pattern against my blog - 3,000 posts going back over twenty years. I built it using some custom SQLite SQL functions that call the OpenAI APIs.</p>
<p>First, some examples of questions and answers I ran against my blog:</p>
<p>What does shot scraper do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shot-scraper is a command-line tool that helps automate the process of taking screenshots of web pages and scraping data from them using JavaScript. It can be used to take one-off screenshots or take multiple screenshots in a repeatable way by defining them in a YAML file. It can also be used to execute JavaScript on a page and return the resulting value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a> is a tool I released in 2022 - after the 2021 GPT-3 training cut-off date. This is a very good summary - better I think than anything I've written about <code>shot-scraper</code> myself.</p>
<p>What museums has Simon been to?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simon has been to the Pitt Rivers museum, the British Museum, the Science Museum, the Natural History Museum, the V&amp;A, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Pioneer Museum in Paso Robles. He has also seen the Giant Squid at the Natural History Museum and Charles Darwin's collection at the spirit building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is entirely correct, though I've talked about a lot more museums than that on my blog.</p>
<p>What are some unconventional things you can do with GitHub Actions?</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Create dynamic content for GitHub repository templates using cookiecutter and GitHub Actions 
 Automate repetitive tasks like code linting, testing, and deployment using GitHub Actions 
 Run scheduled scrapers in GitHub Actions 
 Use GitHub Actions to trigger a webhook call when a repository is forked 
 Create an automated issue-tracking system with GitHub Issues and GitHub Actions 
 Automatically extract captions and transcripts from online videos using Whisper and GitHub Actions. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Some of my relevant posts:</p>
 
 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/28/dynamic-github-repository-templates/">Dynamic content for GitHub repository templates using cookiecutter and GitHub Actions</a> 
 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping: track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository</a> 
 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/30/action-transcription/">A tool to run caption extraction against online videos using Whisper and GitHub Issues/Actions</a> 
 
<p>I've never written anything about triggering webhook calls or issue-tracking systems though, so 4 and 5 in that list are a little suspicious.</p>
<p>What is the big grey box at the top of the utility pole? What does it do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big grey box at the top of the utility pole is likely a transformer. Transformers are used to step down the voltage of electricity from the high-voltage lines that run along the pole to the lower-voltage lines that are used to provide electricity to homes and businesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm including this example because I've never written anything even remotely related to transformers and utility poles on my blog. This demonstrates that in the lack of useful context GPT-3 will answer the question entirely by itself - which may or may not be what you want from this system.</p>
 Try this out yourself 
<p>If you want to try this out yourself you'll need to get your own API key from OpenAI. I don't want to foot the bill for people using my blog as a free source of GPT-3 prompt answers!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://beta.openai.com/signup">sign up for one here</a>. I believe they are still running a free trial period.</p>
<p>Now head over to this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/answer_question?_hide_sql=1">https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/answer_question?_hide_sql=1</a></p>
<p>You'll need to paste in your OpenAI key. I am not logging these anywhere, and the form stores these in a cookie in order to avoid transmitting it over a GET query string where it could be accidentally logged somewhere.</p>
<p>Then type in your question and see what comes back!</p>
<p>Let's talk about how this all works - in a whole lot of detail.</p>
 Semantic search using embeddings 
<p>You can implement the first step of this sequence using any search engine you like - but there's a catch: we are encouraging users here to ask questions, which increases the chance that they might include text in their prompt which doesn't exactly match documents in our index.</p>
<p>"What are the key features of Datasette?" for example might miss blog entries that don't include the word "feature" even though they describe functionality of the software in detail.</p>
<p>What we want here is semantic search - we want to find documents that match the meaning of the user's search term, even if the matching keywords are not present.</p>
<p>OpenAI have a less well-known API that can help here, which had a big upgrade (and major price reduction) <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model/">back in December</a>: their embedding model.</p>
<p>An embedding is a list of floating point numbers.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a latitude/longitude location: it's a list of two floating point numbers. You can use those numbers to find other nearby points by calculating distances between them.</p>
<p>Add a third number and now you can plot locations in three dimensional space - and still calculate distances between them to find the closest points.</p>
<p>This idea keeps on working even as we go beyond three dimensions: you can calculate distances between vectors of any length, no matter how many dimensions they have.</p>
<p>So if we can represent some text in a many-multi-dimensional vector space, we can calculate distances between those vectors to find the closest matches.</p>
<p>The OpenAI embedding model lets you take any string of text (up to a ~8,000 word length limit) and turn that into a list of 1,536 floating point numbers. We'll call this list the "embedding" for the text.</p>
<p>These numbers are derived from a sophisticated language model. They take a vast amount of knowledge of human language and flatten that down to a list of floating point numbers - at 4 bytes per floating point number that's 4*1,536 = 6,144 bytes per embedding - 6KiB.</p>
<p>The distance between two embeddings represents how semantically similar the text is to each other.</p>
<p>The two most obvious applications of this are search and similarity scores.</p>
<p>Take a user's search term. Calculate its embedding. Now find the distance between that embedding and every pre-calculated embedding in a corpus and return the 10 closest results.</p>
<p>Or for document similarity: calculate embeddings for every document in a collection, then look at each one in turn and find the closest other embeddings: those are the documents that are most similar to it.</p>
<p>For my semantic search answers implementation, I use an embedding-based semantic search as the first step to find the best matches for the question. I then assemble these top 5 matches into the prompt to pass to GPT-3.</p>
 Calculating embeddings 
<p>Embeddings can be calculated from text using <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings">the OpenAI embeddings API</a>. It's really easy to use:</p>
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": "Your text string goes here",
       "model":"text-embedding-ada-002"}'  
<p>The documentation doesn't mention this, but you can pass a list of strings (<a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/777c1c3de1a9cfc0a33e6376cc09b9badbb9cdf9/openai/embeddings_utils.py#L43">up to 2048</a> according to the official Python library source code) as <code>"input"</code> to run embeddings in bulk:</p>
  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": ["First string", "Second string", "Third string"],
       "model":"text-embedding-ada-002"}'  
<p>The returned data from this API looks like this:</p>
  {
  "data": [
    {
      "embedding": [
        -0.006929283495992422,
        -0.005336422007530928,
        ...
        -4.547132266452536e-05,
        -0.024047505110502243
      ],
      "index": 0,
      "object": "embedding"
    }
  ]  
<p>As expected, it's a list of 1,536 floating point numbers.</p>
<p>I've been storing embeddings as a binary string that appends all of the floating point numbers together, using their 4-byte representation.</p>
<p>Here are the tiny Python functions I've been using for doing that:</p>
 import struct

def decode(blob):
    return struct.unpack("f" * 1536, blob)

def encode(values):
    return struct.pack("f" * 1536, *values) 
<p>I then store them in SQLite <code>blob</code> columns in my database.</p>
<p>I wrote a custom tool for doing this, called <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/openai-to-sqlite">openai-to-sqlite</a>. I can run it like this:</p>
  openai-to-sqlite embeddings simonwillisonblog.db \
  --sql 'select id, title, body from blog_entry' \
  --table blog_entry_embeddings  
<p>This concatenates together the <code>title</code> and <code>body</code> columns from that table, runs them through the OpenAI embeddings API and stores the results in a new table called <code>blog_entry_embeddings</code> with the following schema:</p>
  CREATE TABLE [blog_entry_embeddings] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [embedding] BLOB
)  
<p>I can join this against the <code>blog_entry</code> table by ID later on.</p>
 Finding the closest matches 
<p>The easiest way to calculate similarity between two embedding arrays is to use cosine similarity. A simple Python function for that looks like this:</p>
 def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    dot_product = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    magnitude_a = sum(x * x for x in a) ** 0.5
    magnitude_b = sum(x * x for x in b) ** 0.5
    return dot_product / (magnitude_a * magnitude_b) 
<p>You can brute-force find the top matches for a table by executing that comparison for every row and returning the ones with the highest score.</p>
<p>I added this to my <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-openai">datasette-openai</a> Datasette plugin as a custom SQL function called <code>openai_embedding_similarity()</code>. Here's a query that uses it:</p>
  with input as (
  select
    embedding
  from
    blog_entry_embeddings
  where
    id = :entry_id
),
top_n as (
  select
    id,
    openai_embedding_similarity(
      blog_entry_embeddings.embedding,
      input.embedding
    ) as score
  from
    blog_entry_embeddings,
    input
  order by
    score desc
  limit
    20
)
select
  score,
  blog_entry.id,
  blog_entry.title
from
  blog_entry
  join top_n on blog_entry.id = top_n.id  
<p><a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog?sql=with+input+as+%28%0D%0A++select%0D%0A++++embedding%0D%0A++from%0D%0A++++blog_entry_embeddings%0D%0A++where%0D%0A++++id+%3D+%3Aentry_id%0D%0A%29%2C%0D%0Atop_n+as+%28%0D%0A++select%0D%0A++++id%2C%0D%0A++++openai_embedding_similarity%28%0D%0A++++++blog_entry_embeddings.embedding%2C%0D%0A++++++input.embedding%0D%0A++++%29+as+score%0D%0A++from%0D%0A++++blog_entry_embeddings%2C%0D%0A++++input%0D%0A++order+by%0D%0A++++score+desc%0D%0A++limit%0D%0A++++20%0D%0A%29%0D%0Aselect%0D%0A++score%2C%0D%0A++blog_entry.id%2C%0D%0A++blog_entry.title%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++blog_entry%0D%0A++join+top_n+on+blog_entry.id+%3D+top_n.id&amp;entry_id=7977">Try that out here</a>.</p>
<p>This takes as input the ID of one of my blog entries and returns a list of the other entries, ordered by their similarity score.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is pretty slow! It takes over 1.3s to run against all 3,000 embeddings in my blog.</p>
<p>I did some research and found that a highly regarded solutions for fast vector similarity calculations is <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">FAISS</a>, by Facebook AI research. It has neat Python bindings and can be installed using <code>pip install faiss-cpu</code> (the <code>-gpu</code> version requires a GPU).</p>
<p>FAISS works against an in-memory index. My blog's Datasette instance uses the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/">baked data</a> pattern which means the entire thing is re-deployed any time the data changes - as such, I can spin up an in-memory index once on startup without needing to worry about updating the index continually as rows in the database change.</p>
<p>So I built another plugin to do that: <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-faiss">datasette-faiss</a> - which can be configured to build an in-memory FAISS index against a configured table on startup, and can then be queried using another custom SQL function.</p>
<p>Here's the related entries query from above rewritten to use the FAISS index:</p>
  with input as (
  select
    embedding
  from
    blog_entry_embeddings
  where
    id = :entry_id
),
top_n as (
  select value as id from json_each(
    faiss_search(
      'simonwillisonblog',
      'blog_entry_embeddings',
      input.embedding,
      20
    )
  ), input
)
select
  blog_entry.id,
  blog_entry.title
from
  blog_entry
  join top_n on blog_entry.id = top_n.id  
<p><a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog?sql=with+input+as+%28%0D%0A++select%0D%0A++++embedding%0D%0A++from%0D%0A++++blog_entry_embeddings%0D%0A++where%0D%0A++++id+%3D+%3Aentry_id%0D%0A%29%2C%0D%0Atop_n+as+%28%0D%0A++select+value+as+id+from+json_each%28%0D%0A++++faiss_search%28%0D%0A++++++%27simonwillisonblog%27%2C%0D%0A++++++%27blog_entry_embeddings%27%2C%0D%0A++++++input.embedding%2C%0D%0A++++++20%0D%0A++++%29%0D%0A++%29%2C+input%0D%0A%29%0D%0Aselect%0D%0A++blog_entry.id%2C%0D%0A++blog_entry.title%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++blog_entry%0D%0A++join+top_n+on+blog_entry.id+%3D+top_n.id&amp;entry_id=7977">This one runs</a> in 4.8ms!</p>
<p><code>faiss_search(database_name, table_name, embedding, n)</code> returns a JSON array of the top <code>n</code> IDs from the specified embeddings table, based on distance scores from the provided <code>embedding</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>json_each()</code> trick here is a workaround for the fact that Python's SQLite driver doesn't yet provide an easy way to write table-valued functions - SQL functions that return something in the shape of a table.</p>
<p>Instead, I use <code>json_each()</code> to turn the string JSON array of IDs from <code>datasette_faiss()</code> into a table that I can run further joins against.</p>
 Implementing semantic search with embeddings 
<p>So far we've just seen embeddings used for finding similar items. Let's implement semantic search, using a user-provided query.</p>
<p>This is going to need an API key again, because it involves a call to OpenAI to run embeddings against the user's search query.</p>
<p>Here's the SQL query:</p>
  select
  value,
  blog_entry.title,
  substr(blog_entry.body, 0, 500)
from
  json_each(
    faiss_search(
      'simonwillisonblog',
      'blog_entry_embeddings',
      (
        select
          openai_embedding(:query, :_cookie_openai_api_key)
      ),
      10
    )
  )
  join blog_entry on value = blog_entry.id
  where length(coalesce(:query, '')) &gt; 0  
<p><a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog/embedding_search">Try that here</a> (with extra some cosmetic tricks.)</p>
<p>We're using a new function here: <code>openai_embedding()</code> - which takes some text and an API key and returns an embedding for that text.</p>
<p>The API key comes from <code>:_cookie_openai_api_key</code> - this is a special Datasette mechanism called <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#magic-parameters">magic parameters</a> which can read variables from cookies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cookies-for-magic-parameters">datasette-cookies-for-magic-parameters</a> plugin notices these and turns them into an interface for the user to populate the cookies with, decsribed earlier.</p>
<p>One last trick: adding <code>where length(coalesce(:query, '')) &gt; 0</code> to the query means that the query won't run if the user hasn't entered any text into the search box.</p>
 Constructing a prompt from semantic search query results 
<p>Getting back to our semantic search answers pattern.</p>
<p>We need a way to construct a prompt for GPT-3 using the results of our semantic search query.</p>
<p>There's one big catch: GPT-3 has a length limit, and it's strictly enforced. If you pass even one token over that limit you'll get an error.</p>
<p>We want to use as much material from the top five search results as possible, leaving enough space for the rest of the prompt (the user's question and our own text) and the prompt response.</p>
<p>I ended up solving this with another custom SQL function:</p>
  select openai_build_prompt(content, 'Context:
------------
', '
------------
Given the above context, answer the following question: ' || :question,
  500
  ) from search_results  
<p>This function works as an aggregate function - it takes a table of results and returns a single string.</p>
<p>It takes the column to aggregate - in this case <code>content</code> - as the first argument. Then it takes a prefix and a suffix, which are concatenated together with the aggregated content in the middle.</p>
<p>The third argument is the number of tokens to allow for the response.</p>
<p>The function then attempts to truncate each of the input values to the maximum length that will still allow them all to be concatenated together while staying inside that 4,000 token limit.</p>
 Adding it all together 
<p>With all of the above in place, the following query is my full implementation of semantic search answers against my blog:</p>
  with query as (
  select
    openai_embedding(:question, :_cookie_openai_api_key) as q
),
top_n as (
  select
    value
  from json_each(
    faiss_search(
      'simonwillisonblog',
      'blog_entry_embeddings',
      (select q from query),
      5
    )
  )
  where length(coalesce(:question, '')) &gt; 0
),
texts as (
  select 'Created: ' || created || ', Title: ' || title || 
  ', Body: ' || openai_strip_tags(body) as text
  from blog_entry where id in (select value from top_n)
),
prompt as (
  select openai_build_prompt(text, 'Context:
------------
', '
------------
Given the above context, answer the following question: ' || :question,
  500
  ) as prompt from texts
)
select
  'Response' as title,
  openai_davinci(
    prompt,
    500,
    0.7,
    :_cookie_openai_api_key
  ) as value
  from prompt
  where length(coalesce(:question, '')) &gt; 0
union all
select
  'Prompt' as title,
  prompt from prompt  
<p>As you can see, I really like using CTEs (the <code>with name as (...)</code> pattern) to assemble complex queries like this.</p>
<p>The <code>texts as ...</code> CTE is where I strip HTML tags from my content (using another custom function from the <code>datasete-openai</code> plugin called <code>openai_strip_tags()</code>) and assemble it along with the <code>Created</code> and <code>Title</code> metadata. Adding these gave the system a better chance of answering questions like "When did Natalie and Simon get married?" with the correct year.</p>
<p>The last part of this query uses a handy debugging trick: it returns two rows via a <code>union all</code> - the first has a <code>Response</code> label and shows the response from GPT-3, while the second has a <code>Prompt</code> label and shows the prompt that I passed to the model.</p>
<p></p>

<p>There are so many ways to improve this system.</p>
 
 Smarter prompt design. My prompt here is the first thing that I got to work - I'm certain there are all kinds of tricks that could be used to make this more effective. 
 Better selection of the content to include in the prompt. I'm using embedding search but then truncating to the first portion: a smarter implementation would attempt to crop out the most relevant parts of each entry, maybe by using embeddings against smaller chunks of text.
 
   Yoz <a href="https://mastodon.social/@yoz/109684742557484622">tipped me off</a> to <a href="https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">GPT Index</a>, a project which aims to solve this exact problem by using a pre-trained LLM to help summarize text to better fit in a prompt used for these kinds of queries. 
 Spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/theseamouse/status/1614453236349693953">this idea</a> from Hassan Hayat: "don't embed the question when searching. Ask GPT-3 to generate a fake answer, embed this answer, and use this to search". 
 
 
 Hold out for GPT-4: I've heard rumours that the next version of the model will have a significantly larger token limit, which should result in much better results from this mechanism. 
 
 Want my help implementing this? 
<p>I plan to use this pattern to add semantic search and semantic search answers to my <a href="https://datasette.cloud/">Datasette Cloud</a> SaaS platform. <a href="https://forms.gle/mbMZFKpK2kEY7t8C6">Please get in touch</a> if this sounds like a feature that could be relevant to your organization.</p>

<p>[Update: 3:34 PM Monday 16 January] Two news stories:</p>
 
 Edhat: <a href="https://www.edhat.com/news/gibraltar-road-damage">Gibraltar Road Damage</a>., by Edhat staff, Januraly 11, 2023 12:30 PM. It’s a collection of revealing Gibraltar Road photos that I wish I had seen earlier. Apologies for that. This is the text of the whole story: “A resident of Gibraltar Road shared the below photos from the recent storm damage. A section of the road appears to be washed out with a Tesla trapped under some debris.&nbsp;A resident of Gibraltar Road shared the below photos from the recent storm damage. A section of the road appears to be washed out with a Tesla trapped under some debris.&nbsp;The Tesla slide is located approximately a quarter mile past the Rattlesnake Canyon trailhead and the washed road is about a mile past the radio tower before reaching the west fork trailhead.” If “mile past” means going uphill toward East Camino Cielo on the ridge, that means travel was (and is) impeded (at the very least) in both directions from the transmitter sites. The photos are dramatic. Please check them out. 
 Noozhawk:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/several-radio-stations-still-off-the-air-after-storm-knocks-out-power-to-gibraltar-transmitter-site/">Several Radio Stations Still Off the Air After Storm Knocks Out Power to Gibraltar Transmitter Site</a> by <a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/author/giana-magnoli/">Giana Magnoli</a>, by M<a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/author/giana-magnoli/">anaging Editor Giana Magnoli</a>, January 16, 2023 | 1:47 pm 
 
<p>Fom the Noozhawk story:</p>
 
 “… they’ve helicoptered up a new battery and 600 gallons of diesel fuel to the site’s backup generator, but they haven’t been able to get it to work.” I believe this is for lack of the expected banjo valve. (See below.) 
 “Southern California Edison, which supplies power to the transmission towers site, first reported an outage for the Gibraltar Road area at 2:34 a.m. Jan. 9, the day of the big storm.” That was Monday. At least some stations would have switched over to generator power then. 
 “Repair crews haven’t been sent to the site yet, according to the<a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/check-outage-status">&nbsp;SCE Outage Map</a>, but Franklin said he heard there could be new poles installed this week.” That’s John Franklin, who runs the whole Gibraltar Peak site. 
 “KCLU (102.3 FM) went off the air on Wednesday and was still off as of Monday.KCLU (102.3 FM) went off the air on Wednesday and was still off as of Monday. KJEE (92.9 FM) went down for several days but came back on the air on Thursday.” Note: it’s not on now—at least not on the radios I’m using. 
 “Santa Barbara County spokeswoman Kelsey Gerckens Buttitta said there are cell and radio station towers off Gibraltar Road that requires fuel to operate, and Gibraltar Road and East Camino Cielo Road are closed because of slides, debris and slipouts.” Fixing those roads will be very difficult and time-consuming. 
 
<p>The story also lists signals I reported off as of last night. One correction to that:&nbsp;K250BS/97.9, which relays KTMS/990, is on the air. This I presume is because it’s at the KTMS/KTYD site. All the signals from that site (which is up the road from Gibraltar Peak) are still up. I assume that’s either because they are fed electric power separately from Gibraltar Peak, or because they are running on generator power.</p>
<p>[Update: 11:40 AM Monday 16 January] In a private group discussion with broadcast engineers, I am gathering that a stretch of Gibraltar Road close to the Gibraltar Peak site has collapsed. The location is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7pNt3oethjD25xDW6">34°28’05.2″N 119°40’21″W,</a> not far from the road into the transmitter site. This is not the section marked closed by Santa Barbara County on its map <a href="https://www.countyofsb.org/2116/Road-Closures">here</a>. It is also not an easy fix, because it appears from one photograph I’ve seen (shared on a private group) that the land under the road slid away. It is also not the section where power lines to the site were knocked out. So we’re looking at three separate challenges here:</p>
 
 Restoring electrical service to Gibraltar Peak, and other places served by the same now-broken lines 
 Repairing Gibraltar Road in at least two places (the one marked on the county map and the one above) 
 Getting generators fueled and fixed. 
 
<p>On that last issue, I’m told that the site with most of the transmitters can be powered by a generator that awaits what is called a <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=banjo+valve">banjo valve</a>. The KDB facility requires propane, and stayed up longer than the others on the peak while its own supply held up.</p>
 
<p>Gibraltar Peak isn’t the highest landform overlooking Santa Barbara. At 2180 feet, it’s about halfway up the south flank of the Santa Ynez Mountains. But it does provide an excellent vantage for FM stations that want the least obstructed view of the market’s population. That’s why more local signals come from here than from any other site in the region.</p>
<p>Except for now: a time that began with the storm last Tuesday. That’s when power lines feeding the peak were broken by falling rocks that also closed Gibraltar road. Here is a list of signals that have been knocked off the air (and are still off, as of the latest edit, on Sunday, January 15 at 11:15PM):</p>
 
 88.7 KDRW, which has a studio in Santa Barbara, but mostly relays <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/">KCRW</a> from Santa Monica 
 89.5 KSBX, which relays <a href="https://www.kcbx.org/">KCBX</a> from San Luis Obispo* 
 89.9 K210AD, which relays <a href="https://www.kpcc.org/">KPCC</a> from Pasadena by way of KJAI from Ojai 
 90.3 KMRO-FM2, a booster for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMRO">KMRO</a> in Camarillo 
 91.5 K218CP, which relays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSN_International">KAWZ</a> from Twin Falls, Idaho 
 93.7 KDB, which relays KUSC from Los Angeles (down after running on generator power for 5 days) 
 96.9&nbsp;K245DD, which relays <a href="http://am1290kzsb.com/">KZSB</a>/1290 AM in Santa Barbara 
 97.9 K250BS, which relays <a href="http://www.ktms.com/">KTMS</a>/990 AM in Santa Barbara (and is on a KTMS tower, farther up the slope) 
 98.7 K254AH, which relays <a href="https://www.kpfk.org/">KPFK</a> from Los Angeles 
 102.3 KK272DT, the FM side of <a href="https://www.kclu.org/">KCLU</a>/1340 in Santa Barbara and KCLU/88.3 in Thousand Oaks 
 
<p>KTMS/990AM, KTYD/99.9FM, and K231CR/94.1, which relays <a href="https://oldschool1490.com/">KOSJ</a>/1490AM, are still on the air as of Sunday night at 11:15pm. Those are are a short distance farther up Gibraltar Road. (In the other box in the photo above.)</p>
<p>Here is a guide to substitute signals for some of the stations:</p>
 
 KCRW/KDRW can be heard on KCRU/89.1 from Oxnard (actually, Laguna Peak, in Pt. Magu State Park) 
 KDB can be heard on KDSC/91.1 from Thousand Oaks (actually off Sulphur Mountain Road, south of Ojai) 
 KCLU can be heard on 1340 AM from Santa Barbara and 88.3 FM from Thousand Oaks 
 KPCC can be heard on KJAI/89.5 from Ojai (also transmitting from Sulphur Mountai Road) 
 KSBX/KCBX can be heard on 90.9 from Solvang (actually Broadcast Peak) 
 KPFK can be heard on its home signal (biggest in the U.S.) from Mount Wilson in Los Angeles at 90.7 
 KZSB can be heard on 1290 AM from Santa Barbara 
 KMRO can still be heard on its Camarillo main transmitter on 90.3 
 
<p>The two AM signals (marked green in the top list above) are strong in town and most of the FMs are weak but listenable here and there. And all of them can be heard through their live streams online.</p>
<p>Published stories so far, other than this one:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.independent.com/2023/01/11/gibraltar-peak-towers-out-of-commission/">Gibraltar Peak Towers Out of Commission</a>, in the <a href="https://www.independent.com/">Santa Barbara Independent</a>. That story says two power poles were knocked out, as reported by John Franklin, who operates the whole transmitter site. (The story also kindly gives me credit for the photo there.) 
 <a href="https://www.kclu.org/kclus-102-3-fm-signal-in-santa-barbara-is-intermittently-off-the-air">KCLU’s 102.3 FM signal in Santa Barbara is intermittently off the air</a>, on the KCLU website. The image it shows is not of KCLU’s antenna on Gibraltar Peak. Mouse&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/51196612298/in/album-72157719242709298/">over this photo</a> to see which of the many antennas on Gibraltar Peak radiate which signals (to the best of my knowledge, anyway). 
 
<p>The Independent says the site is a “relay” one. That’s correct in the sense that most of the stations there are satellites of bigger stations elsewhere. But KCLU is local to Santa Barbara (its anchor AM station is here), and the ratings reflect it. I wrote about those ratings a few years ago, in <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/04/04/public/">Where Public Radio Rocks</a>. In that post, I noted that public radio is bigger in Santa Barbara than anywhere else in the country.</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb591">ratings</a> (Spring of 2022), in % shares of total listening, are these:</p>
 
 KDB/93.9, classical music, relaying KUSC/91.1 from Los Angeles: 7.9% 
 KCLU/102.3 and 1340 in Santa Barbara (studios in Thousand Oaks), public broadcasting: 7.3% 
 KDRW/88.7 in Santa Barbara (main studio in Santa Monica, as KCRW/89.9): 4.6% 
 KPCC/89.9, relaying KJAI/89.5 and KPCC/89.3 in Pasadena: 1.3% 
 KSBX/89.5, relaying KCBX/90.1 from San Luis Obispo: 0.7% 
 
<p>Total: 21.8%.</p>
<p>That means more than a fifth of all radio listening in Santa Barbara is to noncommercial and public radio.</p>
<p>And, of all those stations, only KDB/KUSC and KCLU-AM are on the air right now.</p>
<p>By the way, when I check to see how public broadcasting is doing in other markets, nothing is close. Santa Barbara still kicks ass. I think that’s an interesting story, and I haven’t seen anyone report on it, other than here.</p>
 
<p>*Turns out KSBX is off the air permanently, after losing a coverage battle with KPBS/89.5 in San Diego. On December 29, they published a story in print and sound titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kcbx.org/health-science-and-technology/2022-12-29/why-is-89-5-ksbx-off-the-air-the-answer-is-in-the-atmosphere">Why is 89.5 KSBX off the air? The answer is in the atmosphere.</a>&nbsp;They blame <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_propagation#Tropospheric_ducting">tropospheric ducting</a>, which much of the time makes KPBS come in like a local signal. Also, even though KPBS’s transmitter on Soledad Mountain (really more of a hill) above the coast at La Jolla is more than 200 miles away, it does pump out 26,000 watts, while KCBX puts out only 50 watts—and less in some directions. Though the story doesn’t mention it, KJAI, the KPCC relay on 89.5 for Ojai, is audible in Santa Barbara if nothing else is there. So that also didn’t help. By the way, I’m almost certain that the antenna identified as KSBX’s in the story’s photo (which is also one of mine) is actually for KMRO-2. KSBX’s is the one on the left in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/51197177169/in/album-72157719242709298/">this photo here</a>.</p>

<p>Most of California has just two seasons: rain and fire. Rain is another name for Winter, and it peaks in January. In most years, January in&nbsp;California isn’t any more wet than, say, New York, Miami or Chicago.&nbsp;But every few years California gets monsoons. Big ones. This is one of those years.</p>
<p>The eighteen gallon storage tub in our yard is sixteen inches deep and serves as a rain gauge:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yesterday morning it was less than half full. While it gathered rain, our devices blasted out alerts with instructions like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>So we stayed home and watched the Web tell us how the drought was ending:</p>
<p><a href="https://rain.cosbpw.net/sensor/?site_id=105&amp;site=70729dd9-97d4-430a-9271-7b6c195b49be&amp;device_id=9&amp;device=e1b323bd-c4c6-4ea4-b9d1-c775a97ce915"></a></p>
<p>Wasn’t long ago that Lake Cachuna was at 7%.</p>
<p>So that’s good news. The bad news is about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/roads-turn-to-rivers-as-storms-drench-california-claiming-lives-and-leaving-many-in-the-dark/ar-AA16aly9">floods</a>, <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/california-ocean-piers-collapse-waves-rise-to-35-feet/">ruined piers and wharfs</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/city-of-fallen-trees-storm-damage-visible-across-sacramento/ar-AA16amrh">downed trees</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/over-135k-people-are-without-power-from-california-storm-see-where-its-hit-the-most/ar-AA16bnwa">power outages</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/levee-breaches-cause-additional-flooding-in-monterey-county-new-evacuations-ordered/">levee breaches</a>. The usual.</p>
<p>It should help to remember that the geology on both coasts is temporary and improvisational. The East Coast south of New England and Long Island (where coastal landforms were mostly dumped there or scraped bare by glaciers in the geologic yesterday) is a stretch of barrier islands that are essentially dunes shifted by storms. Same goes for the Gulf Coast. The West Coast looks more solid, with hills and mountains directly facing the sea. But Pacific storms in Winter routinely feature waves high as houses, pounding against the shores and sea cliffs.</p>
<p>Looking up the coast from Tijuana, within a few hundred years Coronado and Point Loma in San Diego, La Jolla, all the clifftop towns up the coast to Dana Point and Laguna, Palos Verdes Peninsula, Malibu and Point Dume, Carpinteria, the Santa Barbara Mesa and Hope Ranch, all of Isla Vista and UCSB, Pismo and Avila Beaches, all of Big Sur and the Pacific Coast Highway there, Carmel and the Monterey Peninsula, Aptos, Capitola and Santa Cruz, Davenport, Half Moon Bay, Pacifica, the headlands of San Francisco, Muir and Stimson Beaches and Bolinas in Marin, Fort Bragg in Mendicino County, and Crescent City in Humbolt—all in California—will be eaten away partially or entirely by weather and waves. Earthquakes will also weigh in.</p>
<p>The photo up top is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Conchita,_California">La Conchita</a>, a stupidly located town on the South Coast, west of Ventura, four days after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Conchita_landslides#2005_La_Conchita_landslide">landslide in 2005</a> took out 13 homes and killed 10 people. All the land above town is a pile of former and future landslides, sure to slide again when the ground is saturated with water. Such as now or soon.</p>
<p>So that’s a long view. For one that spans the next week, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windy.com/">windy.com</a>&nbsp;and slide the elevation up to FL (flight level) 340 (34000 feet):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windy.com/?200h,41.043,-171.585,4"></a></p>
<p>That yellow river of wind is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream">jet stream</a> hauling serious ass straight across the Pacific and into California. Jet streams are why the headwinds and tailwinds you see on seat-back displays showing flight progress on planes often say 100mph or more. Look at Windy before you fly coast to coast or overseas, and you can guess what the flight path will be. You can also see why it may take as little as five hours to get from Dulles to Heathrow, or more than seven hours to come back by a route that touches the Arctic Circle. Your plane is riding, fighting or circumventing high altitude winds that have huge influences on the weather below.</p>
<p>To see how, drop Windy down to the surface:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windy.com/?41.043,-171.585,4"></a></p>
<p>Those eddies alongside the jet stream are low pressure centers full of the moisture and wind we call storms. They spin along the sides of the jet stream the way dust devils twist up along the sides of highways full of passing trucks. Those two storm centers are spinning toward California and will bring more wind and rain.</p>
<p>Beside the sure damage those will bring, there will be two benefits. One is that California will be as green as Ireland for a few months. The other is that wildflowers will bloom all over the place.</p>
<p>The Death Valley folks are <a href="https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/wildflower-seasons.htm">hedging their bet</a>, but I’d put money on a nice bloom this Spring. Watch for it.</p>

  <p>I release Datasette 0.64 this morning. This release is mainly a response to the realization that it's not safe to run Datasette with the SpatiaLite extension loaded if that Datasette instance is configured to enable arbitrary SQL queries from untrusted users.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-64">the release notes</a> quoted in full:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Datasette now strongly recommends against allowing arbitrary SQL queries if you are using SpatiaLite. SpatiaLite includes SQL functions that could cause the Datasette server to crash. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/spatialite.html#spatialite">SpatiaLite</a> for more details. 
 New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/settings.html#setting-default-allow-sql">default_allow_sql</a> setting, providing an easier way to disable all arbitrary SQL execution by end users: <code>datasette --setting default_allow_sql off</code>. See also <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html#authentication-permissions-execute-sql">Controlling the ability to execute arbitrary SQL</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1409">#1409</a>) 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/spatialite">Building a location to time zone API with SpatiaLite</a> is a new Datasette tutorial showing how to safely use SpatiaLite to create a location to time zone API. 
 New documentation about <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html#installation-extensions">how to debug problems loading SQLite extensions</a>. The error message shown when an extension cannot be loaded has also been improved. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1979">#1979</a>) 
 Fixed an accessibility issue: the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements in the table filter form now show an outline when they are currently focused. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1771">#1771</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
 The problem with SpatiaLite 
<p>Datasette allows arbitrary SQL execution <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html">as a core feature</a>. It takes a bunch of steps to provide this safely: database connections are opened in read-only mode, it imposes a strict time limit on SQL queries and Datasette is designed to be run in containers for a further layer of protection.</p>
<p>SQLite itself is an excellent platform for this feature: it has a set of default functionality that supports this well, protected by a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">legendarily thorough test suite</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index">SpatiaLite</a> is a long running third-party extension for SQLite that adds a <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-sql-5.0.1.html">bewildering array</a> of additional functionality to SQLite - much of it around GIS, but with a whole host of extras as well. It includes debugging routines, XML parsers and even it's own implementation of stored procedures!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all of this functionality is safe to expose to untrusted queries - even for databases that have been opened in read-only mode.</p>
<p>After identifying functions which could crash the Datasette instance, I decided that Datasette should make a strong recommendation not to expose SpatiaLite in an unprotected manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the new documentation, I also added a feature I've been planning for a while: a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/settings.html#setting-default-allow-sql">simple setting</a> for disabling arbitrary SQL queries entirely:</p>
 <code>datasette --setting default_allow_sql off
</code> 
<p>Prior to 0.64 you could achieve the same thing by adding the following line to your <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/metadata.html">metadata.json</a> file:</p>
  {
    "allow_sql": false
}  
<p>Or in <code>metadata.yml</code>:</p>
  allow_sql: false  
<p>The new setting achieves the same thing, but is more obvious and can be easily applied even for Datasette instances that don't use metadata.</p>
 A new SpatiaLite tutorial 
<p>The documentation now recommends running SpatiaLite instances with pre-approved SQL implemented using Datasette's canned queries feature.</p>
<p>To help clarify how this works, I decided to publish a new entry in the official series of <a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials">Datasette tutorials</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/tutorials/spatialite">Building a location to time zone API with SpatiaLite</a></p>
<p>This is an updated version of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Dec/12/location-time-zone-api/">a tutorial</a> I first wrote back in 2017.</p>
<p>The new tutorial now includes material on Chris Amico's <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-geojson-map">datasette-geojson-map</a> plugin, SpatiaLite point-in-polygon queries, polygon intersection queries, spatial indexes and how to use the <code>simplify()</code> function to reduce huge polygons down to a size that is more practical to display on a map.</p>
<p>I'm really happy with this new tutorial. Not only does it show a safe way to run SpatiaLite, but it also illustrates a powerful pattern for using Datasette to create and deploy custom APIs.</p>
<p>The resulting API can be accessed here:</p>
<p><a href="https://timezones.datasette.io/timezones">https://timezones.datasette.io/timezones</a></p>
<p>It's hosted on <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly</a>, using their $1.94/month instance size with 256MB of RAM - easily powerful enough to host this class of application.</p>
<p>I also updated the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-publish-fly">datasette-publish-fly</a> plugin to make it easier to deploy instances with SQL execution disabled, see the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-fly/releases/tag/1.3">1.3 release notes</a>.</p>

<p>What does it mean to unify these 3 organizations? Is it possible? What would it take to unify these 3 organizations?</p>



<p>Let’s start with a common cause/purpose/vision/mission.  Without these, the goal of unification is impossible to attain.</p>

  <p>Summary:      The following is an excerpt from my upcoming book, Learning Digital Identity, which will be available January 2023.</p>




<p>
    The family therapist Salvador Minuchin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674292367/technometria-20">declared</a>, "The human experience of identity has two elements: a sense of belonging and a sense of being separate." This is as good a description of digital identity as it is of our psychological identity. A digital identity contains data that uniquely describes a person or thing but also contains information about the subject's relationships to other entities.
</p>

<p>
    To see an example of this, consider the data record that represents your car, stored somewhere in your state or country's computers. This record, commonly called a title, contains a vehicle identification number (VIN) that uniquely identifies the car to which it belongs. In addition, it contains other attributes of the car such as year, make, model, and color. The title also contains relationships: most notably, the title relates the vehicle to a person who owns it. In many places, the title is also a historical document, because it identifies every owner of the car from the time it was made, as well as whether it's been in a flood or otherwise salvaged.
</p>

<p>
    While fields as diverse as philosophy, commerce, and technology define identity, most are not helpful in building, managing, and using digital identity systems. Instead, we need to define identity functionally, in a way that provides hooks for us to use in making decisions and thinking about problems that arise in digital identity.
</p>

<p>
    Joe Andrieu, principal at Legendary Requirements, <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">writes</a> that "identity is how we recognize, remember, and respond to specific people and things. Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context." This definition is my favorite because it has proven useful over the years in thinking through thorny identity issues. 
</p>

<p>
    The identity record for a car includes attributes that the system uses to recognize it: in this case, the VIN. The title also includes attributes that are useful to people and organizations who care about (that is, need to respond to) the car, including the owner, the state, and potential buyers. The government runs a system for managing titles that is used to create, manage, transfer, and govern vehicles (or, in Andrieu's formulation, remember them). The system is designed to achieve its primary goal (to record valuable property that the state has an interest in taxing and regulating) and secondary goals (protecting potential buyers and creating a way to prove ownership).
</p>

<p>
    Digital identity management consists of processes for creating, managing, using, and eventually destroying digital records, like the one that contains your car title. These records might identify a person, a car, a computer, a piece of land, or almost anything else. Sometimes they are created simply for inventory purposes, but the more interesting ones are created with other purposes in mind: allowing or denying access to a building, the creation of a file, the transfer of funds, and so on. These relationships and the authorized actions associated with them make digital identities useful, valuable, and sometimes difficult to manage.

<p>[Alias] seized the opportunity to purchase the Spacemaker technology and launched UpFront, a low-cost 3D Mac and Windows based package for architects. Alias achieved a major coup by impressing Bill Gates, who mentioned Upfront during a major Microsoft&nbsp;conference as a particularly innovative application under Windows. “In the graphics area, I picked Upfront from Alias Research. It is really an incredible tool for making sure the design is exactly right”, said the Chairman of Microsoft.</p>

We also used the same code base to build Alias Upfront for the Mac.&nbsp;Upfront didn’t generate a lot of revenue ($2 million? …or was it $200,000?) but it was Alias Research’s very first desktop software product. We were and are very proud of what we accomplished.</p>

<p>1. IE4 and the Java Jam</p>



<p>What are your favorite Microsoft stories? Here’s one of my mine… (#1 in my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/favoritemicrosoftstories?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZXQ0JTArdzg04nuBAoJFly1zQ_JcCVgk8BR2gGMZV3xc0kUgplXemjGfC8DQLzfaToc0wvJKOjQs5cAKnZyKuLbuisF8i1Ip4Er2OxZ0QsRE34yVVjWjq4zy4HskUuD9ck&amp;__tn__=*NK-R">#FavoriteMicrosoftStories</a> series)</p>



<p>One of my favorite MS stories involves IE4 and one of the largest banks in Canada, one of Microsoft’s largest customers headquartered here in Toronto, around Spring 1997 – maybe ’96 (May 15th actually …I’ll never forget that date). The bank had committed themselves to using server-side Java before there was any hint of server-side Java apps, J2EE, etc. They were using the IE4 Java VM at a time when we (MS) were happy to have the VM running “dancing elephants” in IE for 24 hours without a crash. We never thought of using the MS VM to run what was at the time “the world’s largest server-side Java application”.</p>



<p>The bank’s Java app would crash again and again. The bank blamed our VM because our VM was the only one that would run the app at all (not the IBM Hersley VM, not the VM from Sun Microsystems).</p>



<p>CharlesF and I ended up going head-to-head on this …for me it was all about what support is MS willing to provide MS’s largest enterprise customers; Charles’ job was to work for BradSi and, among other responsibilities, deflect any distractions that would delay shipping IE4 …remember the days of “The Browser Wars”?</p>



<p>We each chose our teams. Bill Gates was already down the throats and backs of BradSi and Charles to not work on this. SteveB came to Toronto and got a huge strip torn off him – up one side and down the other – by an ex-IBM bank VP whose husband at the time was the IBM account executive for the same bank. SteveB was instantly on my team.</p>



<p>At the MGS in Orlando a few months later, Bill was walking around making himself available for the MS field people that were there (an MS internal WW sales conference). I started to walk up to Bill and to explain my role in the “Java Jam” as we called it and had only gotten a couple words out when SteveB pounced on Bill in front of dozens of MS people – his pointer fingers high up in the air pointing down at Bill – virtually yelling at him to listen to the story I had and to learn what it means to be passionate about our enterprise customers.</p>



<p>Later that evening, I got a call to meet with SteveB in his hotel suite. Just me and him …and PaulMa, CharlesF and the MS Java VM team on the other end of a conference phone. Steve was on one side of an L-shaped couch when I arrived eating cashews or almonds from a can. I sat on the other side of the couch. The phone was in the middle on the coffee table. The call was already in progress.</p>



<p>The best thing about this meeting was that everyone was on the same page. We just needed someone to make a damn decision: yes or no, are we going to fix this problem?</p>



<p>Steve started by asking Paul two questions: 1) “Is what the bank doing on-strategy or off-strategy?” Paul replied “It’s not off strategy”. Then Steve asked question 2: “OK then, what are we doing to help the bank?”</p>



<p>Almost immediately PaulMa offered to call the VP at the bank. I gestured to Steve sitting across from me – no further than 2-3 feet away – and said “We’ve already had a lot of people talking to the bank”. “What we need is a decision. A yes or a no. Are we going to fix this problem or not? That’s all they want to hear”.</p>



<p>Steve immediately leaned over to me and whispered “If Paul is going to call, Paul is going to fix this”. We agreed Paul would call the VP as soon as they could synchronize their schedules.</p>



<p>Afterwards Steve said “If something like this ever happens again, call me right away. Call me directly. Don’t let it happen again”. We shook hands and I left.</p>



<p>The bug (a multi-threading sync data structure being overwritten) was fixed by the end of the following weekend …in time for PaulMa’s concall with the bank’s VP on the Tuesday afternoon.</p>



<p>After that, it used to freak people out in the Canadian sub when SteveB would high-five me in the hallway. It wasn’t worth trying to explain unless you knew the whole story.</p>

<p>2. Cancellation of the Local Web Storage System (LWSS) Project</p>



<p>What are your favorite Microsoft stories? Here’s my second favorite… (#2 in my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/favoritemicrosoftstories?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZV8WkfzQUO3739u8xijCyZkeJXKyBJR10C69eySqSvprnRpGBrbzmu7jilXQfD9skPkVvlugrX6mSOpji6zyvRkjfT1KWdCqatcW4CJVvzsYvJX4Hs6AVFZ3rEhCsyR6MU&amp;__tn__=*NK-R">#FavoriteMicrosoftStories</a> series)</p>



<p>Who remembers what famous Microsoft event happened on December 17, 2000?</p>



<p>How about the cancellation of the Local Web Storage System (LWSS) project? …preventing it from shipping with “Outlook 10” (aka Office XP).</p>



<p>I remember it well because the next day I was asked to present at the MS Collaboration Partner Advisory Council meeting at the Atlantis Hotel in Nassau. Not a bad gig except about every 45 minutes Robert Ginsberg would start to shake his head and shout out “How could you Microsoft do this to us?”. This went on for the full 2-day event – before and after every presentation.</p>



<p>Robert was right to be upset. Being the cofounder of one of the leading Exchange Server WSS development shops in the world, Robert, and his business partner Andy Sakalian, had invested enormous amounts of time and effort learning about LWSS – inside and out – and had built several tools to help prospective LWSS ISVs build custom solutions on top of LWSS and “Outlook 10”.</p>



<p>Schitt happens – everywhere – but it was always more fun when it happened at Microsoft.</p>



<p>p.s. You’d like an upbeat ending? Andy introduced me to a jeweler from Montreal who taught me how to play Black Jack “the real way” and what finer venue than sitting at the tables at the Altantis Casino. I made USD$900 that evening. I had to stay up until 4am but I did clear $900. ..that’s about $75/hour. Back then there were a lot easier ways to make $900/day …a lot easier.</p>

<p>3. PDC 2001: Unified Storage Strategy</p>



<p>What are your favorite Microsoft stories? Here’s my third favorite… (#3 in my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/favoritemicrosoftstories?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUmAlnemSaoTcTbAK-zBe6BPqS3atUsikh-CZU2r5rdfW6m722CmtRm3N7uAfifAWAwVLMnW5meKyW90qAEs7keYoUXHVohfIqW_4xLsfyl7bqbry2RcXXKAHeWERV-rYY&amp;__tn__=*NK-R">#FavoriteMicrosoftStories</a> series)</p>



<p>There was a series of events I often attended (before and) after I left the mothership in 2001: the Microsoft Professional Developer Conferences (PDC). They have since gone away. …the conferences I mean. (I think there are still lots of professional Microsoft developers.)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/maryjofoley?__cft__[0]=AZUmAlnemSaoTcTbAK-zBe6BPqS3atUsikh-CZU2r5rdfW6m722CmtRm3N7uAfifAWAwVLMnW5meKyW90qAEs7keYoUXHVohfIqW_4xLsfyl7bqbry2RcXXKAHeWERV-rYY&amp;__tn__=-]K-R">Mary-Jo Foley</a>, an excellent journalist, writer and research analyst, would also attend these events. Disclosure: Mary-Jo Foley is also a friend on Facebook (currently) but we really don’t know each other that well.</p>



<p>At these events, Mary-Jo would often be first in line at the microphones during the Bill Gates executive Q&amp;A session. One of her favorite questions was to ask Bill how Microsoft was progressing with its unified storage strategy based on SQL Server …especially the following question: When was Exchange Server going to ship using a SQL Server-based storage system? Bill always had a good answer.</p>



<p>This was also one of my favorite BillG questions and, unknown to Mary-Jo as far as I know, it became a race for me to try and ask the unified storage question before she could. If I asked it first, she would mention me and my affiliation in her coverage. It worked once. It was bit of game where I was the only knowing player.</p>

<p>4. Microsoft Exchange Server .NET Whitepaper</p>



<p>What are your favorite Microsoft stories? Here’s another one of my favorites… (#4 in my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/favoritemicrosoftstories?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWMG0Et-KiF2egQbq1lFntxVgM1ZyFb-OcJuwrr9Bir1_7J9lJAk6bUiKRz3rBBy_q_7NbImcfWZ4GSWMEWtKDh0w1titcLfOrLwpMAUZPIUjPdWqiYPecLQdrFd7gRoAc&amp;__tn__=*NK-R">#favoriteMicrosoftStories</a> series)</p>



<p>This story starts in the Fall of 2000 – the very, very early days of .NET/.net/.Net …yes, the days when, even inside Microsoft, there wasn’t a consistent .NET messaging and positioning framework and every product group spelled .NET differently.  How many different ways can you spell a 3-letter word that doesn’t meaning anything? We used them all until…</p>



<p>Internally at Microsoft, we had the “.NET police force” who swooped down unexpectedly on presenters, content authors and writers to make sure that whichever way we chose to spell .NET, we had to change it!</p>



<p>And who was the .NET police chief? …none other than my good colleague from the “IE4 Java Jam”: Charles Fitzgerald. (For more information, read <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mwherman/posts/pfbid0mErz6QjZHMMwWyE85PxydtdTSppuHrT9B4ccJfPxEW6UEDYvFsQ9D4eicoYdAGC5l?__cft__[0]=AZWMG0Et-KiF2egQbq1lFntxVgM1ZyFb-OcJuwrr9Bir1_7J9lJAk6bUiKRz3rBBy_q_7NbImcfWZ4GSWMEWtKDh0w1titcLfOrLwpMAUZPIUjPdWqiYPecLQdrFd7gRoAc&amp;__tn__=-UK-R">https://www.facebook.com/mwherman/posts/10153044551595932</a>)</p>



<p>In the Fall of 2000, I moved into the EC3 team (Enterprise Connectivity Competency Center), a specialty team within MCS Canada formed as part of the acquisition of Linkage, a Toronto ISV who had an entire library of Exchange 5.5. connectors …but I digress.</p>



<p>The nicest thing about EC3 is that we were one of the only MCS practices that figured out how to subcontract ourselves back into the corp product groups. My first assignment was to write a .NET/.net/.Net strategy whitepaper for Thomas Rizzo when he was still on the Exchange Server team (pre SQL Server, pre SharePoint, pre Local Web Storage System). Like the Internet Wave, the .NET wave meant every product group needed to craft some sort of .NET developer story (aka strategy). My task was not only to document the Exchange Server .NET strategy in a whitepaper but I also had to make it up!  “Those were the days my friend…”</p>



<p>I started by interviewing a lot of cool folks inside and outside the Exchange Server team: Gordon Mangione, Alex Hopmann, Brent Ingraham, Harry Katz, Keith McCall, Chris Vanden Berg, Thomas Rizzo, Lyle Curry, Jeff Wierer, and Kevin Hunter.</p>



<p>From there, I crafted a fairly compelling story (I mean strategy, sorry!). The whitepaper ended up being 15-20 pages.</p>



<p>I can’t find an original version of the “Developing Microsoft .NET Collaboration Solutions” whitepaper but you can still find the German version on the Microsoft web site: <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fde-de%2Flibrary%2Fcc405536.aspx%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR09Jflevv-W6tK0G6umBuEs8m5l2Cm7UKBczXJO8TcJVisc4af9iPnvn7M&amp;h=AT33bKw0BA5DNY_CpEBf3v66GBt7LjSKZQ7ogkTCiM44afkpy1mMJV0qQvn-MnkSvP5_NlIf7Cao4zdlj9nVC_l08HBTsmOZlEnhueasWhG32Qz2OIF6QdOj03RI5awQ8w&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c[0]=AT2YwW11gGcQJ2rPFtJN9nqJGDPpZ6ccwm5v-rdB_jzDF1JhkRXICXUvv2XJpAAJ5G3b_0Bf0E7Oy8gjHXckWnAHU2L0qbu31a5Qi29NpXGr4_06nO4SgdCHNwYd1lgUxgrK0D8bU56Ce1isR4BsD8xNEP0">https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/cc405536.aspx</a> . Google will do a pretty good job helping you translate from German to English.</p>



<p>And what about the .NET police force? Back then, there was no one who knew how to push content faster to the <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FMicrosoft.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3__NLuqRqpV_XgZJnxYTbuWbr2y_tUebJk0-exopze8Qc8McHXqca5XoY&amp;h=AT1ct8_EuJTLPolRiVDwVyTNZGwLjlX3cNpzC2s7fivRkgyKgG4vRmCw_Ke8wySPIR6AYMb8D-8dOmUQX1hktCkqDL-9GLysZ_dbWmtbYkWv0sz53ogvhy2jDMus2uDPVg&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c[0]=AT2YwW11gGcQJ2rPFtJN9nqJGDPpZ6ccwm5v-rdB_jzDF1JhkRXICXUvv2XJpAAJ5G3b_0Bf0E7Oy8gjHXckWnAHU2L0qbu31a5Qi29NpXGr4_06nO4SgdCHNwYd1lgUxgrK0D8bU56Ce1isR4BsD8xNEP0">Microsoft.com</a> web site than Tom Rizzo. He litrerally had the Exchange Server .NET whitepaper published overnight. When the .NET police came to our doors, we just smilled. We had already moved on to something else. </p>

<p>The one isn’t really very juicy …more of an early milestone. Thank you goes to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/William.R.Vaughn?__cft__[0]=AZWOGiMeGHbGeSyzlWfZrZz7AJjvYi7nT3r8-A4hmD5o-eX7NXoWmdv1UEU24k9aEptMSkyoX6D5mHA3SvfQbk2OrBNjK6ZACPYhVa5wA8xnT16wz2vZA3dLEAm3IVt_NmcyCajjEm43vvq9OE_Bp7YC&amp;__tn__=-]K-R">Bill Vaughn</a> for helping with some of the names and dates.</p>



<p>It was the Spring of 1986. I worked for a Toronto research company/ISV (Optical Recording Corporation) where we were trying to use the very early versions of Windows to create (don’t laugh) an optical disc-based document storage and management system. …and I mean, very, very early versions of Windows: Windows SDK version 0.989, Windows 1.01, Windows 1.02, etc.</p>



<p>Later in the Fall of 1987 (I think), I attended my first Microsoft Windows developer event (MS used a small ‘d’ back then ;-)). It was in a simple Santa Clara hotel meeting room. 5-6 rows of chairs. Less than 100 people. SteveB was the MC and John Butler was the main technical guy as I remember. I remember John for his ponytail. He later went on to play a key role in creating Microsoft University (who remembers that?).</p>



<p>As a giveaway, we received a white cotton book bag with the pale blue Windows logo on it. It had a copy of the Windows “runtime environment” and the SDK in it. Maybe be a copy of the Microsoft C compiler. The entire library of Microsoft “small d” developer documentation was at most 3 small beige PC binders.</p>

<p>Herman: It’s nice to see Microsoft consolidating around a smaller set of core technologies, but when it comes to electronic forms, Word and Excel have their own point solutions, Outlook has its own point solution, InfoPath has its own point solution, Access has its own point solution. In the developer platform you have ASP.NET and WebForms. We’re constantly in the situation where we’re trying to guess which ones are strategic. Can you give us some insight?</p>

<p>AUDIENCE QUESTION: Michael Herman, from Parallelspace Corporation. It’s nice to see Microsoft consolidating around a smaller set of core technologies. But, when it comes to electronic forms, Word and Excel have their own point solution. Outlook has its own point solution. InfoPath has its own point solution. Access has its own point solution. In the developer platform, you have ASP.NET and WinForms. We’re constantly in a situation we’re trying to guess which ones are strategic. Can you give us some insight?</p>



<p>Microsoft’s varied collaboraboration platform strategies: More comments from Billg and StevenSi<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060903014934/http://www.dotnetjunkies.com:80/WebLog/mwherman2000/archive/2005/02/14/54405.aspx">https://web.archive.org/web/20060903014934/http://www.dotnetjunkies.com:80/WebLog/mwherman2000/archive/2005/02/14/54405.aspx</a></p>



<p>A question from Mark Moore (formerly of KPMG and an early SPS 2001 adopter)…</p>



<p>AUDIENCE QUESTION: A number of us have been on the collaboration path with Microsoft for a long time starting with Outlook and Exchange. A couple of us probably remember a team productivity update. Then SharePoint 2001, SharePoint 2003, Digital Dashboard was in there. In going from point- milestone to milestone on this path, there hasn’t been a lot to leverage moving from one point to the other. Today, in the Whidbey talk I was gratified to hear that the Whidbey Web Parts were going to be backward compatible. I’m hoping that you can assure us that those of us who have been on the path with you for a while, that this cycle of creative destruction is coming to an end.</p>



<p>PDC 05: Are the PDC silos going to present a disconnected view of the Microsoft developer platform?<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060211002512/http://dotnetjunkies.com:80/WebLog/mwherman2000/archive/2005/07/14/131275.aspx">https://web.archive.org/web/20060211002512/http://dotnetjunkies.com:80/WebLog/mwherman2000/archive/2005/07/14/131275.aspx</a></p>



<p>For example, in the description for sesssion “Choosing the Right Presentation Technology: Avalon, Windows Forms, ASP.NET, IE, and More”, there is no mention of InfoPath “12” and the forms server demonstrated at TechEd 2005.</p>



<p>I would encourage everyone attending this session to rate it a 1 of 5 if the new InfoPath forms and forms server is not included in the analysis.</p>



<p>Is Microsoft going to present an integrated view of the Microsoft platform or a disconnected one?</p>



<p>Is the PDC going to be one large Microsoft “technology fair” with no strategic intent other than giving each product group a venue to promote their own technology bits? …leaving developers to guess what is strategic and what is not. (50% probability)</p>



<p>Pre-blogging the PDC<br><a href="https://jonudell.net/udell/2005-08-02-pre-blogging-the-pdc.html">https://jonudell.net/udell/2005-08-02-pre-blogging-the-pdc.html</a></p>



<p>As Microsoft gears up for its annual Professional Developers Conference, Michael Herman — CTO and founder of Parallelspace — is asking some probing questions about the agenda:</p>



<p>Is the PDC going to be one large Microsoft “technology fair” with no strategic intent other than giving each product group a venue to promote their own technology bits? …leaving developers to guess what is strategic and what is not. (50% probability) [Michael Herman: Are the PDC silos going to present a disconnected view of the Microsoft platform?]</p>



<p><br>Michael asked similar questions at the Office Developers Conference I attended in February. I transcribed one of them — about Microsoft’s hydra-headed electronic forms strategy — in this blog item. Michael blogged the same exchange, and he also zeroed in on another set of questions and answers about unified storage that I transcribed from the February conference.<br>These questions are interesting, but I find the process itself even more so. The PDC tends to be ahistorical, focusing on futures more than follow-through. In the hallways you see attendees reading the entrails and trying to divine which futures will be strategic, at a level more granular than the grand themes: Windows, NT, Win95, the Internet, tablet PC, .NET, Hailstorm, WinFX.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement the OAUTH 2.0 Token Exchange RFC 8693 delegated flow between two APIs, one using Azure AD to authorize the HTTP requests and a second API protected using OpenIddict. The Azure AD protected API uses the OAUTH 2.0 Token Exchange RFC 8693 delegated flow to get a new OpenIddict delegated access token using the AAD delegated access token. An ASP.NET Core Razor page application using a confidential client is used to get the Azure AD access token with an&nbsp;access_as_user&nbsp;scope. By using the OAUTH 2.0 Token Exchange flow, delegated and application authorization mixing can be avoided and the trust between systems can be reduced.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/OAuthGrantExchangeOidcDownstreamApi">https://github.com/damienbod/OAuthGrantExchangeOidcDownstreamApi</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup OAUTH 2.0 Token Exchange RFC 8693 for delegated flows 



<p>A Razor page UI application is implemented using Azure AD as the identity provider. This application authenticates using a confidential client against Azure AD. The UI uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to implement the client authentication logic. The application requests an Azure AD delegated access token to use the API which is also protected using Azure AD. This API application needs to use a downstream API which is protected using a separate identity provider and is protected using OpenIddict. The API uses the Azure AD access token to acquire another access token which the OpenIddict protected API accepts. The OAuth 2.0 token exchange RFC 8693 is used to implement this using the delegated flow. Only known Azure AD delegated access tokens can be used. The identity provider which is used to host OpenIddict implements the server logic of token exchange flow. I have kept this separated but I assume this could be integrated into OpenIddict as well. It is important to validate the flow correctly and not just the flow but the mapping logic between the different identities used in the delegated access token. I did not implement the full spec in this demo, just the bits requires for the delegated flow. Impersonation and other such use cases for the RFC 8693 are not supported at present. Maybe I will implement this later. </p>







<p></p>



 Implement the OAUTH 2.0 Token Exchange client 



<p>The GetApiDataAsync method is used to get an access token for the OpenIddict downstream API and use it to get the data. It uses the GetApiTokenOauthGrantTokenExchange to the get the access token using the token exchange flow and then uses it to call the business API. The configuration values are used as well as the client secret to acquire the new token. </p>


  public async Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt; GetApiDataAsync(string aadAccessToken)
{
	try
	{
		var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

		client.BaseAddress = new Uri(
			_downstreamApi.Value.ApiBaseAddress);

		var access_token = await _apiTokenClient
			.GetApiTokenOauthGrantTokenExchange
		(
			_downstreamApi.Value.ClientId,
			_downstreamApi.Value.Audience,
			_downstreamApi.Value.ScopeForAccessToken,
			_downstreamApi.Value.ClientSecret,
			aadAccessToken
		);

		client.SetBearerToken(access_token);

		var response = await client.GetAsync("api/values");
		if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
		{
			var data = await JsonSerializer
				.DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(
			await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());

			if(data != null)
				return data;

			return new List&lt;string&gt;();
		}

		throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, 
			Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
	}
	catch (Exception e)
	{
		throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
	}
}
  


<p>The GetApiTokenOauthGrantTokenExchangeAad is an internal method used to call the OpenIddict identity provider to get the correct access token. This method is only called once per session or as long as the token is valid. This is normally cached once acquired. The method passes the required parameters which match the server settings.</p>


  private async Task&lt;AccessTokenItem&gt; GetApiTokenOauthGrantTokenExchangeAad(
	string clientId, 
	string audience,
	string scope, 
	string clientSecret, 
	string aadAccessToken)
{
	var tokenExchangeHttpClient = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
	tokenExchangeHttpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(
		_downstreamApiConfigurations.Value.IdentityProviderUrl);

	var tokenExchangeSuccessResponse = await RequestDelegatedAccessToken
		.GetDelegatedApiTokenTokenExchange(
			new GetDelegatedApiTokenOAuthTokenExchangeModel
			{
				Scope = scope,
				AccessToken = aadAccessToken,
				ClientSecret = clientSecret,
				Audience = audience,
				ClientId = clientId,
				EndpointUrl = "/connect/oauthTokenExchangetoken",
				GrantExchangeHttpClient = tokenExchangeHttpClient
			}, _logger);

	if (tokenExchangeSuccessResponse != null)
	{
		return new AccessTokenItem
		{
			ExpiresIn = DateTime.UtcNow
				.AddSeconds(tokenExchangeSuccessResponse.expires_in),
			AccessToken = tokenExchangeSuccessResponse.access_token
		};
	}

	_logger.LogError(
		"no success response from oauth token exchange access token request");
	throw new ApplicationException(
		"no success response from oauth token exchange access token request");
}
  


<p>The GetDelegatedApiTokenTokenExchange method implements the client business of the OAuth flow. This creates an authentication header using basic authentication as we only want to use a confidential client for this. The parameters are passed as a KeyValuePair and match the defined specifications in the RFC 8693 for the POST body. If the data is returned correctly a success response is returned, otherwise the error response like in the RFC definition with a few extra parameters. The OauthTokenExchangeSuccessResponse is used to get the successful HTTP response from the POST request.</p>


  public static async Task&lt;OauthTokenExchangeSuccessResponse?&gt; GetDelegatedApiTokenTokenExchange(
	GetDelegatedApiTokenOAuthTokenExchangeModel reqData, ILogger logger)
{
	if (reqData.GrantExchangeHttpClient == null)
		throw new ArgumentException("Httpclient missing, is null");

	string credentials = CreateBasicAuthenticationHeader(reqData);

	reqData.GrantExchangeHttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic", credentials);

	KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;[] oauthTokenExchangeBody = CreateTokenExchangeBody(reqData);

	var response = await reqData.GrantExchangeHttpClient.PostAsync(reqData.EndpointUrl,
		new FormUrlEncodedContent(oauthTokenExchangeBody));

	if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
	{
		var tokenResponse = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync&lt;OauthTokenExchangeSuccessResponse&gt;(
		await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());
		return tokenResponse;
	}

	if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)
	{
		// Unauthorized error
		var errorResult = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync&lt;OauthTokenExchangeErrorResponse&gt;(
	   await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());

		if (errorResult != null)
		{
			logger.LogInformation("{error} {error_description} {correlation_id} {trace_id}",
				errorResult.error,
				errorResult.error_description,
				errorResult.correlation_id,
				errorResult.trace_id);
		}
		else
		{
			logger.LogInformation("RequestDelegatedAccessToken Error, Unauthorized unknown reason");
		}
	}
	else
	{
		// unknown error, log
		logger.LogInformation("RequestDelegatedAccessToken Error unknown reason");
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>The CreateTokenExchangeBody creates the body. This is implemented for the delegated flow which requests an access token. The subject_token parameter is used to pass the Azure AD access token.</p>


  private static KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;[] CreateTokenExchangeBody(
	GetDelegatedApiTokenOAuthTokenExchangeModel reqData)
{
	// Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	var oauthTokenExchangeBody = new[]
	{
		new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;("grant_type", 
			OAuthGrantExchangeConsts.GRANT_TYPE),
		new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;("audience", reqData.Audience),
		new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;("subject_token_type", 
			OAuthGrantExchangeConsts.TOKEN_TYPE_ACCESS_TOKEN),
		new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;("subject_token", reqData.AccessToken),
		new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;("scope", reqData.Scope)

		// new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;("resource", "--optional--")
		// new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;("requested_token_type", "--optional--")
		// new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;("actor_token", "--optional--")
		// new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;("actor_token_type", "--optional--")
	};

	return oauthTokenExchangeBody;
}
  


<p>I created a consts class to implement the specification per defined string types.</p>


  public class OAuthGrantExchangeConsts
{
    public const string TOKEN_TYPE_ACCESS_TOKEN = "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token";
    public const string TOKEN_TYPE_REFRESH_TOKEN = "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token";
    public const string TOKEN_TYPE_ID_TOKEN = "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token";
    public const string TOKEN_TYPE_SAML1 = "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml1";
    public const string TOKEN_TYPE_SAML2 = "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2";

    public const string GRANT_TYPE = "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange";

    public const string ERROR_INVALID_REQUEST = "invalid_request";
    public const string ERROR_INVALID_CLIENT = "invalid_client";
    public const string ERROR_INVALID_GRANT = "invalid_grant";
    public const string ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED_CLIENT = "unauthorized_client";
    public const string ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_GRANT_TYPE = "unsupported_grant_type";
    public const string ERROR_INVALID_SCOPE = "invalid_scope";

    // ... more consts, see the code for the full definitions
}
  


<p>That’s all that is required to implement the client side of the OAuth Token exchange delegated flow. If you require other flow types from this specification, then this needs to be implemented. See the RFC docs for details (In the links below)</p>



 Implement the OAUTH 2.0 Token Exchange server 



<p>The server part of the flow needs to validate a few different things. The identity provider validates the POST request using BASIC authentication, then it validates the body of the HTTP POST request. The server needs to fully validate the Azure AD access token including the signature, aud and iss as per standard. Once the Azure AD token is validated, the claims can be used to authorize the identity delegated in the access token. Only delegated access tokens should be accepted and so in an Azure AD token V2, you can do this be checking for an oid claim and a scp claim. These claims might be renamed if using the default Microsoft namespaces. The server must match its users to the Azure AD users. You need to be careful when using emails for this. The Azure OID a good claim to use for this.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The server must do the following:</p>



 
 Validate the Basic authentication 



 Validate the body of the POST request as per standard 



 Validate the access token fully 



 Validate the claims, do the authorization 



 Generate the new access token as per standard 
 



<p></p>



 Validate Basic authentication 



<p>Basic authentication is used so that only confidential clients can use the API. This is not the strongest of authentication methods but it is how the specification recommends sending the clientId and clientSecret. The used authentication is validated using an Authorize attribute and the correct scheme.</p>


  [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = BasicAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]
[HttpPost("~/connect/oauthTokenExchangetoken"), Produces("application/json")]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Exchange([FromForm] OauthTokenExchangePayload oauthTokenExchangePayload)
{
	// Implement validate and create AT logic
}
  


<p>Once authenticated, the validation can begin.</p>



 Validate payload of POST request 



<p>The payload of the HTTP POST request is validated. This checks that the body has the expected values and the ones which are allowed. If any are incorrect, the error parameter of the unauthorized request is returned as defined in the specification.</p>


  var (Valid, Reason, Error) = ValidateOauthTokenExchangeRequestPayload
	.IsValid(oauthTokenExchangePayload, 
		_oauthTokenExchangeConfigurationConfiguration);

if(!Valid)
{
	return UnauthorizedValidationParametersFailed(
		oauthTokenExchangePayload, Reason, Error);
}
  


 Validate access token and signature 



<p>If the payload is validated, then the access token sent using the subject_token parameter is validated. This must be fully validated including the signature. The well known endpoints of the Azure AD identity provider is used to get the public keys of the certificate used to create the JWT token. This is used to validate the token signature. The iss and the aud are validated and checked against the expected values. </p>


  // get well known endpoints and validate access token sent in the assertion
var configurationManager = new ConfigurationManager&lt;OpenIdConnectConfiguration&gt;(
	_oauthTokenExchangeConfigurationConfiguration.AccessTokenMetadataAddress, 
	new OpenIdConnectConfigurationRetriever());

var wellKnownEndpoints =  await configurationManager
	.GetConfigurationAsync();

var accessTokenValidationResult = 
	ValidateOauthTokenExchangeRequestPayload.ValidateTokenAndSignature(
		oauthTokenExchangePayload.subject_token,
		_oauthTokenExchangeConfigurationConfiguration,
		wellKnownEndpoints.SigningKeys);

if(!accessTokenValidationResult.Valid)
{
	return UnauthorizedValidationTokenAndSignatureFailed(
		oauthTokenExchangePayload, accessTokenValidationResult);
}
  


<p>The ValidateTokenAndSignature method checks and validates the token.</p>


  public static (bool Valid, string Reason, ClaimsPrincipal? 
	ClaimsPrincipal) ValidateTokenAndSignature(
	string jwtToken, 
	OauthTokenExchangeConfiguration oboConfiguration, 
	ICollection&lt;SecurityKey&gt; signingKeys)
{
	try
	{
		var validationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
		{
			RequireExpirationTime = true,
			ValidateLifetime = true,
			ClockSkew = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1),
			RequireSignedTokens = true,
			ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
			IssuerSigningKeys = signingKeys,
			ValidateIssuer = true,
			ValidIssuer = oboConfiguration.AccessTokenAuthority,
			ValidateAudience = true, 
			ValidAudience = oboConfiguration.AccessTokenAudience
		};

		ISecurityTokenValidator tokenValidator = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();

		var claimsPrincipal = tokenValidator
			.ValidateToken(jwtToken, validationParameters, out var _);

		return (true, string.Empty, claimsPrincipal);
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		return (false, $"Access Token Authorization failed {ex.Message}", null);
	}
}
  


 Validate claims and authorize the access token 



<p>Now that the token is validated, the returned claimsPrincipal can be used to check and authorize the identity from the access token. The token must be validated that it is a delegated token and must contain a scp claim and an oid claim. The scp is what we added to use the service. We added an access_as_user claim. I would avoid roles as roles can be used for application tokens as well. I matched the name claim with the email from to the identity in the second IAM system. Using the OID claim would be a more trusted way of doing this.</p>


  // get claims from aad token and re use in OpenIddict token
var claimsPrincipal = accessTokenValidationResult.ClaimsPrincipal;

var isDelegatedToken = ValidateOauthTokenExchangeRequestPayload
	.IsDelegatedAadAccessToken(claimsPrincipal);

if (!isDelegatedToken)
{
	return UnauthorizedValidationRequireDelegatedTokenFailed();
}

var name = ValidateOauthTokenExchangeRequestPayload
	.GetPreferredUserName(claimsPrincipal);
var isNameAndEmail = ValidateOauthTokenExchangeRequestPayload
	.IsEmailValid(name);
if(!isNameAndEmail)
{
	return UnauthorizedValidationPrefferedUserNameFailed();
}

// validate user exists
var user = await _userManager.FindByNameAsync(name);
if (user == null)
{
	return UnauthorizedValidationNoUserExistsFailed();
}
  


<p>The delegated access token check is validated using the oid and the scp claims. Sometimes the claims get changed using the namespaces from Microsoft. I added a fallback check to validate both.</p>


  public static bool IsDelegatedAadAccessToken(ClaimsPrincipal claimsPrincipal)
{
	// oid if magic MS namespaces not user
	var oid = claimsPrincipal.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == 
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier");
	// scp if magic MS namespaces not added
	var scp = claimsPrincipal.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type 
		== "http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/scope");

	if (oid != null &amp;&amp; scp != null)
	{
		return true;
	}

	oid = claimsPrincipal.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "oid");
	scp = claimsPrincipal.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "scp");
	if (oid != null &amp;&amp; scp != null)
	{
		return true;
	}

	return false;
}
  


 Generate new access token 



<p>A new access token is created using the same certificate as the defualt one used by OpenIddict. This makes it possible to validate the token using the well known endpoints. </p>


  // use data and return new access token
var (ActiveCertificate, _) = await Startup.GetCertificates(_environment, _configuration);

var tokenData = new CreateDelegatedAccessTokenPayloadModel
{
	Sub = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
	ClaimsPrincipal = claimsPrincipal,
	SigningCredentials = ActiveCertificate,
	Scope = _oauthTokenExchangeConfigurationConfiguration.ScopeForNewAccessToken,
	Audience = _oauthTokenExchangeConfigurationConfiguration.AudienceForNewAccessToken,
	Issuer = _oauthTokenExchangeConfigurationConfiguration.IssuerForNewAccessToken,
	OriginalClientId = _oauthTokenExchangeConfigurationConfiguration.AccessTokenAudience
};

var accessToken = CreateDelegatedAccessTokenPayload.GenerateJwtTokenAsync(tokenData);

_logger.LogInformation("OBO new access token returned sub {sub}", tokenData.Sub);

if(IdentityModelEventSource.ShowPII)
{
	_logger.LogDebug("OBO new access token returned for sub {sub} for user {Username}", tokenData.Sub,
		ValidateOauthTokenExchangeRequestPayload.GetPreferredUserName(claimsPrincipal));
}

return Ok(new OauthTokenExchangeSuccessResponse
{
	expires_in = 60 * 60,
	access_token = accessToken,
	scope = oauthTokenExchangePayload.scope
});
  


<p>The claims are added like in the RFC specification.</p>


  public static string GenerateJwtTokenAsync(CreateDelegatedAccessTokenPayloadModel payload)
{
	SigningCredentials signingCredentials = new X509SigningCredentials(payload.SigningCredentials);

	var alg = signingCredentials.Algorithm;

	//{
	//  "alg": "RS256",
	//  "kid": "....",
	//  "typ": "at+jwt",
	//}

	var subject = new ClaimsIdentity(new[] {
			new Claim("sub", payload.Sub),              
			new Claim("scope", payload.Scope),
			new Claim("act", $"{{ \"sub\": \"{payload.OriginalClientId}\" }}", JsonClaimValueTypes.Json )
		});

	if(payload.ClaimsPrincipal != null)
	{
		var name = ValidateOauthTokenExchangeRequestPayload.GetPreferredUserName(payload.ClaimsPrincipal);
		var azp = ValidateOauthTokenExchangeRequestPayload.GetAzp(payload.ClaimsPrincipal);
		var azpacr = ValidateOauthTokenExchangeRequestPayload.GetAzpacr(payload.ClaimsPrincipal);

		if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
			subject.AddClaim(new Claim("name", name));

		if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
			subject.AddClaim(new Claim("azp", azp));

		if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
			subject.AddClaim(new Claim("azpacr", azpacr));
	}

	var tokenHandler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();
	var tokenDescriptor = new SecurityTokenDescriptor
	{       
		Subject = subject,
		Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1),
		IssuedAt = DateTime.UtcNow,
		Issuer = "https://localhost:44318/",
		Audience = payload.Audience,
		SigningCredentials = signingCredentials,
		TokenType = "at+jwt"
	};

	tokenDescriptor.AdditionalHeaderClaims ??= new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();

	if (!tokenDescriptor.AdditionalHeaderClaims.ContainsKey("alg"))
	{
		tokenDescriptor.AdditionalHeaderClaims.Add("alg", alg);
	}

	var token = tokenHandler.CreateToken(tokenDescriptor);

	return tokenHandler.WriteToken(token);
}
  


<p>Start all the applications and if everything is configured correctly with your Azure AD tenant, the data from the OpenIddict protected API can be used and displayed in the Azure AD UI.</p>

   Mastodon is not the fediverse and in my check_webfinger! post, I’m afraid I made that assumption.  In particular, I concluded 

 
   So, from the perspective of mastodon, the domain component of your identifier you are known as is determined by which domain serves your actor document rather than the domain serving the original “well known” webfinger document. 
 

 which is not necessarily true if

  <p>Mastodon is not the fediverse and in my <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2022/12/23/check_webfinger/">check_webfinger!</a> post, I’m afraid I made that assumption.  In particular, I concluded</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, from the perspective of mastodon, the domain component of your identifier you are known as is determined by which domain serves your actor document rather than the domain serving the original “well known” webfinger document.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is not necessarily true if you consider the fediverse outside of Mastodon.</p>

<p>Instead, it seems that I should have said that the domain component of your identifier is determined by the domain component of the subject field returned in the webfinger response from the domain that serves your actor document when mastodon makes its 2nd webfinger request which is done in the <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L48">check_webfinger!</a> method.</p>

  <code>  def check_webfinger!
    webfinger                            = webfinger!("acct:#{@username}@#{@domain}")
    confirmed_username, confirmed_domain = split_acct(webfinger.subject)
</code> 
 

<p>In the code above, the @domain passed to webfinger! is the domain of the server providing the activitypub actor document but the confirmed_domain can be different (e.g. your personal domain) if your original “well known” webfinger document was not pointing to a Mastodon server for providing the actor document.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you have a static personal website, it is not necessary to also host the actor document there as long as the fediverse node providing the actor document is smart enough to provide your personal domain in the subject when mastodon makes a webfinger call to it.  A caveat is that such a fediverse node accomodating personal domains would not be able to distinguish between bob@a.com and bob@b.com when mastodon webfingers server.com for bob@server.com.</p>

 事件概要 



<p>Bloomberg英語版の2023年1月6日 5:17 JSTの報道によると、twitterから漏洩したとみられる2.3億人を超えるユーザの情報が、掲示板「BreachForum」に掲載されたとのことです。入っている情報は、Eメールアドレス、ツイッター・ハンドル（@ から始まる名前。わたしの場合は <a href="https://twitter.com/_nat">@_nat</a> )、フルネーム（←なんのことやら）とのことですが、このエントリーを書いていてふと思い立ってpiyologさんを見に行ったら「Twitterから流出したとみられる約2億件のデータについてまとめてみた」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5110" title="<a href=&quot;https://piyolog.hatenadiary.jp/entry/2023/01/07/000622&quot;>https://piyolog.hatenadiary.jp/entry/2023/01/07/000622</a>">2</a>にずっと詳しくまとめてありました。それによると</p>

<p>が入っているようです。piyokangoさん、さすが。逆に、Bloomberg、ちゃんと書け。</p>



<p>このデータは新たに抜かれたものではなくて、2021年6月から2022年1月まで存在していたTwitter APIの「脆弱性」を使って抜かれたのだろうとのこと。この脆弱性自体は2022年1月にtwitter社に報告され、即時に修正されたもので、twitter社の2022年8月5日付けの報告<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5110" title="<a href=&quot;https://privacy.twitter.com/en/blog/2022/an-issue-affecting-some-anonymous-accounts&quot;>An incident impacting some accounts and private information on Twitter</a>">3</a>によると、「もしだれかがEメールアドレスないしは電話番号をTwitterのシステムに送ると、Twitterのシステムはその人に、それらが紐付けられたtwitterアカウントがある場合それを返す<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5110" title="原文: 「if someone submitted an email address or phone number to Twitter’s systems, Twitter&amp;#8217;s systems would tell the person what Twitter account the submitted email addresses or phone number was associated with, if any. 」(出所) 上記twitter社2022年8月5日付報告(2023年1月6日取得) ">4</a>」というものだったようです<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-5110" title="より詳しい情報を <a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bulkneets/status/1611720988152201216&quot;>mala さんに教えていただきました</a>。「<a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/reports/1439026&quot;>Discoverability by phone number/email restriction bypass</a>」に詳細があり、これを読めばといういうものであったかがわかります。 (1/11追記) ">5</a>。</p>



<p>このAPI脆弱性が実際に悪用されたのはすでに2022年7月にわかっていました。上記で抜けるのはツイッター・ハンドルだけのように報告書からは読めますが、ツイッター・ハンドルがわかれば、ハンドルに結び付けられたTwitterプロフィールの「名前」もわかりますから、BreachForumに掲載されたのはそれまでに抜かれたデータに、公開情報としてある「名前」を結びつけたものかもしれません。そもそも2022年12月23日にはこれに加えて電話番号もある約4億件のデータが「20万ドルで独占販売又は6万ドルで複数販売」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-5110" title="出所: 上記piyolog記事">6</a>されていたようですから、ここから重複をとったりしてクレンジングしたデータかも知れません。より詳しい内容は piyolog 記事<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-5110" title="https://piyolog.hatenadiary.jp/entry/2023/01/07/000622">7</a>を御覧ください。</p>



 悪用の可能性／リスク 



<p>まず最初にいっておきますが、パスワードは漏れていないのでこれ直接の不正ログインのリスクはありません。ただし、これを機にログインを見直し、FIDO認証器やワンタイムパスワード(OTP)のを設定するのは有用ですからぜひやってください。実際にこれは上記8/5付Twitter社報告でも推奨しています。（逆に、Bloombergさん、「ログイン中に「アカウント」タブでパスワードを変更すべきだ」と高度認証の前にこれを持ってくるのは何？そういうとこだぞ。）</p>



<p>ではリスクに入ります。まず、2022年8月発表の脆弱性の悪用リスクから考えます。</p>



 リスク１：メアドおよび電話番号を使って表アカウントとサブ垢<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-5110" title="サブアカウント">8</a>、裏垢<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-5110" title="裏アカウント">9</a>が名寄せされる 



<p>リスク内容：メールアドレスあるいは電話番号をキーにサブ垢、裏垢を結び付けられるのは、一部個人にとっては最大のリスクでしょうね。これによって、サブ垢の過去のツイートを辿ってあれやこれや言われたり場合によっては脅迫されるとかも出てくるでしょう。元の脆弱性の報告でもこうした名寄せを最大のリスクとして挙げていました。</p>



<p>対策：うーん。起きてしまった分にはなかなか難しいです。サブ垢・裏垢削除は、まだ魚拓など取られていない前提であればある程度効果が見込めます。ただ、逆にツイ消しやアカ消ししていることをなじられる可能性もあります。やましいことがあるんだろうと。</p>



<p>今後に関しては、サブ垢・裏垢を作る場合には、メアドも携帯電話番号も別のものを使いましょう。なお、このブログエントリーを書こうと思ったのは、この辺の深堀（後述）が目的ですので、ぜひそちらも御覧ください。</p>



 リスク２：この情報を使ってフィッシングされる 



<p>リスク内容： たとえそれが公開されていたり漏れていたりする情報であったとしても、本人にとって正しく見える情報を提示されて危機感を煽られると、つい詐欺に騙されてしまいがちになります。「あなたの2015年1月5日開設のツイッターアカウント「<a href="https://tiwtter.com/_nat">＠_nat</a>」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-5110" title="1/11まで @example にしていたのですが、実在アカウントだったので急遽自分のアドレスに変更しました。ご迷惑はかかってないとは思いますが、すみません…">10</a>（メールアドレス: nat@example.com）のパスワードが漏洩しました。次のサイトに行って至急パスワードをリセットしてください」みたいに登録してある携帯電話番号 080-0987-6543<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-5110" title="これは、存在し得ない電話番号です。例に使える番号ということで調べました">11</a> にSMSでメッセージがきたりしたら、ついやっちゃいますよね？</p>



<p>対策：ブルンバーグが勧めるようなパスワードの変更は意味がありません。Twitterが勧めるような2要素認証は、「セキュリティ・キー」を選択すればほぼ確実な効果が見込まれます。テキストメッセージや認証アプリを使ったOTPはフィッシングには脆弱ですのでこのリスクの対策にはなりません。（過去に漏洩したパスワードによる攻撃などには効果がありますが）</p>



 リスク３：プロファイリングに使われる 



<p>リスク内容： 漏れた情報およびそこから引っ張ってこれる情報と、自社でもともと持っていた情報をメアド or 電話番号で紐づけて、ターゲティング用のプロファイリングに利用される。</p>



<p>対策：現実的な、つまり費用対効果が見込める対策はあんまり無いです。なにか思いついたらコメントに書いてください。</p>



 リスク４：スパムに悩まされる/DDoS攻撃 



<p>リスク内容：一般人の場合、漏れたメアドや電話番号にスパムが来て、作業や自由時間に割り込みが入ったり、見落としてはいけないメッセージを見落としたりする、というような感じでしょうか。有名人の場合、DDoSアタックになりえますね。</p>



<p>対策：せっかく重要な相手にしか開示していないメアド・番号で見落としが無かった、という方には残念なおしらせになりますね。現在開示している相手をホワイトリストに入れて、あとは叩き落とすとか、番号を変えるとかしないとならないかも知れません。特に電話の場合は、局側での対応が可能でないと、その電話番号は使い物にならなくなる可能性があります。</p>



<p>その他まだまだ精査すればあるでしょうが、とりあえずこんなところで。思いついたものがあったら、コメントに書いていただければ幸いです。</p>



 識別子問題 



<p>このブログを書き出したときには「ツイッター、2.3億人超える情報流出事件を題材に識別子問題を考えてみる」というタイトルで、識別子問題を深掘しようと思っていたのですが、だいぶ長くなったしもう朝の3時近くて疲れたので、今回はここまでにします。書こうかなと思っていたのは、</p>



 
 識別子とクレデンシャルの混同問題：当初の「脆弱性」って、実はこの辺からくる仕様上のバグだったんじゃないのという感想を持ったので、ここを書こうと思ったのがそもそものこのエントリ執筆のきっかけです。そこまで行く前に力尽きたけど。「そんなバカな」と思うでしょうけど、この混同ってわりとあるんですよ。特に、パスワードリセットにこれらを使っているような場合。まぁ、twitterの場合はそうじゃなかったと信じたいところですが。 



 アカウント間名寄せ問題：リスクの項で触れたはなしが主になります。これに加えて、次の話もあります。
 
 仮名アカウントのときのバックアップ認証手段の話 



 再利用可能識別子を使った場合のバックアップ認証手段の混同問題 
 
 



 Twitterによるメアド・電話番号の目的外利用問題：バックアップ認証手段として取得していたこれらを、ターゲティングに使っていたという話。
 
 詳細はこの辺→ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21353232/twitter-ftc-fine-misused-email-phone-advertising-2011-settlement">Twitter faces $250 million FTC fine for misusing emails and phone numbers</a> (2020-08-04) 
 
 
 



<p>識別子については、昨年暮れに新設した日本語Youtubeチャンネルで解説を始めています（まだ2023年1月7日段階で第1回しかアップロードしてません）。</p>



<p>この第1回では、<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak3nSqwro9I">「識別子の分類とリスク：識別子徹底攻略①」</a><a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/01/5110/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-5110" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak3nSqwro9I">12</a>と題して識別子の分類とリスクについてお話しています（下に掲載しておきました）。これを見ていただくとわかりますが、メールアドレスも電話番号も基本的に再利用可能識別子になります。また、無指向性識別子でもありますし、多くの場合継続的識別子でもあるでしょう。3年毎にメアドと携帯電話番号を変えるって人、ほぼいませんよね。こういったことを勘案しながら、この事件から得られる教訓を書こうと思っていたのです。が、それはまた別の機会にということで。</p>



<p>それではまた！</p>

    I have explored <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/mapping-identity-and-privacy-on-peak-paradox">privacy and identity in a previous post</a>, taken from the perspective of the individual.&nbsp; <p>This post is from the perspective of the state/ nation/ law. I commented on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/privacyshaman/">Michael Becker's</a> LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7014675467131654144/">post</a> about his list of words and definitions for the <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IdP_PDI_Key_Terms_To_Support_Business_Strategy_For_2023_and_Beyond-Report_31DEC22-3.pdf.">identity/ privacy space</a>. I commented that everyone remains fixated on making their particular solution work to a problem the user has not got which is "#privacy." Whilst every language and country has an ideal notion of privacy, the wide variety of cultures means there is no unified “concept of privacy”, even if privacy is explicitly named or defined in their specific language law or culture.</p><p>I asked #chatGPT, the “AI” bot from Google, the question, “how would a capitalist and socialist view privacy?”&nbsp;</p><p>“Capitalists would see privacy as an important aspect of individual liberty and autonomy and they view privacy as a property right that can be traded or sold, and they may support policies that allow companies to collect and use personal data as long as they have obtained the necessary consent.</p><p>A socialist would define privacy as the right to personal autonomy and control over one's own thoughts, feelings, and personal information. It is the ability to make decisions about how and with whom one shares personal information, without interference or coercion from external forces such as the government or capitalist institutions. In a socialist society, privacy would be protected as a fundamental human right and would be respected and upheld by the community as a whole.”</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stjohndeakins/">StJohn Deakins</a> added to the comments by suggesting we move on from ideals of the political spectrum to examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Korea:&nbsp; dictatorship with command economy:&nbsp; Kim owns you and owns your data, including your thoughts (rights to brain data will become a seriously scary "thing" in the next decade)</p><p>China: one-party state, ruling on behalf of 'the people’ with a state-controlled market economy: the party owns you and your data (on behalf of the Chinese people)</p><p>USA: individualist democracy with a free market (where companies have the same legal rights as individuals).&nbsp; You own your data, and others own it, too (lots of them).</p><p>EU:&nbsp; social democracy with a free market (where markets serve people, and people choose how). You own your data (as a human right). You, in theory, participate in choosing how.</p><br><p>It is remarkably common that concepts can be well-defined in language and law, but there remains to be a wide variance in the understanding and use. Words and language are dynamic and never stationary, and we should not try to own or control them,&nbsp; defining for a context is critical. &nbsp; Just consider love, truth, safety, honesty, work, trust, beauty and risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Plotting Privacy on the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak-Paradox</a> framework makes me consider how the different interruptions are framed by the purposes presented in the mapping.&nbsp; It is evident that the interruption for privacy must vary as we move about our understanding of what we are optimising for. Within Peaks, such as the Peak Individual Purpose, there is a creation of dilemmas, for example, Mark Zuckerberg, who wants privacy for himself but not for any of his #meta users.</p><p></p><p>To add an additional layer to the complexity onion of privacy, it should be noted that the concept of privacy probably exists in each of us until there is an external demand or constraint.&nbsp; As unpacked in this <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/we-can-be-very-good-at-answering-questions-but-why-dont-we-challenge-them-cd55f12504bc">post</a>, where I pick up on the work of two behavioural scientists, John Darley and Daniel Batson, who published in 1973 “From Jerusalem to Jericho: A study of Situational and Dispositional Variables in Helping Behavior.” It was an investigation into the psychology of prosocial behaviour. The research demonstrates that when we introduce time pressure, our dispositional factors (I like privacy) stand for nothing and that we will act differently because of the constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>When you design for privacy, you need to understand what the user is optimising for and be aware that your design will change what privacy means to the users because it is a constraint. </p> <br>

Oh, we don’t have that data!</p><p>But we can create constraints that mean we get biased data as we don’t understand human behaviour in context.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>----</p><p>In 1973 two behavioural scientists, John Darley and Daniel Batson published "<a href="https://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/darley_samarit.html">From Jerusalem to Jericho: A study of Situational and Dispositional Variables in Helping Behavior</a>." It was an investigation into the psychology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosocial_behavior">prosocial behaviour</a>.</p><p>Darley and Batson picked students who were studying to be priests at the Princeton Theological Seminary to determine how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(psychology)">situational factors</a> influenced prosocial behaviour. Hypothesis: When someone is kind to another, is that because he or she has some innate qualities that lead to kindness—or because some situational factors simply determine and allow for kind behaviours.</p><p>The famous study was across three days in late fall; they had a bunch of seminary students come to a building, meet with a researcher, and fill out a bunch of surveys. The surveys partly addressed if the students were religious primarily for intrinsic or for extrinsic reasons (with “intrinsic reasons” being like “I am motivated to do good in the world” and “extrinsic reasons” being like “I really want to get into heaven.”). Then the participants were told that they needed to prepare a brief talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan">The Good Samaritan</a> — which is a story about how a hapless victim on the side of the road was just passed by holy individuals, whilst a non-holy Samaritan took the time to stop and help the fellow out. The story's context is significant as the participants were told that they needed to walk to a nearby building to meet up with another team member and then give their sermon. However, using random selection, the student was told that they:</p>  <p>Had plenty of time, and were early.</p>  <p>Were on time, but should head over now so as not to be late, or</p>  <p>We're running late, and really needed to run without delay - no excuse.</p>  <p>Obviously, the situation was rigged, and all participants found a fallen stranger (an actor) in a narrow alleyway who acted sick on the ground and in need of help. The narrow alleyway was selected as there was a choice: help this guy or step over him!</p><p>The “time constraint” crafted behavioural change as:</p>  <p>63% of participants in the “early” condition stopped to help the stranger.</p>  <p>45% of participants in the “on-time” condition stopped to help the stranger.</p>  <p>10% of participants in the “late” condition stopped to help the stranger.</p>  <p>60% of the participants were unwilling to help the “victim.” This is ironic because the participants were Princeton students studying to be priests and about to give a talk on the lessons of the Good Samaritan, but this was manipulated because of the constraints.</p><p>A side note before the core finding is that dispositional factors (what you believed) had no bearing on helping behaviour. In other words, people who reported as religious for intrinsic reasons were no more likely than others to stop to help.</p><p>When it comes to human behaviour, we have a strong bias toward thinking that people do what they do because of internal traits that drive their behaviours (<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_url?url=https://www.academia.edu/download/44555984/The_Overconfidence_Effect_in_Social_Pred20160408-26208-183abhi.pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uTG0Y4XNFbiVy9YPs4i3gAs&amp;scisig=AAGBfm0h9KIeZBrdoprM3zslLQV3M3g86g&amp;oi=scholarr">Dunning, Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1990</a>). The Overconfidence Effect in Social Prediction.&nbsp; Data shows us that dispositional factors are relatively weak predictors of what we do, whilst situational factors (which we cannot see or measure and often seem benign or inconsequential) play a powerful role in shaping our behaviours.</p><br><p>We can only answer the question we have data to, but that does not mean the answer is right or the data is a good predictor because we don't understand the constraints.&nbsp;</p> CEO Take Away <p>If data supports your decisions, who is accountable and responsible for ensuring it answers the question we want and is not just data without context?&nbsp; In the next board agenda, put an item as part of AOB, “Do we understand situational bias in our data?” If there is no debate or looks of bewilderment, perhaps it is time to ask better questions of those who think that the data is accurate.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br><br>

Petals is a fascinating attempt to address that problem: it works a little bit like BitTorrent, in that each user of Petal runs a subset of the overall language model on their machine and participates in a larger network to run inference across potentially hundreds of distributed GPUs. I tried it just now in Google Colab and it worked exactly as advertised, after downloading an 8GB subset of the 352GB BLOOM-176B model.</p>

  <p>Summary: Making onboarding easier would result in better customer experience, more customers, and reduced support costs.</p>


<p>
    Last week a friend referred me to a question on Guru.com about devices for connected cars. Since I used to do <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/fuse.shtml">Fuse</a>, he figured I might be able to help. I was happy to. Unfortunately, Guru wasn't so happy to let me. 
</p>

<p>
    You can't answer a question at Guru.com without registering, enrolling, and onboarding. Fair enough. So I started down the path. Here's their process:
</p>
 
     Enter name and email on first screen. 
     Choose whether you're en employer or freelancer and set your password. Be sure to follow their password conventions. Then agree to the terms of service and agree to get emails (or not). 
     Enter the four-digit code that was sent to the email address you gave in (1). 
     Solve the captcha. 
     Choose whether to use 2FA or security questions to secure your account. I chose 2FA. 
     Verify your phone number using SMS or WhatsApp (they recommend WhatsApp). I chose SMS.  
     Enter the 4 digit code they send. 
     Continue with 2FA. I'm not sure why this screen shows up twice. 
     Logout and log back in. 
     Scan the QR code to set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password">TOTP</a> authenticator. 
     Enter the one-time code from the authenticator app. 
     Upload a photo and enter a mailing address (yes, they're required). 
 

<p>
    Congratulations! You've gone through Guru's twelve step program and you're registered! I went through all this just to discover I can't answer questions unless I pay them money. I bailed.
</p>

<p>
    As I was going though this, I couldn't help thinking how much easier it could be using verifiable credentials.
</p>
 
     Enter an email. 
     Scan the QR code they present using my <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/12/wallets_and_agents.shtml">smart wallet</a> to establish a DID connection. 
     Verify information about myself that they ask for using verifiable credentials.

    Credentials asserting your verified email and phone number would be easy enough to get if I don't already have them. And they've not verifying address and photo anyway, so there's no need for anything but a self-asserted credential for that. Admittedly, if I've never used verifiable credentials before they need to coach me on getting a wallet and the phone and email address credential. But they're already doing that for the authenticator app in step 10 above.
</p>

<p>
    Guru's registration process is one of the most arduous I have encountered. If I were them and unwilling to use verifiable credentials, I'd at least split it up and let people add their photo, address, and authenticator app after they're already on board. Guru.com (and lots of other web sites) have to be shedding potential customers at every step in their onboarding process. I wonder if they keep track of abandoned registrations and where it happens? Does anyone? I'd love to know the numbers. 
</p>

<p>
    Verifiable credentials could make the onboarding experience a breeze, get more customers in the door, and reduce the cost of customer support calls associated with it.

<p>This article looks at Azure Active directory and consent with multi-tenant Azure App registrations. Consent works different depending on the user type, the tenant policies and the required permissions. It is sometimes hard to understand why a user cannot login or where the consent has to be given for a specific Azure App registration which exposes permissions or business functions.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreTenantSelect">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreTenantSelect</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>An Azure App registration was setup as a Web client using a secret which uses some basic delegated permissions. The Azure App registration is a multi-tenant application. You can verify that the Azure App registration is a multi-tenant one by opening the manifest file and checking the signInAudience property.</p>


  "signInAudience": "AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount",
  


<p>You can also check this directly in the portal using the authentication blade.</p>







<p></p>



<p>When using a delegated multi-tenant Azure App registration you do NOT give consent using the Azure App registration. You give consent to a user or an administrator using the Enterprise application created for your tenant for the Azure App registration. Each multi-tenant Azure App registration can have multiple Enterprise applications each which would require consent depending on the user type, the tenant policies and the permissions required.</p>



<p></p>



<p>An ASP.NET Core application was implemented to authenticate using Azure AD and because it’s a multi-tenant application, any Azure AD user from any tenant could authenticate using the application. When using multi-tenant applications, you need to restrict the access by validating the acr claims, the user and other such authorization checks.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the ASP.NET Core authentication. This hides and renames the OpenID Connect standards which are used. These packages are optimized for ASP.NET Core and uses MSAL.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));
  


<p>The Micorosoft.Identity.Web package uses the AzureAd configuration per default which can be renamed if required. The TenantId is set to common for the multi-tenant access.</p>


    "AzureAd": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
    // Use common for multi tenant applications
    "TenantId": "common",
    "ClientId": "086233fd-a846-47e0-a057-7aa05b5a5479", 
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/SignoutCallbackOidc"
    // "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
  },
  


 Grant consent as an admin  



<p>When you authenticate from the application for the first time as an Azure administrator user, a consent screen which allows you to Consent of behalf of your organization is displayed. If you check the checkbox, all users and administrators can use the application. If you do not check this checkbox and you give only your consent, only you can use the application and other administrator users can give consent as well. No Azure AD user can access with this consent. </p>







<p></p>



 Grant consent as a user  



<p>When an Azure AD user uses the application (not an administrator) and no admin consent has already been set for the tenant, the consent screen, is displayed for the user if only not admin delegated permissions are required and the tenant policy allows this. A user could then give a user consent for this account.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Normally the user requires an administrator to give admin consent for all user before a user of a specific tenant can access the application.</p>







 Enterprise application 



<p>If an administrator has already given a user consent for their own account, an Azure Enterprise application is created inside the tenant. You can view all the user consents already given in the permissions blade. </p>







<p></p>



 Grant consent for the whole tenant using the portal 



<p>You could give consent for all users using this application. This would be required if no consent has been given for all users but the IT admin has already consented for a single account.</p>







<p></p>



 Remove consent using the Enterprise application 



<p>It is really important to remove consent if no longer used. This can be done in the Enterprise application created from the Azure App registration for the specific tenant. This can be done in the properties blade.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Consent can be hard to setup on a specific tenant because this depends on different setups. The account type, the Azure AD policies and the required permissions all change how the consent is displayed, blocked or can be given. You should also verify the tenant where the multi-tenant Azure App registration is implemented. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/22/lists-and-people-on-mastodon/">Lists and people on Mastodon</a> I showed how I added a list column to the following tab of the Mastodon browser I’m building. That was a step in the direction of easier and more powerful list management. It enables me to see whether the people I follow are assigned to lists, and to consider who should be on a list (or perhaps on a different list). </p>
<p>Today, as I began to use that new affordance in earnest, I discovered a new challenge. In order to assign someone to a list, or change a list assignment, I clicked the link in the account_url column to open that person’s profile in the Mastodon web app. That was fine for accounts on my home server, mastodon.social. An account URL like Shelley Powers’ <a href="https://mastodon.social/@burningbird">https://mastodon.social/@burningbird</a> brings me to Shelley’s profile on my home server where the list manager is available. </p>
<p>But if I’m following someone elsewhere, like Ward Cunningham at <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox">https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox</a>, the account URL brings me to Ward’s profile on that server where the list manager isn’t available. In order to assign Ward to a list I had to capture his account URL, paste it into the search box in my home server’s web app, and then click the resulting link: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a>.</p>
<p>That got old real fast, so I adjusted the following tab to display the latter flavor of URL which I’ll call an instance-qualified URL. </p>
<p>Steampipe provides a few ways to make that adjustment. As a user of the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboard</a>, you can use Postgres’ regular expression functions to do the transformation in the SQL query that drives the view. But you’d rather not have to. It’s much nicer if the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">plugin</a> does that for you, so the SQL can just refer to a column called instance_qualified_url. </p>
<p>I chose the latter approach. As the author of a Steampipe plugin you want to make life as easy as possible for users of the plugin. When you’re the author of both the plugin and the dashboard, as I am in this case, you can enjoy a nice virtuous cycle. As the dashboard evolves you discover ways to improve the plugin, which leads to more use of the dashboard, which suggests further opportunities to improve the plugin. I have been greatly enjoying the coevolution of these two components!</p>
 Adding a new column to a Steampipe table 
<p>To make the change, I extended the structure that defines the columns of the tables mapped from Mastodon <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Account/">Account API</a>. A Steampipe plugin defines columns using a list of structs like this.</p>
 ...,
{
	Name:        "url",
	Type:        proto.ColumnType_STRING,
	Description: "URL for the account.",
},
...,
 
<p>That struct says: “When the name of a top-level field in the API response is url, tell Steampipe to make a database column with that name and with the Postgres type text.” </p>
<p>You can also transform values in API responses to synthesize new columns that don’t appear in API responses. Here’s the struct I added for this case.</p>
 ...,
{	
	Name:        "instance_qualified_account_url",
	Type:        proto.ColumnType_STRING,
	Description: "Account URL prefixed with my instance.",
	Transform:   transform.FromValue().Transform(instanceQualifiedAccountUrl),
},
...
 
<p>That one says: “Send the API response to the transform function instanceQualifiedAccountUrl, and use its result as the value of the column.</p>
<p>Here’s the function.</p>
 func instanceQualifiedAccountUrl(ctx context.Context, input *transform.TransformData) (interface{}, error) {
	url := input.Value.(*mastodon.Status).Account.URL
	qualifiedUrl := qualifiedUrl(ctx, url)
	return qualifiedUrl, nil
}
 
<p>It delegates the real work to another function.</p>
 func qualifiedUrl(ctx context.Context, url string) string {
	plugin.Logger(ctx).Debug("instanceQualifiedUrl", "server", homeServer, "url", url)
	re := regexp.MustCompile(`https://([^/]+)/@(.+)`)
	matches := re.FindStringSubmatch(url)
	if len(matches) == 0 {
		return url
	}
	person := matches[1]
	server := matches[2]
	qualifiedUrl := fmt.Sprintf("%s/@%s@%s", homeServer, server, person)
	plugin.Logger(ctx).Debug("instanceQualifiedUrl", "qualifiedUrl", qualifiedUrl)
	schemelessHomeServer := strings.ReplaceAll(homeServer, "https://", "")
	qualifiedUrl = strings.ReplaceAll(qualifiedUrl, "@"+schemelessHomeServer, "")
	plugin.Logger(ctx).Debug("qualifiedUrl", "qualifiedUrl", qualifiedUrl)
	return qualifiedUrl
}
 
<p>Why? Two different sets of column definitions need the same transformation. instanceQualifiedAccountUrl works with responses from the Account API. But account URLs also appear in the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/Status/">Status API</a> that drives timeline views. Those use a different transform function, instanceQualifiedStatusUrl, to do the same transformation for a different API response.</p>
 From account URLs to status URLs 
<p>The instanceQualifiedAccountUrl column solved the original problem. I was able to remove my plugin-author hat, put on my dashboard-author hat, and refer to account urls as instance-qualified URLs in all the tabs that display them. Any such link now leads to a profile that I view through the lens of mastodon.social and that enables me to use the web app’s list manager directly, without the cumbersome copy/paste/search procedure.</p>
<p>My happy dance didn’t last long, though. Newly sensitized to that copy/paste/search friction, I realized it was still happening when I try to reply to items that appear in a timeline view. Here is a recent example: <a href="https://techpolicy.social/@mnot/109610641523489182">https://techpolicy.social/@mnot/109610641523489182</a>.</p>
<p>That’s the URL displayed in the dashboard. When I click it I land on Mark’s server and can view the item, but if I try to reply I’m confronted with the dreaded copy/paste/search operation.</p>
<p>No problem! I’ll use a similar transform! Not so fast. I can form an URL like <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mnot@techpolicy.social/109610641523489182">https://mastodon.social/@mnot@techpolicy.social/109610641523489182</a> but it doesn’t go anywhere. </p>
<p>If I do the copy/paste/search operation, I land on a similar-but-different URL: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mnot@techpolicy.social/109610641692667630">https://mastodon.social/@mnot@techpolicy.social/109610641692667630</a>. It has the same structure but a different toot ID. This URL is also the one that appears in the web app’s home timeline, which is why I can reply directly from that view. </p>
<p>I’m out of my depth here so I’ll just end with an appeal for help. It makes sense that a home server will assign its own id to an item fetched from a foreign server, and that the web app will use that id. But I’m not seeing a way to aquire that id directly from the API. I suspect it’s possible to acquire it by way of search, but doing that for every item in a timeline will quickly exhaust the tight budget for API requests (just 300 every 5 minutes).</p>
<p>So, Lazy Mastodon, am I just stuck here or is there a way to transform foreign status URLs into instance-relative status URLs?</p>
 Update: Solved! 
<p>After <a href="https://mastodon.social/@judell/109610845971691248">chatting with Jari Pennanen</a> I took another look and realized the needed ID was available in the API response after all, I just wasn’t using it (facepalm). And in fact there are two flavors of the ID — one for original toots, another for boosts. Columns for both cases are added <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/commit/c3f7e64f5353a1bd09e4db76e0ff4b08792478ff">here</a> and the tweak to make the dashboard use them <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/commit/204b1b61c30f399627661ec7a954920594fc3e97">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/instance-qualified-url.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>Thanks for being my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck</a>, Jari! The instance-qualified toot and reblog URLs make this dashboard massively more useful.</p>

The previous time, I was toting a MacBook laptop computer, and purchased an Apple-specific adapter kit basically built to plug into half of the 10-watt USB adapter. Not as versatile, and a great deal bulkier, but it did the job for me back in 2018.</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiG7PkZwuJfz2uOf2YyRKeHYw2_qo2BkTNcUumesMoR43M83U8AvE7_kOsvTwtXRT7k_gLTJ0wBtn38zaOmraoqSLiJiPRxMT5rAAFlJJ0wvXeQ4_RAkQIWbDT7AeSx2-8bGbFZYrg3S7u_wIfl-7B0K9YrUV1AiLIQg2IJWUuM7CMqu8rjb7_a3ZT8Yw/s2016/OneWorld%2065%20adapter%20in%20Europe.jpg"></a> The OneWorld 65 is a nice progression and compression of key functions of an international adapter, from the jigsaw-puzzle-looking box of Apple stuff to a simple brick. It can charge up to 6 devices simultaneously and is said to work in more than 200 countries. (I will never travel that much, so I'm taking OneAdapter.com's word for it.)<br><p></p><p>In keeping with how charging interfaces are evolving, the OneWorld 65 has two standard USB-C charging ports, 2 USB-A charing ports, and a 65-watt USB-C charging port for the newer laptops that support USB-C.</p><p>In late November and early December, I traveled to Austria, eventually joining the American Beethoven Society on a tour of musical landmarks, including a week in Vienna, and a side trip to Salzburg. Pictured here is the One World 65 in action in my Vienna hotel. To use, I selected between European Union, UK, or U.S. plugs (in Austria, it was EU all the way) and found the OneWorld 65 to plug easily into all such power outlets in various hotel rooms. The USB ports are on the bottom of the unit, and one is on the right side. I didn't come close to using all six outlets at once, but it's great to have the capacity.<br><br>I had one issue, and it wasn't a deal-breaker. I attempted to plug some 110-volt U.S. plugs into the outlet provided on the top of the front as pictured, but was unable to do so. When I returned to the U.S., I contacted OneAdaptr.com, and they suggested I use more force to insert such plugs. I tried various 110-volt plugs at home, and while I did have success with one such plug, I could not insert other plugs I tried, no matter how much force I applied. The blue plastic inside acts as a protection guard, and perhaps with repeated use, I will find it easier to insert any such plug.<br><br>Despite this issue, I recommend the OneWorld 65 for international travel. It's great to see so much versality in such a small package selling for less than $70. It travels well, and I will put it through its paces again in 2023.</p>

<p>Of the 48 with matching usernames, 36 also tweeted today. </p>
<p>So there’s my answer: 75% of the people who appeared in my Mastodon home timeline (when I sampled it just now) also appeared on Twitter today.</p>

<p>On a hike today my friend noticed a clump of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria">Amanita Muscaria</a> and took away this glorious specimen. As we headed down the trail he said: “I can never see one of these without hearing the music from Super Mario Brothers — beep, boop.” He went on to explain that the spotted red mushroom was a coveted power-up that made Mario grow large.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/super-mario-amanita.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>I knew nothing about this. I have never played Super Mario Brothers, or any other iconic game, or really any computer-based game at all, except briefly in the early 1990s when I played Rogue during an office craze that lasted a few weeks, and around the same time played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putt-Putt_(series)">Putt-Putt</a> with our young kids. </p>
<p>This seems unusual for someone like me. I have spent my adult life deeply engrossed in computer-based activity, and am often described to others, by friends and family, as a “computer guy.” That makes me a geek and/or nerd by definition. But I’ve never been comfortable with either of those terms. </p>
<p>Over the years I’ve known a great many others in the geek/nerd tribe who self-identify as gamers. It always puzzles me. I’m perfectly happy to spend long hours in front of a screen reading or writing or coding. But games? I simply lack that gene. It baffles me how other members of the tribe — especially adults who like me already put in long hours in front of screens — could then pile up more screen time playing games, when they could be outside hiking, or cycling, or gardening, or doing really anything else at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps this explains my reluctance to self-identify as a member of the geek/nerd tribe. If I really belonged I’d be gamer. Since I’m not I must be an impostor. I wonder if there’s a word — in some other language than English probably — for when you share certain core attributes with a tribe but not others?</p>

  <p>The notes I made in <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2022/11/15/mastodon-discovery/">Mastodon Discovery</a> skipped over a noteworthy step.  In general, after mastodon fetches and parses the “well known” webfinger document (the so-called JSON Resource Descriptor), there is a 3 step process to learn about the actor referenced in that document.</p>

 
   fetch_resource 
   check_webfinger! 
   create_account 
 

<p>As mentioned previously, in the first step, a very comprehensive json document for the actor is fetched and in the third step, an account is created for that actor if does not already exist.  However, between those two steps, mastodon does another webfinger lookup since, for instance, the domain serving the actor document may be a different domain than the one that originally served the first “well known” webfinger document.  Prior to this check, <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L32">some instance variables are set</a>:</p>

  <code>    @uri      = @json['id']
    @username = @json['preferredUsername']
    @domain   = Addressable::URI.parse(@uri).normalized_host
</code> 
 
<p>The @uri instance variable is the location of the actor document and the @domain instance variable is the domain that serves the actor document.  After these variables are set, <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L36">the check is performed</a>:</p>

  <code>    check_webfinger! unless only_key
</code> 
 
<p>This check enforces that the domain component of your identifier is the domain that serves your actor document. (It <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L48">inspects the subject of the “well known” document</a> and if the username and domain of the subject match the instance variables above, the ‘self’ resource link is required to be the same as the @uri instance variable.  If the subject does not match, one more webfinger lookup for the redirection is allowed.)</p>

<p>So, from the perspective of mastodon, the domain component of your identifier you are known as is determined by which domain serves your actor document rather than the domain serving the original “well known” webfinger document.  It seems if your domain is a static site and you want to be known by an identifier associated with your domain, your domain needs to serve the actor document in addition to “well known” webfinger document.</p>

  Lately I've been using Apple Keynote to create graphics for using in videos and blog posts. It's a quick way to arrange things on a page, copying and pasting most things just works, and there are enough built in shapes and tools to get the point across.

<p>Lately I've been using Apple Keynote to create graphics for using in videos and blog posts. It's a quick way to arrange things on a page, copying and pasting most things just works, and there are enough built in shapes and tools to get the point across. However, after spending a full day creating graphics for a video, I found myself frustrated by the number of clicks required to export a single slide at a time.</p>

<p>I posted a <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2022/12/21/17/keynote">quick note</a> about this, and immediately got a lot of helpful replies! A lot of people suggested it should be possible to automate with <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">KeyboardMaestro</a>, a tool I was not previously familiar with. It was also suggested that I ask on the KeyboardMaestro forums, so I did, and also quickly received <a href="https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/export-current-keynote-slide-as-png/30317?u=aaronpk">a very detailed reply</a>!</p>

<p>In the course of reading through these replies, I realized that the thing they all had in common was AppleScript! One reply in particular <a href="https://twitter.com/chris79/status/1605933706778185730">from Chris</a> contained a pretty detailed AppleScript that appears to have been adapted from the <a href="https://iworkautomation.com/keynote/document-export.html">iworkautomation</a> website. So I took that as a starting point and wanted to see how I could make it work without also using KeyboardMaestro.</p>

 Create a Quick Action in Automator 

<p>First, open Automator and create a new Quick Action.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the new action that is created, set the "Workflow receives" option to no input, and choose Keynote.app in the application list.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then search for the AppleScript action and drag it into the empty grey area.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, replace the <code>(* Your script goes here *)</code> text with the following AppleScript.</p>

 AppleScript to export the current slide as a PNG in Keynote 

 <code>set the defaultDestinationFolder to (path to downloads folder)

tell application "Keynote"
    activate
    try
        set currentSlideNumber to the slide number of (get the current slide of the front document)

        --- skip all but the current slide
        tell the front document
            set skipped of ¬
                (every slide where the slide number is not equal to currentSlideNumber) to true
        end tell

        --- capture the document name
        set documentName to the name of the front document
        if documentName ends with ".key" then ¬
            set documentName to text 1 thru -5 of documentName

        --- create an empty folder to temporarily store the image
        tell application "Finder"
            set newFolderName to documentName &amp; " slide " &amp; currentSlideNumber
            set incrementIndex to 1
            repeat until not (exists folder newFolderName of defaultDestinationFolder)
                set newFolderName to documentName &amp; "-" &amp; (incrementIndex as string)
                set incrementIndex to incrementIndex + 1
            end repeat
            set the targetFolder to ¬
                make new folder at defaultDestinationFolder with properties ¬
                    {name:newFolderName}
            set the targetFolderHFSPath to targetFolder as string
        end tell

        --- tell Keynote to export the current slide
        export the front document as slide images to file targetFolderHFSPath with properties ¬
            {image format:PNG, skipped slides:false}

        --- set all the slides back to unskipped
        tell the front document
            set skipped of every slide to false
        end tell

        --- move the file to the destination folder and delete the temporary folder 
        tell application "Finder"
            set folderContents to every item of targetFolder
            repeat with theFile in folderContents
                set fileExtension to name extension of theFile
                set fileName to the name of theFile as string
                set splitCharacters to ".001"

                set ATID to AppleScript's text item delimiters
                set AppleScript's text item delimiters to splitCharacters
                set newFileName to text item 1 of fileName
                set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ATID

                set newFileName to newFileName &amp; "." &amp; fileExtension
                set name of theFile to newFileName
                -- display dialog quoted form of (name of theFile as string)

            end repeat
            move files of entire contents of targetFolder to defaultDestinationFolder with replacing
            delete targetFolder

            --- open the destination folder
            tell application "Finder"
                set thePath to file (defaultDestinationFolder &amp; newFileName as string)
                activate
                reveal the thePath
            end tell
        end tell

    on error errorMessage number errorNumber
        display alert "EXPORT PROBLEM" message errorMessage
        error number -128
    end try
end tell

</code> 

 Setting up a keyboard shortcut 

<p>In the Automator app, save this quick action with a name like <code>ExportCurrentSlide</code>. You can quit Automator now.</p>

<p>Now open System Preferences, open the Keyboard options, and go to the Shortcuts tab, then click on Services. Your new action should appear at the bottom of the list.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on the "none" at the right side of the action and you can record a keyboard shortcut for the action. I used "Shift Command 9" for mine.</p>

<p>Close this, and go to Keynote to test it out!</p>

<p>Choose the slide you want to export and press your keyboard shortcut! You should see a quick sequence of hiding all the slides, un-hiding them, and then the Downloads folder should pop up with your file name including the Keynote file name and slide number!</p>

<p></p>

<p>There you go! A pure AppleScript solution, no third party apps needed! I just finished setting this up this morning and I'm already so much happier exporting slides now!</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought to use Mastodon lists until I read the Frustration with lists chapter of Martin Fowler’s <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-mastodon.html">Exploring Mastodon</a>, in which he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I like lists because they allow me to divide up my timeline to topics I want to read about at different times. They are frustrating because the tools to manage them in Twitter are very limited, so it’s more hassle to set up the kind of environment I’d like. Mastodon also has lists, sadly its current management tools are equally bad.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This seemed like a good challenge for Steampipe. To tackle it, I first needed to add some new tables to the plugin to encapsulate the list APIs: <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_list.md">mastodon_list</a> and <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_list_account.md">mastodon_list_account</a>. I’ll save that story for another time. Here I’ll just show that together they enable queries like this.</p>
 select
  l.title as list,
  array_agg(a.username order by a.username) as people
from
  mastodon_list l
join
  mastodon_list_account a
on
  l.id = a.list_id
group by
  l.title

<p>That’s a useful view, and I’ve now included it, but it didn’t address Martin’s specific need.</p>
<blockquote><p>
To manage these lists, I really need a display that shows every account that I follow in a table with its lists. That way I can easily see which list each account is on, and spot any accounts that aren’t on a list.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For that I needed to add a list column to the Following tab. </p>
<p>This was the original query.</p>
 select
  url,
  case when display_name = '' then username else display_name end as person,
  to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as since,
  followers_count as followers,
  following_count as following,
  statuses_count as toots,
  note
from
  mastodon_following
order by
  person
 
<p>The new version captures the above join of mastodon_list and mastodon_list_account, and joins that to the mastodon_following (people I follow) table. It’s a left join which means I’ll always get all the people I follow. If you’re not on a list, your list column will be null.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    l.title as list,
    a.*
  from
    mastodon_list l
  join
    mastodon_list_account a
  on
    l.id = a.list_id
),
combined as (
  select
    d.list,
    f.url,
    case when f.display_name = '' then f.username else f.display_name end as person,
    to_char(f.created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as since,
    f.followers_count as followers,
    f.following_count as following,
    f.statuses_count as toots,
    f.note
  from
    mastodon_following f
  left join
    data d
  on
    f.id = d.id
)
select
  *
from
  combined
order by
  person
 
<p>That query drives the new version of the Following tab.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-following-with-lists.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>It’s pretty sparse, I’ve only just begun adding people to lists. And honestly I’m not sure I’ll want to keep doing this curation, it’s the kind of thing that can become a burden, I need to play around some more before I commit. Meanwhile, the default sort puts unlisted people first so they’re easy to find. </p>
<p>To provide a better way to find people who are on lists, I expanded the List tab in a couple of ways. It had included a dropdown of lists by which to filter the home timeline. Now that dropdown has counts of people on each list.</p>
 input "list" {
  type = "select"
  width = 2
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with list_account as (
      select
        l.title
      from
        mastodon_list l
      join
          mastodon_list_account a
      on
        l.id = a.list_id
    ),
    counted as (
      select
        title,
        count(*)
      from
        list_account
      group by
        title
      order by
        title
    )
    select
      title || ' (' || count || ')' as label,
      title as value
    from
      counted
    order by
      title
  EOQ
}
 
<p>I also used this query to expand the List tab.</p>
 select
  l.title as list,
  array_to_string( array_agg( lower(a.username) order by lower(a.username)), ', ') as people
from
  mastodon_list l
join
  mastodon_list_account a
on
  l.id = a.list_id
group by
  l.title
 
<p>The result is the list / people table on the right.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/expanded-list-view.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>I know that some won’t cotton to this SQL-forward programming model. But for others who will, I wanted to show a few detailed examples to give you a sense of what’s possible at the intersection of Mastodon and Steampipe. </p>
<p>If you’re not tuned into SQL (like I wasn’t for a very long time), here’s your takeaway: as SQL goes, this stuff is not too scary. Yes there are joins, yes there’s an array_agg that transposes a column into a list. It’s not beginner SQL. But lots of people know how to use join and array_agg in these ways, lots more could easily learn how, and with SQL ascendant nowadays these are skills worth having. </p>

 ＜制作環境のメモ＞ 



<p>今回は、mmhmm Studio を使ってテキストスライドは全てつくり、絵が必要なものだけGoogle slide で作ったものをPowerpointにエクスポートして、それをmmhmm Studio に読み込んで使いました。JPEGではなくPowerpointにエクスポートしたのは、JPEGだとmmhmm Studioに読み込んだ後のサイズ調整が自由にならないからです。</p>



<p>カメラはMacBook Pro のカメラ。マイクはAudio Technica AT2040、オーディオインターフェースは Yamaha AG03 mk2 です。Compressor, EQはかけていません。マイクの出力が小さいので、Gainはmaxにせざるを得ませんでした。ノイズも乗るので、これをKrispを通してmmhmm Studioに入力しています。</p>



<p>こうやって作ったビデオをMP4に書き出し、それを <a href="https://vrew.voyagerx.com/ja/">Vrew</a> (動画編集をテキスト編集のようにできるソフト）に読み込んで字幕を作りました。無音部分も検出してくれるので、ダダダっとそれらを切りましたが、ちょっと切り過ぎで音が消えているところもなくはありません。でも通じるからよいか、と。字幕はAIが作ったものなので、わたしの滑舌の悪さから結構誤変換があります。が、心がきれいな方には意味がちゃんと通じるはず！</p>



<p>こうして編集したものをVrewからAdobe premiere pro に書き出し、Premiere pro で最終的なMP4を作りました。字幕はPremiere pro でも作れるのでそれでも良かったのですが、無音部分削除はVrewの方が楽だと思います。</p>



<p>これをYoutube Studio でアップロード、プレミア公開の時間を設定します。このときにカウントダウンの時間とそこで流すビデオを設定します。22時に設定して、５分前くらいから人が来るかなと思って時間を５分に設定したら、なんとカウントダウンは指定した22時から始まるのでした。それ、カウントダウンって言わなくね？罠だ。</p>



<p>プレミア公開<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2022/12/5098/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5098" title="英語では単に premiere という">1</a>の特徴は、それが流れている間、チャットでコメントを入れることができ、それを後からプレイバックできることです。動画プレミアが終わった後はチャットを足すことはできません。</p>



<p>このチャットプレイバックは、わたしのデフォルト設定では出るようになりませんでした。いろいろ見ると、動画の詳細設定で、コメントをすべて許可するをオンにしないと出ないという情報があったので、それをオンにしたら出るようになりました。</p>

 ＜チャットリプレイを見る方法＞ 



<p>もっとも、これをやっても直ちに画面にチャットリプレイが展開されるわけでは有りません。次のスクリーンショットのように閉じた形で表示されます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chat_replay_closed.jpg?ssl=1"></a>（図）Chat replay は閉じて表示される



<p>見えるようにするには、この「Show chat replay」をクリックしなければなりません。そうすると、こんな感じで流れるようになります。</p>

 ＜チャットリプレイは動画を編集すると出なくなる＞ 



<p>チャットリプレイを出すのにはもう一つ重要なことがあります。</p>



<p>前後の余分な時間を削るなどの編集を動画に施すとチャットリプレイできなくなります。</p>

  <p>We're back in the UK to see family over Christmas (our first trip back since 2019). Here are a few notes from the past couple of weeks.</p>
 Datasette 0.63.3 
<p>In addition to the Datasette 1.02a2 alpha (described <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/15/datasette-1a2/">in detail here</a>) I also published a small bug fix release for the 0.63.x stable branch. Quoting <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-63-3">the release notes</a> in full:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Fixed a bug where <code>datasette --root</code>, when running in Docker, would only output the URL to sign in as root when the server shut down, not when it started up. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1958">#1958</a>) 
 You no longer need to ensure <code>await datasette.invoke_startup()</code> has been called in order for Datasette to start correctly serving requests - this is now handled automatically the first time the server receives a request. This fixes a bug experienced when Datasette is served directly by an ASGI application server such as Uvicorn or Gunicorn. It also fixes a bug with the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-gunicorn">datasette-gunicorn</a> plugin. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1955">#1955</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>That second fix ended up taking longer than expected.</p>
<p>The root of that fix was that back in Datasette 0.63 I introduced the need to call <code>await datasette.invoke_startup()</code> as part of Datasette's setup process - mainly to trigger plugins that might need to run their own async setup code.</p>
<p>This turned out to break a bunch of unexpected things - most notably, it affected any time people wanted to run Datasette using an ASGI handler such us Gunicorn or Uvicorn.</p>
<p>It broke my own <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-gunicorn">datasette-gunicorn</a> plugin too.</p>
<p>The core problem was that the <code>Datasette()</code> class constructor can be called synchronously, but needed a subsequent <code>await ...</code> call to run those <code>async def</code> setup methods.</p>
<p>I realized that a neater way to handle this would be to introduce a mechanism such that the first time anyone attempted to run an HTTP request through Datasette - an operation that always involved an <code>await</code> - the <code>invoke_startup()</code> method would be called automatically.</p>
<p>I got that working, but in doing so I ran into a longer-running set of problems.</p>
<p>Datasette has around 1,200 tests at this point, and parts of the test suite date back to the start of the project and no longer reflect my preferred way of writing tests.</p>
<p>I've started running into "too many open files" errors running the test suite on macOS, and have so far not quite tracked down the best way to keep open file handles under control.</p>
<p>Test failures were hampering my efforts to fix the issue, so I used this as the impetus to refactor a large chunk of the test suite.</p>
<p>Several hundred of Datasette's tests <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1959">now share</a> a single in-memory fixtures database - previously, these tests were using a <code>fixtures.db</code> database file created in a temporary directory.</p>
<p>There's still more test refactoring that I want to do, described <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1962">in this issue</a>, but I'm happy with the progress I've made so far.</p>
 datasette-ripgrep, cosmetic upgrade 
<p>I built <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/28/datasette-ripgrep/">datasette-ripgrep a couple of years ago</a> - it's a Datasette plugin that provides a UI for running <code>ripgrep</code> code search queries - and linking to the results. It's very handy for finding uses of APIs that I might want to deprecate.</p>
<p>In using it to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1949">investigate Datasette's error output</a> I spotted that the results would be more readable if they <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep/issues/27">included a gap between non-consecutive line numbers</a>, so I shipped an update with that improvement.</p>

<p>I’ve been discussing Mastodon UX wishlists with some new acquaintances there. This excerpt from <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/17/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon/">A Bloomberg terminal for Mastodon</a> concludes with part of my own wishlist.</p>
<blockquote><p>
In a Mastodon timeline, a chatty person can dominate what you see at a glance. When we participate in social media we are always making bids for one another’s attention. As publishers of feeds it’s wise to consider how a flurry of items can overwhelm a reader’s experience. But it’s also useful to consider ways that feed readers can filter a chatty source. Steampipe’s SQL foundation affords an easy and natural way to do that. Here’s part of the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/blob/main/query.sp#L391">query</a> that drives the list view.</p>
 select distinct on (list, person, hour) -- only one per list/user/hour
  person,
  url,
  hour,
  toot
from
  data
order by
  hour desc, list, person
 
<p>It was easy to implement a rule that limits each person to at most one toot per hour. Next steps here will be to apply this rule to other views, show the number of collapsed toots, and enable such rules on a per-person basis.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As a warmup exercise, I decided to first add a simple control for boosts that enables me to see my home timeline with or without boosts. To give technically-inclined readers a sense of what’s involved in doing this kind of thing with Steampipe, I’ll describe the changes here. I’m obviously biased but I find this programming environment to be accessible and productive. If it seems that way to you as well, you might want to try out some of the items on your own UX wishlist. And if you do, let me know how it goes!</p>
<p>Here are the original versions of the two files that I changed to add the new feature. First there’s home.sp which defines the dashboard for the home timeline.</p>
 dashboard "Home" {
  
  tags = {
    service = "Mastodon"
  }

  container {
    // a text widget with the HTML links that define the menu of dashboards
  }

  container {
    text {
    // a block that displays the HTML links that form a menu of dashboards
    }

    card {
    // a block that reports the name of my server
    }

    input "limit" {
      width = 2
      title = "limit"
      sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
        with limits(label) as (
          values 
            ( '50' ),
            ( '100' ),
            ( '200' ),
            ( '500' )
        )
        select
          label,
          label::int as value
        from 
          limits
      EOQ
    }    
  }


  container { 

    table {
      title = "home: recent toots"
      query = query.timeline
      args = [ "home", self.input.limit ]
      column "person" {
        wrap = "all"
      }
      column "toot" {
        wrap = "all"
      }
      column "url" {
        wrap = "all"
      }
    }
  }

}
 
<p>And here’s the new version. It adds an input block called boosts, and passes its value to the referenced query.</p>
 dashboard "Home" {
  
  tags = {
    service = "Mastodon"
  }

  container {
    // a text widget with the HTML links that define the menu of dashboards
  }

  container {
    text {
    // a block that displays the HTML links that form a menu of dashboards
    }

    card {
    // a block that reports the name of my server
    }

    input "limit" {
    // as above
    }

    input "boosts" {
      width = 2
      title = "boosts"
      sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
        with boosts(label, value) as (
          values
            ( 'include', 'include' ),
            ( 'hide', ' ' ),
            ( 'only', ' 🢁 ' )
        )
        select
          label,
          value
        from
          boosts
      EOQ
    }

  }

  container { 

    table {
      // as above
      args = [ "home", self.input.limit, self.input.boosts ]
    }
  }

}
 
<p>Steampipe dashboards are built with two languages. HCL (Hashicorp configuration language) defines the UX widgets, and SQL fills them with data. In this case we’re selecting static values for the boosts input. But any Steampipe query can run there! For example, here is the input block I use on the dashboard that filters the timeline by the list to which I’ve assigned people.</p>
 input "list" {
  type = "select"
  width = 2
  title = "search home timeline"
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      title as label,
      title as value
    from
      mastodon_list
    order by
      title
  EOQ
}
 
<p>Now here is the referenced query, query.timeline, from the file query.sp which contains queries used by all the dashboards.</p>
 query "timeline" {
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with toots as (
      select
        account_url as account,
        case

<p>And here is the new version of that query.</p>
 query "timeline" {
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ

    ),
    boosted as (

        created_at desc
    )
    select
      account,
      person ||
        case
          when in_reply_to is null then ''
          else in_reply_to
        end as person,
      boosted || ' ' || toot as toot,
      url
    from
      boosted
    where
      boost = boosted
      or boost = 'include'
      or boost = 'n/a'
  EOQ
  param "timeline" {}
  param "limit" {}
  param "boost" {}
}
 
<p>The original version uses a single CTE (aka common table expression aka WITH clause), toots, to marshall data for the concluding SELECT. The new version inserts another CTE, boosts, into the pipeline. It uses $3 to reference param "boost" {} which maps to the self.input.boosts passed from home.sp</p>
<p>The SQL code is all standard. Postgres is the engine inside Steampipe, and I sometimes use Postgres-specific idioms, but I don’t think any of those are happening here. </p>
<p>The HCL code may be unfamiliar. Steampipe uses HCL because its core audience are DevSecOps pros who are familiar with Terraform, which is HCL-based. But its a pretty simple language that can be used to describe all kinds of resources. Here the resources are widgets that appear on dashboards.</p>
<p>The other thing to know, if you want to roll up your sleeves and try building your own dashboards, is that the developer experience is — again in my biased opinion! — pretty great because if you’re using an autosaving editor you’ll see your changes (to both HCL and SQL code) reflected in realtime. </p>
<p>To illustrate that, here’s the screencast we included in our <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/dashboards-as-code">blog post</a> introducing the dashboard system.</p>
  
<p>Not shown there, because we wanted to focus on the happy path, is realtime feedback when your SQL queries provoke Postgres errors. The experience feels very much like the one Bret Victor champions in <a href="https://vimeo.com/38272912">Inventing on Principle</a>. The core principle: “Creators need an immediate connection to what they’re creating.” </p>
<p>Here’s the wrong way that too often constrains us.</p>
<blockquote><p>
If there’s anything wrong with the scene, or if I go and make changes, or if I have further ideas, I have to go back to the code, and I edit the code, compile and run, see what it looks like. Anything wrong, I go back to the code. Most of my time is spent working in the code, working in a text editor blindly, without an immediate connection to this thing, which is what I’m actually trying to make.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And here is the right way.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I’ve got this picture on the side, and the code on the side, and this part draws the sky and this draws the mountains and this draws the tree, and when I make any change to the code, the picture changes immediately. So the code and the picture are always in sync; there is no compile and run. I just change things in the code and I see things change in the picture.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/inventing-on-principle.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>We want to work the right way wherever we can. The experience isn’t available everywhere, yet, but it is available in Steampipe where it powerfully enables the experimentation and prototyping that many of us are inspired to do as we delve into Mastodon. </p>
<p>If you want to try this for yourself, please check out the setup instructions for the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">plugin</a> that maps Mastodon APIs to Postgres tables, and the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboards</a> that use those tables, and ping me (on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@judell">Mastodon</a> if you like!) with any questions you may have.</p>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/10/browsing-the-fediverse/">last time</a>, the Steampipe dashboard for Mastodon has evolved in unexpected ways. I imagined that the components — a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon%22">plugin</a> that maps Mastodon APIs to Postgres foreign tables, and a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">suite of views</a> that query the APIs — would combine to enable a broad overview of activity in the Fediverse. That didn’t pan out for two reasons. </p>
<p>First, I learned that the Mastodon community didn’t appreciate the kind of surveillance required for such analysis. That was the original community, I should stress, and things have changed dramatically, but I want to respect the original ethos. Plenty of people will, nevertheless, crawl and index the Fediverse, but I don’t need to put my shoulder to that wheel. And if I did I’d be pushing Steampipe out of its sweet spot: realtime acquisition, querying, and visualization of API-sourced data. </p>
<p>Second, Mastodon’s API allows 300 requests every 5 minutes. You can use Steampipe in batch mode to defeat that limit, and you can store data permanently in its Postgres database, but that cuts across the grain with respect to both Steampipe and Mastodon. All Mastodon clients are subject to the same API rate limit. If you use the web app, or one of the phone apps, you will likely never have seen a message announcing that you’ve hit the limit and need to wait a few minutes. I never saw that message until I started querying the API with Steampipe while also using the web app. </p>
<p>So if Mastodon culture and tech resist deep data mining, and the system is optimized for clients that live within an API budget of 300 requests every 5 minutes, what kind of Mastodon client could Steampipe enable? It wouldn’t be a conventional client because Steampipe is a read-only system. The path forward would be some kind of reader, or browser, that augments the interactive apps. </p>
<p>The outcome, so far, is a suite of dashboards that display tabular views (along with some charts) of the home, local, and federated timelines, of my toot history and my favorites, of my follows and followers, of my notifications, of searches for terms, people, and hashtags, and of the timelines formed by the lists to which I’ve assigned people I follow. These are all HTML tables rendered by Steampipe’s dashboard server. The columns are all sortable, and the cells of the tables can contain only links or plain text. </p>
<p>Given that the toot content returned from the Mastodon API is HTML, the plain-text-only constraint felt, initially, like a blocker. No images? No links in toot content? What good is that?</p>
<p>Some constraints are worth embracing, though, and that may prove true here. The views created this way put a lot of information onto the screen. Here’s my default view in the stock client.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/default-mastodon-view.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>At a glance I can see three items on the home timeline, and if I want to scroll through 100 items I can only do so awkwardly in small gulps.</p>
<p>Here’s my home timeline in the Steampipe dashboard. I can see a dozen items at a glance, and can easily scan 100 items in gulps of that size.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/steampipe-mastodon-view.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>When I described this effect to <a href="https://third-bit.com">Greg Wilson</a> he gave me the title for this post: “That sounds like the Bloomberg terminal for Mastodon.” I’ve never used one, and I’m aware that its design is often derided as a UX disaster, but as I understand it the product is built to enable traders to scan fast-moving data feeds from many different sources. In that sense I do think it’s an interesting and useful comparison.</p>
<p>The underlying principle is one I’ve learned from Edward Tufte: present information at maximum density. Our brains are built to take in a lot of information at a glance, and if it’s organized well we can do that very effectively. It feels like that’s happening for me when I scan these densely-packed views of Mastodon activity.</p>
<p>To enhance the effect, I’ve begun to apply filters. In a Mastodon timeline, for example, a chatty person can dominate what you see at a glance. When we participate in social media we are always making bids for one another’s attention. As publishers of feeds it’s wise to consider how a flurry of items can overwhelm a reader’s experience. But it’s also useful to consider ways that feed readers can filter a chatty source. Steampipe’s SQL foundation affords an easy and natural way to do that. Here’s part of the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/blob/main/query.sp#L391">query</a> that drives the list view.</p>
 select distinct on (list, user_name, person, hour) -- only one per list/user/hour
  person,
  url,
  hour,
  toot
from
  data
order by
  hour desc, list, person
 
<p>It was easy to implement a rule that limits each person to at most one toot per hour. Next steps here will be to apply this rule to other views, show the number of collapsed toots, and enable such rules on a per-person basis.</p>
<p>There are always links into the Mastodon web app, and I follow them when I want to view images, boost someone, or reply to someone. The dashboards help me scan a lot of Mastodon activity quickly, and decide which items I want to interact with. Your 500-character toot is all you’ve got to grab my attention, and I’ll only see it as an unformatted chunk of plain text. That’s a pretty severe constraint, and not everyone will want to embrace it, but it’s working pretty well for me so far.</p>
<p>I expect that our dashboard system will support formatted text and images in cells of HTML tables. When it does I’d like to make it an option you can turn on or off in Mastodon dashboards. What should the default be? I suspect I’ll want plain text and no images, especially if image captions can appear along with the text of toots. Some of the original Mastodon cultural norms aren’t surviving the onslaught of new people, but writing descriptions of images is one that’s held up so far, and it’s a wonderful thing. So write a short thoughtful post, write a caption for your image if you include one, and if you capture my attention I’ll click through to view and interact. </p>

  <p>Summary:      This post is adapted from my forthcoming book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/windleyofente-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>, from O'Reilly Media.</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/windleyofente-20"></a>


<p>
    Our physical wallets are, historically, for holding currency. But that may be the least interesting use case for wallets. Many of the things people put in their wallets represent relationships they have and authorizations they hold. Most people don't often leave home without their wallet.
</p>

<p>
    But the analogy to a physical wallet can only take us so far, because as physical beings, our natural capabilities are multitude. In the digital world, we need tools to accomplish almost anything useful. The name wallet1 for the software we use to interact digitally doesn't do the tool justice. 
</p>

<p>
    A digital identity wallet is a secure, encrypted database that collects and holds keys, identifiers, and verifiable credentials (VCs). The wallet is also a digital address book, collecting and maintaining its controller's many relationships. The wallet is coupled with a software agent that speaks the protocols necessary to engage with others. 
</p>

<p>
    Wallets and agents are not the same thing, even though they're often conflated. Agents are tools for taking action. Wallets are where stuff is stored. Still, most people just say "wallet," even when they mean "wallet and agent." For this post, when I say "wallet" I mean wallet and when I say "agent" I mean agent.
</p>

<p>
    Identity agents are software services that manage all the stuff in the wallet. Agents store, update, retrieve, and delete all the artifacts that a wallet holds. Beyond managing the wallet, agents perform many other important tasks:
</p>
 
     Sending and receiving messages with other agents 
     Requesting that the wallet generate cryptographic key pairs 
     Managing encrypted data interactions with the wallet 
     Performing cryptographic functions like signing and verifying signatures 
     Backing up and retrieving data in the wallet 
     Maintaining relationships by communicating with other agents when DID documents are updated 
     Routing messages to other agents 
 


	  <a></a>
	  The relationship between identity wallets and agents (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This figure shows the relationship between an agent, a wallet, and the underlying operating system. While most current implementations pair a single agent with a single wallet, the presence of an API means that it's possible for one agent to use several wallets, or for multiple agents to access one wallet. Some specialized agents might not even need a wallet, such as those that just perform routing, although most will at least need to store their own keys.
</p>


<p>
    The key-management functions in the wallet includes actions on cryptographic keys like generation, storage, rotation, and deletion. Key management is performed in cooperation with the operating system and underlying hardware. Ideally, the operating system and hardware provide a secure enclave for key storage and a trusted execution environment for performing key-management functions.
</p>

<p>
    The basic functions shown in the diagram might not seem to have much to do with identity. Identity-related activities like authentication and credential exchange are built on top of these basic functions. The agent can issue, request, and accept VCs. The agent also presents and verifies credentials. Specialized messages perform these activities. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Agents and Credential Exchange 
<p>
    Agents speak a protocol called DIDComm (DID-based communication) that  provides a secure communications layer for the exchange of identity information via verifiable credentials (VCs). Agents speak DIDComm to each other without a third-party intermediary (i.e., they're peer-to-peer). Because of DIDComm's flexibility and the ability to define protocols on top of DIDComm messaging, it promises to be as important as the identity layer it enables. The DIDComm protocol is governed by the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm specification</a>, hosted at the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>. The current ratified version is 2.0.
</p>

<p>
    The specification's opening sentence states that "the purpose of DIDComm Messaging is to provide a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of DIDs." Note that the specification describes DIDComm as a communications methodology. This means that DIDComm is more than just a way to send a message or chat with someone else. DIDComm messaging allows individual messages to be composed into application-level protocols and workflows. This makes DIDComm messaging a foundational technology for performing different kinds of interactions within the framework of trust that a DID-based relationship implies. 
</p>

<p>
    To enable the exchange of verifiable credentials, the agent, using the wallet as secure storage, performs three primary activities:
</p>
 
     Exchanging DIDs with other agents 
     Requesting and issuing credentials 
     Requesting and presenting credential proofs 
 
<p>
    The agent does these activities using protocols that run on top of DIDComm. DIDComm's job is to create a secure, mutually authenticated channel for exchanging DIDComm messages. The protocols that operate inside of it, carry out specific activities. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Exchanging DIDs 
<p>
    Agents take care of the tedious and tricky job of exchanging DIDs between parties who want to communicate so that people don't have to get entangled in the details of how DIDs work: how they're created, stored, and validated. Or the work that's necessary when one of the parties needs to rotate keys. The <a href="https://didcomm.org/book/v2/whatsnew">DIDComm v2 spec is capable of exchanging DIDs</a> without a separate protocol so the process can be automated by smart identity agents working on behalf of the various parties. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Requesting and Issuing Credentials 
<p>
    Requesting and issuing credentials is defined in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md">Aries RFC 0036: Issue Credential Protocol 1.0</a>. The protocol "formalizes messages used to issue a credential." The protocol describes four primary messages: <code>propose-credential</code>, <code>offer-credential</code>, <code>request-credential</code>, and <code>issue-credential</code>. The protocol also defines the state machine that the agent operates in response to these messages. These messages combined with the state machine allow the credential issuer and the credential holder to engage is the ceremonies necessary for the issuer to issue a credential to the holder.
</p>

<a></a>
 Requesting and Presenting Credential Proofs 
<p>
    Requesting and presenting credential proofs is defined in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0</a>. The protocol formalizes and generalizes message formats used for presenting a proof of the attributes in a credential. The protocol describes three primary messages: <code>propose-proof</code>, <code>request-proof</code>, and <code>present-proof</code>.  The protocol also defines the state machine that the agent operates in response to these messages. These messages and state machine allow the credential holder and the credential verifier to engage in the ceremonies necessary for the holder to present a credential proof to the verifier.
</p>

<a></a>
 The Nature of Wallets and Agents 

<p>
    Agents and wallets, working together, perform the work necessary for people, businesses, and devices to create mutually-authenticated, secure connections and use those connections to exchange verifiable credentials. People, businesses, and devices all have different needs and so they'll use different agents and wallets.
</p>
 
     People will generally use agents and wallets running on smart phones, laptops, or other personal devices. Your Amazon Alexa, for example could have an agent/wallet pair installed on it to act on your behalf. Most people will have agents on every device. Most of these will have wallets associated with them. Wallets will use device secure enclaves to store sensitive cryptographic information. People will also have agents and wallets in the cloud. All of the agents and wallets under a person's control will interoperate with each other and perform different roles. For example, cloud-based agents are needed to route DIDComm messages to devices that may not have a routable IP address.
     
     Businesses will use enterprise agents that are integrated with other enterprise systems like CRM, ERP, and IAM  systems. The wallets associated with these will be more sophisticated than personal wallets since they have to manage DIDs and their associated keys that various employees, departments, and processes use. The ability to delegate authority and permission actions will be more rigorous than is needed in a personal wallet. A large business might operate thousands of enterprise agents for various business purposes.
     
     Devices will use agents with associated wallets to create relationships and perform credential exchange with the device owner, other devices, their manufacturer, and other people or companies. How they operate and their sophistication depend in great measure on the nature of the device and its expected function. I wrote about the reasons for using agents as part of IoT devices in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">The Self-Sovereign Internet of Things</a>.
     
 

<p>
    Despite differences that these agents exhibit, they all run the same protocols and use DIDComm messaging. There are no intermediaries—the connections are all peer-to-peer. Every agent works on behalf of the entity who controls it. To get a feel for how they might interoperate, see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalizing Digital Relationships</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml">SSI Interaction Patterns</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    DIDComm-capable agents can be used to create sophisticated relationship networks that include people, institutions, and things. The relationships in that network are rich and varied—just like relationships in the real world. Smart agents allow people, business and devices to create, manage, and utilize secure, trustworthy communications channels with anyone online without reliance on any third party. The agent serves as flexible digital tool that people can use to manage their digital life. 
</p>

 
<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     I've heard various people object to the term wallet, but so far, no one has come up with anything else that has stuck, so for now, wallet is the word the industry uses.

  <p>I've released the third alpha of Datasette 1.0. The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a2-2022-12-14">1.0a2 release</a> introduces upsert support to the new JSON API and makes some major improvements to the Datasette permissions system.</p>
<p>Here are the annotated releases (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/datasette-release-notes/">see previous</a>).</p>
<p>You can install and try out the alpha using:</p>
 <code>pip install datasette==1.0a2
</code> 
 Upserts for the JSON API 
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>/db/table/-/upsert</code> API, <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/json_api.html#tableupsertview">documented here</a>. Upsert is an update-or-insert: existing rows will have specified keys updated, but if no row matches the incoming primary key a brand new row will be inserted instead. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1878">#1878</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/2/datasette-write-api/">wrote about the new JSON Write API</a> when I released the first alpha a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>The API can be used to create and drop tables, and to insert, update and delete rows in those tables.</p>
<p>The new <code>/db/table/-/upsert</code> API adds <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/json_api.html#tableupsertview">upsert support</a> to Datasette.</p>
<p>An upsert is a update-or-insert. Consider the following:</p>
 <code>POST /books/authors/-/upsert
Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
</code> 
  {
  "rows": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Ursula K. Le Guin",
      "born": "1929-10-21"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Terry Pratchett",
      "born": "1948-04-28"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Neil Gaiman",
      "born": "1960-11-10"
    }
  ]
}  
<p>This table has a primary key of <code>id</code>. The above API call will create three records if the table is empty. But if the table already has records matching any of those primary keys, their <code>name</code> and <code>born</code> columns will be updated to match the incoming data.</p>
<p>Upserts can be a really convenient way of synchronizing data with an external data source. I had a couple of enquiries about them when I published the first alpha, so I decided to make them a key feature for this release.</p>
 Ignore and replace for the create table API 
<blockquote>
 
 The <code>/db/-/create</code> API for <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/json_api.html#tablecreateview">creating a table</a> now accepts <code>"ignore": true</code> and <code>"replace": true</code> options when called with the <code>"rows"</code> property that creates a new table based on an example set of rows. This means the API can be called multiple times with different rows, setting rules for what should happen if a primary key collides with an existing row. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1927">#1927</a>) 
 
<code>/db/-/create</code> API now requires actor to have <code>insert-row</code> permission in order to use the <code>"row"</code> or <code>"rows"</code> properties. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1937">#1937</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This feature is a little less obvious, but I think it's going to be really useful.</p>
<p>The <code>/db/-/create</code> API can be used to create a new table. You can feed it <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/json_api.html#creating-a-table">an explicit list of columns</a>, but you can also give it one or more rows and have it <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/json_api.html#creating-a-table-from-example-data">infer the correct schema</a> based on those examples.</p>
<p>Datasette inherits this feature <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-json-data">from sqlite-utils</a> - I've been finding this an incredibly productive way to work with SQLite databases for a few years now.</p>
<p>The real magic of this feature is that you can pipe data into Datasette without even needing to first check that the appropriate table has been created. It's a really fast way of getting from data to a populated database and a working API.</p>
<p>Prior to 1.0a2 you could call <code>/db/-/create</code> with <code>"rows"</code> more than once and it would probably work... unless you attempted to insert rows with primary keys that were already in use - in which case you would get an error. This limited the utility of the feature.</p>
<p>Now you can pass <code>"ignore": true</code> or <code>"replace": true</code> to the API call, to tell Datasette what to do if it encounters a primary key that already exists in the table.</p>
<p>Heres an example using the author data from above:</p>
 <code>POST /books/-/create
Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
</code> 
  {
  "table": "authors",
  "pk": "id",
  "replace": true,
  "rows": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Ursula K. Le Guin",
      "born": "1929-10-21"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Terry Pratchett",
      "born": "1948-04-28"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Neil Gaiman",
      "born": "1960-11-10"
    }
  ]
}  
<p>This will create the <code>authors</code> table if it does not exist and ensure that those three rows exist in it, in their exact state. If a row already exists it will be replaced.</p>
<p>Note that this is subtly different from an upsert. An upsert will only update the columns that were provided in the incoming data, leaving any other columns unchanged. A replace will replace the entire row.</p>
 Finely grained permissions 
<p>This is the most significant area of improvement in this release.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-register-permissions">register_permissions(datasette)</a> plugin hook. Plugins can now register named permissions, which will then be listed in various interfaces that show available permissions. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1940">#1940</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Prior to this, permissions were just strings - things like <code>"view-instance"</code> or <code>"view-table"</code> or <code>"insert-row"</code>.</p>
<p>Plugins can introduce their own permissions - many do already, like <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-edit-schema">datasette-edit-schema</a> which adds a <code>"edit-schema"</code> permission.</p>
<p>In order to start building UIs for managing permissions, I needed Datasette to know what they were!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-register-permissions">register_permissions() hook</a> lets them do exactly that, and Datasette core uses it to register its own default set of permissions too.</p>
<p>Permissions are registered using the following named tuple:</p>
 Permission = collections.namedtuple(
    "Permission", (
        "name", "abbr", "description",
        "takes_database", "takes_resource", "default"
    )
) 
<p>The <code>abbr</code> is an abbreviation - e.g. <code>insert-row</code> can be abbreviated to <code>ir</code>. This is useful for creating things like signed API tokens where space is at a premium.</p>
<p><code>takes_database</code> and <code>takes_resource</code> are booleans that indicate whether the permission can optionally be applied to a specific database (e.g. <code>execute-sql</code>) or to a "resource", which is the name I'm now using for something that could be a SQL table, a SQL view or a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries">canned query</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>insert-row</code> permission for example can be granted to the whole of Datasette, or to all tables in a specific database, or to specific tables.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>default</code> value is a boolean that indicates whether the permission should be default-allow (<code>view-instance</code> for example) or default-deny (<code>create-table</code> and suchlike).</p>
<p>This next feature explains why I needed those permission names to be known to Datasette:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 The <code>/-/create-token</code> page can now be used to create API tokens which are restricted to just a subset of actions, including against specific databases or resources. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html#createtokenview">API Tokens</a> for details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1947">#1947</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Datasette now has finely grained permissions for API tokens!</p>
<p>This is the feature I always want when I'm working with other APIs: the ability to create a token that can only perform a restricted subset of actions.</p>
<p>When I'm working with the GitHub API for example I frequently find myself wanting to create a "personal access token" that only has the ability to read issues from a specific repository. It's infuriating how many APIs leave this ability out.</p>
<p>The <code>/-/create-token</code> interface (which you can try out on <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/">latest.datasette.io</a> by first <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/login-as-root">signing in as root</a> and then <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/-/create-token">visiting this page</a>) lets you create an API token that can act on your behalf... and then optionally specify a subset of actions that the token is allowed to perform.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new permissions registration system, the UI on that page knows which permissions can be applied to which entities within Datasette itself.</p>
<p>Here's a partial screenshot of the UI:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Select a subset of permissions, hit "Create token" and the result will be an access token you can copy and paste into another application, or use to call Datasette with <code>curl</code>.</p>
<p>Here's an example token I created that grants <code>view-instance</code> permission against all of Datasette, and <code>view-database</code> and <code>execute-sql</code> permission against the <code>ephemeral</code> database, which in that demo is hidden from anonymous Datasette users.</p>
<p><code>dstok_eyJhIjoicm9vdCIsInQiOjE2NzEwODUzMDIsIl9yIjp7ImEiOlsidmkiXSwiZCI6eyJlcGhlbWVyYWwiOlsidmQiLCJlcyJdfX19.1uw0xyx8UND_Y_vTVg5kEF6m3GU</code></p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the screen I saw when I created it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I've expanded the "token details" section to show the JSON that is bundled inside the signed token. The <code>"_r"</code> block records the specific permissions granted by the token:</p>
 
 
<code>"a": ["vi"]</code> indicates that the <code>view-instance</code> permission is granted against all of Datasette. 
 
<code>"d": {"ephemeral": ["vd", "es"]}</code> indicates that the <code>view-database</code> and <code>execute-sql</code> permissions are granted against the <code>ephemeral</code> database. 
 
<p>The token also contains the ID of the user who created it (<code>"a": "root"</code>) and the time that the token was created (<code>"t": 1671085302</code>). If the token was set to expire that expiry duration would be baked in here as well.</p>
<p>You can see the effect this has on the command-line using <code>curl</code> like so:</p>
<p><code>curl 'https://latest.datasette.io/ephemeral.json?sql=select+3+*+5&amp;_shape=array'</code></p>
<p>This will return a forbidden error. But if you add the signed token:</p>
<p><code>curl 'https://latest.datasette.io/ephemeral.json?sql=select+3+*+5&amp;_shape=array' -H 'Authorization: Bearer dstok_eyJhIjoicm9vdCIsInQiOjE2NzEwODUzMDIsIl9yIjp7ImEiOlsidmkiXSwiZCI6eyJlcGhlbWVyYWwiOlsidmQiLCJlcyJdfX19.1uw0xyx8UND_Y_vTVg5kEF6m3GU'</code></p>
<p>You'll get back a JSON response:</p>
  [{"3 * 5": 15}]  
 The datasette create-token CLI tool 
<blockquote>
 
 Likewise, the <code>datasette create-token</code> CLI command can now create tokens with <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html#authentication-cli-create-token-restrict">a subset of permissions</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1855">#1855</a>) 
 New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#create-token-actor-id-expires-after-none-restrict-all-none-restrict-database-none-restrict-resource-none">datasette.create_token()</a> API method for programmatically creating signed API tokens. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1951">#1951</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>The other way you can create Datasette tokens is on the command-line, using <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html#datasette-create-token">the datasette create-token command</a>.</p>
<p>That's been upgraded to support finely grained permissions too.</p>
<p>Here's how you'd create a token for the same set of permissions as my ephemeral example above:</p>
 <code>datasette create-token root \
  --all view-instance \
  --database ephemeral view-database \
  --database ephemeral execute-sql \
  --secret MY_DATASETTE_SECRET
</code> 
<p>In order to sign the token you need to pass in the <code>--secret</code> used by the server - although it will pick that up from the <code>DATASETTE_SECRET</code> environment variable if it's available.</p>
<p>This has the interesting side-effect that you can use that command to create valid tokens for other Datasette instances, provided you know the secret they're using. I think this ability will be really useful for people like myself who run lots of different Datasette instances on stateless hosting platforms such as Vercel and Google Cloud Run.</p>
 Configuring permissions in metadata.json/yaml 
<blockquote>
 
 Arbitrary permissions can now be configured at the instance, database and resource (table, SQL view or canned query) level in Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/metadata.html#metadata">Metadata</a> JSON and YAML files. The new <code>"permissions"</code> key can be used to specify which actors should have which permissions. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html#authentication-permissions-other">Other permissions in metadata</a> for details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1636">#1636</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Datasette has long had the ability to set permissions for viewing databases and tables using blocks of configuration in the increasingly poorly named <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/metadata.html">metadata.json/yaml files</a>.</p>
<p>As I've built new plugins that introduce new permissions, I've found myself wishing for an easier way to say "user X is allowed to perform action Y" for arbitrary other permissions.</p>
<p>The new <code>"permissions"</code> key in metadata.json/yaml files allows you to do that.</p>
<p>Here's how to specify that the user with <code>"id": "simon"</code> is allowed to use the API to create tables and insert data into the <code>docs</code> database:</p>
  databases:
  docs:
    permissions:
      create-table:
        id: simon
      insert-row:
        id: simon  
<p>Here's a demo you can run on your own machine. Save the above to <code>permissions.yaml</code> and run the following in one terminal window:</p>
 <code>datasette docs.db --create --secret sekrit -m permissions.yaml
</code> 
<p>This will create the <code>docs.db</code> database if it doesn't already exist, and start Datasette with the <code>permissions.yaml</code> metadata file.</p>
<p>It sets <code>--secret</code> to a known value (you should always use a random secure secret in production) so we can easily use it with <code>create-token</code> in the next step:</p>
<p>Then in another terminal window run:</p>
 <code>export TOKEN=$(
  datasette create-token simon \
  --secret sekrit
)
curl -XPOST http://localhost:8001/docs/-/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "table": "demo",
    "row": {"id": 1, "name": "Simon"},
    "pk": "id"
  }'
</code> 
<p>The first line creates a token that can act on behalf of the <code>simon</code> actor. The second <code>curl</code> line then uses that token to create a table using the <code>/-/create</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>Run this, then visit <a href="http://localhost:8001/docs/demo">http://localhost:8001/docs/demo</a> to see the newly created table.</p>
 What's next? 
<p>With the 1.0a2 release I'm reasonably confident that Datasette 1.0 is new-feature-complete. There's still a lot of work to do before the final release, but the remaining work is far more intimidating: I need to make clean backwards-incompatible breakages to a whole host of existing features in order to ship a 1.0 that I can keep stable for as long as possible.</p>
<p>First up: I'm going to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1914">redesign Datasette's default API output</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to being really verbose, you'll note that the rows themselves are represented like this:</p>
  [
  [
    3,
    "Detroit"
  ],
  [
    2,
    "Los Angeles"
  ],
  [
    4,
    "Memnonia"
  ],
  [
    1,
    "San Francisco"
  ]
]  
<p>I originally designed it this way because I thought saving on repeating the column names for every row would be more efficient.</p>
<p>In practice, every single time I've used Datasette's API I've found myself using the <code>?_shape=array</code> parameter, which outputs this format instead:</p>
  [
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Detroit"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Los Angeles"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Memnonia"
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "San Francisco"
  }
]  
<p>It's just so much more convenient to work with!</p>
<p>So the new default format will look like this:</p>
  {
  "rows": [
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Detroit"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Los Angeles"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "Memnonia"
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "San Francisco"
    }
  ]
}  
<p>The <code>rows</code> key is there so I can add extra keys to the output, based on additional <code>?_extra=</code> request parameters. You'll be able to get back everything you can get in the current full-fat table API, but you'll have to ask for it.</p>
<p>There are a ton of other changes I want to make to Datasette as a whole - things like renaming <code>metadata.yaml</code> to <code>config.yaml</code> to reflect that it's gone way beyond its origins as a way of attaching metadata to a database.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/milestone/7">1.0 milestone</a> is a dumping ground for many of these ideas. It's not a canonical reference though: I'd be very surprised if everything currently in that milestone makes it into the final 1.0 release.</p>
<p>As I get closer to 1.0 though I'll be refining that milestone so it should get more accurate over time.</p>
<p>Once again: now is the time to be providing feedback on this stuff! The <a href="https://datasette.io/discord">Datasette Discord</a> is a particularly valuable way for me to get feedback on the work so far, and my plans for the future.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 27, 2022</p>



<p>With the other members of our group having already departed, we joined our friends Liz and Peter to explore a few more places in Montgomery. We started our day at the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/civil-rights-memorial">Civil Rights Memorial Center</a>, part of the Southern Poverty Law Center headquarters. The Memorial Center wasn’t large, but had some excellent multimedia presentations on the civil rights struggle, both historical and ongoing.</p>



<p>From there we walked over to the former Greyhound bus station associated with the Freedom Riders. The station is now a small museum, the <a href="https://ahc.alabama.gov/properties/freedomrides/freedomrides.aspx">Freedom Rides Museum</a>, and has signs on the outside with a detailed history. While there, a Black woman drove up to take some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CkQZACWPxyt/">video</a> of the bus station and we had a somewhat surprising conversation with her. She was not entirely pleased with the placement of all of the civil rights museums and displays in Montgomery — she thought that the Black community needed to strengthen themselves and didn’t need to be constantly reminded of their struggles.</p>


 
<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/img_8915.jpg"></a>Freedom Rides Museum 


<p>From there we walked to the <a href="https://www.troy.edu/student-life-resources/arts-culture/rosa-parks-museum/index.html">Rosa Parks Museum</a> a few blocks away. The museum tour consisted of a couple of multimedia presentations describing the background and events of the day she refused to give up her seat on a city bus, which gave us a much more detailed understanding of the events of that day and the questionable legality of her arrest. This was followed by a short self-guided tour of artifacts relating to the tension between the Black community and the police.</p>



<p>It was then about time to make our way to the airport for our flights home. We returned to our hotel to retrieve our bags and got a Lyft ride to the airport. The Montgomery Regional Airport is a fairly small airport consisting of about five gates located only about 15 minutes from downtown. TSA inspection was quick and we had a small lunch in the airport’s one restaurant. Co-located with the airport is an Alabama Air National Guard base, which surprised us as several pairs of fighter planes — F-16s I think — took off with considerable noise and speed.</p>

<p>Wednesday, October 26, 2022</p>



<p>Today was the last day of the official tour (we are staying a day longer) and a very powerful day. After breakfast at the hotel, we went to the <a href="https://museumandmemorial.eji.org/museum">Legacy Museum</a>, a large and modern museum established by the <a href="https://eji.org/">Equal Justice Initiative</a> to tell the story of Black experience from enslavement to mass incarceration (the current situation). The museum proceeded roughly chronologically from the slave trade, slavery, the Civil War, reconstruction, Jim Crow segregation, and lynchings, to the current disproportionate sentencing and incarceration of Black people. The images and words used in the museum were very strong and intentionally uncomfortable for many. We were somewhat prepared by our recent experience, but the story was very uncomfortable nonetheless.</p>



<p>Following the museum, we traveled to another of Equal Justice Initiative’s projects, the <a href="https://museumandmemorial.eji.org/memorial">National Memorial for Peace and Justice</a>. The memorial, which is outdoors, includes hundreds of large corroded iron rectangular blocks that, by county, list the names and dates of lynching victims up to 1950. There was also a section to recognize counties and states that had put up markers recognizing the deaths of these victims. I was struck by the number of markers and names of people who had been lynched; this presentation of the names helps one appreciate the magnitude of the lynching problem.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/img_8904.jpg"></a>Sculptures at Michelle Browder’s studio




<p>We then traveled to the <a href="https://www.anarchalucybetsey.org/">studio</a> (for lack of a better name) of Michelle Browder, who led us on our tour yesterday, for lunch and discussion. After lunch, Michelle showed us her artwork, which included large sculptures and an old car that had been intricately decorated by use of a plasma cutter on its body. Her artwork and advocacy were recently highlighted in People Magazine.</p>



<p>We then sat down for a final debrief on our memories of the week before the first of our co-travelers had to leave for the airport.</p>



<p>Afterward, our friends Peter and Liz joined us in visiting the <a href="https://www.museum.alabama.gov/">Museum of Alabama</a>, located in the state archives building near the capitol. The museum was well presented, but we were now better equipped to read between the lines of many of the descriptions. For example, commerce often meant slave trade.</p>



<p>After returning to the hotel to clean up, we went to a nearby brewpub, the <a href="https://www.towertaproom.com/">Tower Taproom</a>. It had quite good pub food, and an interesting array of self-service taps that were enabled using a card they issued at the cash register. The taps measured beer (a good selection, plus a few wines and ciders) by the ounce, and you were charged for the amount you poured.</p>

  <p>(Updated Dec 14, 2022 with clarifications and a subscriber implementation note.)</p>
 Preface 
<p>The British government clearly has more tolerance for humor when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaty_McBoatface">naming important things</a> than the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/">W3C does</a>. Continuing in the original fashion, thus
this name.</p>
 The Problem 
<p>The publish-subscribe pattern is well known, but in some circumstances, it suffers from
two important problems:</p>
 
 
<p>When a subscriber is temporarily not present, or cannot be reached, sent events
are often lost. This can happen, for example, if the subscriber computer reboots,
falls off the network, goes to sleep, has DNS problems and the like. Once the
subscriber recovers, it is generally not clear what needs to happen for the subscriber
to catch up to the events it may have missed. It is not even clear whether it has missed
any. Similarly, it is unclear for how long the publisher needs to retry to
send a message; it may be that the subscriber has permanently gone away.</p>
 
 
<p>Subscriptions are often set up as part of the following pattern:</p>
 
 A resource on the Web is accessed. For example, a user reads an article on a website,
or a software agent fetches a document. 
 Based on the content of the obtained resource, a decision is made to subscribe to updates
to that resource. For example, the user may decide that they are interested in updates
to the article on the website they just read. 
 There is a time lag between the time the resource has been accessed, and when the
subscription becomes active, creating a race condition during which update events may
be missed. 
 
 
 
<p>While these two problems are not always significant, there are important circumstances
in which they are, and this proposal addresses those circumstances.</p>
 Approach to the solution 
<p>We augment the publish-subscribe pattern in the following way:</p>
 
 
<p>All events, as well as the content of the resource that whose changes are supposed
to be tracked are time-stamped. Also, each event identifies the event that directly
precedes it (that way, the subscriber can detect if it missed something).
Alternatively, a monotonically increasing sequence number could be used.</p>
 
 
<p>The publisher stores the history of events emitted so far. For efficiency reasons,
this may be shortened to some time window reaching to the present,
as appropriate for the application; for example, all events in the last month.
(Similar to how RSS/Atom feeds are commonly implemented.)</p>
 
 
<p>The publisher provides a query interface to the subscriber to that history,
with a “since” time parameter, so the subscriber can obtain the sequence of events
emitted since a certain time. (Actually, since “right after” the provided time not
including the provided time itself.)</p>
 
 
<p>When subscribing, in addition to the callback address, the subscriber provides to
the publisher:</p>
 
 a time stamp, and 
 a subscription id. 
 
 
 
<p>Further, the actual sending of an event from the publisher to the subscriber is
considered to be a performance optimization, rather than core to the functionality.
This means that if the event cannot be successfully conveyed (see requirements above),
it is only an inconvenience and inefficiency rather than a cause of lost data.</p>
 Details 
 About the race condition 
 
 
<p>The future subscriber accesses resource R and finds time stamp T0.
For example, a human reads a web page whose publication date is April 23, 2021, 23:00:00 UTC.</p>
 
 
<p>After some time passes, the subscriber decides to subscribe. It does this with the
well-known subscription pattern, but in addition to providing a callback address, it
also provides time stamp T0 and a unique (can be random) subscription id.
For example, a human’s hypothetical news syndication app may provide an event update
endpoint to the news website, and time T0.</p>
 
 
<p>The publisher sets up the subscription, and immediately checks whether any events
should have been sent between (after) T0 and the present. (It can do that because it stores
the update history.) If so, it emits those events to
the subscriber, in sequence, before continuing with regular operations. As a result,
there is no more race condition between subscription and event.</p>
 
 
<p>When sending an event, the publisher also sends the subscription id.</p>
 
 
 About temporary unavailability of the subscriber 
 
 
<p>After a subscription is active, assume the subscriber disappears and new events cannot be
delivered. The publisher may continue to attempt to deliver events for as long as
it likes, or stop immediately.</p>
 
 
<p>When the subscriber re-appears, it finds the time of the last event it had received
from the publisher, say time T5. It queries the event history published by the publisher
with parameter T5 to find out what events it missed. It processes those events and
then re-subscribes with a later starting time stamp corresponding to the last
event it received (say T10). When it re-subscribes, it uses a different subscription id
and cancels the old subscription.</p>
 
 
<p>After the subscriber has re-appeared, it ignores/rejects all incoming events with
the old subscription id.</p>
 
 
 Subscriber implementation notes 
 
 
<p>The subscriber receives events exclusively through a single queue for incoming events.
This makes implementing an incoming-event handler very simple, as it can simply
process events in order.</p>
 
 
<p>The event queue maintains the timestamp of the last event it successfully added.
When a new event arrives, the queue accepts this event but only if the new event
is the direct follower of the last event it successfully added. If it is not, the
incoming event is discarded. (This covers both repeatedly received events and
when some events were missed.)</p>
 
 
<p>The subscriber also maintains a timer with a countdown from the last time an event
was successfully added to the incoming queue. (The time constant of the timer is
application-specific, and may be adaptive.) When the timeout occurs, the subscriber
queries the publisher, providing the last successful timestamp.
If no updates are being found, nothing happens. If updates are being found, it
is fair to consider the existing subscription to have failed. Then:</p>
 
 The subscriber itself inserts the obtained “missed” events into its own incoming
event queue from where they are processed. 
 The subscriber cancels the existing subscription. 
 The subscriber creates a new subscription, with the timestamp of the most recent
successfully-inserted event. 
 
 
 
 Observations 
 
 
<p>Publishers do not need to remember subscriber-specific state. (Thanks,
<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>, for showing us!) That makes it easy to implement
the publisher side.</p>
 
 
<p>From the perspective of the publisher, delivery of events to subscribers that can receive
callbacks, and those that need to poll, both works. (It sort of emulates RSS except that
a starting time parameter is provided by the client, instead of a uniform window
decided on by the publisher as in RSS)</p>
 
 
<p>Subscribers only need to keep a time stamp as state, something they probably have already
anyway.</p>
 
 
<p>Subscribers can implement a polling or push strategy, or dynamically change between those,
without the risk of losing data.</p>
 
 
<p>Publishers are not required to push out events at all. If they don’t, this protocol
basically falls back to polling. This is inefficient but much better than the alternative
and can also be used in places where, for example, firewalls prevent event pushing.</p>

<p>Would love your thoughts!</p>

<p>Tuesday, October 25, 2022</p>



<p>After getting up and packing for today’s trip to Montgomery, we loaded up the bus and made the very short trip to the <a href="https://www.selmacenterfornonviolence.org">Selma Center for Nonviolence, Truth, and Reconciliation</a> (SCNTR). We had breakfast at the Center, followed by training, focusing on the meaning and application of nonviolence, from the Center’s director, Ainka Jackson. One of the major themes was the difference between nonviolence, which is an active role, from the passive role of non-violence (or avoidance of violence).</p>



<p>Lunch was also at SCNTR and featured a powerful presentation from Callie Greer on nonviolence and forgiveness. Many years ago, her son was shot and killed in an argument with one of his peers. When the perpetrator was put on trial, she asked in her victim statement that he not be sentenced to death or to life in prison, but rather be given a minimum sentence. The judge, stunned, complied. She met the perpetrator after he had served his prison time and asked for his mother to contact her. Callie and the perpetrator’s mother continue talking to this day.</p>



<p>Another situation that Callie related was that her daughter found a breast lump. Due to the lack of appropriate healthcare, her cancer was not diagnosed until it had progressed too far and the daughter died. She is finding it difficult to forgive the healthcare system (specifically, the lack of Medicaid in Alabama) for this.</p>

<p>After the lunch discussion, we rode the bus across the Pettus bridge and on to Montgomery, Alabama. Downtown Montgomery is a considerably more attractive capital than downtown Jackson, probably due to their focus on attracting conventions and other travelers. When we arrived, we met Michelle Browder, who in addition to being our tour guide is an entrepreneur. She is focused on telling a more complete story about the role of Black women as test subjects in the development of gynecological treatment, and how they were victimized in undergoing this experimentation.</p>



<p>Michelle led us on a tour that began at the waterfront of the Alabama River, and gave us a lesson on reading between the lines of the historical markers in town. She pointed out in particular three markers that highlighted the slave trade and Montgomery’s role in it. There were to be more of these markers, but of course the city stopped the project.</p>



<p>After the tour, we returned to check into the hotel (the Renaissance, probably the nicest hotel in town), and gathered at Central, a nearby restaurant that is also among the best. This was the final group dinner of the trip, because most of the group will be leaving tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>Monday, October 24, 2022</p>



<p>After a buffet breakfast at our hotel, we had an hour or so with Mike Espy, former Secretary of Agriculture, Congressman, and Senate candidate. Secretary Espy discussed the political climate in Mississippi in quite some detail, and made it yet more clear that Mississippi politics are more complicated than one might think, and civil rights is not a lost cause.</p>



<p>We then boarded our bus for the three-hour bus ride to Selma, Alabama. Selma today is a somewhat depressed town of about 18,000 having one of the highest murder rates in the state. In the 1960s, Selma was an important site for the civil rights movement. In 1965, attempts were made to march from here to the state capitol in Montgomery to demand voting rights. Initially this Freedom March was blocked by police and resulted in considerable injury to the protesters. Eventually a successful march was held following issuance of a court order.</p>



<p>Upon arrival, we visited the <a href="https://bytherivercenterforhumanity.com">By the River Center for Humanity</a>, a mixed-use community facility. They served us a delicious lunch which was followed by a talk by JoAnne Bland, one of the participants in the Freedom March. She shared with us some of her vision for Selma, and led us in a bit of singing and dancing as well.</p>

<p>We then walked across the famous Edmund Pettus Bridge, and visited the <a href="http://nvrmi.com">National Voting Rights Museum</a> just across the river from Selma. The museum had artifacts and pictures from the Freedom March, as well as considerable material on subsequent visits to Selma by presidents, particularly Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>



<p>After a short break at our hotel (the St. James hotel, recently renovated by Hilton), we took a short walk to The Revolt Selma, a new restaurant opened by a Black entrepreneur, for a buffet-style steak dinner.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 23, 2022</p>



<p>We started earlier than usual today in order to catch the 8 am service at New Horizons Church, a majority-Black church in a former strip mall in southern Jackson. The facility was beautifully adapted to its use as a church, and we were warmly welcomed. Most of the music was presented by a children’s group, which was very talented.</p>



<p>After the service, we met with the Senior Pastor, Bishop Ronnie Crudup. He described the formation of the church and also went into considerable detail about the political climate in Jackson and more generally in Mississippi. One story that struck me was that the Governor, rather than distribute federal aid from the American Recovery Act, sent at least some of the money back to the federal government saying that it was not needed. This struck me as simply cruel. In any case it is organizations like New Horizons that are developing the community for future leadership.</p>



<p>We then went to a local restaurant for brunch with some local women leaders (and teenage leaders) who are working in the area of voting rights and getting the Black community, and Black women in particular, to participate in the political process and specifically to vote.</p>



<p>After brunch we took our bus to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in downtown Jackson. The museum is, perhaps surprisingly, funded by the State of Mississippi. We started out with a short talk by Hezekiah Watkins, one of the original Freedom Riders. We then had some time — although not enough — to explore the museum, which took us from the days of slavery to the present, with an emphasis on the mid-20th century civil rights movement.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/img_8810.jpg"></a>Mississippi Civil Rights Museum




<p>We then took the bus to the Medgar Evers home. Evers, the field secretary for the Mississippi NAACP, was shot and killed there in 1963. The house has recently been designated as a national monument, but unfortunately wasn’t open for tours when we were there.</p>

  <p>We're doing a family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa">Secret Santa</a> this year, and we needed a way to randomly assign people to each other without anyone knowing who was assigned to who.</p>
<p>I offered to write some software! (Maybe "insisted" is more accurate)</p>
<p>I've been wanting an excuse to write something fun involving Python's <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/">cryptography</a> library for years. The problem is that I'm too responsible/cowardly to ignore the many warnings to only use the "hazardous materials" area of that library if you know exactly what you're doing.</p>
<p>A secret santa is the perfect low stakes project to ignore those warnings and play with something fun.</p>
 My requirements 
<p>I have six participants. Each participant needs to know who they are to buy a gift for - with no way of finding out any of the other gift pairings.</p>
<p>As the administrator of the system I must not be able to figure out the pairings either.</p>
<p>I don't want to use email or logins or anything like that - I just want to be able to share a link in the family WhatsApp group and have everyone use the same interface to get their pairing.</p>
 How it works 
<p>Here's the scheme I came up with:</p>
 
 Each participant gets a password generated for them. This happens on demand when they click a button - with an honour system not to click someone else's button (easily detected since each button can only be clicked once). If someone DOES click someone else's button we can reset the entire system and start again. 
 Their password is generated for them - it's three random words, for example "squirrel copper sailboat". I expect most people to take a screenshot with their phone to record it. 
 Behind the scenes, each user has a RSA public/private key generated for them. The private key is encrypted using their new password, then both keys are stored in the database. The password itself is NOT stored. 
 Once every user has generated and recorded their password, we can execute the Secret Santa assignments. This simple shuffles the participants and then assigns each person to the person after them in the list. It then uses their public keys to encrypt a message telling them who they should buy a gift for. 
 Those encrypted messages are stored in the database too. 
 Finally, each user can return to the site and enter their password to decrypt and view their message. 
 
<p>And here's an animated GIF demo:</p>
<p></p>
 Building it as a Datasette plugin 
<p>This is a tiny app with a very small amount of persistence needed, so I decided to build it as a Datasette plugin on top of a couple of SQLite database tables.</p>
<p>In addition to giving me an excuse to try something new with my <a href="https://datasette.io/">main project</a>, this should also hopefully make it easy to deploy.</p>
<p>Most of the code is in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-secret-santa/blob/main/datasette_secret_santa/__init__.py">datasette_secret_santa/__init__.py</a> file. I used a number of different <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html">plugin hooks</a>:</p>
 
 
<code>startup()</code> to create the database tables it needs when the server first starts (if they do not exist already) 
 
<code>canned_queries()</code> to add a canned SQL query for creating new Secret Santa groups, to save me from needing to build a custom UI for that 
 
<code>register_routes()</code> to register five new custom pages within Datasette 
 
<code>extra_template_vars()</code> to make an extra context variable available on the Datasette homepage, which is rendered using a custom template 
 
<p>Here are the routes:</p>
 @hookimpl
def register_routes():
    return [
        (r"^/secret-santa/(?P&lt;slug&gt;[^/]+)$", secret_santa),
        (r"^/secret-santa/(?P&lt;slug&gt;[^/]+)/add$", add_participant),
        (r"^/secret-santa/(?P&lt;slug&gt;[^/]+)/assign$", assign_participants),
        (r"^/secret-santa/(?P&lt;slug&gt;[^/]+)/set-password/(?P&lt;id&gt;\d+)$", set_password),
        (r"^/secret-santa/(?P&lt;slug&gt;[^/]+)/reveal/(?P&lt;id&gt;\d+)$", reveal),
    ] 
 
 
<code>/secret-santa/{slug}</code> is the main page for a Secret Santa group. It shows a list of participants and a form to add a new participant. 
 
<code>/secret-santa/{slug}/add</code> is the endpoint for a form that adds a new participant. 
 
<code>/secret-santa/{slug}/set-password/{id}</code> is the page that lets a user generate and retrieve their password. 
 
<code>/secret-santa/{slug}/reveal/{id}</code> is the page where a user enters their password to reveal their Secret Santa assignment. 
 
<code>/secret-santa/{slug}/assign</code> is the endpoint that does the work of assigning participants to each other, and generating and saving encrypted message for each of them. 
 
 The cryptography 
<p>The earlier warning holds firm here: I am not a cryptographer. I'm just having fun. You should not imitate any of the code I wrote here without thoroughly reviewing it with someone who knows what they're doing.</p>
<p>(I also used ChatGPT to write my first drafts of it, as <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-secret-santa/issues/1#issuecomment-1345348032">described in this issue</a>. Trusting cryptographic code generated by a large language model is a particularly bad idea!)</p>
<p>Disclaimers out of the way, here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-secret-santa/blob/18995be276a0fff99cf2f788cc15ac409465231d/datasette_secret_santa/__init__.py#L246-L280">the code</a> I wrote to generate and store the RSA keys:</p>
 async def generate_password_and_keys_for_user(db, participant_id):
    password = " ".join(random.sample(words, 3))

    private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(public_exponent=65537, key_size=2048)
    public_key = private_key.public_key()

    # Serialize the keys for storage
    private_key_serialized = private_key.private_bytes(
        encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,
        format=serialization.PrivateFormat.PKCS8,
        encryption_algorithm=serialization.BestAvailableEncryption(
            password.encode("utf-8")
        ),
    ).decode("utf-8")
    public_key_serialized = public_key.public_bytes(
        encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,
        format=serialization.PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
    ).decode("utf-8")

    await db.execute_write(
        """
        update secret_santa_participants
        set
            password_issued_at = datetime('now'),
            public_key = :public_key,
            private_key = :private_key
        where id = :id
        """,
        {
            "id": participant_id,
            "public_key": public_key_serialized,
            "private_key": private_key_serialized,
        },
    )
    return password 
<p>As you can see, it uses <code>rsa.generate_private_key()</code> from the <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/">PyCA cryptography library</a> to generate the public and private keys.</p>
<p>The options <code>public_exponent=65537, key_size=2048</code> are recommended by the <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/rsa/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.generate_private_key"> generate_private_key() documentation</a>.</p>
<p>It then serializes them to PEM format strings that can be stored in the database.</p>
<p>The private key is serialized after being encrypted using the randomly generated password for that user. This produces a string that looks like this:</p>
 <code>-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
</code> 
<p>I had originally come up with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-secret-santa/blob/cef3aed7afa523dc07190e7d735e46ecd61e4f5e/datasette_secret_santa/__init__.py#L269-L279">my own scheme for this</a>, involving AES encryption and a key derived from a hash of the raw password (which I planned to later run through <code>bcrypt</code> a few hundred thousand times) - I was very happy when <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-secret-santa/issues/3">I realized</a> that there was a standard way to do this already.</p>
<p>The code that then assigns the participants and generates their encrypted messages looks <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-secret-santa/blob/18995be276a0fff99cf2f788cc15ac409465231d/datasette_secret_santa/__init__.py#L311-L339">like this</a>:</p>
 # Assign participants
random.shuffle(participants)
for i, participant in enumerate(participants):
    assigned = participants[(i + 1) % len(participants)]
    message = "You should buy a gift for {}".format(assigned["name"])
    # Encrypt the message with their public key
    public_key = serialization.load_pem_public_key(
        participant["public_key"].encode("utf-8"), backend=default_backend()
    )
    secret_message_encrypted = public_key.encrypt(
        message.encode("utf-8"),
        padding.OAEP(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
            algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
            label=None,
        ),
    )
    await db.execute_write(
        """
        update secret_santa_participants
        set secret_message_encrypted = :secret_message_encrypted
        where id = :id
        """,
        {
            "id": participant["id"],
            "secret_message_encrypted": secret_message_encrypted,
        },
    ) 
<p>And finally, the code that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-secret-santa/blob/18995be276a0fff99cf2f788cc15ac409465231d/datasette_secret_santa/__init__.py#L201-L220">decrypts the message</a> when the user provides their password again:</p>
 data = await request.post_vars()
password = data.get("password", "").strip()
if not password:
    return await _error(
        datasette, request, "Please provide a password", status=400
    )
# Decrypt the private key with the password
try:
    private_key = decrypt_private_key_for_user(participant, password)
except ValueError:
    return await _error(datasette, request, "Incorrect password", status=400)
# Decrypt the secret message with the private key
decrypted_message = private_key.decrypt(
    participant["secret_message_encrypted"],
    padding.OAEP(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()),
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        label=None,
    ),
).decode("utf-8") 
 And some snowflakes 
<p>I spent all of five minutes on the visual design for it - the main feature of which is a thick red top border on body followed by a thinner white border to make it look like its wearing a Santa hat.</p>
<p>I did add some animated snowflakes though! I used <a href="https://github.com/natbat/CSS-Snow">this script</a> Natalie Downe built back in 2010. It works great!</p>
 Deploying it on Glitch 
<p>This kind of project is a really great fit for <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>, which offers free hosting with persistent file storage - perfect for SQLite - provided you don't mind your projects going to sleep in between bouts of activity (unless you pay to "boost" them). A Secret Santa app is a perfect fit for this sort of hosting.</p>
<p>(You can <a href="https://glitch.com/~datasette-secret-santa">remix my project</a> to get your own copy of the app (with your own database) by clicking the "Remix" button.)</p>
<p>Since I had <a href="https://pypi.org/project/datasette-secret-santa">shipped the plugin</a> up to PyPI already, deploying it on Glitch was a matter of creating a new project there containing this single <code>glitch.json</code> file:</p>
  {
  "install": "pip3 install --user datasette datasette-secret-santa -U",
  "start": "datasette --create .data/santa.db -p 3000"
}  
<p>This causes Glitch to install both <code>datasette</code> and <code>datasette-secret-santa</code> when the project first launches. It then starts the Datasette server running like this:</p>
 <code>datasette --create .data/santa.db -p 3000
</code> 
<p>The <code>--create</code> flag tells Datasette to create a new SQLite database if one doesn't already exist at that path. <code>.data/</code> is a <a href="https://glitch.happyfox.com/kb/article/22-do-you-have-built-in-persistence-or-a-database/">special directory</a> on Glitch that won't have its contents automatically tracked using their version control.</p>
<p>The <code>-p 3000</code> flag tells the server to listen on port 3000, which is the Glitch default - traffic to the subdomain for the app will automatically be routed to that port.</p>
 And the database is public 
<p>Here's a slightly surprising thing about this: the SQLite table containing all of the data - including the public keys and encrypted private keys - is visible for anyone with access to the instance to see!</p>
<p><a href="http://datasette-secret-santa.glitch.me/santa/secret_santa_participants">Here's that table</a> for a demo I deployed on Glitch.</p>
<p>Once again, I am by no means a cryptography expert, and this isn't something I would tolerate for any other application. But with the risk profile involved in a secret santa I think this is OK. I'm pretty sure you could brute force decrypt the private keys if you really wanted to, so it's a good thing they're not being used for anything else!</p>
<p>(This is also one of the reasons I didn't let users pick their own passwords - by assigning generated passwords I can be 100% sure I don't accidentally end up holding onto an encrypted copy of a credential that could be used for anything else.)</p>
 Self-contained apps as plugins 
<p>Something I find interesting about this project is that it demonstrates how a Datasette plugin can be used to provide a full, self-contained app.</p>
<p>I think this is a powerful pattern. It's a neat way to take advantage of the tools I've built to help make Datasette easy to deploy - not just on Glitch but <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Feb/15/fly-volumes/">on platforms like Fly</a> as well.</p>
<p>This is my first time using Datasette in this way and I found it to be a pleasantly productive way of building and deploying this kind of personal tool. I'm looking forward to trying this approach out for other projects in the future.</p>
<p>And if you know cryptography and can spot any glaring (or subtle) holes in the way my system works, please <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-secret-santa/issues/new">open an issue</a> and let me know!</p>

<p>A month ago, when the Great Discontinuity happened, I started working on a Steampipe plugin to enable SQL queries against the Mastodon API, along with a companion Steampipe “mod” (suite of dashboards) to display and chart the results of those queries.</p>
<p>I expect these dashboards will soon be available in <a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io">Steampipe Cloud</a>, where it will take just a few seconds to pop in your Mastodon access token (from, e.g., <a href="https://mastodon.social/settings/applications/new">https://mastodon.social/settings/applications/new</a>) and begin using the dashboards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you’re so inclined, you can find the plugin <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">here</a> and the dashboards <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">here</a>. If you’re reasonably technical you can pretty quickly and easily install Steampipe, clone these repos, build the plugin, and start using the dashboards. </p>
<p>Why would you want to? My own motivation, originally, was to do Mastodon analytics. I thought Steampipe’s SQLification of the API would be a handy way to discern and monitor activity trends during a period of extraordinary flux. And that’s proven to be true, to a limited extent. Here’s a <a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io/user/judell/workspace/personal/snapshot/snap_ceadu3fclgsqqchccd7g_11qxtodekrz7416zi0obhxj0l">snapshot</a> of the dashboard that uses the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/activity/">instance activity</a> API. </p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/mastodon-instance-activity.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>I’m watching this chart with great interest. Where does it go from here? I’m not going to hazard a guess. Everything’s up in the air right now, and anything could happen.</p>
<p>But as I added tables to the plugin to encapsulate more of the Mastodon API, and added dashboards to visualize those tables, my focus shifted. I began to see the suite of dashboards as a Mastodon reader/browser that complements the web and phone clients, and that’s how I mainly use them now.</p>
<p>I think the key benefit is one of Edward Tufte’s core principles: <a href="https://guypursey.com/blog/202001041530-tufte-principles-visual-display-quantitative-information#data-density-and-small-multiples">information density</a>. Each of these dashboards shows more activity than you can see at a glance in the web or phone interfaces. I find this very helpful for searching and browsing. When I see items of interest that I want to interact with, I click through to the web app in order to boost, reply, or favorite.</p>
<p>Will this way of browsing Mastodon appeal to you? To get a feel for what it’s like, here are <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-17-0">snapshots</a> of some of the dashboards I’ve built so far. </p>

<p>For me, at least, this approach has become an effective way to browse the fediverse, find interesting people, read what they boost, and keep track of my own activity.</p>
<p>If you are dev-minded, by the way, please note that these dashboards are just one way to skin the results of queries against the plugin. Any SQL client can connect to Steampipe’s Postgres endpoint. You could use dashboards like Metabase or Grafana, or you could embed Steampipe <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">as a component</a> in an app. </p>

That species is ours, and we are a pestilential one, altering, consuming, and wasting everything we can.</p>
<p>Specifically, our civilizations have advanced on the planet like a cancer, parasitically metabolizing materials we call “resources” (without their permission) as if their sums were not finite. Oil and coal will be gone in a few hundred years. Uranium, titanium, tungsten, helium, lithium and other members of the periodic table may be gone far sooner, thanks to our boundless appetites.

<p>Saturday, October 22, 2022</p>



<p>Today we are off to Jackson, Mississippi. We are also changing focus from history (enslavement) to contemporary civil rights issues. After breakfast we had a visit from three community members involved in trying to improve the criminal justice system in Louisiana. First we heard from Will Snowden of the <a href="https://www.vera.org/">Vera Institute</a>. He spoke about their initiative to reduce the population in Orleans Parish jails following Hurricane Katrina from about 7200 to 1000, largely by observing the distinction between jails (typically short-term detainees awaiting trial) and prisons (long-term convicted detainees). This distinction gives long-term detainees the potential to have access to education and training programs to help them develop. Vera Institute is working more broadly to improve equity in the criminal legal system in Louisiana as well.</p>



<p>We then heard from Everett “Buck” Ofray and Louis Gibson, both former long-term detainees who had been convicted of second-degree murder. They described their journey from arrival at Louisiana’s notorious Angola Prison, forced to labor initially without pay and later for only 20 cents an hour. Held without parole, they had to challenge the system to obtain access to education and vocational opportunities.  Eventually they worked their way into more and more responsible jobs like maintaining aircraft for the State Police. Changes in law allowed them to eventually be paroled. They described their process of re-integration into society; both are now working to assist other recent detainees. Louis is also working as a paralegal. This was truly an inspirational talk.</p>



<p>We then loaded into our bus for the three hour drive to Jackson, Mississippi for the next phase of our journey. We stopped along the way for a picnic lunch and to discuss what we have learned so far.</p>



<p>This is also homecoming weekend, a big deal in Jackson, so we expect everything to be crowded. We had dinner this evening at the <a href="https://jackson.charrestaurant.com/">Char Restaurant</a>, again a very enjoyable meal. Tomorrow will be an early and full day, so we are turning in early.</p>

<p>Friday, October 21, 2022</p>



<p>After breakfast at our hotel, we got on the bus and went east to visit one of the bayous. Along the way, we stopped and were introduced to a native American couple who explained the many ways that the oil industry in the area had impacted their lives. In addition to needing to relocate, they were severely affected by the Gulf of Mexico oil well disaster, and continue to endure health threats from toxic emissions from the refineries, many of which have been made legal through lobbying efforts on behalf of the oil companies.</p>



<p>We continued east through St. Bernard Parish, and as we did, we saw many skeletons of dead oak trees. These have apparently died due to increased salination of the underground aquafer. Many homes were seen that were propped up on platforms typically 20 feet above ground. Many of these homes were owned not by locals but by sport fishermen as second homes or as rentals. As we looked out into the waterway, it was fairly obvious which boars belonged the visiting sport fishermen and which were owned by locals. As our hosts explained, the waterway is always in a state of transition. There have been efforts to open new channels from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, and other projects that would change the salinity of that portion of the delta. Nobody seems to be sure how long this will last.</p>



<p>Returning to New Orleans, we had lunch at a very pleasant restaurant, <a href="https://cafecarmo.com/">Carmo</a>. Our next stop was at a youth development organization called <a href="https://sonofasaint.org/">Son of a Saint</a>. Housed in a newly renovated former ice house, Son of a Saint provides mentorship services to boys who have lost their fathers. Engagement with them begins in middle school and extends through their educational career and beyond. They have a very impressive track record with the boys they have mentored.</p>

<p>We then traveled to <a href="https://studiobenola.com/">StudioBE</a>, a warehouse art gallery space featuring the art of “BMike”, a local urban artist. As you might expect, BMike’s preferred medium is spray paint, but the amount of expression and detail he is able to impart is truly impressive. But spray paint is not his only medium: there were exhibits in many forms, even simulated video games. Along with the art were words that were in many cases quite profound. This visit definitely broadened my art tastes.</p>



<p>After a short break at the hotel, the group went to dinner at the <a href="https://windsorcourthotel.com/">Windsor Court Hotel</a>, where we had stayed on our visit to New Orleans about 10 years ago. It was a wonderful dinner, definitely too much food but all of it delicious.</p>

<p>Here are three things I once hoped — but no longer expect — to outlive:</p>
<p>1. PDF files</p>
<p>2. passwords</p>
<p>3. The occasional need to scrape data from web pages</p>
<p>PDF files and passwords are topics for another day, but web scraping is timely. Today I was asked to corral data from the Steampipe blog, and the path of least resistance was (of course!) to extract it from the site. </p>
<p>I was all warmed up for the exercise because we’d just published a <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-is-an-http-client">post</a> dramatically entitled “Why build an HTTP client into a database? So you can ingest web data directly!” In that post I show three solutions enabled by the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/net">Net plugin’s</a> <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/net/tables/net_http_request">net_http_request</a> table. </p>
<p>Since the dawn of the web, scraping has worked this way: Use a script to fetch the data, then save it for retrieval and analysis. You might use the script language to query the data, or the query language of a database. </p>
<p>A couple of years ago I found a way to unify those ingredients: Run the script inside the database. You can do a lot with Postgres’ built-in procedural language, and even more if you activate Python inside Postgres. I went deeply into both and explained why in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">an earlier episode</a>.</p>
<p>PL/Python was great for <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">advanced uses</a>, and I used it for a bit of web scraping too. It all worked fine, and I never thought to ask this question: “What if the database is the HTTP client, and SQL the common way to reason over data coming through that pipe?”</p>
<p>The examples in the post show what that’s like. In its simplest form you write a query like this.</p>
 select
    response_status_code,
    jsonb_pretty(response_headers) as headers
  from
    net_http_request
  where
    url = 'https://steampipe.io'
 
<p>The result is like this.</p>
 +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| response_status_code | headers                                               |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 200                  | {                                                     |
|                      |     "Age": [                                          |
|                      |         "45557"                                       |
|                      |     ],                                                |
|                      |     "Date": [                                         |
|                      |         "Fri, 09 Dec 2022 06:46:40 GMT"               |
|                      |     ],                                                |
|                      |     "Etag": [                                         |
|                      |         "W/\"614a142998557b388e053bfa4408cf70\""      |
 
<p>The response_status_code is a regular Postgres column, the headers column is a JSONB column that you can index into (e.g. headers -&gt;&gt; 'etag'). If you also select the response_body column of the net_http_request table you’ll get another regular Postgres column containing the text of the web page. If it’s HTML text, you can use regular expressions to match patterns in it. If it’s JSON text you can use Postgres’ JSON functions to query and transform it. </p>
<p>You can join fields nested in the JSON with other Postgres columns. And those other columns can belong to tables populated in any of the ways <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">Steampipe plugins</a> populate tables: from JSON or GraphQL API endpoints, from CSV or Terraform or Yaml files, from anywhere really. As a developer writing Steampipe queries (and flowing results into dashboards) you see all of these sources as tables, you query them individually in all the ways Postgres can, and you join across diverse sources in a common way. </p>
<p>Of course web pages are structured in ways that regular expressions can’t easily grok. It’s easy to match links, but parsing HTML tag names and attributes is a job for a real parser. I’d made a start on an <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-html">HTML plugin</a> for Steampipe. There were already two tables: one to extract links from a web page, one to transform HTML tables to CSV format. So today, when tasked with tabulating blog metadata, I added a third table to enable these queries.</p>
 -- find the title

select
  page,
  tag_name,
  tag_content
from
  html_tag
where
  page = 'https://steampipe.io/blog/selective-select'
  and tag_name = 'title'

-- list the meta tags

select
  page,
  tag_name,
  tag_attrs
from
  html_tag
where
  page = 'https://steampipe.io/blog/selective-select'
  and tag_name = 'meta'
 
<p>That’s a powerful way to reason over HTML data! It was easy for me to extend the HTML plugin in this way, and I assure you that I’m no 10x programmer. The <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk">Steampipe plugin SDK</a> and the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery">goquery package</a> are doing all the heavy lifting. I just had to stitch the components together, and if you’re any kind of programmer, with or without Go experience, you could pretty readily do the same.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 20, 2022</p>



<p>Our day began with a briefing in a conference room in our hotel. Our leaders spoke for almost two hours on the history of slavery in the US and specifically in New Orleans as background for our visit to <a href="https://www.whitneyplantation.org">Whitney Plantation</a>, about an hour’s bus ride from town. We made it to the plantation about noon, and had a picnic lunch there.</p>



<p>Whitney Plantation is different from most historical sites because it is presented from the viewpoint of the enslaved people, not the plantation owners. We were very fortunate that Yvonne, one of our tour leaders, had worked for Whitney Plantation until very recently and was able to tailor our tour to the theme of our journey. The tour included not only the Big House of the plantation, but also the areas where many of the enslaved people worked, such as the cooking areas, and their living quarters. We also were introduced to the evolution of the plantation, from early days farming indigo to sugar cane farming. There were memorial walls commemorating the many enslaved people who worked at the plantation, giving us an idea of the scale of the slavery at this one plantation.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/img_8725-edited.jpg"></a>Memorial walls showing names of enslaved people who had worked at the plantation




<p>While at the Whitney, Konda Mason, an entrepreneur who leads an organization called <a href="https://www.jubileejustice.org">Jubilee Justice</a>, spoke to us about the work they are doing. Jubilee Justice is working to improve the business climate for Black rice farmers in Louisiana and Arkansas. One of their main initiatives is to establish a cooperative rice mill in order to give the local farmers a more equitable and cost effective way to get their rice to market.</p>



<p>After returning from the Whitney, we took a short break and then had dinner at <a href="https://ninerosesrestaurant.com">9 Roses</a> with several leaders from the local Vietnamese community. New Orleans has a significant Vietnamese community, dating from the 1975 evacuation during the Communist takeover of South Vietnam. Some are engaged in fishing and shrimping, which had been their occupations in Vietnam. Our dinner table included a leader from the real estate industry who was part of that 1975 migration and a Catholic priest who had relatively recently moved to the United States. It was informative to see the similarities and differences between these generations of immigrants. The food was excellent!</p>

<p>Wednesday, October 19, 2022</p>



<p>With the official part of our tour beginning at 3 pm, we had much of the day to explore the French Quarter of New Orleans on our own. We met up with our friends Liz and Peter and started at <a href="https://shop.cafedumonde.com/">Café du Monde</a> for their traditional breakfast of beignets and coffee. Beignets are fried choux pastries with piles, and I mean piles, of powdered sugar on top. While we were eating, a brass band assembled on the sidewalk next to the Café and started playing. They were very good, a classic New Orleans moment.</p>



<p>The four of us headed over to the nearby <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jela/index.htm/index.htm">Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve</a> Visitor Center. We got there in time for their 10 am talk. It began with an interesting discussion of the Acadian expulsion from the Canadian Maritimes, and subsequent arrival of many of them in the New Orleans area. This was followed by a talk we were less interested in, discussing medicinal properties of native plants.   Afterwards we enjoyed a number of interesting exhibits in the visitor center.</p>



<p>While we were listening to the talks, Liz and Peter went through the <a href="https://louisianastatemuseum.org/museum/cabildo">Louisiana state museum in The Cabildo</a>, a notable building next to the iconic St. Louis Cathedral. This is the location where the Louisiana Purchase was signed. We understand admission was $10, and not necessarily worth the cost.</p>



<p>We met up with Liz and Peter again for lunch. We had planned to get muffuletta sandwiches, but weren’t sure where to get them since the traditional place, Central Grocery and Deli, was closed due to damage from Hurricane Ida. We found a place in the French Market, Alberto’s, that had good muffulettas but perhaps not quite as rich in olives as those at Central Grocery.</p>



<p>After lunch, we all went to the <a href="https://www.hnoc.org/">Historic New Orleans Collection</a> museum on Royal Street near our hotel. Admission was free, and there was plenty to see. Visiting this museum helped us better follow the series of events as control of New Orleans passed from France to Spain, back to France, and finally to the United States. Definitely worth the visit.</p>



<p>At 3 pm our tour officially started. We gathered in a conference room of the hotel for introductions and a brief orientation. We then walked north to Congo Square, just outside the French Quarter. Congo Square was the location where slaves who might be given a Sunday off (due to the strong Roman Catholic influence in the area) would gather, dance and sing, and trade wares. We met up with Luther Gray and Jamilah Peters-Muhammad of the <a href="https://www.congosquarepreservationsociety.org/">Congo Square Preservation Society</a> who told us of the considerable history of the Square. They taught us drumming and dancing in the traditional style, or at least as close as we could come to that.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/11/img_4817-1.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/11/img_8708.jpg"></a>




<p>We were then met by Erin, an official New Orleans tour guide, who led us on a whirlwind walking tour of some of the French Quarter. Erin had a lot of information, and talked fast to get as much of it to us as possible.</p>



<p>After a few minutes to get cleaned up, the group walked to <a href="https://www.galatoires.com/">Galatoire’s</a>, a well known (and fancy) restaurant in the French Quarter. Our group had a private room and a selection of menu items to choose from. I had to try the turtle soup, which resembled a thin chili and was very tasty. My fish entrée and Kenna’s crab hollandaise were both quite good.</p>

<p>What happened, <a href="https://status.apps.rackspace.com/index/viewincidents?start=1670216400">Rackspace says</a>, was “the result of a ransomware incident.” Damaged, lost or destroyed is its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rackspace.com/applications/microsoft-exchange">Hosted Exchange</a> business.&nbsp;On that cloud platform, companies and individuals around the world run their email and much else.</p>
<p>It’s quite a saga.</p>
<p>The first report from Rackspace came at 11:49pm Pacific (where I am) on Thursday, posted on its <a href="https://status.apps.rackspace.com/index/viewincidents?group=2">Incidents page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are investigating an issue that is affecting our Hosted Exchange environments. More details will be posted as they become available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Updates got more wordy as the outage continued. About a day later, a long posting said,</p>
<blockquote><p>We proactively powered down and disconnected the Hosted Exchange environment while we triaged to understand the extent and the severity of the impact. After further analysis, we have determined that this is a security incident.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also offered a lifeline of sorts:</p>
<blockquote><p>At no cost to you, we will be providing access to Microsoft Exchange Plan 1 licenses on Microsoft 365 until further notice. At no cost to you, we will be providing access to Microsoft Exchange Plan 1 licenses on Microsoft 365 until further notice. To activate, please use the below link for instructions on how to set up your account and users.</p></blockquote>
<p>For reasons not worth going into, this was useless to me. But I’m also just one guy, and almost all of Rackspace’s customers are businesses with more to lose.</p>
<p>Getting help from Rackspace quickly became difficult or impossible, while details about the situation were minimal, until this morning (6 December), when they said it was a ransomware incident. Which <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=rackspace%20ransom&amp;src=typed_query">countless tweets had been suggesting</a> from the start.</p>
<p>Here is what Rackspace said it was doing about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alongside our internal security team, we have engaged a leading cyber defense firm to investigate. Our investigation is still in its early stages, and it is too early to say what, if any, data was affected. If we determine sensitive information was affected, we will notify customers as appropriate.</p></blockquote>
<p>No FBI? CIA? NSA? DHS? Police? My guess is that at least two of those have been notified because it would make sense for them to be involved. But I’m sure abundant caution on Rackspace’s part is the reason we’re not hearing about any of that.</p>
<p>As for notifying customers, good luck. In a posting two days ago, Rackspace said,</p>
<blockquote><p>For those who are finding the process challenging and are awaiting support, we ask for your patience as we increase staff to help every customer. Since our last update, we have mobilized roughly 1000 support Rackers to reduce wait times and address ticket queues. We will continue to accelerate and deploy even more resources to further help customers.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=rackspace%20wait&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">Search for Rackspace+wait on Twitter</a> to see how that’s going.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I chose the “we’ll call you back asap” option at the Rackspace support number, after calling them fruitlessly before that. Since then, crickets. Meanwhile, I’ve been working almost non-stop on moving my email hosting to <a href="https://www.hover.com/email">Hover</a>, which answers the phone quickly and is always helpful.</p>
<p>Of course, I haven’t been able to export anything from Rackspace, and I have growing doubts that I ever will. If the failure is total, many details of my life in the digital world will be lost forever.</p>
<p>One bit of good fortune is that my wife and sister, who both also have&nbsp;<a href="http://searls.com" title="http://searls. ">searls.com</a> email addresses, were on Rackspace’s basic non-Exchange email service. Since that was still working today,&nbsp;we could export their mail archive from Rackspace as .mbox files, and start new accounts for them on Hover. (Ironically, I moved to Rackspace’s Exchange service because I punched through the basic service’s 25Gb limit on storage, and they sold me on the Exchange service’s better security.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware">Ramsomware</a> is bad shit. If you’re Rackspace or one of its customers, there is plenty to fear.</p>
<p>But the larger story here isn’t about Rackspace or its customers. It’s about the cloud business, which is beyond massive.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking for examples of cloud failures that are bigger than this one. <a href="https://readitquik.com/articles/cloud-3/6-cloud-computing-failures-that-shocked-the-world/">Here’s a list</a> from five years ago. <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/the-10-biggest-cloud-outages-of-2022-so-far-">Here is one</a>&nbsp;from July of this year. <a href="https://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-infrastructure/lessons-learned-recent-major-outages">Here is one</a> from August. Most list disruptions lasting hours. This one has been going on for five days with no end in sight.</p>
<p>So let’s imagine that Rackspace and its customers are stuck in that crater, and it just keeps burning. For years. What are the lessons from that?</p>
<p>[Later, on 10 December…] <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/rackspace-cloud-office-suffers-security-breach-958e6c755d7f">This report by Kevin Beaumont</a> on the Rackspace catastrophe (which continues) is long on technical and administrative details that nobody else seems to be reporting, and is damning to Microsoft as well.</p>

<p>
I was determined to write my Mastodon #introduction today. To get started I used the tag search in the dashboard I’m building.
</p>
 
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-tag-search-kathy-nickels-in-the-mod3.jpg?ssl=1"></a>
 
<p>
The idea was to look at a bunch of other #introduction posts to get a feel for how mine should go. When you search specifically for hashtags, the Mastodon search API returns this information.</p>
 "hashtags": [
    {
      "name": "introduction",
      "url": "https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction",
      "history": [
        {
          "day": "1574553600",
          "uses": "10",
          "accounts": "9"
        },
        // ...
      ]
    },
 
<p>
A first version of the dashboard, having only this data to work with, just listed the names of tags matching the search term along with corresponding URLs. Here was the initial query.
</p>
 select 
  name,
  url
from 
  mastodon_search_hashtag 
where 
  query = 'introduction'
 
<p>
That produced a list of links, like <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction">https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction</a>, to home pages for variants of the tag. These are useful links! Each goes to a page where you can see who is posting to the tag.
</p>
<p>
To make this view slightly more useful, I tapped the third element of the API response, history, in a revised query.
</p>
 with data as (
  select 
    name,
    url,
    ( jsonb_array_elements(history) -&gt;&gt; 'uses' )::int as uses
  from 
    mastodon_search_hashtag 
  where 
    query = 'introduction'
)
select
  name,
  url,
  sum(uses)
from
  data
group by
  name, url
order by
  sum desc
 
<p>
These results help me decide which variant to use.
</p>
 +-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+------+
| name              | url                                               | sum  |
+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------+------+
| introduction      | https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction         | 1816 |
| introductions     | https://mastodon.social/tags/introductions        | 218  |
| introductionpost  | https://mastodon.social/tags/introductionpost     | 19   |
| introductionfr    | https://mastodon.social/tags/introductionfr       | 6    |
 
<p>
But I still need to visit each link’s page to explore how it’s being used. It would be nice to surface more context in the dashboard, and I found a nifty way to do it, but first let’s dwell on the revised query for a minute. Postgres’ <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/15/postgres-and-json-finding-document-hotspots-part-1/">JSON features</a> are powerful and it’s often a challenge (at least for me) to visualize how they work.
</p>
<p>
The Postgres jsonb_array_elements() function is what’s called a set-returning function. Here it unpacks Postgres’ JSON representation of the list of history structures returned from the Mastodon API. In its simplest form, the function call jsonb_array_elements(history) produces a temporary table with per-tag, per-day data.
</p>
 select
  name,
  jsonb_array_elements(history) as history
from
  mastodon_search_hashtag 
where 
  query = 'introduction'
 
 +--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| name                           | history                                            |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"16","day":"1670371200","uses":"19"}   |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"250","day":"1670284800","uses":"269"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"259","day":"1670198400","uses":"274"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"253","day":"1670112000","uses":"270"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"245","day":"1670025600","uses":"269"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"345","day":"1669939200","uses":"383"} |
| introduction                   | {"accounts":"307","day":"1669852800","uses":"339"} |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670371200","uses":"0"}     |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670284800","uses":"0"}     |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670198400","uses":"0"}     |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670112000","uses":"0"}     |
| introductionsfr                | {"accounts":"0","day":"1670025600","uses":"0"}     |
 
<p>
history is a JSONB column that holds an object with three fields. The revised query uses Postgres’ JSON indexing operator -&gt;&gt; to reach into that object and hoist the number of daily uses into its own column, so it can be the target of a SQL SUM function.
</p>
<p>
OK, ready for the nifty solution? Recall that <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction">https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction</a> is the home page for that variant of the tag. There you can see introduction posts from people using the tag. Those posts typically include other tags. In the dashboard shown above you can see that Kathy Nickels is using these: #Music #Art #Equestrian #Nature #Animals. The tags appear in her introduction post.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-tag-search-kathy-nickels-in-the-app.png?ssl=1"></a>
</p>
<p>
I didn’t immediately see how to capture them for use in the dashboard. Then I remembered that certain classes of Mastodon page have corresponding RSS feeds, and wondered if the tag pages are members of one such class. Sure enough they are, and <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction.rss">https://mastodon.social/tags/introduction.rss</a> is a thing. That link, formed by tacking .rss onto the base URL, provides the extra context I was looking for. Here’s the final version of the query.
</p>
 with data as (
  select 
    name,
    url,
    ( jsonb_array_elements(history) -&gt;&gt; 'uses' )::int as uses
  from 
    mastodon_search_hashtag 
  where 
    query = 'introduction'
  ),
  uses as (
    select 
      name,
      url || '.rss' as feed_link,
      sum(uses) as recent_uses
    from 
      data 
    group 
      by connection, name, url
  )
  select
    u.name,
    r.guid as link,
    to_char(r.published, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as published,
    r.categories
  from
    uses u
  join
    rss_item r
  on 
    r.feed_link = u.feed_link
  where
    recent_uses &gt; 1
  order by 
    recent_uses desc, published desc
)
 
<p>
The new ingredients, courtesy of the RSS feed, are: guid which links to an individual introduction like Kathy’s, published which is the day the introduction appeared, and categories which has the tags used in the introduction post. Sweet! Now I can scan the dashboard to get a sense of which introductions I want to check out.
</p>
<p>
The first three queries use the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">Steampipe plugin for Mastodon</a>, and in particular its mastodon_search_hashtag table which encapsulates the Mastodon API for searching tags. The final version joins that table with the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss/tables/rss_item">rss_item</a> table provided by the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss">RSS plugin</a>, using the common base URL as the basis of the join.
</p>
<p>
This delights me in so many ways. When the blogosphere first emerged in the early 2000s, some of us discovered that the RSS protocol was capable of far more than just delivering feeds to RSS readers. The other new hot protocol in that era was XML web services. As an InfoWorld analyst I was supposed to be cheering the latter as an enterprise-grade technology, but I couldn’t help noticing that RSS kept turning out to be a great way to move data between cooperating systems. That’s always been true, and I love how this example reminds us that it’s still true.
</p>
<p>
I’m equally delighted to show how Steampipe enables this modern exercise in RSS-powered integration. Steampipe was, originally, an engine for mapping results from JSON API endpoints to SQL tables. Over time, though, it has broadened its view of what constitutes an API. You can use Steampipe to query CSV files, or <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3659794/do-your-aws-deployments-match-your-terraform-definitions-use-sql-to-find-out.html">Terraform files</a>, or — as we see here — RSS feeds. Data comes in all kinds of flavors. Steampipe abstracts those differences and brings all the flavors into a common space where you can reason over them using SQL.
</p>
<p>
And finally, it’s just wonderful to be at the intersection of Mastodon, Steampipe, and RSS in this remarkable moment. I’ll readily admit that nostalgia is a factor. But RSS did bust things wide open twenty years ago, Mastodon’s doing that now, and I love that RSS can help it happen again.
</p>
<p>
Now I need to write that #introduction!

<p>Continuing with our tradition of publishing a journal of significant travels, this begins a journal of our recent trip to the US South, focused on Race, Equity, and American Identity. Posts will be added approximately daily, and are delayed 7 weeks from the actual events.</p>
  



 



<p>Tuesday, October 18, 2022</p>



<p>Kenna and I left today on what will be our first fully-guided land trip. This is a thematic trip entitled Race, Equity, &amp; American Identity that was organized by <a href="https://www.sv2.org/">SV2</a>, a local philanthropic organization that Kenna and I are partners in. The trip was planned and will be led by <a href="https://www.telosgroup.org/">Telos</a>, an organization that is best described by their mission statement:</p>



<blockquote><p>We form communities of American peacemakers across lines of difference, and equip them to help reconcile seemingly intractable conflicts at home and abroad.</p>Telos mission statement</blockquote>



<p>We have had a couple of pre-trip meetings with our group. The group consists of about 16 people, which includes our friends Liz and Peter who expressed interest when Kenna told them about the trip. We decided to leave a day early to get acclimated to the time change, to have some time to re-explore New Orleans on our own, and to avoid missing any of the program on the actual first day.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/11/img_8670.jpg"></a>




<p>Our travel today was wonderfully drama-free. The ride to the airport was right on time, we met up with Peter and Liz at SFO airport, and our flight was on-time and comfortable. We got to our hotel, the <a href="https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/new-orleans-royal-orleans">Omni Royal</a>, in the late afternoon with enough time to walk around and explore. We walked around the French Quarter quite a bit, through Jackson Square, and down to the Mississippi River waterfront. The river seemed to be a little low but not as much as we expected.</p>



<p>While walking around, we read various menus to get ideas for dinner. We were in a touristy part of the French Quarter, so many places seemed the wrong style, too expensive or both. Consulting online resources, we decided on a high-rated barbecue place named <a href="https://www.pigoutnolabbq.com/">Pig Out</a>. It was very small and informal, and the food was excellent.</p>



<p>Having had just a few hours of sleep last night, we decided to turn in early, even considering the two hour time change.</p>

<p>The post shows how features toggles or feature switches can be implemented in an ASP.NET Core application using Blazor. The Microsoft.FeatureManagement Nuget package is used to add the feature toggles.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreFeatures.Toggles">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreFeatures.Toggles</a></p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>The Blazor application is a simple ASP.NET core hosted application using Azure AD for the identity provider. Both the Server and the Client applications need to implement the feature toggle.</p>



<p>The Blazor Server project is an ASP.NET Core application. This uses the Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore Nuget package. The Client application is a Blazor WASM project and uses the Microsoft.FeatureManagement package.</p>



 Blazor Server 



<p>The AddFeatureManagement can be used to added the services to add or remove features. I added a feature specific service which is only added is the feature is activated. This is read from teh server app settings.</p>


  services.AddFeatureManagement();

var featureXEnabled = configuration.GetValue&lt;bool&gt;("FeatureManagement:FeatureX");

if(featureXEnabled)
{
    services.AddScoped&lt;FeatureXService&gt;();
}
  


<p>The FeatureXApiController is used to make the feature business available for the Blazor UI. In this example, the IFeatureManager is used to check if the feature is enabled. If enabled, the business is called, otherwise a 404 is returned.</p>


  private IFeatureManager _featureManager;
private readonly FeatureXService _featureXService;

public FeatureXApiController(IFeatureManager featureManager, 
	
	FeatureXService featureXService)
{
	_featureManager = featureManager;
	_featureXService = featureXService;
}

[HttpGet]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; GetAsync()
{
	var featureX = await _featureManager
		.IsEnabledAsync(Features.FEATUREX);

	if(featureX)
	{
		return Ok(new List&lt;string&gt; { 
			"some data", 
			"more data", 
			_featureXService.GetFeatureString() 
		});
	}

	return NotFound();
}
  


<p>The  ASP.NET Core Server application uses the default FeatureManagement app settings. Only one feature was added to this application.</p>


  {
  "FeatureManagement": {
    "FeatureX": true
  }
}
  


 Blazor WASM Client 



<p>The AddFeatureManagement is used to add the feature management to the Blazor WASM UI.</p>


  builder.Services.AddFeatureManagement();
  


<p>The feature check can be used by injecting the IFeatureManager interface. The IsEnabledAsync can be used to check if the feature is enabled.</p>


  @page "/featurexapi"
@inject IAntiforgeryHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory
@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime
@using Microsoft.FeatureManagement
@using AspNetCoreFeatures.Toggles.Shared;
@inject IFeatureManager _featureManager

&lt;h1&gt;Data from Feature X API&lt;/h1&gt;

@if (apiData == null)
{
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
}
else
{
    &lt;table class="table"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Data&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
            @foreach (var data in apiData)
            {
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;@data&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
            }
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
}

@code {
    private string[]? apiData;

    public bool FeatureXEnabled { get; set; }

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var featureX = await _featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(Features.FEATUREX);

        if (featureX)
        {
            var client = await httpClientFactory.CreateClientAsync();
            apiData = await client.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;string[]&gt;("api/FeatureXApi");
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The Blazor WASM requires app settings with the feature definitions. This is deployed to the wwwroot folder in an ASP.NET Core hosted application.</p>


  {
  "FeatureManagement": {
    "FeatureX": true
  }
}
  


<p>The feature switch can also be used in the Razor UI components. The component can used the OnInitializedAsync to check if a feaure is enabled and set a bool value which can be used in the UI.</p>


  @using Microsoft.FeatureManagement
@using AspNetCoreFeatures.Toggles.Shared
@inject IFeatureManager _featureManager

&lt;div class="top-row pl-4 navbar navbar-dark"&gt;
    &lt;a class="navbar-brand" href=""&gt;Blazor AAD BFF Cookies&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;button class="navbar-toggler" @onclick="ToggleNavMenu"&gt;
        &lt;span class="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="@NavMenuCssClass" @onclick="ToggleNavMenu"&gt;
    &lt;ul class="nav flex-column"&gt;
        &lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
            &lt;Authorized&gt;

                &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
                    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="" Match="NavLinkMatch.All"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="oi oi-home" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Home
                    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;

                @if (FeatureXEnabled)
                {
                    &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
                        &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="featurexapi"&gt;
                            &lt;span class="oi oi-list-rich" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Feature X API call
                        &lt;/NavLink&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                }


            &lt;/Authorized&gt;
            &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
                &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
                    &lt;p class="whiteColor"&gt;no access&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
        
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

@code {
    private bool collapseNavMenu = true;

    public bool FeatureXEnabled { get; set; }

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        FeatureXEnabled = await _featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(Features.FEATUREX);
    }
   
    private string? NavMenuCssClass =&gt; collapseNavMenu ? "collapse" : null;

    private void ToggleNavMenu()
    {
        collapseNavMenu = !collapseNavMenu;
    }
}
  


<p>The feature can now be turned on or off per configuration.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Microsoft.FeatureManagement Nuget package provides many more feature management helpers and is really helpful when you need to support feature toggles or feature switches in a software solution or product. </p>

   <p>Which one of the roles is the most challenging, as both are isolated and unforgiving? In either position, the opposition will not like you when you're doing well.&nbsp; When doing badly, your supporters are not on your side.&nbsp; Irrespective of if it is a good or bad day in the office, everyone else knows they can do your job better than you can, and your backers are never happy, always wanting more.&nbsp; So what is the toughest position?&nbsp;</p> Being ahead  If you're thinking three, four, or five plays ahead, you're not suitable for this role. <p>There is a reality to both roles that you have to be ahead, to be in the right position at the right time to ensure success, but everyone else just thinks you are lucky.&nbsp; Anyone can do the job, but those who can see signals and read the play will excel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Blame  No matter how many great things you do, everyone only remembers you for the one you missed <p>In either position, you have to accept that you’re the last person in the line of defence, and you will regularly take the brunt of the criticism when it goes wrong. But these abilities, to remain humble and stay positive combined with power, agility, and quickness, make those in these positions the strongest leaders.</p> Touchline criticism  They need an element of insanity, as there is no hiding place. <p>Criticisms from the sideline can be heard when you stand in one spot; their views are loud and clear.&nbsp; Abuse is particularly annoying when you know the media and crowd have zero experience with your role and do not know the context.&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom line is that you have to ignore all those distractions. People on the sidelines are fickle. Anything you do — good or bad — will alter their opinions on you pretty quickly. Stick to what you're good at, and you’ll prove them wrong.</p><br> Preparation  Success depends upon previous preparation; without such preparation, there will surely be failure. <p>In lower levels, particularly in SMEs and youth football, there’s a tendency to stick the CEO in position or the keeper in goal and pelt multiple objects their way from point blank range. It’s one of the worst ways for a leader to prepare.&nbsp; A leader will take charge and create proper warmup routines, which others feel do not warm them up and this creates tensions and conflicts.</p> Messy  So there’s an enormous blue frog with your name on it. <p>The CEO deals with people and all the messy complications people bring to any team.&nbsp; A goalie has to deal with a muddy puddle that is cold and wet.&nbsp; Those who lead deal with how they will approach it before they play and not during.</p><br> Training  Coaching is not the filling of a pot but the lighting of a fire <p>It’s 10 of them for every 1 of you. Unfortunately, CEOs and goalkeepers are regularly neglected in team coaching and training sessions. With so many players to work on, leaders and keepers don’t receive the attention they need as they are unique and special; however, they are the ones who can lift everyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> Second chance  Is it unprecedented for two CEOs or goalkeepers in competition can both enjoy the result? <p>Being a CEO or goalkeeper is the most unforgiving position and offers little opportunity for redemption. Sales directors and strikers, for example, can make several poor efforts at a goal and then “get into” the game. If they land the deal or score, those poor efforts are entirely forgotten.&nbsp;</p><p>When you step out, you have to be ready because redemption is an uphill struggle. If you make a mistake, you may not get another chance to put it right. You can only keep your head up, stay focused, and learn from it.</p> Alone on a bad day&nbsp;  Only a CEO can understand the challenges faced by a goalkeeper. <p>There’s nothing worse than the journey home when you’re kicking yourself over a mistake you made. It’s those key moments that ruin an evening or weekend for everyone. CEOs and goalkeepers truly carry the burden of their errors. No other position holds themselves singularly responsible. With that in mind, it’s unsurprising that some professionals have to quit for a lifestyle with a little less stress. Mental strength, a positive attitude and the determination to go again are required. Wounds will heal. CEO and keepers are easily victimised by their high level of responsibility. It takes guts to be one.</p> With all that said  Only an outstanding leader can make their team victorious. <br>

<p>Write a biblical parable in the style of the King James Bible explaining why one should only use access tokens and ndever ID tokens for access management</p>
（出所）@Sarah_Cecc </blockquote>



<p>つまり</p>



<blockquote>
<p>アクセス管理にアクセストークンとIDトークンのみを使用すべき理由を、欽定訳聖書のスタイルで説明しなさい。</p>
</blockquote>



<p>この結果がすごく面白い。IDトークンの説明が間違ってるけど、いかにも欽定訳聖書ぽくなっている。DeepL翻訳がこれ。</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ある賢い王がWebdomの国で、害を与えようとする者から自分の王国を守ろうとしたとき、そのことが明らかになった。そして王は、正当なアクセス権を持つ者だけが王国の門をくぐることができるよう、アクセス管理システムを導入するよう召使に命じた。</p>



<p>しかし、王のしもべたちが使えるトークンには、アクセス・トークンとIDトークンの2種類があった。しかし、使用人はセキュリティに疎く、どちらを使えばいいのか分からない。</p>



<p>そこで王は参謀を呼び、2つのトークンの違いを説明するように頼んだ。</p>



<p>「アクセス・トークンは一時的なもので、王国内の特定の資源にアクセスするために使われるものです。一方、IDトークンは永久的なものであり、所持者の機密情報を含んでいます。もし、IDトークンが悪人の手に渡れば、王国全体へのアクセスが許可される可能性があるのです」。</p>



<p>王はこれを大いに憂慮し、王国の安全を脅かすことのないよう、アクセストークンをアクセス管理のためにのみ使用するよう召使に命じた。</p>



<p>王は、「すべての人に無制限のアクセスを許可して王国の安全を脅かすよりは、少数の人に限定されたアクセスを許可する方がよい」と宣言した。</p>



<p>王国のしもべたちは、この王様の言葉に耳を傾け、王国は安全な状態を保ちました。</p>
（出所）@Sarah_Cecc によるChatGPT生成結果より <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2022/12/5082/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5082" title="And it came to pass that a wise king, in the land of Webdom, sought to protect his kingdom from those who would seek to do harm. And he commanded his servants to implement a system of access management, that only those with rightful access may enter the kingdom&amp;#8217;s gates.<br>But there were two types of tokens that the king&amp;#8217;s servants could use &amp;#8211; access tokens and ID tokens. And the servants were unsure which to use, for they were not well versed in the ways of security.<br>And so the king summoned his chief counselor, and asked him to explain the difference between the two tokens.<br>&amp;#8220;Mighty king,&amp;#8221; the counselor said, &amp;#8220;access tokens are temporary and can be used to grant access to specific resources within the kingdom. ID tokens, on the other hand, are permanent and contain sensitive information about the bearer. If an ID token were to fall into the wrong hands, it could be used to gain access to the entire kingdom without permission.&amp;#8221;<br>The king was greatly concerned by this, and commanded his servants to only use access tokens for access management, lest they jeopardize the security of the kingdom.<br>&amp;#8220;For it is better to grant limited access to a few, than to risk the safety of the kingdom by granting unrestricted access to all,&amp;#8221; the king declared.<br>And the servants of the kingdom heeded the wise words of their king, and the kingdom remained safe and secure. ">1</a></blockquote>



<p>ちなみに、同じ質問をわたしが投げてみたら違うバージョンが返ってきた。AIなので結果は安定しないんですよね。ここでもこの「賢い王」は同じ間違いをしているところは安定しているけど。</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ある賢い王が、自分の王国に入ろうとする者はすべて、まずアクセストークンを得なければならないと命じた。王国は大きな宝と知恵のある場所であり、王はそれを害そうとする者から守りたかったからである。</p>



<p>しかし、王の命令を聞かず、入城証以外の方法で王国に入ろうとする者がいた。これらの者は愚かな者で、自分が賢いと思って、代わりにIDトークンを使おうとしたのだ。</p>



<p>しかし、王は賢明で、このことを予見していた。そして、王国の門に警備兵を配置し、適切なアクセストークンを持つ者だけが入れるようにしたのである。自分を賢いと思っている愚かな者たちは門で追い返され、そのIDトークンは何の役にも立たなかった。</p>



<p>賢者たちは、王の命令を教訓として、王国に入るためにアクセストークンを得ることだけを目指した。というのも、アクセストークンだけが王国に入るための真の方法であり、他の手段はすべて無駄であったからである。</p>



<p>王は喜んだ、彼の王国は安全で堅固であり、ふさわしい者だけが入ることができたからである。そして、他の手段で王国に入ろうとする者はすべて、その中にある宝と知恵にアクセスすることができず、外に取り残されてしまったのである。</p>



<p>だから、賢い王の王国に入ろうとする者はみな、このたとえ話に注意し、入国のしるしを手に入れよう。そして、他の方法で入ろうとする者はすべて、門で追い返され、IDトークンは何の役にも立たないので、警告を受けるようにしなさい。</p>

  The first law of OAuth states that the total number of authorized access tokens must remain constant in an isolated system.
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  The second law of OAuth states that the overall security of the system will always increase or remain constant over time.
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  The third law of OAuth states that as the security of the system approaches absolute, the ability to grant authorized access approaches zero.
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  The zeroth law of OAuth states that if two systems are in authorization equilibrium with a third system, they are also in authorization equilibrium with each other. In other words, if two systems have the same access rights and permissions, they are considered to be in a state of authorization equilibrium.

<p>I was talking to a long time competitor/colleague/client/friend this week about identity governance and a variety of other identity topics. We were commenting that in some regards access certification and access policies have been stuck in bubble of amber: not a lot of innovation save the addition of some cluster analysis (marketed as AI.) In the course of the conversation I remember that a long time ago I had written a piece on the use of negative policy spaces for access governance. My buddy thought it would be fun to dig it up a repost it. So of I went to find this…</p>



<p>What’s funny (at least to me) is that what follows is a writing sample I used as part of the interview process to get my first analyst job at Burton Group. And that brought back a lot of memories… </p>



<p>So without further adieu, straight out of 2008, I bring you:</p>



 Controls Intelligence in the Greater Whole – Using Negative Authorizations to satisfy Audit Requirements and strengthen Positive Authorization Policies 



 Executive Summary 



<p>Whether conscious of it or not, no enterprise embarks on a controls exercise, be it controls definition, management, monitoring, or rationalization, unless that exercise addresses audit requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auditors and regulators have defined the backdrop against which a variety of corporate stakeholders must perform an ever-changing array of maneuvers to prove compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this context, controls intelligence platforms and processes have developed to directly satisfy audit requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, identity management technologies and other “compliance” tools are not truly aware of the constraints and requirements that auditors inflict upon organizations and are fundamentally not designed to meet those needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece will contrast the difference between controls intelligence platforms and their associated negative authorization policies against identity management technologies and their positive authorization policies, illustrating the appropriate use of both in the eyes of the auditors as well as the enterprise.</p>



 The Auditors rise to Power 



<p>It sometimes seems as if there were no audit regulations before Sarbanes-Oxley, but of course there were.&nbsp;&nbsp;Various industries had their own set of regulations and subsequent audit requirements to meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;SOX, however, does not discriminate among industries and with its introduction all manner of enterprise turned to their auditors for guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The power and importance of the external auditor grew significantly; on one side, their clients were asking for guidance and on the other government and regulators were looking for results.&nbsp;&nbsp;This put auditors in control and control they did; they defined stringent audit requirements and testing procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;They design the obstacle course that their clients have had to maneuver year after year.</p>



 Being Negative Never Seemed So Good 



<p>Simply put, auditors are interested in what people cannot do.&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to verify that people who can execute out one task cannot execute another task that is in opposition to the first.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, an auditor will examine business systems to validate that the collection of capabilities granted to an inventory clerk does not enable the clerk to see the pay grades of her coworkers, as well as authorize payment for goods she ordered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Auditors require that the analysis of these collections of capabilities must be executed at the lowest level of the audited system, ensuring that no convoluted permutation of capability components result in conflicts that cannot be detected at higher levels and thus cannot be mitigated.&nbsp;&nbsp;This analysis of complex systems and processes is expressed using negative authorizations – explicit statements about which capability components are in conflict with others.</p>



<p>Compliance to audit requirements is evidence that the organization has not allowed to transpire what, according to auditors, should not be allowed to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;This holds true for both automatable processes and manual ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of evidence that the organization required all of its managers to attend sexual harassment training, and thus educated managers appropriately, can be sufficient to run afoul of audit and/or regulatory requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, evidence that a business system allows the inventory clerk to see her coworkers’ pay grades as well as authorize payment for goods she ordered can be sufficient to violate an audit requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Controls intelligence and controls documentation platforms are designed to discover the existence of such potential violations before the auditor discovers them.&nbsp;&nbsp;These tools, from a testing and monitoring perspective, utilize negative authorizations to discover, on an on-going as well as episodic basis, potential violations in both manual and automatable processes.</p>



 The Downside of being Positive 



<p>Identity Management technologies deal with entitlement: what are people of a certain type allowed to, and subsequently enabled, to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;This holds true for a variety of identity management technologies including user provisioning, bottom-up and top-down role management, as well as entitlement management.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these technologies use a form of an entitlement which groups people together and grants them a collection of capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The explicit granting nature of these entitlements is a form of positive authorizations.</p>



<p>The primary goal of entitlement-based identity management systems is to realize operational efficiencies by granting and managing people’s granted abilities faster with more automated control and finesse.&nbsp;&nbsp;A secondary goal is the self-service enablement of users in order to reduce cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;These tools are invaluable to IT and help reduce the overall cost of supporting the enterprise’s user population.&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said these tools cannot truly meet the needs of auditors on their own.</p>



<p>Auditors are not ignorant to positive authorization-based systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are well aware these systems help provide access to business systems and at the same time these systems can pollute critical business systems with audit exceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the inherent reasons that these positive authorization systems can so easily generate problems is that these systems concern themselves with collections of capabilities at the highest level.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows entitlements to be built and managed quickly, helping to realize operational efficiencies, but does not allow for the detailed analysis that auditors require and that negative authorization platforms provide.</p>



 Using Negative Authorizations to satisfy Audit Requirements 



<p>While the efficiencies gained from positive authorization systems, like user provisioning, are great from a bottom-line perspective, those efficiencies are irrelevant to auditors – they don’t care how quickly an enterprise grants access to business applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;To satisfy audit requirements, an enterprise must be able to demonstrate how people cannot execute certain tasks, how theirs capabilities are not in conflict and must be able to demonstrate this amongst the tiny pieces that comprise a capability.&nbsp;&nbsp;To accomplish this, the enterprise must rely on negative authorizations and the depth of analysis that controls intelligence platforms provide.</p>



<p>Unaware of their choice, many enterprises choose to codify and modify negative authorizations through manual efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;They employ brute force spreadsheet-based analysis of both manual processes and business systems to demonstrate that they have an enforced, auditable collection of negative authorization policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective to a point and costly to an extreme, these efforts have been tolerably sufficient in the past but with changes to auditor guidance, such as&nbsp;&nbsp;AS5, and financial and competitive pressures, enterprises are turning to automated solutions, eschewing these manual efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprises that chose controls intelligence platforms, those who automate controls management and monitoring, find benefits in reduced audit preparation costs, easier more predictable audits, and stronger deployments of their positive authorization systems.</p>



 Harmonizing of Negative and Positive Authorizations 



<p>As previously mentioned, positive authorization systems, like identity management technologies, provide a conduit along which potential exceptions and audit findings travel straight into business systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to intercept these potential audit exceptions and, in turn, meet audit requirements, enterprises must examine their positive authorization-based policies through the filter of negative authorizations.</p>



<p>There are two key points at which controls intelligence, negative authorizations, can filter positive authorization-based identity management technologies: runtime and design-time.&nbsp;&nbsp;At runtime, proposed account changes, generated by user provisioning systems, derived from positive authorization-based entitlements, pass through the filter of a controls intelligence platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;This negative authorization filter highlights potential exceptions that exist in the proposed account change and does so by using the language that the auditors speak at a level of detail that the auditors expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;This process, known as compliant provisioning, provides a safety-net for critical business applications, preventing potential audit findings from finding their way into the business applications in the first place.</p>



<p>Although compliant provisioning is a highly effective method of preventing potential exceptions, design-time application of negative authorization filters is a superior long term approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach not only reduces potential audit exceptions, but also increases the value of enterprise identity management deployments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Design-time application of negative authorizations works as follows: as entitlements are developed in positive authorization systems, they are passed through the filter of a controls intelligence platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative authorization analysis of these entitlements, episodically and/or continually, highlight flaws in these entitlements and help organizations prevent these “bad” entitlements from generating fundamentally flawed role definitions, provisioning policies and account changes, and access entitlements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, by relying on the filter of negative authorizations at design-time, organizations can avoid costly and time consuming entitlement exercises in which subject matter experts on critical business systems attempt to translate what they know an auditor wants to see (negative authorizations) into convoluted positive authorizations.</p>



<p>Both the runtime and design-time approaches harmonize positive and negative authorizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;This harmonizing of satisfies audit requirements for complete, detailed negative authorization analysis and reduces potential audit findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also retains all of the operational benefits of identity management systems, reduces the cost of deploying these systems, and increases their time to value.</p>



 Recommendations 



<p>To satisfy both internal and external audit requirements, the enterprise must consolidate and rationalize its negative authorization policy stores.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes transitioning from manual-effort analysis and disjoint controls documentation to continuous, automated controls testing whose results flow into a consolidated controls documentation platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts reduce enterprise risk and audit exposure and serves to directly meet audit requirements.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the enterprise should continue deploying identity management technologies and their positive authorizations in order to realize operational gains.&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, the enterprise should not attempt to make these positive authorizations behave like negative authorization systems as the effort will be time consuming, costly, and fundamentally will not meet audit requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the enterprise should tie their negative authorizations to their positive authorization systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the minimum the enterprise should deploy compliant provisioning, passing entitlement generated account changes through the filter of a controls intelligence platform for negative authorization analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, during creation and on-going maintenance, identity management entitlements, in their various forms, should be examined through negative authorization filters weeding out potential audit findings long before they can find their way into business applications.</p>



<p>By using negative authorizations and thus gaining control intelligence, the enterprise can speak the language of the auditor and rise to the challenge of an ever-changing set of audit requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;By using negative and positive authorization in harmony, the enterprise can realize operational efficiencies without an increased risk of potential audit findings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OpenID is a decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to securely log in to multiple websites using a single set of login credentials. It allows users to authenticate their identity on one website, and then use that authentication to log in to other websites that support OpenID without having to create separate accounts for each website. This allows users to have more control over their personal information and makes it easier to manage multiple online accounts. OpenID is an open standard that is supported by many different websites and organizations.</p>

<p>日本語にDeepLで翻訳させるとこんな感じ。</p>



<blockquote>
<p>OpenIDは分散型の認証プロトコルで、ユーザーは1組のログイン認証情報を使って複数のウェブサイトに安全にログインすることができるようになります。ユーザーは、1つのWebサイトで自分のIDを認証し、その認証を使ってOpenIDをサポートする他のWebサイトにログインすることができ、それぞれのWebサイトで別々のアカウントを作成する必要がありません。これにより、ユーザーは自分の個人情報をより管理しやすくなり、複数のオンラインアカウントを容易に管理することができます。OpenIDは、さまざまなWebサイトや組織がサポートするオープンスタンダードです。</p>

<p>That was <a href="https://www.billswindamanphotography.com/">Bill Swindaman</a> on the last day I saw him: June 2nd of this year, at a gathering of friends from the best community I’ve ever known: a real one, of friends living in a place. The place was called Oxbow, and it was a collection of mismatched houses on a short dirt road that skirted a pond off Mt. Sinai Road, north of Chapel Hill, in North Carolina. I lived or hung out there, and with friends who called themselves Oxbovines, from 1974 until I moved to Silicon Valley in 1985. After that, we got together once a year at a beach house until the early ’90s. One thing that kept me coming back was <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72177720304116942">a letter Bill wrote</a> called “Where the hell is Searls?”</p>
<p>Since then we’ve all stayed good friends and in touch. And sometimes rogue planets in our little solar system, such as I, would come through town and we’d get together. That’s what happened in June. It was great to see everybody, but there was bummage in the house, because we all knew Bill had ALS: an awful and fatal disease, diagnosed six months earlier. It was a disease that had claimed David Hodskins, my business partner and a friend for nearly as long, just three months earlier. (I remember David, and some of our business adventures, <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2022/03/30/exitings/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>At Oxbow, Bill and I would often play one-on-one basketball (he was bigger and better), and shoot the shit about everything. I remember one story he told about his dad, a family doctor in Toledo, Ohio. When his car caught fire on the road for no obvious reason, Doctor Swindaman calmly pulled over to the side, got out, lit a cigarette, and calmly watched the thing burn down. Bill too was known for his calm and love of irony. On one of his long cross-country trips alone, Bill sent me a postcard from Tijuana. All he wrote was “Where the liquor flowed, and the dice were hot.” (Those less elderly that Bill and I might not know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tijuana_Jail">the reference</a>.)</p>
<p>As I recall, Bill went to Wittenberg College and got his masters in (I thought it was urban planning, but have heard it was something else) at UNC Chapel Hill. After that, he had a series of jobs that he used to accumulate savings for funding long trips. His last job, as I recall, was working for UNC doing something or other that doesn’t matter as much as the other vocation he took up in recent decades: nature photography. You can see his work at <a href="https://www.billswindamanphotography.com/">BillSwindamanPhotography.com</a>. Here he is, on the job:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.billswindamanphotography.com/"></a></p>
<p>I recognize so many places when I look through his photographs—Death Valley, Comb Ridge, Monument Valley, Arches, Canyonlands—less because I’ve been there than because I’ve shot them from commercial flights zooming by <a href="https://flickr.com/search/?text=windowseat&amp;sort=interestingness-desc">overhead</a>. I envied Bill’s ability to get out and explore these places, while I was too committed to other things. I also respected the quality of Bill’s work. It was, and remains, primo.</p>
<p>We did talk for a while about his maybe coming up to New York, from which we could go out to tidelands and photograph wildlife and other outdoor scenes. I lacked gear and skills to equal <a href="https://www.billswindamanphotography.com/ncwildliferefuges">Bill’s</a>, but it would have been fun. Alas, as John Lennon said, life is what happens when you’re busy making plans.</p>
<p>When I saw Bill in June, I asked if he was still in shape to keep shooting. He said no, and that he had already sold off all his gear. Yet he was still in good humor, considering the obvious fact that he was done with pretty much everything other than persisting at being his good self.</p>
<p>This morning came an email I hadn’t expected this soon. It was from Jackie Strouble, the wild dear with whom he hooked up back in our Oxbow days. With her permission, I’ll later add here what she wrote. Meantime I hope she doesn’t mind my sharing the photo above, which came with her letter.</p>
<p>And I just hope Bill’s memory for us Oxbovines will be a blessing to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Nostalgia is a dangerous drug and it’s always risky to wallow in it. So those of us who fondly remember the early blogosphere, and now want to draw parallels to the fediverse, should do so carefully. But we do want to learn from history. </p>
<p>Here’s one way to compare five generations of social software along the five dimensions named in the title of this post. </p>
               Autonomy    Packet Size   Friction    Fanout    Velocity
 
Usenet        medium      high          medium      medium    low

Blogosphere   high        high          high        low       low

Facebook      low         high          low         medium    high

Twitter       low         low           low         high      high

Fediverse     high        medium        high        medium    medium
 
<p>These are squishy categories, but I think they surface key distinctions. Many of us who were active in the blogosphere of the early 2000s enjoyed a high level of autonomy. Our RSS readers were our Internet dashboards. We loaded them with a curated mix of official and individual voices. There were no limits on the size of packets exchanged in this network. You could write one short paragraph or a 10,000-word essay. Networking wasn’t frictionless because blog posts did mostly feel like essays, and because comments didn’t yet exist. To comment on my blog post you’d write your own blog post linking to it. </p>
<p>That friction limited the degree to which a post would fan out through the network, and the velocity of its propagation. The architecture of high friction, low fanout, and low velocity was a winning combination for a while. In that environment I felt connected but not over-connected, informed but not overloaded. </p>
<p>Twitter flipped things around completely. It wasn’t just the loss of autonomy as ads and algos took over. With packets capped at 120 characters, and tweets potentially seen immediately by everyone, friction went nearly to zero. The architecture of low friction created an addictive experience and enabled powerful effects. But it wasn’t conducive to healthy discourse.</p>
<p>The fediverse can, perhaps, strike a balance. Humans didn’t evolve to thrive in frictionless social networks with high fanout and velocity, and arguably we shouldn’t. We did evolve in networks governed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a>, and our online networks should respect that limit. We need less friction within communities of knowledge and practice, more friction between them. We want messages to fan out pervasively and rapidly within communities, but less so between them.</p>
<p>We’re at an extraordinary inflection point right now. Will the fediverse enable us to strike the right balance? I think it has the right architectural ingredients to land where I’ve (speculatively) placed it in that table. High autonomy. As little friction as necessary, but not too little. As much fanout and velocity as necessary, but not too much. Nobody knows how things will turn out, predictions are futile, behavior is emergent, but I am on the edge of my seat watching this all unfold.</p>

<p>This article looks at using Microsoft Graph permissions in Azure App registrations and whether you should use Graph in specific Azure App registrations types and if it is ok to expose these with other scopes and roles. Is it ok to expose Graph permissions in public Azure App registrations?</p>



 Using Graph with public applications 



<p>As a rule, I do not allow any Graph permissions to be assigned to an Azure App registration used by a public application apart from the delegated User.Read permission or others like this. The problem with sharing a Graph permission in this way is that you allow the full permission to be shared and not just the specific use case from your application. For example, if I expose the User.ReadWrite.All permission in a public Azure App registration, anyone who acquires an access token for this permission can do everything allowed. My application might only need to allow a user to update the firstname, lastname properties. With this token, I could list out all users on this tenant and share this in an unfriendly way or create and delete users.</p>



<p>If you find a public Azure App registration and Graph permissions other than the User.Read scope, you probably have found a security attack possibility or evaluated permissions problem.</p>



<p>A better setup is to separate the Graph permissions into a different Azure App registration and only allow this to be used in a confidential client.</p>







 Using Graph with application App Registrations 



<p>When using Graph application permissions, I create a specific Azure App registration to expose the permissions which require a secret or certificate to acquire the access token. You should not share this with an Azure App registration used to expose different APIs. If only using this inside a specific confidential Web client which is not used to expose further APIs, then it is ok to share the Graph permissions and the confidential client definitions in the same Azure App registration.</p>



<p>I never mix application permissions and delegated permissions in the same Azure App registration. If you find yourself doing this, it is probably the result of an architecture error and should be reviewed.</p>



 Separating Graph permissions and solution App registrations 



<p>When using an Azure App registration to use an specific API role or scope, do not use the same one to expose a Graph permission. This is because the intent of the Azure App registration is to do whatever is allowed in the API exposed using this. If you also allow Graph permissions, the App registrations can be used for two different intentions. The client using this could execute an evaluated privilege attack as the same secret/certificate can be used to acquire both of the permissions or even worse, no secret at all is required to get an access token for the Graph API.</p>



<p>You might not want to allow the client using the API to have the full access to everything exposed with the Graph permission. You probably only want to expose a subset. This can be solved by using an API which validates the specific request and in a trusted environment and the Graph permissions from a separate Azure App registration can be used with a confidential client and only the subset of the Graph features are exposed to the third party. A secret or certificate must be required to get the access token for the Graph permission. It it not possible for the third party application to get an access token for the Graph permission.</p>



 What about sharing Graph permissions and third party applications 



<p>Shared Graph permissions to third party clients is sharing trust. I would avoid this as much as possible and use a zero trust strategy. Only expose or share what is required. How secure are the secrets or certificates in the other solutions? How easy is it to rotate the secrets?</p>

<p>去る８月６日の原爆忌に、今日（11月25日）金曜ロードショーで放映される「ヴァイオレット・エヴァーガーデン」の舞台であるC.H郵便社のモデルになった京都文化博物館別館ホールで、ツィンバロンの演奏会を開き、そのアンコールに同作のシーズン１のエンディング・テーマである「みちしるべ」を演奏してきました。戦争の悲惨さを訴えかける同作、そしてそのPTSDから「愛してる」をさがしてヴァイオレットが歩みを始めるC.H郵便社が、ウクライナ戦争が始まった今年のことを考え、この作品を作っているときに焼き討ちテロにあって亡くなった京都アニメーションの方々とそこから立ち上がってきた方々のことを考え、はたまたこの原爆忌に原爆で亡くなった方々の思いに馳せ、戦争の無い世界を想うのに最適なシチュエーションと曲であると思ったからです。</p>



<p>ややネタバレになりますが、ご存知の無い方のために書くと、「ヴァイオレット・エヴァーガーデン」は京都アニメーション社が制作した非常に美しいアニメで、第一次世界大戦と思しき当時のドイツ近辺で兵器として育てられ心を閉ざしてしまった少女が、最後の上官となった「少佐」に人として扱われ、人間性を取り戻し始めたときに戦場で両腕を失い、少佐が「戦死」直前にかけたことば「愛してる」の意味を探して戦後生きていこうとする作品です。失った両腕は高性能の義手で補って、タイプならば打てるようになったので、まだ文盲の方が多い社会で自動筆記人形（代筆業）をC.H郵便社で行いながら「愛してる」を探します。戦争PTSD、自閉症、当時ホワイトカラーとしての女性の社会進出の最前線であったタイピスト、社会に残り続ける戦争の傷跡、生きるとは、死ぬとは、その意味とは、そうしたことを、京都アニメーションの透明感の高い絵で、静けさの中に重層的に塗り重ねていくドラマです。長いですが、ぜひ見ていただきたいアニメです。</p>



<p>今回の演奏では今年侵略されているウクライナでもよく演奏される楽器「ツィンバロン」を使いました。演奏している崎村潤子はこの10月にはチェコでウクライナの奏者と一緒に演奏をしてきています。</p>



<p>ツィンバロンは東欧から中欧に広がるダルシマー族の楽器です<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2022/11/5063/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5063" title="近い楽器にドイツで盛んなバッグブレットがあります。">1</a>小型のものは軍楽隊でも使われますから、ヴァイオレットもひょっとしたらきいたことがあったかもしれません。そんなことにも心を馳せながら聞いてみてください。</p>

 Reflections following Cardano Summit&nbsp;2022 <p>With Ethereum now functionally a censored network, many have been asking what L1 they should build on. With that in mind (plus an invitation from the magical Catalyst4Climate group), I attended the two-day Cardano Summit in Lausanne, and asked everyone I could the key question: “Does it&nbsp;work?”</p> Cardano Community: Less Shill, More&nbsp;Goodwill <p>Cardano has taken a slower route towards development of its solution, with more than 160 academic papers and the establishment of a line of studies at Edinburgh University to create and maintain a <a href="https://www.bbcode.org/edinburgh-decentralization-index.php">Decentralization Index</a>. They eschew the philosophy of “move fast and break things” for a more methodical and reliable approach to building software.</p><p>The community surrounding Cardano reflects this philosophy. The dress was business casual rather than cypherpunk haphazard. Shilling was at a minimum, with Impact-related projects having equal weight with DeFi and technical sessions. The Cardano crowd is intentional about not speaking about other protocols as well as avoiding discussions of the ADA price. In short, compared to other crypto communities, the Cardano crowd came off as a group of mature professionals rather than revolutionaries or slick marketers.</p><p>On the one hand, the more mature feel was welcome, reflected in several serious projects with large bodies such as the UN and government institutions. On the downside, it seemed there were fewer truly cutting edge innovations. While Cardano hosts a number of delightful NFT projects, the more practical teams took the floor most often. Self Sovereign Identity projects were abundant, which gives Cardano a huge boost compared to crypto projects who assert that NFTs will somehow suffice as Verifiable Credentials. Live demos included using DID and VC for swapping business contacts and a working PoS system based on a Raspberry Pi.</p> What, No Elephant? <p>Remarkably, in the middle of the coldest crypto winter, there was no mention of any of the difficulties that have befallen the rest of the market. With Ethereum becoming a censored network, DAOs under legal scrutiny, Solana failing to live up to its promises, and centralized exchanges crashing the market, now is the perfect time to be speaking about lessons&nbsp;learned.</p><p>Yet, there was almost complete silence about the news in the industry and how to avoid problems such&nbsp;as:</p>  NFTs becoming “mutable” by&nbsp;OpenSea.  Majority of Ethereum blocks censoring private transactions.  Prosecution of DAOs under US regulations.  Under-collateralization of assets on exchanges.  Implications of the recent ruling against LBRY, declaring their tokens to be securities.  <p>Of course, in the decentralized world, these are sticky problems. If you aren’t a centralized entity, it’s easy to argue that it’s not up to you who opens an NFT marketplace, where and how the validators choose to manage their operations, or how the regulators treat the projects built on your Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>Whether it’s up to you or not, however, these are real threats. Ignoring them won’t make them go&nbsp;away.</p> Regulation and Validators <p>Like every blockchain, Cardano does have a group working with regulators. They do have consortia of their Stake Pool Operators, and Delegators can stake on the nodes they consider most reliable. Unfortunately, this seems inadequate.</p><p>While 60% of the nodes in Cardano are on bare metal, 90% of the Relayers are hosted on the major cloud provider. Plus, it’s not clear what “bare metal” means in terms of jurisdiction. If someone has a fully-owned bare metal rack in their basement, and the government of their country says you can’t run Tornado Cash through your node, what do you do? We know the answer to that&nbsp;one.</p><p>Today, every L1 should be thinking very carefully about the companies hosting their nodes, as well as the jurisdictions where the servers are&nbsp;located.</p><p>Which brings us to regulation. It should be obvious at this point that the regulatory bodies are not friends of private blockchains. It should also be obvious why that is. Nation-states have no interest in a bunch of technologists offering an alternative to the nation’s sovereign monetary&nbsp;system.</p> You Are Not an Operating System <p>Cardano, like the other Layer 1s, sees itself as a kind of operating system. As such, L1s don’t govern what is built on them. They don’t decide on the direction of the community, how to prioritize traffic, or what projects to encourage on the platform. Except for the fact that, over time, it’s inevitable that L1s end up prioritizing DeFi because that’s where the money is. Also, individuals inevitably end up complying with laws, no matter how unjust they are, because the consequences of civil disobedience are too high for most&nbsp;people.</p>  Why stand up for LBRY or Ooki? You’ve got your own problems and the regulators haven’t come after you&nbsp;yet.  Why not let your nodes live on <a href="https://www.cryptotimes.io/alchemy-and-infura-block-access-for-tornado-cash-users/">Alchemy or Infura</a>? You’ll just annoy your community and limit who can be a&nbsp;host.  Why speak out about centralized exchanges or <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">disappearing NFTs</a> on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/anger-as-opensea-bans-nft-collectors-in-iran">OpenSea</a>? Where else will you get that volume of transaction fees?  <p>All of these are examples of the trap of decentralization, free markets, and an industry based on individual game&nbsp;theory.</p><p>For any individual in the game, it’s easiest to host a node or relayer on Alchemy or Google. For any individual in the game, it’s easiest to manage their onboarding and offboarding in whatever legitimate or illegitimate way that works for them. For any individual project it’s easiest to call their token a “utility” or “governance” token based on whatever is legal at any given moment. For any individual in the game, it’s easiest to use the popular tools even if they aren’t as decentralized.</p><p>For the industry as a whole, these individual game theoretic choices lead to illegalization, censorship, and CBDCs. These individual choices are leading to a bunch of useless L1s and Bitcoin as the last chain standing.</p><p>The Bitcoin Maxis may have been right all along, but even the Bitcoin Maxis are hurting these days. The inability of L1s to deliver on their promises damages everyone.</p> Decentralized Governance: Can It Get&nbsp;Better <p>Governance is how individuals do things together. From that perspective, DAOs have been another huge failing of the Web3 industry. Hard Forks and Rage Quits are the opposite of democracy. Rather than a Web3 movement, what we have is a lot of noise and competition.</p><p>In the next few blogs, I’ll be exploring how Layer 1s and the industry as a whole might approach some of these problems. I mean. Hopefully. Hopefully, I’ll have some practical and constructive ideas over the next few weeks. At this point, I have a lot more questions than answers, and I have a lot more faith than evidence that we as an industry can resolve these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>To be perfectly honest, I’m about as happy as a Bitcoin Maxi that I’ve been right all along about these things. Right but Rekt is not a good look. We can do&nbsp;better.</p>

  <p>Summary: Verifiable credentials have a number of use cases in healthcare. Using them can reduce the administrative burden that people experience at the hands of the bureaucracies that inevitably develop.</p>


<p>
    I have a medical condition that requires that I get blood tests every three months. And, having recently changed jobs, my insurance, and thus the set of acceptable labs, changed recently. I know that this specific problem is very US-centric, but bear with me, I think the problems that I'll describe, and the architectures that lead to them, are more general than my specific situation. 
</p>

<p>
    My doctor sees me every 6 months, and so gives me two lab orders each time. Last week, I showed up at Revere Health's lab. They were happy to take my insurance, but not the lab order. They needed a date on it. So, I called my doctor and they said they'd fax over an order to the lab. We tried that three times but the lab never got it. So my doctor emailed it to me. The lab wouldn't take the electronic lab order from my phone, wouldn't let me email it to them (citing privacy issues with non-secure email), and couldn't let me print it there. I ended up driving to the UPS Store to print it, then return to the lab. Ugh.
</p>

<p>
    This story is a perfect illustration of what David Graeber calls the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00MKZ0QZ2/windleyofente-20">Utopia of Rules</a>. Designers of administrative systems do the imaginative work of defining processes, policies, and rules. But, as I wrote in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>Because of the systematic imbalance of power that administrative ... systems create, administrators can afford to be lazy. To the administrator, everyone is structurally the same, being fit into the same schema. This is efficient because they can afford to ignore all the qualities that make people unique and concentrate on just their business. Meanwhile subjects are left to perform the "interpretive labor," as Graeber calls it, of understanding the system, what it allows or doesn't, and how it can be bent to accomplish their goals. Subjects have few tools for managing these relationships because each one is a little different from the others, not only technically, but procedurally as well. There is no common protocol or user experience [from one administrative system to the next].
</blockquote>
<p>
    The lab order format my doctor gave me was accepted just fine at Intermountain Health Care's labs. But Revere Health had different rules. I was forced to adapt to their rules, being subject to their administration. 
</p>

<p>
    Bureaucracies are often made functional by the people at the front line making exceptions or cutting corners. In my case no exceptions were made. They were polite, but ultimately uncaring and felt no responsibility to help me solve the problem. This is an example of the "interpretive labor" borne by the subjects of any administrative system.
</p>

<p>
    Centralizing the system—such as having one national healthcare system—could solve my problem because the format for the order and the communication between entities could be streamlined. You can also solve the problem by defining cross-organization schema and protocols. My choice, as you might guess, would be a solution based on verifiable credentials—<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_digital_staff_passports_at_the_nhs.shtml">whether or not the healthcare system is centralized</a>. Verifiable credentials offer a few benefits:
</p>
 
     Verifiable credentials can solve the communication problem so that everyone in the system gets authentic data.  
     Because the credentials issued to me, I can be a trustworthy conduit between the doctor and the lab. 
     Verifiable credentials allow an interoperable solution with several vendors. 
     The tools, software, and techniques for verifiable credentials are well understood. 
 

<p>
    Verifiable credentials don't solve the problem of the lab being able to understand the doctor's order or the order having all the right data. That is a governance problem outside the realm of technology. But because we've narrowed the problem to defining the schema for a given localized set of doctors, labs, pharmacies, and other health-care providers, it might be tractable. 
</p>

<p>
    Verifiable credentials are a no-brainer for solving problems in health care. Interestingly, many health care use cases already use the patient as the conduit for transferring data between providers. But they are stuck in a paper world because many of the solutions that have been proposed for solving it, lead to central systems that require near-universal buy-in to work. Protocol-based solutions are the antedote to that and, fortunately, they're available now.

    This read describes the space between chaos and the abyss, where we find ourselves when we allow machines to make decisions without safeguarding collective criticism or realise they can change our minds.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>-----</p><p>There is a reality that we are not forced to recognise our collective ethical and own moral bias without others. However, these biases are the basis of our decision-making, so asking a machine to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_of_trust">take an unelected position of trust</a>" and make a decision on our collective behalf creates a space we should explore as we move from human criticism to machine control.</p><br><p></p> Machines are making decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Automation is incredibly powerful and useful, and we continue to learn to reduce bias in automated decision-making by exploring data sets and understanding the outcomes by testing for bias.&nbsp; As we continue testing, iterating and learning about using past data for future decisions, we expose many of our human frailties and faults.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>The decisions we ask machines to make today are easily compared to where we think we are going.&nbsp; However, since I cannot confirm or write down my cognitive biases today (<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/every-single-cognitive-bias/">out of the 180 plus available</a>). If asked which biases would be the same tomorrow, I would be unable to tell you.&nbsp; Therefore, I am even less convinced that, as a team, we can agree on our team biases as these will change as a new sun rises because we all have eaten our own choice of food, have different biology, chemistry and bacteria and have had divergence experiences since the last sunrise.</p> AI and Hypocrisy <br><p>Hypocrisy is the practice of engaging in the same behaviour or activity for which one criticises another. Our past and present actions can be different, but because of our past, we have learnt, and change has happened, but that does not mean we should not be able to call out when someone is making the same mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>A defence used by those called out is to cry “hypocrisy”.&nbsp; Human rights issues and football spring to mind. How can you judge when you did the same? As a Brit, we are responsible for some of the worst abuses of power and wrong thinking, but we are changing; I agree that it is not fast or far enough. However, the point here is that humans learn and can call something out to other humans if they are making the same mistakes.&nbsp; I accept we are not very good at either.&nbsp;</p><br><p>However, contemporary discourse is that if your past is flawed, you are not empowered to be critical of others.&nbsp; However, if we ever believe that we are beyond criticism, fault or learning, surely we become delusional and unable to see the wrong we are doing, believing we are more moral or ethical.&nbsp; But what about machines? When machines make a biased decision, who is there to be critical or will the AI call hypocrisy?&nbsp;</p><br><p>I struggle with the idea that the company values, purpose and culture are good predictors of the decision-making processes that we have in place because of bias.&nbsp; A good human culture can exist, but that is one of learning, but that does not mean the machine that powers the organisation is aligned with learning in the same direction.</p><br><p>This thinking about hypocrisy and culture creates gaps, voids and chasms filled with chaos between individuals' integrity, the integrity of the wider team/ company and what decisions we ask machines (automation) to make. &nbsp; This is not new, and such gaps have been the study by many philosophies and political scientists since Aristotle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>So how do we enable a machine to make a decision based on data but then allow other machines to see the inconsistency and defend hypocrisy?&nbsp; This is the space between chaos and the abyss.</p> So how do we enable a machine to make a decision based on data but then allow other machines to see the inconsistency and defend hypocrisy?&nbsp; <br> Being explainable is not the problem. <br><p>Explainable is in fashion in AI; however, events of 2020 to 2022 have presented rich picking from COVID lockdowns, the cost of living crisis, football WorldCup hosting and COP28 to say that explainable is not much use when decisions impact humans.&nbsp; Equally, making an algorithm or the code behind it explainable does not solve the problem.&nbsp; Neural networks are accurate but un-interpretable, whereas Decision Trees are interpretable but inaccurate.&nbsp; I can explain an outcome, but that does not mean I can predict it.&nbsp; We can explain mass shootings, but that is of little value or comfort to those who lost a loved one.&nbsp;</p> Jumping into the abyss. <br><p>Machines with bias in decision-making are not new, nor is explainable AI thinking.&nbsp; However, when we (humans) are criticised or called out, we often become defensive and don't change. Will machines be different?&nbsp; Calling out that someone is wrong does not persuade them to follow a different path. Calling out a decision made by a machine is not going to change the machine's decision-making process.</p><br><p>Here is the final jump. <a href="https://knowledge.insead.edu/leadership-organisations/how-change-someones-mind">How to change someone's mind</a> is a super article from <a href="https://knowledge.insead.edu/author/manfred-f-r-kets-de-vries">Manfred F.

<p>This article shows how to setup an ASP.NET Core application to authorize multiple access tokens from different Azure AD App registrations. Each endpoint can only accept a single AAD access token and it is important that the other access tokens do not work on the incorrect API. ASP.NET Core Schemes and Policies are used to force the delegated authorization.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreApiAuthMultiIdentityProvider/tree/main/AadMultiApis">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreApiAuthMultiIdentityProvider/tree/main/AadMultiApis</a></p>



 Setup 



<p>Azure Active Directory is used to implement the identity provider and is responsible for creating the access tokens. Two Azure App registrations are used to implement the APIs. One Azure App registration is created for application clients and accepts tokens from multiple tenants which have the correct roles claims. A secret is required to get and access token for the App registration. Any tenant could used this endpoint so maybe extra authorization is required in case the clients shared the secrets, certificates or something like this. It would probably make sense to validate the tenant used to acquire the access token. The delegated Azure App registration is implemented as a single tenant and can only be used in the second API. </p>







<p></p>



<p>A test application implemented as a server rendered UI confidential client is used to send the API calls. The application can acquire both types of access tokens and send the tokens to the correct endpoints. (Or incorrect endpoints for testing)</p>



 Implement the API 



<p>The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi method from the Micorsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package is used to implement the AAD MSAL clients. Separate ASP.NET Core schemes are used for the different access tokens. The different tokens use different configurations and also use separate ASP.NET Core policies for forcing the authorization and the specific claims. </p>


  services.AddAuthentication(Consts.AAD_MULTI_SCHEME)
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(Configuration, 
		"AzureADMultiApi", 
		Consts.AAD_MULTI_SCHEME);

services.AddAuthentication(Consts.AAD_SINGLE_SCHEME)
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(Configuration, 
		"AzureADSingleApi", 
		Consts.AAD_SINGLE_SCHEME);
  


<p>The Azure AD configurations are added to the app settings and are specific for each client.</p>


    "AzureADMultiApi": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/", 
    "Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
    "ClientId": "967925d5-87ea-46e6-b0eb-1223c001fd77" 
  },
  "AzureADSingleApi": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
    "ClientId": "b2a09168-54e2-4bc4-af92-a710a64ef1fa"
  },
  


<p>The AddAuthorization is used to add the ASP.NET Core policies which are specific for the schemes and not global. The policies validate the required claims. If using a multi tenant App registration, you might need to validate the tenant used to acquire the access token as well. Access tokens for both clients must be acquired using a secret (or certificate would also be ok, type 2). This is important for multi-tenant App registrations if allowing any enterprise application to use this.</p>


  services.AddAuthorization(policies =&gt;
{
	policies.AddPolicy(Consts.MUTLI_AAD_POLICY, p =&gt;
	{
		// application access token
		// "roles": [
		//  "application-api-role"
		// ],
		// "azp": "967925d5-87ea-46e6-b0eb-1223c001fd77",
		p.RequireClaim("azp", "967925d5-87ea-46e6-b0eb-1223c001fd77");

		// client secret = 1, 2 if certificate is used
		p.RequireClaim("azpacr", "1"); 
	});

	policies.AddPolicy(Consts.SINGLE_AAD_POLICY, p =&gt;
	{
		// delegated access token =&gt; "scp": "access_as_user",
		// "azp": "46d2f651-813a-4b5c-8a43-63abcb4f692c",
		p.RequireClaim("azp", "46d2f651-813a-4b5c-8a43-63abcb4f692c");

		// client secret = 1, 2 if certificate is used
		p.RequireClaim("azpacr", "1");
	});
});
  


<p>An authorization filter is added to the AddControllers method which requires one of our defined schemes. </p>


  services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
{
	var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
		.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
		.AddAuthenticationSchemes(
			Consts.AAD_MULTI_SCHEME, 
			Consts.AAD_SINGLE_SCHEME)
		.Build();
	options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});
  


<p>The middelware is setup like any ASP.NET Core application using authentication. You could add a RequireAuthorization method to the MapControllers method as well.</p>


  app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
{
	endpoints.MapControllers();
});
  


<p>The Controllers used to expose the endpoints use both the scheme and the policy to validate the access token. It is important that correct access token only works for the correct endpoint. Controllers support authorization using attributes in a developer friendly way. You can develop secure endpoints really efficiently using this.</p>


  [Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = Consts.AAD_MULTI_SCHEME, 
	Policy = Consts.MUTLI_AAD_POLICY)]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class MultiController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
    {
        return new string[] { 
			"data 1 from the multi api", 
			"data 2 from multi api" };
    }
}
  


 Test Confidential Client 



<p>To test the API, I created an ASP.NET Core Razor page application which authenticates using a confidential OpenID Connect code flow client. The application acquires the different access tokens using services. The single tenant service gets a delegated access token to access the single tenant API.</p>


  using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;

namespace RazorAzureAD;

public class SingleTenantApiService
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
    private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquisition;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public SingleTenantApiService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
        ITokenAcquisition tokenAcquisition,
        IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _clientFactory = clientFactory;
        _tokenAcquisition = tokenAcquisition;
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public async Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt; GetApiDataAsync(bool testIncorrectMultiEndpoint = false)
    {
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

        var scope = _configuration["AzureADSingleApi:ScopeForAccessToken"];
        var accessToken = await _tokenAcquisition.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(new[] { scope });

        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configuration["AzureADSingleApi:ApiBaseAddress"]);
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

        HttpResponseMessage response;
        if (testIncorrectMultiEndpoint)
        {
            response = await client.GetAsync("api/Multi"); // must fail
        }
        else
        {
            response = await client.GetAsync("api/Single");
        }


        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            var data = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(responseContent);

            if(data != null)
                return data;
        }

        throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
    }
}
  


<p>The MultiTenantApplicationApiService class is used to get an application access token using the OAuth client credentials flow. This requires a secret (or certificate) and no user is involved in this flow.</p>


  using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;

namespace RazorAzureAD;

public class MultiTenantApplicationApiService
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public MultiTenantApplicationApiService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
        IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _clientFactory = clientFactory;
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public async Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt; GetApiDataAsync(bool testIncorrectMultiEndpoint = false)
    {
        // 1. Client client credentials client
        var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
            .Create(_configuration["AzureADMultiApi:ClientId"])
            .WithClientSecret(_configuration["AzureADMultiApi:ClientSecret"])
            .WithAuthority(_configuration["AzureADMultiApi:Authority"])
            .Build();

        var scopes = new[] { _configuration["AzureADMultiApi:Scope"] }; // default scope

        // 2. Get access token
        var authResult = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes)
            .ExecuteAsync();

        // 3. Use access token to access token
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configuration["AzureADMultiApi:ApiBaseAddress"]);

        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization
            = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", authResult.AccessToken);
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept
            .Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

        HttpResponseMessage response;
        if (testIncorrectMultiEndpoint)
        {
            response = await client.GetAsync("api/Single"); // must fail
        }
        else
        {
            response = await client.GetAsync("api/Multi");

        }

        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());
        }

        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            var data = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(responseContent);

            if (data != null)
                return data;
        }

        throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
    }
}
  


<p>When the application is run, the APIs can be tested and validated. If running this locally, you need to setup your own Azure App registrations and change the configuration.</p>

<p>I’ve been reviewing <a href="https://third-bit.com">Greg Wilson’s</a> current book project, <a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/">Software Design in Python</a>. Like the earlier JavaScript-based <a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/">Software Design by Example</a> it’s a guided tour of tools, techniques, and components common to many software systems: testing frameworks, parsers, virtual machines, debuggers. Each chapter of each of these books shows how to build the simplest possible working version of one of these things.</p>
<p>Though I’ve used this stuff for most of my life, I’ve never studied it formally. How does an interpreter work? The chapter on <a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/interpreter/">interpreters</a> explains the basic mechanism using a mixture of prose and code. When I read the chapter I can sort of understand what’s happening, but I’m not great at mental simulation of running code. I need to run the code in a debugger, set breakpoints, step through execution, and watch variables change. Then it sinks in.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/sdxpy">GitHub repo</a> for the book includes all the text and all the code. I’d like to put them side-by-side, so that as I read the narrative I can run and debug the code that’s being described. Here’s how I’m doing that in VSCode.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/debug-the-book.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>This is pretty good! But it wasn’t dead simple to get there. In a clone of the repo, the steps included:</p>
 
 Find the HTML file for chapter 3. 
 Install a VSCode extension to preview HTML. 
 Find the code for chapter 3. 
 Adjust the code to not require command-line arguments. 
 Arrange the text and code in side-by-side panes. 
 
<p>Though it’s all doable, the activation threshold is high enough to thwart my best intention of repeating the steps for every chapter.</p>
<p>Whether in VSCode or another IDE or some other kind of app, what would be the best way to lower that activation threshold?</p>

Without a time lag, which creates separation, we would never improve but rather get trapped in negative and unproductive ways because we all accept this moral or ethical behaviour as the best we can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;It is in this void we find all the complexity of modern society and politics.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This gap represents the tensions that boards and leadership teams have to face as they find that they need to find a strategy and route between the new thinking and the old rules.&nbsp;</p><p>COVID19, climate change, sustainability, and poverty are just some examples that have made us more aware of the gaps between different nations' rules, constraints and resources which provide their ethics and different mental model for a morally better society.&nbsp; If it is or not is yet to be determined.</p><p>Therefore I believe we should be asking for more “unethical moral”, and more “immoral ethical” dilemmas; as this will focus our attention on the void between our existing rule set and the new rules we need if we are to make a world more inclusive, accepting and transparent and less biased, cruel and prejudiced.&nbsp;</p><p>I repeat …. we need more unethical morals!</p> <br>

   Making notes is helpful when reading and running unfamiliar code for the first time.  I usually start with happy paths.  Here’s some notes I made while learning about Mastodon account search and discovery.  It’s really cool to poke around the code that so many people are using every day to find each other. 

 When you search on an account identifier on Mastodon, your browser makes a request to you

  <p>Making notes is helpful when reading and running unfamiliar code for the first time.  I usually start with happy paths.  Here’s some notes I made while learning about Mastodon account search and discovery.  It’s really cool to poke around the code that so many people are using every day to find each other.</p>

<p>When you search on an account identifier on Mastodon, your browser makes a request to your Mastodon instance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/api/v2/search?q=%40herestomwiththeweather%40mastodon.social&amp;resolve=true&amp;limit=5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resolve=true parameter tells your Mastodon instance to make a webfinger request to the target Mastodon instance if necessary. The search controller <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/controllers/api/v2/search_controller.rb#L32">makes a call to the SearchService</a></p>

  <code>  def search_results
    SearchService.new.call(
      params[:q],
      current_account,
      limit_param(RESULTS_LIMIT),
      search_params.merge(resolve: truthy_param?(:resolve), exclude_unreviewed: truthy_param?(:exclude_unreviewed))
    )
  end
</code> 
 

<p>and since resolve=true, SearchService <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/account_search_service.rb#L36">makes a call to the ResolveAccountService</a></p>

  <code>      if options[:resolve]
        ResolveAccountService.new.call(query)
</code> 
 

<p>The purpose of ResolveAccountService is to “Find or create an account record for a remote user” and return an account object to the search controller. It includes <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/helpers/webfinger_helper.rb">WebfingerHelper</a> which is a trivial module with just one one-line method named webfinger!()</p>

  <code>module WebfingerHelper
  def webfinger!(uri)
    Webfinger.new(uri).perform
  end
end
</code> 
 

<p>This method returns a webfinger object. Rather than call it directly, ResolveAccountService <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/resolve_account_service.rb#L34">invokes process_webfinger!</a> which <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/resolve_account_service.rb#L86">invokes it</a> and then asks the returned webfinger object’s subject method for its username and domain and makes them instance variables of the service object.</p>

  <code>  def process_webfinger!(uri)
    @webfinger                           = webfinger!("acct:#{uri}")
    confirmed_username, confirmed_domain = split_acct(@webfinger.subject)

    if confirmed_username.casecmp(@username).zero? &amp;&amp; confirmed_domain.casecmp(@domain).zero?
      @username = confirmed_username
      @domain   = confirmed_domain
      return
    end
</code> 
 

<p>If the Mastodon instance does not already know about this account, ResolveAccountService <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/resolve_account_service.rb#L55">invokes fetch_account!</a> which <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/resolve_account_service.rb#L114">calls the ActivityPub::FetchRemoteAccountService</a> which inherits from <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb">ActivityPub::FetchRemoteActorService</a></p>

  <code>      @account = ActivityPub::FetchRemoteAccountService.new.call(actor_url, suppress_errors: @options[:suppress_errors])
</code> 
 

<p>The actor_url will look something like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>https://mastodon.social/users/herestomwiththeweather</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ActivityPub::FetchRemoteActorService <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L19">passes the actor_url parameter to fetch_resource</a> to receive a json response for the remote account.</p>

  <code>    @json = begin
      if prefetched_body.nil?
        fetch_resource(uri, id)
      else

</code> 
 

<p>The response includes a lot of information including name, summary, publicKey, images and urls to fetch more information like followers and following.</p>

<p>Finally, the ActivityPub::FetchRemoteActorService <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L38">calls the ActivityPub::ProcessAccountService</a>, passing it the json response.</p>

  <code>    ActivityPub::ProcessAccountService.new.call(@username, @domain, @json, only_key: only_key, verified_webfinger: !only_key)
</code> 
 

<p>If the Mastodon instance does not know about the account, ActivityPub::ProcessAccountService <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/process_account_service.rb#L28">invokes create_account and update_account</a> to save the username, domain and all the associated urls from the json response to a new account record in the database.</p>

  <code>      create_account if @account.nil?
      update_account
</code> 
 

<p>I have several questions about how following others works and will probably look at that soon.  I may start out by reading <a href="https://tinysubversions.com/notes/reading-activitypub/">A highly opinionated guide to learning about ActivityPub</a> which I bookmarked a while ago.</p>

<p>This post shows how to setup an Azure App registration using Powershell for an application access token using an application role. In Azure roles are used for App only, scopes are used for delegated flows (Or roles for users). The Azure App registration uses OAuth2 with the client credentials flow. A secret and a client_id is used. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/GrpcAzureAppServiceAppAuth">https://github.com/damienbod/GrpcAzureAppServiceAppAuth</a></p>



<p>The AzureAD Powershell module is used to create a new Azure App registration. The New-AzureADApplication function creates a new Azure App registration with a secret on the defined tenant from the authentication flow.</p>


  $Guid = New-Guid
$startDate = Get-Date
$allowPassthroughUsers = false

$PasswordCredential = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordCredential
$PasswordCredential.StartDate = $startDate
$PasswordCredential.EndDate = $startDate.AddYears(20)
$PasswordCredential.KeyId = $Guid
$PasswordCredential.Value = ([System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes(($Guid))))

if(!($myApp = Get-AzureADApplication -Filter "DisplayName eq '$($appName)'"  -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue))
{
    $myApp = New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName $appName -PasswordCredentials $PasswordCredential -AllowPassthroughUsers $allowPassthroughUsers

	# Write-Host $myApp | Out-String | ConvertFrom-Json	
}
  


<p>We need an App Role and this is exposed in the access token. The App Role can be created using this function. See this link for the original:</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51651889/how-to-add-app-roles-under-manifest-in-azure-active-directory-using-powershell-s">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51651889/how-to-add-app-roles-under-manifest-in-azure-active-directory-using-powershell-s</a> </p>



<p>This Azure App registration is created for an Application client, ie no user. If creating this for delegated flows, the AllowedMemberTypes would need to be changed and no secret/certificate is required. A scope would probably be used as well instead of a Role, but this depends on the solution authorization architecture.</p>


  function CreateApplicationAppRole([string] $Name, [string] $Description)
{
    $appRole = New-Object Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.AppRole
    $appRole.AllowedMemberTypes = New-Object System.Collections.Generic.List[string]
    $appRole.AllowedMemberTypes.Add("Application");
    $appRole.DisplayName = $Name
    $appRole.Id = New-Guid
    $appRole.IsEnabled = $true
    $appRole.Description = $Description
    $appRole.Value = $Name;
    return $appRole
}
  


<p>The Set-AzureADApplication function adds the roles to the Azure App registration.</p>


  $appRoles = $myApp.AppRoles
$newRole = CreateApplicationAppRole -Name $appRoleName -Description $appRoleName
$appRoles.Add($newRole)
Set-AzureADApplication -ObjectId $myApp.ObjectId -AppRoles $appRoles 
$appRoleId = $newRole.Id
  


<p>The App Role can now be used and exposed in the access token. This is added using the RequiredResourceAccess</p>


  $req = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RequiredResourceAccess"
$acc1 = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList $appRoleId,"Role"
$req.ResourceAccess = $acc1
$req.ResourceAppId = $myApp.AppId
Set-AzureADApplication -ObjectId $myApp.ObjectId -RequiredResourceAccess $req
  


<p>For some unknown reasin, the Powershell AzureAD module add default Oauth2Permissions to the Azure App registration. This can be disabled. We have no scopes as this is an application client, i.e. AppOnly.</p>


  $Scopes = New-Object System.Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.OAuth2Permission]
$Scope = $myApp.Oauth2Permissions | Where-Object { $_.Value -eq "user_impersonation" }
$Scope.IsEnabled = $false
$Scopes.Add($Scope)
Set-AzureADApplication -ObjectId $myApp.ObjectID -Oauth2Permissions $Scopes
  


<p>The API IdentifierUris is added to the Azure App registration.</p>


  $apiUrl = "api://" + $myApp.AppId
$IdentifierUris = New-Object System.Collections.Generic.List[string]
$IdentifierUris.Add($apiUrl)
Set-AzureADApplication -ObjectId $myApp.ObjectID -IdentifierUris $IdentifierUris
  


<p>A service principal can be created for the Azure App Registration. This can then be used in the enterprise applications.</p>


  $createdServicePrincipal = New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AccountEnabled $true -AppId $myApp.AppId -DisplayName $appName

  


<p>Graph application roles can also be added to the Azure App Registration if required. I usually separated this to a different Azure App registration.</p>


  $req = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RequiredResourceAccess"
$acc1 = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList "62a82d76-70ea-41e2-9197-370581804d09","Role"
$acc2 = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList "5b567255-7703-4780-807c-7be8301ae99b","Role"
$acc3 = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList "9e3f62cf-ca93-4989-b6ce-bf83c28f9fe8","Role"
$acc4 = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList "741f803b-c850-494e-b5df-cde7c675a1ca","Role"

$acc7 = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList "19dbc75e-c2e2-444c-a770-ec69d8559fc7","Role"
$req.ResourceAccess = $acc1,$acc2,$acc3,$acc4,$acc5,$acc6,$acc7
$req.ResourceAppId = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"

  


<p>Add the item to the Azure App registration.</p>


  ##################################
### Create an RequiredResourceAccess list
##################################
$requiredResourceAccessItems = New-Object System.Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RequiredResourceAccess]
$requiredResourceAccessItems.Add($req)
Set-AzureADApplication -ObjectId $myApp.ObjectId -RequiredResourceAccess $requiredResourceAccessItems
  


<p>Access tokens version 2 are used. This needs to be set in the manifest. This property is called accessTokenAcceptedVersion  in the portal and requestedAccessTokenVersion in Graph. Set the accessTokenAcceptedVersion to version 2 access tokens.</p>


  $Body = @{
    api = @{
        requestedAccessTokenVersion = 2
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Compress | ConvertTo-Json
$null = az rest --method PATCH --uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/$($appRegObjectId)" --body $Body --headers "Content-Type=application/json"
  


 Running the scripts 



<p>Install the required Azure AD Powershell module:</p>


  Install-Module AzureAD -AllowClobber
  


<p>Connect to the correct tenant using an account which has the privileges to create App registrations:</p>


  Connect-AzureAD -TenantId 5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244
  


<p>Run the script replacing the tenantId and your Azure App Registration name:</p>


  .\app-reg-application-cc.ps1 -tenantId 5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244 -appName AppRegTest
  


 Login Azure CLI and Update access token version 


  az login --tenant 5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244
  


<p>You can read the id from the manufest (ObjectId) “id”: “ba62783f-fb6b-48a9-ba51-f56355e84926”,</p>


  .\update-access-token-version2.ps1 -TenantId 5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244 -appRegObjectId ba62783f-fb6b-48a9-ba51-f56355e84926
  


<p></p>







<p></p>



 Create new secret 



<p>You can read the id from the manufest (ObjectId) “id”: “ba62783f-fb6b-48a9-ba51-f56355e84926”,</p>


  .\app-new-secrets.ps1 -TenantId 5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244 -appRegObjectId ba62783f-fb6b-48a9-ba51-f56355e84926
  


<p>See the full scripts in the Github repository accompanying this blog.</p>



<p>Notes</p>



<p>We are using secrets in this demo. You can also update to using certificates instead of secrets which then use client assertions on the access token request. I normal store the secret or certificate in an Azure Key Vault and use this directly from the application and services. I would normally add this to DevOps and create a single script for all infrastructure.</p>



<p></p>



<p>After the App registrations have been created, you need to grant consent before these can be used.</p>

  First of all, what is a restreaming server? Sometimes you want to livestream video from a device like an ATEM Mini or OBS to multiple destinations. Many devices and software like this will let you push video to just one RTMP destination at a time.

<p>First of all, what is a restreaming server? Sometimes you want to livestream video from a device like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRyLn6THA5wMTKc56KGZG4V7EY-enwSjB">ATEM Mini</a> or OBS to multiple destinations. Many devices and software like this will let you push video to just one RTMP destination at a time.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To stream to multiple destinations, you need to use a restream server so that the device can stream the one stream to the server, and the restream server pushes to multiple destinations.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are paid services you can use to restream for you, <a href="https://restream.io/join/wNPDr">restream.io</a> being one of the most well-known ones. This is a great solution too, and if you're just looking for a quick way to restream to multiple platforms, this is the easiest way to go.</p>

<p>(Note: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRyLn6THA5wN1ADH1nF_fIc_eFTrbaDV0">YoloBox</a> does let you publish to multiple destinations with no extra setup, so if you're using that device, you can just ignore this whole tutorial!)</p>

<p>But, sometimes you want to do this yourself, avoid paying third party services, or you might need to restream to local devices that something on the public internet can't reach. That's what the rest of this blog post is about. I'll show you how to set up a Raspberry Pi (or really any other Linux computer) to restream your livestreams to multiple destinations.</p>

 Getting Started 

<p>Before we get into the details, you'll need to start with a Raspberry Pi or an Ubuntu server that's already set up and running. That should be as easy as following the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#using-raspberry-pi-imager">official setup guide</a> for Raspberry Pi. Also note that if you're comfortable with SSH, you can install the Raspberry Pi OS "Lite" without the desktop environment.</p>

 Install nginx 

<p>The magic that makes this all work is the nginx web server with a custom module that supports RTMP.</p>

<p>Install nginx and the rtmp module by running the following commands on the command line, either over SSH or by opening the Terminal on the desktop.</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx libnginx-mod-rtmp
</code> 

 Configure your Restream Server 

<p>Now we need to set up an RTMP server in nginx. Edit the main nginx config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code> 

<p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and copy the below text into the config file:</p>

 <code>rtmp {
  server {
    listen 1935;

    application restream {
      # Enable livestreaming
      live on;

      # Disable recording
      record off;

      # Allow only this machine to play back the stream
      allow play 127.0.0.1;
      deny play all;

      # Push your stream to one or more RTMP destinations
      push rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX;
      push rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX;
      push rtmp://live-cdg.twitch.tv/app/live_XXXXXXXX;
    }
  }
}
</code> 

<p>Save this file by pressing ctrl+X, then Y, then enter.</p>

<p>To test the config file for errors, type:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -t
</code> 

<p>If that worked, you can reload nginx to make your changes take effect:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -s reload
</code> 

 Start Streaming 

<p>At this point the Raspberry Pi is ready! You can now stream to this box and it will send a copy to each configured destination! Any stream key will work, and you can stream using any sort of device or software like OBS. You'll need to find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi which you can do by typing:</p>

 <code>hostname -I
</code> 

<p>To stream to the Raspberry Pi, use the RTMP URL: <code>rtmp://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/restream</code> and anything as the stream key.</p>

<p>NOTE: The way this is set up, anyone can stream to this if they know the IP address since it will accept any stream key. If you want to restrict this, you can use a long random string in place of <code>restream</code> in the config. For example:</p>

 <code>    ...
    application restream-ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP {
      ...
</code> 

<p>Now you are ready to stream! Start pushing an RTMP feed to your server and it will send a copy to each of your configured destinations!</p>

<p>If you want to stream to this from an ATEM Mini, you'll need to create a custom streaming config and load that in to the software control app. You can use <a href="https://heretorecord.com/xml/">this XML generator</a> to create the configuration.</p>

<p>Fill out your server's IP address, and use either <code>restream</code> or <code>restream-ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP</code> as the path.</p>

<p></p>

 Further Reading 

<p>Now that you have the nginx RTMP module installed, there's a lot more things you can do! You can read the <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives">official documentation</a> for a full list of other commands you can use. You can do things like:</p>

 
 <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives#record">Record</a> a local copy of anything your RTMP server receives 
 Create multiple resolutions of your video and push different resolutions to different platforms 
 Create a vertical cropped version of your feed and send it to another RTMP destination 
 <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives#on_publish">Notify</a> external services when you start or stop streaming

<p>11月13日の朝、twitter社の新オーナーであるイーロン・マスク氏が近日中に企業による担当者認証をはじめるとツイートしました。</p>



 
<blockquote><p>Rolling out soon, Twitter will enable organizations to identify which other Twitter accounts are actually associated with them</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591851391773200384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>この場合、まずはその企業の正当なツイッターアカウントを特定しなければなりません。これは、最終的には「twitter社が判断者とならざるを得ないと思うが、良い意見があれば聞きたい」とのこと。</p>



 
<blockquote><p>Ultimately, I think there is no choice but for Twitter to be the final arbiter, but I’m open to suggestions</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591852141370548224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>また、その企業の担当者／責任者が他のユーザの所属状態の管理をできるようにするとのこと。</p>



 
<blockquote><p>We will enable organizations to manage affiliations</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591867579282456576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>この企業を特定して、その中の権限 (Authority) を指定していくというのは、各国毎にいろいろな仕組みがあります。英国などではそういったデータがオープンデータになっておりますし、日本では gBizIDという仕組みがあります。</p>



<p>gBizIDは企業の履歴事項全部証明書と代表者の実印を使って登録したIDレジスターを持つIDPで、データをOpenIDとして検証可能な形で出すことができます。なので、Twitter社はgBizIDからデータを受け取るようにすれば、希望のことが直ぐにできるようになります。</p>



<p>このツイートを見た瞬間、日本だったらこうすればよいのじゃね？とリプしそうになりましたが、本来デジタル庁がやるべきでしょうから柄にもなく自重しました。デジタル庁さん、チャンスですぜ！</p>



<p>また、このスレの最後にマスク氏は「『確認済み』が実際のところ何を意味するのかということの粒度を上げていくことは良いことだ」と締めくくっています。全くわが意を得たり。願わくば、ちゃんとしたアイデンティティのプロが検討チームに入っていますように。</p>



 
<blockquote><p>Increasing granularity about what “verified” actually means is the right move</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591905921365872640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2022</a></blockquote>

 Twitter は銀行サービスを提供する 



<p>Twitterの新オーナーであるイーロン・マスク<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2022/11/5054/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5054" title="Elon Mask">1</a>氏が、第１回社員向けミーティングで、Twitter は銀行・(国際)決済カンパニーになると語ったようです。Paypal 2.0 ですね。</p>



<p>イーロン・マスク氏はオンライン銀行のX.com<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2022/11/5054/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5054" title="2017年にマスク氏は ドメイン X.com をPaypalから買い戻しています。">2</a>を1999年に創業して、翌年 confinitiy と合併させて PayPal を作ったので、彼にとっては土地勘がある世界。当時は email しかなかったけどこれだけユーザ数のいるDMのプラットフォームがあるなら、それをベースにやればベターなものができると。もともと銀行を作ったくらいだから既存の金融機関とのつなぎもしっかりつなぎこむ。多分、殆ど透過的になるのではないでしょうか。送金や決済のプラットフォームとしてかなり便利になりそうです。国際送金もこれでできるようになると色々影響が大きいですね。ただ、KYCが課題ですね。 </p>



 Twitter は動画サービスも提供し、クリエーターにより良い収益機会を与える 



<p>また、動画も長い動画も挙げられるようにするようです。今はYoutube などに上げてそのリンクを置くしか無いが、twitter で完結できるようにする。 そして、クリエーターはYoutubeなどから得られるよりも大きな収益を得られるようにするようです。ユーザー体験的にはtiktokのようなものを考えているよう。</p>



 リモートワークについて 



<p>その他リモートワークについても語っています。原則出社、パフォーマンスが出る人はリモートでも良い。このポリシーはSpace X や Tesla と共通、とのこと。</p>

  <p>Summary: Elon has started a monthly $8 fee for verified twitter users. A verifiable credential-based solution would be a better way to increase trust in the platform by authenticating users as real people without attendent privacy concerns.</p>


<p>
    This <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1587064925167489025">thread</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias">Matthew Yglesias</a> concerning Twitter's decision to charge for the blue verification checkmark got me thinking. Matthew makes some good points:
</p>
 
     Pseudonymity has value and offers protection to people who might not otherwise feel free to post if Twitter required real names like Facebook tries to.  
     Verification tells the reader that the account is run by a person 
     There's value to readers in knowing the real name and professional affiliation of some accounts 
 
<p>
    Importantly, the primary value accrues to the reader, not the tweeter. So, charging the tweeter $20/month (<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587312517679878144?s=61&amp;t=dfbMe-WX7Va6sBiE8QNPVg">now $8</a>) is charging the wrong party. In fact, more than the reader, the platform itself realizes the most value from verification because it can make the platform more trustworthy. Twitter will make more money if the verification system can help people understand the provenance of tweets because ads will become more valuable. 
</p>

<p>
    Since no one asked me, I thought I'd offer a suggestion on how to do this right. You won't be surprised that my solution uses verifiable credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    First, Twitter needs to make being verified worthwhile to the largest number of users possible. Maybe that means that tweets from unverified accounts are delayed or limited in some way. There are lots of options and some A/B testing would probably show what incentives work best.
</p>

<p>
    Second, pick a handful (five springs to mind) of initial credential issuers that Twitter will trust and define the credential schema they'd prefer. Companies like <a href="https://onfido.com">Onfido</a> can already do this. It wouldn't be hard for others like Equifax, ID.me, and GLEIF to issue credentials based on the "real person" or "real company" verifications they're already doing. These credential issuers could charge whatever the market would bear. Twitter might get some of this money. 
</p>

<p>
    Last, Twitter allows anyone with a "real person" credential from one of these credential issuers to verify their profile. The base verification would be for the holder to use zero-knowledge proof to prove they are a person or legal entity. If they choose, the credential holder might want to prove their real name and professional affiliation, but that wouldn't be required. Verifying these credentials as part of the Twitter profile would be relatively easy for Twitter to implement. 
</p>

<p>
    Twitter would have to decide what to do about accounts that are not real people or legal entities. Some of these bots have value. Maybe there's a separate verification process for these that requires that the holder of the bot account prove who they are to Twitter so they can be held responsible for their bot's behavior.
</p>

<p>
    You might be worried that the verified person would sell their verification or verify multiple accounts. There are a number of ways to mitigate this. I explained some of this in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/06/transferable_accounts_putting_passengers_at_risk.shtml">Transferable Accounts Putting Passengers at Risk</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Real person verification using verifiable credentials has a number of advantages.
</p>
 
     First, Twitter never knows anyone's real name unless that person chooses to reveal it. This means that Twitter can't be forced to reveal it to someone else. They just know they're a real person. This saves Twitter from being put in that position and building infrastructure and teams to deal with it. Yes, the police, for example, could determine who issued the Twitter Real Person credential and subpoena them, but that's the business these companies are in, so presumably they already have processes for doing this. 
     Another nice perk from this is that Twitter jump starts an ecosystem for real person credentials that might have uses somewhere else. This has the side benefit of making fraud less likely since the more a person relies on a credential the less likely they are to use it for fraudulent purposes.  
     A big advantage is that Twitter can now give people peace of mind that they accounts they're following are controlled by real people. Tools might let people adjust their feed accordingly so they see more tweets by real people.  
     Twitter also can give advertisers comfort that their engagement numbers are closer to reality. Twitter makes more money.  
 

<p>
    Yglesias says:
</p>

    Verifiable credentials can help make Twitter a more trustworthy place by providing authentic data about people and companies creating accounts—and do it better than Twitter's current system. I'm pretty sure Twitter won't. <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587627120355934208?s=61&amp;t=qGJOU08cuSIgtfoYBB8Qow">Elon seems adamant</a> that they are going to charge to get the blue checkmark.

    In that moment of panic, we forget to reflect on what type of gap this is and why it has been filled with fear. Leadership is a recognition of the gaps, that not all gaps are the same and how to prevent fear being the first response. <p></p><p>Image source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanadavidphd/">Susan David, Ph.D</a> (love her work)</p> Fear and Gaps&nbsp; <p>Fear is an unpleasant emotion caused by the immediate or expected threat of danger, pain, or harm, but it is also so much more.&nbsp; We know fear sells in terms of marketing.&nbsp; We understand FOMO (fear of missing out) and the fear of failure (FOF) are significant drivers. We are aware that fear produces a unique reaction in the body driven from the gut ahead of the brain (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=antonio+damasio+the+strange+order+of+things">Antonio Damasio research</a>). Fear is a stimuli but is subjective and how fear is perceived is different for everyone. Different types of fear spread at different speeds. Brands and the media use fear and to create headlines and force change.&nbsp; COP27 and climate change agenda are not adverse to utilising this insight.</p><p>We should be aware that fear drives many decisions we make.&nbsp; Therefore, the interesting question becomes, “Why is it that fear fills the gaps between what we know/ believe and the unknown/ uncertain?” A further question on the link between fear and trust is worth exploring, but it is beyond this post.&nbsp;</p> Why is it that fear tends to be the feeling that fills the gaps between what we know/ believe and the unknown/ uncertain? <br> Peak Human Purpose&nbsp; <p>In the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a>, one of the peaks to optimise for is “<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/explaining-peak-purpose">Peak Human Purpose</a>”. Each of the four purposes of the framework exists at the exclusion of anything else - purity at an extreme.&nbsp; At peak human purpose, we are here (humans on earth) to escape ultimate death by reproducing as much as possible with the broadest community we can. We also have to adapt as fast as possible. We have to meet our chemistry requirements to stay alive for as long as possible to adopt and reproduce at the expense of anything else. These form the most basic definitions of life with clarity and purity.</p><p>Whilst the purity of all the peak purposes might be controversial (even to myself), saying the purity of human purpose is chemistry/ biology does not go down very well; it is too simplistic. However, this is a model for framing thinking, so please go with it as it needs to be pure, and every other human purpose has conflicts with someone.&nbsp; The point here is that when we realise that fear and/or anxiety fills gaps, we understand that we are optimising for something deeply human - life, survival, and thriving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The point here is that when we realise that fear/or anxiety fills gaps, we understand that we are optimising for something deeply human.</p><p>I am often questioned why I put “Human Purpose” as one of the peaks, and it is because of some deeply human traits of life that influence our decisions and create conflicts and tensions within us and our groups.&nbsp; Fear and anxiety are some of these feelings.&nbsp; I am neither an expert, counsellor or theorist in any human behaviour or psychology; however, that does not stop me from realising how much chemistry, biology and experience influence our decision-making, if we want to realise it or not. These disciplines are currently undervalued as is that fear is baked in to some systems from management, control and performance.&nbsp;</p> Different gaps have different fears <p>Different gaps have different fears sounds obvious, but it is not, as the only gap that fear is filling is the one in front of us right now.&nbsp; Fear steps in when there is a gap in our knowledge/ information.&nbsp; We hear a noise we cannot explain; someone is walking behind us or an imagined scenario.&nbsp; Fear is not limited to our personal lives and is an active component in the world of our daily commercial activities and actions. Geoffery Moores's Book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm">Crossing the Chasm</a>” is about a book that sells by creating fear.&nbsp; The book is much more important than that and is a fantastic insight into adoption - however until you knew about the chasm, you did not fear it.</p><p>Without a doubt, life would be easier if only one gap and one fear existed. However, we have to be content with the fact that every moment we are dealing with different gaps (leadership, innovation, knowledge, information, experience) and different fears that come from the gaps we have right now and those we image in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What do we image are the boundaries?&nbsp; <p>The image below illustrates two different gaps. The original thought was caught in an ESG session, so using this as an example.&nbsp; For some, ESG is a gap (think fear) between what is unknown and known and how we cross it (the gap on the left below.)&nbsp; For others, ESG is a gap (think fear) between what is known and the action they need to take (the gap on the right below.)&nbsp; At the recent Sibos conference*, where this thinking emerged, was a debate about the role data has in ESG and whether data can ever be useful because there are two gaps. A good question to ask is which area does your ESG data fall? This removes the ideas about for and against, and forces you to determine which camp your data represents!&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><p>The fear in each gap is real and, depending on the persona and team - determines how you will cross your fear fill gap. However, this model whilst “obvious” might not actually be a good representation of the issue..</p> Just Fix It <p>We (humans) tend to have an obsession with fixing things.&nbsp; The majority who will read this realise that we cannot fix wicked problems, usually because we cannot understand them. Even our systems thinking and explanation have limits because of the boundary interconnection problem.&nbsp; (the unknown consequences of your action on another system and vice-versa).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When you hear someone bark an order to “fix something”, we know it resembles the old order of control, dogma and hierarchy.&nbsp; There was a belief that in a more simple time, leadership should/could just fix everything. However, not everything is easy to fix (humans, climate, economy, inflation) and not all problems have solutions (my favourite is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Millennium-Problem">pure maths</a>), and the majority of what we face every day requires us to walk past the ideal of a “quick fix” and wrestle with the complexity of wicked systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We should not ignore the power and pull of a “fix it” mental model.&nbsp; We all tend to do it as a first untrained response when faced with a fear, gap or problem. Because of the “fix-it” mental model, our gaps are mostly filled with fear because there is no immediate fix within our experience. Our early experience in education and business teaches us we can “fix it” by defining the problem and building a solution. To do this, we have to accept we must ignore critical facts that add complexity to the actual problem or lack experience to see such layers.&nbsp;</p><p>Management, leadership and MBA courses all spend a lot of time teaching us to ask, “what is the problem to be solved?” Usually, so we can determine if the pre-packed solution on offer aligns with the problem at hand.&nbsp; When we know the problem, we can write a plan.&nbsp; This fix-it provides a perception that we know how to cross the two big chasms filled with fears. This is not true because a “Fix it” mentality and language ignore struggles, dilemmas, compromises and paradoxes.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>We, humans and our environment, are not a problem to be fixed but something to be crafted, shaped and moulded over time.	</p><p></p><br><p>We, humans, and our environment are not a problem to be fixed but something to be crafted, shaped and moulded over time.</p><p>The purpose of the Peak Paradox framework is to embrace “fix it” thinking for simple things but then build a model that allows us to picture and imagine many of the complications of a dynamic interactive, interdependent system of systems.&nbsp; Wicked problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A single independent system can be modelled and might be fixable. A system of systems cannot be modelled or fixed as there are unknowns at the boundaries between the systems presenting unknown effects, dependencies and consequences.&nbsp; Not all humans have the same motivations, incentives or desires - a core identification in the peak paradox framework.</p> Moving on from the “fix-it” model <p>When we take out the “fix-it” thinking and redraw the two chasms, we observe that it is critical that executives are able to cope with leading in uncertainty and management who remain flexible so they can continually adapt the plan.&nbsp; I would argue this is why reporting and compliance boards fail and don’t work for any stakeholder, as they focus on the wrong model - “fix-it”&nbsp;</p><p></p> How does fear align with the Peak Paradox framework and thinking on sustainability?&nbsp; <p>“Fix-It” thinking defines problems and solves them or ends up with gaps filled with fears, the information gap.&nbsp; I see too many executive boards fixated on reporting, gaps and compliance, translating leadership into an instruction to fix it as there is a divergence between the plan and the actual.&nbsp; Leadership is surely about bringing vision, belief and skills to help bridge the gap, not by barking instructions to fix it but by providing the next base camp on an uncharted map.&nbsp; Stakeholder trust management to be flexible and adaptable so cope with change and the plan is there to change and not to manage to.&nbsp; The delta (gap in the plan to actual) is not to be feared but embraced and understood. Dashboards are a leadership killer&nbsp;</p><p>Dashboards are a leadership killer&nbsp;</p><p>Humans and the earth (terra firma, water and climate) need to find a sustainable compromise and are the same in this respect. We don’t need to be fixed, and we don’t need fixing. What we do need is a map.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Cop 27&nbsp; “Fix-It” or map?&nbsp;</p><p>The obsession with 1.5 degrees to me is a problem. The earth will not end, but yes, it will definitely become far more difficult for humans on earth to thrive over just survive. The changes in temperature will affect some humans in some regions far more. Our favoured economic model is likely also to tested to a breaking point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am a massive supporter of SDG’s and change but my issue is that 1.5 degrees is a solution to a problem that we have not fully defined and depends on the “we can fix-it” mental model; The same with NetZero and ESG data.&nbsp; These are solutions to problems we don’t understand.&nbsp; These are wicked problems that should not be boiled down to a single number that no one can do anything about.&nbsp; 1.5 degrees is not a vision, a north star or a plan - it is a target. It should be the first camp on a long journey. &nbsp; However fear fills the gaps and drives a model that drives more fear into making the gaps bigger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps we should step back to agree and determine what fears and gaps we are talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Thank you.&nbsp; <br>* At <a href="https://www.sibos.com/">Sibos 22</a> (the big banking, payments and finance conference), I had the joy of meeting a flock of old friends and meeting IRL some new ones I had only ever interacted with digitally. During one of the #Innotribe ESG sessions, it was good to interactively pen ideas based on the content as I sat with Yael Rozencwajg, which has become this post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>So far the experience of using Twitter under Musk is pretty much unchanged. Same goes for Facebook.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a lot of hand-wringing, and the stock market hates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms">Meta</a>&nbsp;(the corporate parent to which Facebook gave birth); but so far the experience of using both is pretty much unchanged.</p>
<p>This is aside from the fact that the two services are run by feudal overlords with crazy obsessions and not much feel for roads they both pave and ride.</p>
<p>As for Meta (and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs">Reality Labs</a> division), virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR) via headgear are today where “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1BG7YLR8aWcC&amp;q=fred+upstairs">Ginger</a>” was before she became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway">Segway</a>: promising a vast horizontal market that won’t materialize because its utilities are too narrow.</p>
<p>VR/AR will, like the Segway, will find some niche uses. For Segway, it was warehouses, cops, and tourism. For VR/AR headgear it will be gaming, medicine, and hookups in meta-space. The porn possibilities are beyond immense.</p>
<p>As for business, both Twitter and Facebook will continue to be hit by a decline in personalized advertising and possibly a return to the old-fashioned non-tracking-based kind, which the industry has mostly forgotten how to do. But it will press on.</p>
<p>Not much discussed, but a real possibility is that advertising overall will at least partially collapse. This has been coming for a long time. (I’ve been <a href="http://j.mp/adbwars">predicting it at least since 2008</a>.) First, there is near-zero (and widespread negative) demand for advertising on the receiving end. Second, Apple is doing a good job of working for its customers by providing ways to turn off or thwart the tracking that aims most ads online. And Apple, while not a monopoly, is pretty damn huge.</p>
<p>It may also help to remember that trees don’t grow to the sky. There is a life cycle for companies just as there is for living things.</p>

  <p>Summary: This post is an excerpt from my upcoming book, Learning Digital Identity, which will be available January 2023.</p>


<p>
    Cogito, ergo sum.<br>
    —René Descartes
</p>
<p>
    The Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648, created the concept of Westphalian sovereignty: the principle of international law that "each state has sovereignty over its territory and domestic affairs, to the exclusion of all external powers, on the principle of non-interference in another country's domestic affairs, and that each state (no matter how large or small) is equal in international law."1
</p>

<p>
    The ensuing century saw many of these states begin civil registration for their citizens, in an effort to turn their sovereignty over territory into governance over the people living in those lands. These registrations, from which our modern system of birth certificates springs, became the basis for personal identity and legal identity in a way that conflated these two concepts.
</p>

<p>
    Birth certificates are a source of legal identity and a proof of citizenship, and thus the basis for individual identity in most countries. Civil registration has become the foundation for how states relate to their citizens. As modern nation-states have become more and more influential (and often controlling) in the lives of their citizens, civil registration and its attendant legal identity have come to play a larger and larger role in their lives. People present proof of civil registration for many purposes: to prove who they are and, springing from that, their citizenship.
</p>

<p>
    Even so, Descartes did not say, "I have a birth certificate, therefore I am." When most people hear the word identity, they think about birth certificates, passports, driver's licenses, logins, passwords, and other sorts of credentials. But clearly, we are more than our legal identity. For most purposes and interactions, our identity is defined through our relationships. Even more deeply, we each experience these independently as an autonomous being with an individual perspective.
</p>

<p>
    This dichotomy reflects identity's dual nature. While identity is something others assign to us, it is also something deep inside of us, reflecting what Descartes actually said: "I think, therefore I am."
</p>

 A Bundle of Sticks? 
<p>
    Another way to think about the dual nature of identity is to ask, "Am I more than a set of attributes?" Property rights are often thought of as a "bundle of sticks": each right is separable from the rest and has value independent of the rest. Similarly, identity is often considered a bundle of attributes, each with independent value. This is known in philosophy as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_theory">bundle theory</a>, originated by David Hume.
</p>

<p>
    Bundle theory puts attributes into a collection without worrying about what ties them together. As an example, you might identify a plum as purple, spherical, 5 centimeters in diameter, and juicy. Critics of bundle theory question how these attributes can be known to be related without knowing the underlying substance—the thing itself.
</p>

<p>
    Substance theory, on the other hand, holds that attributes are borne by "an entity which exists in such a way that it needs no other entity to exist," according to our friend Descartes.  Substance theory gives rise to the idea of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2002/entries/identity-personal/#2">persistence in the philosophy of personal identity</a>. People, organizations, and things persist through time. In one sense, you are the same person who you were when you were 16. But in another, you are not. The thing that makes you the same person over your lifetime is substance. The thing that makes you different is the collection of ever-changing attributes you present to the outside world over time.
</p>

<p>
    I'm no philosopher, but I believe both viewpoints are useful for understanding digital identity. For many practical purposes, viewing people, organizations, and things as bundles of attributes is good enough. This view is the assumption upon which the modern web is built. You log into different services and present a different bundle of attributes to each. There is no substance, at least in the digital sense, since the only thing tying them together is you, a decidedly nondigital entity.
</p>

<p>
    This lack of a digital representation of you, that you alone control, is one of the themes I'll return to several times in my book. At present, you are not digitally embodied—your digital existence depends on other entities. You have no digital substance to connect the various attributes you present online. I believe that digital identity systems must embody us and give us substance if we are to build a digital future where people can operationalize their online existence and maintain their dignity as autonomous human beings.

     Substance theory has many more proponents than Descartes, but his definition is helpful in thinking through identity’s dual nature.

<p>This article shows how to switch between tenants in an ASP.NET Core multi-tenant application using a multi-tenant Azure App registration to implement the identity provider. Azure roles are added to the Azure App registration and this can be used in the separate enterprise applications created from the multi-tenant Azure App registration to assign users and groups. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreTenantSelect">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreTenantSelect</a></p>



<p>Azure AD is used to implement the identity provider for the ASP.NET Core application. In the home tenant, an Azure App registration was created to support multiple tenants. Three roles for users and groups were created and added to the Azure App registration. The first time a user authenticates using the Azure App registration, an administrator can give consent for the tenant. This creates an Azure enterprise application inside the corresponding tenant. Users or groups can be assigned the roles from the Azure App registration. This is specific for the corresponding tenant only. </p>



<p></p>



<p>If a user exists in two separate tenants, the user needs an easy way to switch between the tenants without a logout and a login. The user can be assigned separate roles in each tenant. The email is used to identify the user, as separate OIDs are created for each tenant. The user can be added as an external user in multiple tenants with the same email.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application uses the Azure App registration to authentication.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to implement the OpenID Connect client. This client uses MSAL. The user of the application needs a way to switch between the tenants. To do this, the specific tenant must be used in the authorize request of the OpenID Connect flow. If the common endpoint is used, which is the standard for a multi-tenant Azure App registration, the user cannot switch between the tenants without an account logout first or using a separate incognito browser.</p>



<p></p>



<p>A cache is used to store the preferred tenant of the authenticated user. The user of the application can select the required tenant and the tenant is used for authentication. Before the authorize request is sent to Azure AD, the ProtocolMessage.IssuerAddress is used with the correct tenant GUID identifier. The prompt select_account was added for the authorize request in the OpenID Connect flow so that the user will always be asked to choose an account. Most of us have multiple identities and account nowadays.</p>



<p>The application requires an authenticated user. The default authentication uses the common endpoint and no select account prompt.</p>



<p>There are different ways to implement the switch tenant logic. I have not focused on this. I just add the selected organization to an in-memory cache. You can for example keep a database of your specific allowed organizations and authorize this after a successful authentication using claims returned from the identity provider. You could also provide the organization as a query parameter in the URL. The Azure AD Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI client and ASP.NET Core application requires that the application starts the authentication flow from a HTTP GET, and not a redirect to a GET or a POST request.</p>


  services.AddTransient&lt;TenantProvider&gt;();

services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));

WebApplication? app = null;

services.Configure&lt;MicrosoftIdentityOptions&gt;(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.Prompt = "select_account";
    
    var redirectToIdentityProvider = options.Events.OnRedirectToIdentityProvider;
    options.Events.OnRedirectToIdentityProvider = async context =&gt;
    {
        if(app != null)
        {
            var tenantProvider = app.Services.GetRequiredService&lt;TenantProvider&gt;();
            var email = context.HttpContext!.User.Identity!.Name;
            if (email != null)
            {
                var tenant = tenantProvider.GetTenant(email);
                var address = context.ProtocolMessage.IssuerAddress.Replace("common", tenant.Value);
                context.ProtocolMessage.IssuerAddress = address;
            }
        }

        await redirectToIdentityProvider(context);
    };
});

services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
    var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
                     .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
                     .Build();
    options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

  


<p>The TenantProvider service implements the tenant select logic so that a user can switch between tenants or accounts without signing out or switching browsers. This can be replaced with a database or logic as your business requires. I hard coded some test tenants for the organization switch. Some type of persistence or database would be better for this. An in-memory cache is used to persist the user and the preferred organization.</p>


  public class TenantProvider
{
    private static readonly SelectListItem _org1 = new("Org1", "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1");
    private static SelectListItem _org2 = new("Org2", "a0958f45-195b-4036-9259-de2f7e594db6");
    private static SelectListItem _org3 = new("Org3", "5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244");
    private static SelectListItem _common = new("common", "common");

    private static readonly object _lock = new();
    private IDistributedCache _cache;
    private const int cacheExpirationInDays = 1;

    public TenantProvider(IDistributedCache cache)
    {
        _cache = cache;
    }

    public void SetTenant(string email, string org)
    {
        AddToCache(email, GetTenantForOrg(org));
    }

    public SelectListItem GetTenant(string email)
    {
        var org = GetFromCache(email);

        if (org != null)
            return org;

        return _common;
    }

    public List&lt;SelectListItem&gt; GetAvailableTenants()
    {
        return new List&lt;SelectListItem&gt; { _org1, _org2, _org3, _common };
    }

    private SelectListItem GetTenantForOrg(string org)
    {
        if (org == "Org1")
            return _org1;
        else if (org == "Org2")
            return _org2;
        else if (org == "Org3")
            return _org3;

        return _common;
    }

    private void AddToCache(string key, SelectListItem userActiveOrg)
    {
        var options = new DistributedCacheEntryOptions()
            .SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromDays(cacheExpirationInDays));

        lock (_lock)
        {
            _cache.SetString(key, JsonSerializer.Serialize(userActiveOrg), options);
        }
    }

    private SelectListItem? GetFromCache(string key)
    {
        var item = _cache.GetString(key);
        if (item != null)
        {
            return JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;SelectListItem&gt;(item);
        }

        return null;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>An ASP.NET Core Razor Page is used to implement the tenant switch UI logic. This just displays the available tenants and allows the user to choose a new tenant.</p>


  public class SwitchTenantModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly TenantProvider _tenantProvider;

    public SwitchTenantModel(TenantProvider tenantProvider)
    {
        _tenantProvider = tenantProvider;
    }

    [BindProperty]
    public string Domain { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    [BindProperty]
    public string TenantId { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    [BindProperty]
    public List&lt;string&gt; RolesInTenant { get; set; } = new List&lt;string&gt;();

    [BindProperty]
    public string AppTenantName { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    [BindProperty]
    public List&lt;SelectListItem&gt; AvailableAppTenants { get; set; } = new List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;();

    public void OnGet()
    {
        var name = User.Identity!.Name;

        if (name != null)
        {
            AvailableAppTenants = _tenantProvider.GetAvailableTenants();
            AppTenantName = _tenantProvider.GetTenant(name).Text;

            List&lt;Claim&gt; roleClaims = HttpContext.User.FindAll(ClaimTypes.Role).ToList();

            foreach (var role in roleClaims)
            {
                RolesInTenant.Add(role.Value);
            }

            TenantId = HttpContext.User.FindFirstValue("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/tenantid");
        }
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Only works from a direct GET, not a post or a redirect
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public IActionResult OnGetSignIn([FromQuery]string domain)
    {
        var email = User.Identity!.Name;
        if(email != null)
            _tenantProvider.SetTenant(email, domain);

        return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" },
                OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The Index Razor page in the ASP.NET Core application displays the actually tenant, the organization and the roles for this identity in this tenant.</p>


  public void OnGet()
{
	var name = User.Identity!.Name;

	if(name != null)
	{
		AvailableAppTenants = _tenantProvider.GetAvailableTenants();
		AppTenantName = _tenantProvider.GetTenant(name).Text;

		List&lt;Claim&gt; roleClaims = HttpContext.User.FindAll(ClaimTypes.Role).ToList();

		foreach (var role in roleClaims)
		{
			RolesInTenant.Add(role.Value);
		}

		TenantId = HttpContext.User.FindFirstValue(
			"http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/tenantid");
	}
}
  


<p>After a successful authentication using Azure AD and the multi-tenant Azure App registration, the user can see the assigned roles and the tenant. </p>







<p></p>



<p>The tenant switch is displayed in a HTML list and the authentication request with the select account prompt is sent to Azure AD.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The new tenant and the new corresponding roles for the authorization are displayed after a successful authentication.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Switching tenants is becoming a required feature in most applications now that we have access to multiple Azure AD tenants and domains using the same email. This makes using external identities for an Azure AD user in a multiple domain environment a little less painful. </p>



<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>If using this in environment where all tenants are not allowed, the tid claim must be validated. You should always restrict the tenants in a multi tenant application if possible. You could force this by adding a tenant requirement.</p>


  services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
    var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
                     .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
                     // Eanble to force tenant restrictions
                     .AddRequirements(new[] { new TenantRequirement() })
                     .Build();
    options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

As I was testing my code, I logged into <a href="https://indieweb.org">indieweb.org</a> and noticed that I needed to update my code to support <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#profile-url-response">5.3.2 Profile URL Response</a> of the IndieAuth spec as this IndieAuth client does not need an access token.  Here’s what the history looks like on my IndieAuth server:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If I click on a login timestamp, I have the option to revoke the access token associated with the login if it exists and has not already expired.  My next step is to test some other <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Servers">micropub servers</a> than the one I use to see what interoperability updates I may need to make.</p>

    The pandemic changed us, our views, what we value and how we work.&nbsp; We might not recognise all the changes and hang on in the hope of a return to something we loved, but we must make the best of it now.&nbsp; We should be aware that the change has not only affected us but also our teams.&nbsp; <p>Whilst the Bruce Tuckman 1965 forming–storming–norming–performing model of group development is timeless. No one is likely to dissent that phases remain necessary and inevitable for a team to grow, face challenges, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work, and deliver results.&nbsp;</p><p>However, because we have changed, so has the utility of the tools we apply that move us along the journey from forming to performing.&nbsp; Tools learnt and built in stable and certain times, have less applicability when we are faced with volatility and uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><p>It is the usefulness of tools we utilise that move us on the journey from forming to performing that has changed.&nbsp;</p><p>More books and articles on “teams” and “leadership” exist than on almost all other management topics. However, forming teams today and how to get teams to perform is continually changing. Below is a new framework for the tool bag. Frameworks are just like a tradesperson supplementing their faithful and well-used wooden screwdriver with a sophisticated modern digital electronic driver.&nbsp; Both are needed, but the update can be faster and have more applications.</p><p>Because this is not a book on team building, an overly simplistic view of the Tuckman model is to recognise there are tensions and compromises in all new teams that have to be addressed (storming.)&nbsp; When addressed, align the team to the reason this team exists (norming.) Finally, focus on the tasks that are delegated to the team (performing.) If only it were that simple or that quick!!!&nbsp; Critically team leadership helps the team realise, faster than it would otherwise, that this team has an identity, purpose and unique capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The focus of the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak-Paradox framework</a> in this context is to aid in the unpacking of the storming part in the process. How to unpick and identify different tensions and compromises is essential, and there are many tools for this when the markets are stable and certain. The Peak Paradox framework has the most value in this part of a team's journey, especially when everything is changing.&nbsp; Digital interactions, Gen Z and remote working mean we need new tools to supplement the existing ones.</p><p>The Peak Paradox framing makes us realise that teams and communities don’t naturally exist in all places equally. The purer the purpose that drives an individual, the less likely they can find others who will make a team and walk someone else's path.&nbsp; Yes, there are certain exceptions, but those are not normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Teams and communities don’t exist in all places equally.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/explaining-the-model">Peak Paradox</a>, where you try to optimise for everything, teams will not naturally exist as those in the team cannot agree on what they are optimising for. Debate, argument and hostility remain forever, with a team never escaping the forming stage.&nbsp; Indeed, forming a team with individuals who dwell at the two extremes (Peak Purpose and Peak Paradox) would appear to be futile. However, when humans' only mission is to survive, some of the best teams form.&nbsp; Always an exception.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: these comments should not be confused with applying the Peak Paradox framework to leadership or decision-making - the focus here is purely on team storming.</p><p></p><br><p>A team can start weak, messy or strong - the descriptions of the areas on the chart. They will all still follow the forming – storming – norming – performing model.&nbsp; These three areas give rise to where teams form and where teams need to move if they are to perform.</p><p>Weak teams. &nbsp;The reality, the individuals are not weak, the team is weak.&nbsp; These teams are made of very strong-minded individuals who know what they want, can lead themselves and know what to do but cannot work as a team at the outset. In this case, it is about unpacking what purpose they align to and how they would approach fulfilling the purpose this team has. This allows you to unpack what tensions and compromises they have to live with and how they will deal with them.&nbsp; The right question to ask each team member is, “Where do you naturally align on the four purposes?”&nbsp; Often these teams find they need to lose members or find a different leadership style to be able to move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Messy teams. &nbsp; This is because the individuals are messy, and we come with bias, history, experience and incentives.&nbsp; Messy teams are full of individuals who grasp compromise and tension and live with it every day but have been unable to find the right place for them.&nbsp; They are drawn to optimise for many things at the same time, they comprehend ambiguity, complexity, volatility and uncertainty.&nbsp; Messy teams can be easily guided by strong leadership, but often the cracks appear much later when an individual cannot live with the compromises that are now enforced.&nbsp; The right question to ask each team member is, “What is the one thing you will not compromise over because it creates tension you cannot live with?”</p><p>Strong teams. &nbsp; Teams both start here and should come here to perform, as there is a balance between clarity of purpose, tensions and compromises - sufficient diversity of thought and experience means they can work through problems that occur on the journey the team travels in delivering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The team who starts here will still go on the same F-S-N-P path and, depending on the alignment the team has (if well selected), can get to performing fast.&nbsp; A misaligned team that was selected because of the wrong criteria can fall apart and never get anywhere - this is due to the fact that the individuals oppose the purpose and optimisation of others in the team.&nbsp; The division is divisive.&nbsp; Strong starting teams are not always the route to the best outcome.&nbsp; The trick here is to use the Peak Paradox model to select diverse team members who will be able to cope with the demands and requirements other team members place on the group.&nbsp; The right question to ask is, “What will you compromise on to make another team member more successful?”</p><p>The teams who come to this area from a different starting place, messy or weak, may take time however, on that journey, some team members may have to be lost, and others may be transformed, but they will come to a strong alignment and cohesion by the time they are performing.&nbsp; This is a thing of beauty. The right question to ask when you get to norming is, “what sacrosanct thing can you compromise on to be part of the team?”</p><br><p>The value of the Peak Paradox framework to modern team building is it enables you to ask questions and plot where people are. This allows you to visualise gaps so you can work on how to bring a team together to perform.&nbsp; This is very different to culture and style analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why is this new? Because Gen-Z is much more opinionated and vocal on their purpose than previous generations, they are also far less likely to compromise to be in a team they don’t want to be in.&nbsp; Old tools still work, but new tools can help us get there faster.</p><p>The title is “How to build a #team fit for #uncertainty”&nbsp;</p><p>When there is stability and certainty, teams can perform with a far narrower, more holistic and aligned view, principally because decision-making has more data, and history is a good predictor.&nbsp; There is a greater demand for variance, tension and compromise in teams during instability and uncertainty. &nbsp; Building teams that are resilient when all is changing demands a deeper understanding of what drives individuals and how they cope with new tensions and compromises.&nbsp; To do that, we need new tools to help leadership and team builders visualise what they have and where they need to be.</p><p>My suggestion to start this, is that you</p><p>1. Plot where the team needs to be on the Peak Paradox map to deliver its objective.</p><p>2. Plot the individuals and determine if you have a team that can deliver or has too many tensions, which means compromise will not be sufficient to get them to perform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>3. Do it again before each review or every time a new member joins or leaves.</p><p>4. Question yourself if the current team is too narrow and aligned or too divergent and divisive.&nbsp;</p><p>Another reality - none of this is easy, and for anyone who entered work place post-1990, this is different to other significant but localised market disruptions in 2001 and 2008.&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>The Mobile Ecosystem Forum released a report today—MEF Market Review: Personal Data and Identity Meeting of the Waters—that I’ve been working on for a while. You can <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/mef-market-review-personal-data-and-identity/.">download it for FREE here</a>.</p>
<p>The report explains the current state of the personal data and identity market. Take a look. Let’s collaborate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world is responding to the growing importance of personal data and identity. This response is reshaping the world’s markets. Regulatory, technological, cultural, and economic factors are shifting the context of personal data and identity: the what, when, why, who, where, and how. In light of these shifts, we’re witnessing the nature of personal data and identity change—i.e., the definition or lack thereof. We are seeing shifts in personal data control, i.e., from organizations to individuals. As a result of the Internet of Things (IoT) use, AI, and other technical advancements, personal data is exponentially growing in scope and scale. Many stakeholders are waking up to the value of personal data—not just the idea that it is the “new black gold” but something entirely different; that it is a non-rivalrous, non-depleting, regenerative asset. And finally, we’re seeing an explosion of people-centric regulations rolling out—by 2024, according to Gartner, 75% of the world’s population will be endowed with rights under one or more of these regulations, and organizations will be held accountable to a myriad of new obligations. This all means that we are witnessing the birth of the “personal data and identity meeting of the waters” and a new economy, the personal information economy, where individuals will have a legit seat at the economic table for personal data and identity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This report, the “MEF Market Report: Personal Data and Identity Meeting of the Waters,” provides a detailed overview of what’s happening to and with personal data and identity, why you should care, and what you—all of us—should consider doing to harness the power of personal data and identity responsibly. We hope that this report is used as a guide to help us come together to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Rebuild trusted relationships by inviting individuals to the table 
 Educate and empower all actors 
 Shape and reshape new and existing personal data and identity policies, frameworks, laws, and regulations 
 Attack cybercrime and enhance data stewardship practices 
 Lobby to address market failures and support people-centric infrastructure as a public utility 
 Consider interoperable technology standards and protocols 
 Envision new and evolved business models 
 
<p>The MEF Personal Data and Identity working group welcomes your feedback and contribution. Please message me and let’s discuss the world of personal data and identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wrote this more than a quarter century ago when Linux Journal&nbsp;was the only publication that would have me, and I posted unsold essays and wannabe columns at <a href="http://searls.com">searls.com</a>. These postings accumulated in&nbsp;<a href="http://searls.com/r2">this subdirectory</a>&nbsp;for several years before <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> got me to blog for real, <a href="http://weblog.searls.com/1999/11/11">starting here</a>.</p>
<p>Interesting how much has changed since I wrote this, and how much hasn’t. Everything I said about metaphor applies no less than ever, even as all the warring parties mentioned have died or moved on to other activities, if not battles. (Note that there was no Google at this time, and the search engines mentioned exist only as fossils in posts such as this one.)</p>
<p> Perhaps most interesting is the paragraph about&nbsp;MARKETS ARE CONVERSATIONS. While that one-liner had no effect at the time, it became a genie that would not return to its bottle after Chris Locke, David Weinberger, Rick Levine and I put it in&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>&nbsp;in 1999.&nbsp;In fact, I had been saying “markets are conversations” to no effect at least since the 1980s. Now&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22join+the+conversation%22">join the conversation</a>” is bullshit almost everywhere it’s uttered, but you can’t stop hearing it. Strange how that goes.</p>
 MAKE&nbsp;MONEY, NOT&nbsp;WAR<br>
TIME TO MOVE PAST THE WAR METAPHORS OF THE INDUSTRIAL AGE 
<p>By Doc Searls<br>
19 March 1997</p>
<p>“War isn’t an instinct. It’s an invention.”</p>
<p>“The metaphor is probably the most fertile power possessed by man.”</p>
<p>“Conversation is the socializing instrument par excellence.”</p>
<p>-José Ortega y Gasset</p>
 
 Patton lives 
<p>In the movie “Patton,” the general says, “Compared to war, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance.” In a moment of self-admonition, he adds, “God help me, I love it so.”</p>
<p>And so do we. For proof, all we have to do is pick up a trade magazine. Or better yet, fire up a search engine.</p>
<p>Altavista says more than one million documents on the Web contain the words&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;Netscape,&nbsp;and&nbsp;war. Hotbot lists hundreds of documents titled “Microsoft vs. Netscape,” and twice as many titled “Netscape vs. Microsoft.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to find an article about the two companies that does not cast them as opponents battling over “turf,” “territory,” “sectors” and other geographies.</p>
<p>It’s also hard to start a conversation without using the same metaphorical premise.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.innergy.com/index.html">Intranet Design Magazine</a>&nbsp;recently hosted a thread titled&nbsp;<a href="http://www.innergy.com/ix/arc/677.html">“Who’s winning?? Netscape vs. Microsoft.”</a>&nbsp;Dave Shafer starts the thread with “Wondering what your informed opinion is on who is winning the internet war and what affects this will have on inter/intranet development.” The first respondent says, “sorry, i’m from a french country,” and “I’m searching for economical informations about the war between Microsoft and Netscape for the control of the WEB industrie.” Just as telling is a post by a guy named Michael, who says “Personaly I have both on my PC.”</p>
<p>So do I. Hey, I’ve got 80 megs of RAM and a 2 gig hard drive, so why not? I also have five ISPs, four word processors, three drawing programs, and two presentation packages. I own competing products from Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Netscape, Adobe, Yamaha, Sony, Panasonic, Aiwa, Subaru, Fisher Price and the University of Chicago — to name just a few I can see from where I sit. I don’t sense that buying and using any of these is a territorial act, a victory for one company, or a defeat for another.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean we don’t have those perceptions when we write and talk about companies and the markets where they compete. Clearly, we do, because we understand business — as we understand just about everything — in metaphorical terms. As it happens, our understanding of companies and markets is largely structured by the metaphors BUSINESS IS WAR and MARKETS ARE BATTLEFIELDS.</p>
<p>By those metaphors we share an understanding that companies fight battles over market territories that they attack, defend, dominate, yield or abandon. Their battlefields contain beachheads, bunkers, foxholes, sectors, streams, hills, mountains, swamps, streams, rivers, landslides, quagmires, mud, passages, roadblocks, and high ground. In fact, the metaphor BUSINESS IS WAR is such a functional conceptual system that it unconsciously pumps out clichés like a machine. And since sports is a sublimated and formalized kind of war, the distances between sports and war metaphors in business are so small that the vocabularies mix without clashing.</p>
<p>Here, I’ll pick up the nearest&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/">Business Week</a>… it’s the January 13 issue. Let’s look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/1997/02/b3509122.htm">High Technology</a>&nbsp;section that starts on page 104. The topic is Software and the headline reads, “Battle stations! This industry is up for grabs as never before…” Here’s the first paragraph, with war and sports references capitalized: “Software was once an orderly affair in which a few PLAYERS called most of the shots. The industry had almost gotten used to letting Microsoft Corp. set the agenda in personal computing. But as the Internet ballooned into a $1 billion software business in 1996, HUGE NEW TERRITORIES came up for grabs. Microsoft enters the new year in a STRONG POSITION TO REASSERT CONTROL. But it will have to FIGHT OFF Netscape, IBM, Oracle and dozens of startups that are DESPERATELY STAKING OUT TURF on the Net. ‘Everyone is RACING TO FIND MARKET SPACE and get established…'”</p>
<p>Is this a good thing? Does it matter? The vocabularies of war and sports may be the most commonly used sources of metaphors, for everything from academic essays to fashion stories. Everybody knows war involves death and destruction, yet we experience little if any of that in the ordinary conduct of business, or even of violent activities such as sports.</p>
<p>So why should we concern ourselves with war metaphors, when we all know we don’t take them literally?</p>
<p>Two reasons. First, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;take them literally. Maybe we don’t kill each other, but the sentiments are there, and they do have influences. Second, war rarely yields positive sums, except for one side or another. The economy the Internet induces is an explosion of positive sums that accrue to many if not all participants. Doesn’t it deserve a more accurate metaphor?</p>
<p>For answers, let’s turn to <a href="https://lx.berkeley.edu/people/george-lakoff">George Lakoff</a>.</p>
 The matter of Metaphor 
<p>“Answer true or false,” Firesign Theater says. “Dogs flew spaceships. The Aztecs invented the vacation… If you answered ‘false’ to any of these questions, then&nbsp;everything you know is wrong.”</p>
<p>This is the feeling you begin to get when you read George Lakoff, the foremost authority on the matter of metaphor. Lakoff is Professor of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at UC-Berkeley, the author of&nbsp;Women, Fire and Dangerous Things&nbsp;and&nbsp;Moral Politics: What Conservatives Know that Liberals Don’t. He is also co-author of&nbsp;<a href="http://public.logica.com/~stepneys/bib/nf/lakoff.htm">Metaphors We Live By</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;More than Cool Reason. All are published by the University of Chicago Press.</p>




 




Maybe that’s why they didn’t give us the&nbsp;real&nbsp;story in school. It would have been like pulling the pins out of a bunch of little hand grenades.




 





<p>If Lakoff is right, the most important class you ignored in school was English — not because you need to know all those rules you forgot or books you never read, but because there’s&nbsp;something else&nbsp;behind everything you know (or&nbsp;think&nbsp;you know) and talk about. That something is a metaphor. (And if you think otherwise, you’re wrong.)</p>
<p>In English class — usually when the subject was poetry — they told us that meaning often arises out of comparison, and that three comparative devices are&nbsp;metaphor,&nbsp;simile,&nbsp;and&nbsp;analogy. Each compares one thing to another thing that is similar in some way:</p>
 
 Metaphors&nbsp;say one thing&nbsp;is&nbsp;another thing, such as “time is money,” “a computer screen is a desktop,” or (my favorite Burt Lancaster line) “your mind is a cookie of arsenic.” 
 Similes&nbsp;say one thing is&nbsp;like&nbsp;another thing, such as “gone like snow on the water” or “dumb as a bucket of rocks.” 
 Analogies&nbsp;suggest partial similarities between unalike things, as with “licorice is the liver of candy.” 
 
<p>But metaphor is the device that matters, because, as Lakoff says, “We may not always know it, but we think in metaphor.” And, more to the point, “Metaphors can kill.” Maybe that’s why they didn’t give us the&nbsp;real&nbsp;story in school. It would have been like pulling the pins out of a bunch of little hand grenades.</p>
<p>But now we’re adults, and you’d think we should know how safely to arm and operate a language device. But it’s not easy. Cognitive science is relatively new and only beginning to make sense of the metaphorical structures that give shape and meaning to our world. Some of these metaphors are obvious but many others are hidden. In fact, some are hidden so well that even a guru like Lakoff can overlook them for years.</p>
<p>Lakoff’s latest book, “Moral Politics: What Conservatives Know and Liberals Don’t,” was inspired by his realization that the reason he didn’t know what many conservatives were talking about was that, as a Liberal, he didn’t comprehend conservative metaphors. Dan Quayle’s applause lines went right past him.</p>
<p>After much investigation, Lakoff found that central to the conservative worldview was a metaphor of the state as a strict father and that the “family values” conservatives espouse are those of a strict father’s household: self-reliance, rewards and punishments, responsibility, respect for authority — and finally, independence. Conservatives under Ronald Reagan began to understand the deep connection between family and politics, while Liberals remained clueless about their own family metaphor — the “nurturant parent” model. Under Reagan, Lakoff says, conservatives drove the language of strict father morality into the media and the body politic. It won hearts and minds, and it won elections.</p>
<p>So metaphors matter, big time. They structure our perceptions, the way we make sense of the world, and the language we use to talk about things that happen in the world. They are also far more literal than poetry class would lead us to believe. Take the metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR —</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is important to see that we don’t just talk about arguments in terms of war. We can actually win or lose arguments. We see the person we are arguing with as an opponent. We attach kis decisions and defend our own. We gain and lose ground. We plan and use strategies… Many of the things we do in arguing are partially structured by the concept of war.” (From&nbsp;Metaphors We Live By)</p></blockquote>
<p>In our culture argument is understood and structured by the war metaphor. But in other cultures it is not. Lakoff invites us to imagine a culture where argument is viewed as dance, participants as performers and the goal to create an aesthetically pleasing performance.</p>
<p>Right now we understand that “Netscape is losing ground in the browser battle,” because we see the browser business a territory over which Netscape and Microsoft are fighting a war. In fact, we are so deeply committed to this metaphor that the vocabularies of business and war reporting are nearly indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Yet the Internet “battlefield” didn’t exist a decade ago, and the software battlefield didn’t exist a decade before that. These territories were created out of nothingness. Countless achievements have been made on them. Victories have been won over absent or equally victorious opponents.</p>
<p>In fact, Netscape and Microsoft are creating whole new markets together, and both succeed mostly at nobody’s expense. Netscape’s success also owes much to the robust nature of the Windows NT Server platform.</p>




 




The war stories we’re telling about the Internet are turning into epic lies.




 





<p>At the same time Microsoft has moved forward in browsers, directory services, languages, object models and other product categories — mostly because it’s chasing Netscape in each of them.</p>
<p>Growing markets are positive-sum creations, while wars are zero-sum at best. But BUSINESS IS WAR is an massive metaphorical machine that works so well that business war stories almost write themselves. This wouldn’t be a problem if business was the same now as it was twenty or fifty years ago. But business is changing fast, especially where the Internet is involved. The old war metaphor just isn’t doing the job.</p>
<p>Throughout the Industrial Age, both BUSINESS IS WAR and MARKETS ARE BATTLEFIELDS made good structure, because most industries and markets were grounded in physical reality. Railroads, shipping, construction, automobiles, apparel and retail were all located in physical reality. Even the phone system was easily understood in terms of phones, wires and switches. And every industrial market contained finite labor pools, capital, real estate, opportunities and natural resources. Business really was war, and markets really were battlefields.</p>
<p>But the Internet is hardly physical and most of its businesses have few physical limitations. The Web doesn’t look, feel or behave like anything in the analog world, even though we are eager to describe it as a “highway” or as a kind of “space.” Internet-related businesses appear and grow at phenomenal rates. The year 1995 saw more than $100 billion in new wealth created by the Internet, most of it invested in companies that were new to the world, or close to it. Now new markets emerge almost every day, while existing markets fragment, divide and expand faster than any media can track them.</p>
<p>For these reasons, describing Internet business in physical terms is like standing at the Dawn of Life and describing new species in terms of geology. But that’s what we’re doing, and every day the facts of business and technology life drift farther away from the metaphors we employ to support them. We arrive at pure myth, and the old metaphors stand out like bones from a dry corpse.</p>
<p>Of course myths are often full of truth. Fr. Seán Olaoire says “there are some truths so profound only a story can tell them.” But the war stories we’re telling about the Internet are turning into epic lies.</p>




 




Describing Internet business in physical terms is like standing at the Dawn of Life and describing new species in terms of geology.




 





<p>What can we do about it?</p>
<p>First, there’s nothing we can do to break the war metaphor machine. It’s just too damn big and old and good at what it does. But we can introduce some&nbsp;new&nbsp;metaphors that make equally good story-telling machines, and tell more accurately what’s going on in this new business world.</p>
<p>One possibility is MARKETS ARE CONVERSATIONS. These days we often hear conversations used as synonyms for markets. We hear about “the privacy conversation” or “the network conversation.” We “talk up” a subject and say it has a lot of “street cred.” This may not be much, but it does accurately structure an understanding of what business is and how markets work in the world we are creating with the Internet.</p>
<p>Another is the CONDUIT metaphor. Lakoff credits Michael Reddy with discovering hidden in our discussions of language the implication of conduit structure:</p>
 
 Your thinking comes&nbsp;through&nbsp;loud and clear. 
 It’s hard to&nbsp;put&nbsp;my ideas&nbsp;into&nbsp;words 
 You can’t&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;into&nbsp;a sentence 
 His words&nbsp;carry&nbsp;little meaning 
 
<p>The Net facilitates communication, and our language about communication implies contuits through which what we say is conveyed. The language of&nbsp;push&nbsp;media suggests the Net is less a centerless network — a Web — than a set of channels&nbsp;through&nbsp;which stuff is sent. Note the preposition. I suggest that we might look more closely at how much the conduit metaphor is implicit in what we say about push, channels and related subjects. There’s something to it, I think.</p>
<p>My problem with both CONDUIT and CHANNEL is that they don’t clearly imply positive sums, and don’t suggest the living nature of the Net. Businesses have always been like living beings, but in the Net environment they enjoy unprecedented fecundity. What’s a good metaphor for that? A jungle?</p>
<p>Whatever, it’s clearly not just a battlefield, regardless of the hostilities involved. It’s time to lay down our arms and and start building new conceptual machines. George Lakoff will speak at PC Forum next week. I hope he helps impart some mass to one or more new metaphorical flywheels. Because we need to start telling sane and accurate stories about our businesses and our markets.</p>
<p>If we don’t, we’ll go on shooting at each other for no good reason.</p>

<p>Among other places.</p>
<p>These were shot on the second leg of a United flight from Seattle to Indianapolis by way of Houston. I do this kind of thing on every flight I take. Partly it’s because I’m obsessed with geography, geology, weather, culture, industry, infrastructure, and other natural things. And partly it’s to provide a useful service.</p>
<p>I don’t do it for the art, though sometimes art happens. For example, with this shot of salt ponds at the south end of San Francisco Bay:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/51393996519/in/album-72157719712055684/"></a></p>
<p>Airplane windows are not optically ideal for photography. On the contrary, they tend to be scratched, smudged, distorted, dirty, and worse. Most of the photos above were shot through a window that got frosty and gray at altitude and didn’t clear until we were close to landing. The air was also hazy. For cutting through that I can credit the&nbsp;dehaze slider in Adobe Photoshop 2021. I can also thank Photoshop for pulling out color and doing other things that make bad photos useful, if not good in the artsy sense. They fit my purpose, which is other people’s purposes.</p>
<p>In addition to Adobe, I also want to tip my hat toward Sony, for making the outstanding <a href="https://kenrockwell.com/sony/a7-iv.htm">a7iv mirrorless camera</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/05/14/help-why-dont-images-load-in-https/">24-105mm f/4 FE G OSS</a> lens I used on this flight. Also&nbsp;<a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, which makes it easy to upload, organize, caption, tag, and annotate boundless quantities of full- (and other-) size photos—and to give them Creative Commons licenses. I’ve been using Flickr since it started in 2005, and remain a happy customer with two accounts: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/">my main one</a>, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/">another focused on infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>While they are no longer in a position to care, I also want to thank the makers of iView MediaPro, Microsoft Expressions and PhaseOne MediaPro for providing the best workflow software in the world, at least for me. Alas, all are now abandonware, and I don’t expect any of them to work on a 64-bit operating system, which is why, for photographic purposes, I’m still sitting on MacOS Mojave 10.14.6.</p>
<p>I’m hoping that I can find some kind of substitute when I get a new laptop, which will inevitably come with an OS that won’t run the oldware I depend on. But I’ll save that challenge for a future post.</p>

<p>This article explains why cross device authentication has security issues as it is subject to phishing attacks unless further authentication is used in the client. Scanning QR Codes for authentication does not protect against phishing and leaves the users open to having their session stolen. </p>







<p></p>



 Phishing 



<p>There a many forms of phishing and this is one of the biggest problems the industry needs to solve at present. As a service or software provider, it is not correct for you to expect your clients to be wise enough, not to fall for a phishing attack. We need and must create systems where phishing is not possible. At present the industry provides three solutions to protect against phishing; FIDO2, certificate authentication using PKI and windows for business authentication. FIDO2 will become much more user friendly once the new hardware devices have built in FIDO2 keys and the rollout of passkeys is supported by most of the big service providers.</p>



<p>When using cross device authentication, it is not possible to protect against phishing, or at least we have no known solution for this at present. </p>



 Phishing in Self sovereign identity 



<p>Users authenticating on HTTPS websites using verifiable credentials stored on your wallet are still vulnerable to phishing attacks. This can be improved by using FIDO2 as a second factor to the SSI authentication. The DIDComm communication between agents has strong protection against phishing but this does not protect against phishing when started using a QR Code from a separate device.</p>



<p>Self sovereign identity phishing scenario using HTTPS websites:</p>



 
 User opens a phishing website in the browser using HTTPS and clicks the fake sign-in 



 Phishing service initializes the authentication using a correct SSI sign-in on the correct website using HTTPS and gets presented with a QR Code (URI link) for a digital wallet to complete. 



 Phishing service presents this back on the phishing website to the victim. 



 Victim scans the QR Code using the digital wallet and completes the authentication using the agent in the digital wallet, DIDComm V2, trusted registry etc. 



 When the victim completes the sign-in using the out of band digital wallet and agent, the HTTPS website being used by the attacker gets updated with the session of the victim. 
 







<p></p>



<p>This can only be prevented by using the browser client-side origin as part of the flow, signing this and returning this back to the server to be validated, thus preventing this type of phishing attack. This cannot be prevented unless the origin from the client browser is used and validated in the authentication process. The browser client-side origin is not used in the SSI login.</p>



<p>Here’s the same problem description:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tpmyLf88pU&amp;t=1496s">Risk Mitigation for Cross Device Flows</a></p>



 Phishing in cross device 



<p>In general, any cross device authentication does not protect against phishing. You need further authentication in the browser/agent client where the session is running.</p>



 Comparing apples and oranges 



<p>A lot of people pushing these systems compare this form of authentication with single factor password authentication. This type of cross device authentication is much better than password authentication, this is correct, but the industry has already solved this and for any good enterprise systems or secure systems, users can no longer use single password authentication, this is a solved problem. It is just not rolled out to the wider public for the consumer market. Introducing another system will not solve this either.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The cross device application running on the separate device can authenticate its part of the authentication flow correctly and this step in the authentication process is ok and cannot be phished if implemented correctly like for example using Didcomm V2 and trust registries but this does not solve the phishing weakness when starting from a HTTPS website with a QR Code scanned from the original device.</p>



 Workarounds 



<p>Use a phishing resistant authentication like FIDO2, PKI solution using certificates or Windows for business.  Once authenticated, the QR Code can be scanned in a safe way and the cross device authentication can be used for example to verify an identity. This works because you are already inside a secure session and the same session will get updated with the scanned data then.</p>

<p><a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/2635730822/"></a><br>
In July 2008, when I <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2008/07/04/fire-from-the-mission/">posted the photo above on this blog</a>, some readers thought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Santa_Barbara">Santa Barbara Mission</a> was on fire. It didn’t matter that I explained in that post how I got the shot, or that news reports made clear that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_Fire_(2008)">Gap Fire</a>&nbsp;was miles away. The photo was a good one, but it also collapsed three dimensions into just two. Hence the confusion. If you didn’t know better, it looked like the building was on fire. The photo removed distance.</p>
<p>So does the Internet, at least when we are there. Let’s look at what&nbsp;there means.</p>
<p>Pre-digital media were limited by distance, and to a high degree defined by it. Radio and television signals degrade across distances from transmitters, and are limited as well by buildings, terrain, weather, and (on some frequency bands), ionospheric conditions. Even a good radio won’t get an absent signal. Nor will a good TV. Worse, if you live more than a few dozen miles from a TV station’s transmitter, you need a good antenna mounted on your roof, a chimney, or a tall pole. For signals coming from different locations, you need a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tv+antenna+rotator">rotator</a> as well. Even on cable, there is still a distinction between local channels and cable-only ones. You pay more to get “bundles” of the latter, so there is a distance in cost between local and distant channel sources. If you get your TV by satellite, your&nbsp;there needs to be in the satellite’s coverage footprint.</p>
<p>But with the Internet, here and there are the same. Distance is gone, on purpose. Its design presumes that all physical and wireless connections are one, no matter who owns them or how they get paid to move chunks of Internet data. It is a <a href="https://worldofends.com/">world of ends</a>&nbsp;meant to show nothing of its middles, which are countless paths the ends ignore. (Let’s also ignore, for the moment, that some countries and providers censor or filter the Internet, in some cases blocking access from the physical locations their systems detect. Those all essentially violate the Internet’s simple assumption of openness and connectivity for everybody and everything at every end.)</p>
<p>For people on the Internet, distance is collapsed to the height and width of a window. There is also no gravity because space implies three dimensions and your screen has only two, and the picture is always upright. When persons in Scotland and Australia talk, neither is upside down to the other. But they are present with each other and that’s what matters. (This may change in the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=metaverse">metaverse</a>, whatever that becomes, but will likely require headgear not everyone will wear. And it will still happen over the Internet.)</p>
<p>Digital life, almost all of which now happens on the Internet, is new to human experience, and our means of coping are limited. For example, by language. And I don’t mean different ones. I mean all of them, because they are made for making sense of a three-dimensional physical world, which the Internet is not.</p>
<p>Take prepositions. English, like most languages, has a few dozen prepositions, most of which describe placement in three-dimensional space. Over, around, under, through, beside, within, off, on, over, aboard… all presume three dimensions. That’s also where our bodies are, and it is through our bodies that we make sense of the world.&nbsp;We say good is light and bad is dark because we are diurnal hunters and gatherers, with eyes optimized for daylight. We say good is up and bad is down because we walk and run upright. We “grasp” or “hold on” to an idea because we have opposable thumbs on hands built to grab. We say birth is “arrival,” death is “departure” and careers are “paths,” because we experience life as travel.</p>
<p>But there are no prepositions yet that do justice to the Internet’s absence of distance. Of course, we say we are “on” the Internet like we say we are “on” the phone. And it works well enough, as does saying we are on” fire or drugs. We just frame our understanding of the Internet in metaphorical terms that require a preposition, and “on” makes the most sense. But can we do better than that? Not sure.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that how we present ourselves in the digital world also differs from how we do the same in the physical one? On social media, for example, we perform roles, as if on a stage. We talk to an audience straight through a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall">fourth wall</a>, like an actor, a lecturer, a comedian, musician, or politician. My point here is that the arts and methods of performing in the physical world are old, familiar, and reliant on physical surroundings. How we behave with others in our offices, our bedrooms, our kitchens, our clubs, and our cars are all well-practiced and understood. In social media, the sense of setting is much different and more limited.</p>
<p>In the physical world, much of our knowledge (as the scientist and philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi">Michael Polanyi</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge">first taught</a>) is tacit rather than explicit, yet digital technology is entirely explicit: ones and zeroes, packets and pixels. We do have tacit knowledge of the digital world, but the on/off present/absent two-dimensionality of that world is still new to us and lacks much of what makes life in the three-dimensional natural world so rich and subtle.</p>
<p>Marshall McLuhan says all media, all technologies, extend us. When we drive a car we wear it like a carapace or a suit of armor. We also speak of it in the first person possessive: my engine, my fenders, my wheels, much as we would say my fingers and my hair. There is distance here too, and it involves performance. A person who would never yell at another person standing in line at a theater might do exactly that at another car. This kind of distance is gone, or very different, in the digital world.</p>
<p>In a way we are naked in the digital world, and vulnerable. By that I mean we lack the rudimentary privacy technologies we call clothing and shelter, which protect our private parts and spaces from observation and intrusion while also signaling the forms of observation and contact that we permit or welcome. The absence of this kind of privacy tech is why it is so easy for websites and apps to fill our browsers with cookies and other ways to track us and report our activities back to dozens, hundreds or thousands of unknown parties. In this early stage of life on the Internet, what’s called privacy is just the “choices” sites and services give us, none of which are recorded where we can easily find, audit, or dispute them.</p>
<p>Can we get new forms of personal tech that truly extend and project our agency in the digital world? I think so, but it’s a question so completely good that we don’t yet have an answer.</p>

<p>Me, <a href="https://open.nytimes.com/collective-decision-making-with-ahp-3ef819e5bc2a" title="Collective Decision-Making with AHP">writing for NYT Open</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Identity Team at the Times, responsible for building and maintaining
identity and authentication services for all of our users, has embarked on an
ambitious project to build a centralized identity platform. We’re going to
make a lot of decisions, such as what languages we should use, what database,
how we can best protect personal information, what the API should look like,
and so much more. Just thinking about the discussions and consensus-building
required for a project of this scope daunts even the most experienced
decision-makers among us. Fortuitously, a presentation at <a href="https://leaddev.com/staffplus-new-york/">StaffPlus NYC</a> by
Comcast Fellow <a href="http://www.johnriviello.com">John Riviello</a> introduced a super fascinating approach to
collective decision-making, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process" title="Wikipedia: “Analytic hierarchy process”">AHP</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I quite enjoyed our experiment with AHP, a super useful tool for collective
decision-making. For a less technical primer, Wikipedia has some great examples:</p>

  <p>Summary: Verifiable credentials have transport options other than DIDComm. In this post, I explore the OpenID4VC specification which allows credentials to be used in the OpenID ecosystem.</p>




<p>
In my discussions of verifiable credentials, I assume DIDs are the underlying identifier. This implies that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm, the messaging protocol based on DIDs</a>, underlies the exchange of verifiable credentials. This does not have to be the case.
</p>

<p>
  The OpenID Foundation has defined protocols on top of OAuth1 for <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html">issuing</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html">presenting</a> credentials. These specifications support the W3C Verifiable credential data model specification and support both full credential and derived credential presentations. The OpenID specifications allow for other credential formats as well, such as the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO mobile driver’s license</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to defining specifications for issuing and presenting credentials, OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) introduces2 a wallet for holding and presenting credentials. Open ID Connect (OIDC) redirects interactions between the identity provider (IdP) and relying party (RP) through a user agent under a person’s control, but there was never an OIDC-specific user agent. The addition of a wallet allows OpenID4VC to break the link that has traditionally existed between the IdP and RP in the form of federation agreements and an interaction protocol wherein the IdP always knew when a person used OIDC to authenticate at the RP. OpenID4VC offers direct presentation using the wallet.
</p>

<p>
  Extending OAuth and OIDC to support the issuance and presentation of verifiable credentials provides for richer interactions than merely supporting authentication. All the use cases we’ve identified for verifiable credentials are available in OpenID4VC as well.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to using the OpenID4VC wallet with a traditional OIDC IdP, OpenID has also added a <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">specification for Self-issued OpenID Providers (SIOP)</a>. A SIOP is an IdP that is controlled by the entity who uses the wallet. A SIOP might use DIDs, KERI, or something else for identifiers. The SIOP allows Alice to control the identifiers and claims she releases to the RP. As with DIDs, a SIOP-based relationship between the RP and Alice is not intermediated by an external, federated IdP as it is in the traditional OIDC model.
</p>

<p>
  When Alice uses a wallet that supports OpenID4VC and SIOP to present credentials to an RP, the Alice has a relationship with the RP based on a self-issued identity token she creates. SIOP allows Alice to make presentations independent from any specific IdP. As a result, she can present credentials from any issuer to the RP, not just information from a single IdP as is the case in traditional OIDC.
</p>

<p>
  Like any other credential presentation, the RP can verify the fidelity of the credential cryptographically. This can include knowing that it was issued to the wallet Alice is using to make the presentation. The RP also gets the identifier for the credential issuer inside the presentation and must decide whether to trust the information presented.
</p>

<p>
  To make fidelity and provenance determinations for the credential, the RP will need the public key for the credential issuer as is the case with any credential verification. The verifiable data registry (VDR) in an OpenID4VC credential exchange might be a ledger or other decentralized data store if the presentation uses DIDs, or it might be obtained using PKI or web-pages accessible under a domain name controlled by the issuer. Depending on how this is done, the credential issuer might or might not know which credentials the RP is verifying. The design of the VDR plays a large role in whether credential exchange has all the properties we might desire. 
</p>

<p>
  OpenID4VC is an important example of alternatives to DIDComm in verifiable credential exchange thanks to OIDC’s large deployment base and developers’ familiarity with its underlying protocols and procedures. Because the W3C specification for verifiable credentials does not specify an underlying mechanism for exchanging credentials, others are possible. If you find a need from an alternative, be sure to carefully vet its design to ensure it meets your privacy, authenticity, and confidentiality requirements.
</p>

 
   Recall that OpenID Connect is based on OAuth. 
   For details on OpenID4VC, I recommend the introductory whitepaper from the OpenID Foundation: <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/06/OIDF-Whitepaper_OpenID-for-Verifiable-Credentials-V2_2022-06-23.pdf">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials: A Shift in the Trust Model Brought by Verifiable Credentials (June 23, 2022)</a>

<p>This article shows how to force a phishing resistant authentication for an ASP.NET Core application using Azure AD and a conditional access policy which forces a phishing resistant authentication using a conditional access authentication context. The ASP.NET Core application forces this by requiring the acrs claim in the id_token with the value of c4 which is the authentication context created for this in this tenant.</p>



<p>Code <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreAzureADCAE">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreAzureADCAE</a></p>



<p>The following five steps are required to set this up. I used Microsoft Entra for this but Graph can be used as well which makes automatization and infrastructure as code (IaC) deployments possible.</p>



 
 Step 1 Authentication method definition 



 Step 2 Create an CA Auth context 



 Step 3 Create a policy to use the Azure AD CA Auth context 



 Step 4 Define the Azure App registration 



 Step 5 Use inside an ASP.NET Core application 
 



 Step 1 Authentication method definition 



<p>Using <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com">https://entra.microsoft.com</a>, you can create a custom authentication method, or re-use some of the given standard definitions. A phishing resistant authentication method is already defined in the portal. You can also create a custom method that for example only accepts your company specific FIDO2 keys.</p>







<p>Creating a specific authentication method allows you to choose a specific authentication method. The phishing resistant default definition is a pre-defined authentication method.</p>







 Step 2 Create an CA Auth context 



<p>An authentication context needs to be created to force a policy in the ASP.NET Core application. Create a new authentication context using the Microsoft Entra.</p>



<p></p>







<p>Add the naming of the policy and the authentication context identifier. I used c4 for my phishing resistant requirement.</p>







<p>You could also create the authentication context using Microsoft Graph. I created the <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreAzureADCAE/tree/main/CaeAdministrationTool">CaeAdministrationTool</a> application in the demo repo showing how to implement this.</p>



 Step 3 Create a policy to use the Azure AD CA Auth context 



<p>You can create the conditional access policy to use the authentication context and force the authentication method as requires. Create a new policy.</p>







<p>Select the created authentication context in the Cloud apps or actions.</p>







<p>In the access controls, grant access to users that authenticate with a phishing resistant authentication.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Using this policy, a user must authentication with one of the phishing resistant methods.</p>



 Step 4 Define the Azure App registration 



<p>The ASP.NET Core application requires an Azure App registration with the correct configuration to authenticate with Azure AD and the use conditional access policy. The application must validate the CA and not a downstream API. This means we need to validate this in the id_token. This is done using the xms_cc claim. You can add this in the App registration manifest.</p>


  "optionalClaims": {
	"idToken": [
		{
			"name": "xms_cc",
			"source": null,
			"essential": false,
			"additionalProperties": []
		}
	],
	"accessToken": [],
	"saml2Token": []
},
  


<p>Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the authentication for Azure AD. The app.settings requires the ClientCapabilities value with the cp1 value.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodsharepoint.onmicrosoft.com",
	"TenantId": "5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244",
	"ClientId": "daffd2e8-3718-4ac4-b971-c7f1bb570375",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "ClientCapabilities": [ "cp1" ]
	//"ClientSecret":  "--in-user-secrets-or-key-vault--"
},
  


<p>You can check some of the standard settings required for the Web application Azure App registration using the manifest definition. The docs for this can be found on the Microsoft.Identity.Web Github repo Wiki.</p>


  "oauth2AllowIdTokenImplicitFlow": true,
"optionalClaims": {
	"idToken": [
		{
			"name": "xms_cc",
			"source": null,
			"essential": false,
			"additionalProperties": []
		}
	],
	"accessToken": [],
	"saml2Token": []
},
"replyUrlsWithType": [
	{
		"url": "https://localhost:44414/signin-oidc",
		"type": "Web"
	}
],
"signInAudience": "AzureADMyOrg",
  


 Step 5 Use inside an ASP.NET Core application 



<p>The application must validate if the id_token and the corresponding claims identity has the acrs claim with the value c4 which represents the authentication context created for the phishing resistant conditional access policy. If this is configured correctly, a phishing resistant authentication is required to use the application.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System;
using System.Linq;

namespace RazorCaePhishingResistant;

/// &lt;summary&gt;

/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class CaeClaimsChallengeService
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public CaeClaimsChallengeService(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public string? CheckForRequiredAuthContextIdToken(string authContextId, HttpContext context)
    {
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(authContextId))
        {
            string authenticationContextClassReferencesClaim = "acrs";

            if (context == null || context.User == null || context.User.Claims == null || !context.User.Claims.Any())
            {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context), "No Usercontext is available to pick claims from");
            }

            var acrsClaim = context.User.FindAll(authenticationContextClassReferencesClaim).FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.Value == authContextId);

            if (acrsClaim?.Value != authContextId)
            {
                string clientId = _configuration.GetSection("AzureAd").GetSection("ClientId").Value;
                var cae = "{\"id_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"" + authContextId + "\"}}}";

                return cae;
            }
        }

        return null;
    }
}
  


<p>The admin page requires a strong authentication. If this is missing, a challenge is returned informing the identity provider (AAD) which claim is required to use the application. This is specified in the OpenID Connect shared signal and events specifications.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace RazorCaePhishingResistant.Pages;

public class AdminModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly CaeClaimsChallengeService _caeClaimsChallengeService;

    public AdminModel( CaeClaimsChallengeService caeClaimsChallengeService)
    {
        _caeClaimsChallengeService = caeClaimsChallengeService;
    }

    [BindProperty]
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;? Data { get; private set; }

    public IActionResult OnGet()
    {
        // if CAE claim missing in id token, the required claims challenge is returned
        // C4 is used in the phishing resistant policy
        var claimsChallenge = _caeClaimsChallengeService
            .CheckForRequiredAuthContextIdToken(AuthContextId.C4, HttpContext);

        if (claimsChallenge != null)
        {
            var properties = new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/admin" };

            properties.Items["claims"] = claimsChallenge;
            return Challenge(properties);
        }

        Data = new List&lt;string&gt;()
        {
            "Admin data 1",
            "Admin data 2"
        };

        return Page();
    }
}
  


<p>Now the admin page of the application requires the correct authentication. You could force this for the complete application or just a single page of the app. If the user does not authenticate using a phishing resistant authentication or cannot use this, the application page cannot be used. This is really useful when deploying administration applications to tenants which do not enforce this for all users.</p>



 Notes 



<p>This works really well and you can force a phishing resistant authentication from the application.  MFA using the authenticator app will not work and the users of of Azure AD and applications using Azure AD have more protection. </p>

   One of the building blocks of the Indieweb is IndieAuth. Like many others, I bootstrapped my experience with indieauth.com but as Marty McGuire explains, there are good reasons to switch and even consider building your own.

  <p>One of the building blocks of the <a href="https://indieweb.org">Indieweb</a> is <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>. Like many others, I bootstrapped my experience with <a href="https://indieauth.com/">indieauth.com</a> but as <a href="https://martymcgui.re/2022/07/31/switching-costs-for-an-indieauth-server/">Marty McGuire explains</a>, there are good reasons to switch and even consider building your own.

<p>This is not production ready code.  While I know that <a href="https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github">the micropub server I use</a> works with it, I expect others may not. Also, there is no support for refresh tokens and other things in the spec that I didn’t consider high priority.  It does support <a href="https://indieweb.org/PKCE">PKCE</a> but not the less useful “plain” method.</p>

<p>All of <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2020/12/03/1/indieauth-2020">IndieAuth Spec Updates 2020</a> was very clear and helpful.  In one case, I made the server probably too strict (as an easy way to curtail spam registrations).  It requires that the hosts for a blog’s authorization endpoint and token endpoint match the host of the IndieAuth server before a user can register an account on the indieauth server.</p>

<p>I plan to add an option for a user to keep a history of logins to indieauth clients soon.  Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>

<p>Over the past year, I have been so engrossed in building <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">decentralized digital trust infrastructure</a> that I haven’t made a single post on this blog.

<p>*****</p>



<p>I began the morning, as I often do, with a cup of coffee and a discussion with a friend. We were talking about last week’s&nbsp;<a href="https://link.theatlantic.com/click/29254268.380691/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29tL25ld3NsZXR0ZXJzL2FyY2hpdmUvMjAyMi8wOS9ydXNzaWFzLW51Y2xlYXItdGhyZWF0cy82NzE1NzEvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1hdGxhbnRpYy1kYWlseS1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PTIwMjIxMDAz/6050ea994c8a1e4095020f69Bedb49045">nuclear warnings</a>&nbsp;from Russian President Vladimir Putin, and while we were on the subject of unhinged threats, I mentioned Donald Trump’s&nbsp;<a href="https://link.theatlantic.com/click/29254268.380691/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjIvMTAvMDEvdHJ1bXAtbWNjb25uZWxsLWRlYXRoLXdpc2gvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1hdGxhbnRpYy1kYWlseS1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PTIwMjIxMDAz/6050ea994c8a1e4095020f69B06cc2930">bizarre statement</a>&nbsp;over the weekend that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had a “DEATH WISH,” with a racist slam on McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, added in for good measure.</p>



<p>“Oh, yeah,” my friend said. “I’d forgotten about that.” To be honest, so had I. But when I opened Twitter today,&nbsp;The Bulwark&nbsp;publisher Sarah Longwell’s&nbsp;<a href="https://link.theatlantic.com/click/29254268.380691/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9TYXJhaExvbmd3ZWxsMjUvc3RhdHVzLzE1NzY4ODY1NDgzMDUzMDk2OTY_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWF0bGFudGljLWRhaWx5LW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9MjAyMjEwMDM/6050ea994c8a1e4095020f69Bc3cf4edc">tweet</a>&nbsp;that “we are still under-reacting to the threat of Trump” jumped out at me. She’s right.</p>



<p>We are also, in a way, underreacting to the war in Ukraine. Our attention, understandably, has become focused on the human drama. But we are losing our grip on the larger story and greater danger: Russia’s dictator is demanding that he be allowed to take whatever he wants, at will and by force. He is now, as both my colleague&nbsp;<a href="https://link.theatlantic.com/click/29254268.380691/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29tL2lkZWFzL2FyY2hpdmUvMjAyMi8wOS9ydXNzaWEtYW5uZXgtdWtyYWluZS1wdXRpbi82NzE2MDcvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1hdGxhbnRpYy1kYWlseS1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PTIwMjIxMDAz/6050ea994c8a1e4095020f69Bd93f8995">Anne Applebaum</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://link.theatlantic.com/click/29254268.380691/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29tL25ld3NsZXR0ZXJzL2FyY2hpdmUvMjAyMi8wOS9wdXRpbi1pbi10aGUtYnVua2VyLzY3MTYyOC8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWF0bGFudGljLWRhaWx5LW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9MjAyMjEwMDM/6050ea994c8a1e4095020f69B18ccd355">I have written</a>, at war not only with Ukraine, but with the entire international order. He (like his admirer Trump) is at war with democracy itself.</p>



<p>And somehow, we have all&nbsp;just gotten used to it.</p>



<p>We are inured to these events not because we are callous or uncaring. Rather, people such as Trump and Putin have sent us into a tailspin, a vortex of mad rhetoric and literal violence that has unmoored us from any sense of the moral principles that once guided us, however imperfectly, both at home and abroad. This is “the widening gyre” W. B.&nbsp;<a href="https://link.theatlantic.com/click/29254268.380691/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9ldHJ5Zm91bmRhdGlvbi5vcmcvcG9lbXMvNDMyOTAvdGhlLXNlY29uZC1jb21pbmc_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPWF0bGFudGljLWRhaWx5LW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9MjAyMjEwMDM/6050ea994c8a1e4095020f69Baab39b14">Yeats wrote</a>&nbsp;about in 1919, the sense that “anarchy is loosed upon the world” as “things fall apart.”</p>



<p>For many years, I have often felt this way in the course of an ordinary day, when it seems as if I am living in a dystopian alternate universe. A time of hope and progress that began in the late 1980s was somehow derailed, perhaps even before the last chunks of the Berlin Wall’s corpse were being cleared from the Friedrichstrasse. (This was a time, for example, when we started taking people like&nbsp;<a href="https://link.theatlantic.com/click/29254268.380691/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29tL2lkZWFzL2FyY2hpdmUvMjAyMi8wOS9yb3NzLXBlcm90LXJlcHVibGljYW4tcGFydHktaGlzdG9yeS10cnVtcC82NzE0NDEvP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1hdGxhbnRpYy1kYWlseS1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PTIwMjIxMDAz/6050ea994c8a1e4095020f69B5c0783e5">Ross Perot</a>&nbsp;seriously, which was an early warning sign of our incipient post–Cold War stupor.) Here are some of the many moments in which I have felt that sense of vertigo:</p>



 
 In my lifetime, I have seen polio defeated and smallpox eradicated. Now hundreds of thousands of Americans are dead—and still dying—because they refused a lifesaving vaccine as a&nbsp;<a href="https://link.theatlantic.com/click/29254268.380691/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJvb2tpbmdzLmVkdS9ibG9nL2ZpeGdvdi8yMDIxLzEwLzAxL2Zvci1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbnMtcGFydHktYWZmaWxpYXRpb24tbWF0dGVycy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tcmFjZS1hbmQtZXRobmljaXR5Lz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249YXRsYW50aWMtZGFpbHktbmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fY29udGVudD0yMDIyMTAwMw/6050ea994c8a1e4095020f69B457e0779">test of their political loyalty</a>&nbsp;to an ignoramus. 



 After living under the threat of Armageddon, I saw the Soviet flag lowered from the Kremlin and an explosion of freedom across Eastern Europe. An American president then took U.S. strategic forces off high alert and ordered the destruction of thousands of nuclear weapons with&nbsp;<a href="https://link.theatlantic.com/click/29254268.380691/aHR0cHM6Ly9uc2FyY2hpdmUuZ3d1LmVkdS9icmllZmluZy1ib29rL251Y2xlYXItdmF1bHQtcnVzc2lhLXByb2dyYW1zLzIwMTYtMDktMzAvdW5pbGF0ZXJhbC11cy1udWNsZWFyLXB1bGxiYWNrLTE5OTEtbWF0Y2hlZD91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249YXRsYW50aWMtZGFpbHktbmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fY29udGVudD0yMDIyMTAwMw/6050ea994c8a1e4095020f69B6813b51a">the stroke of a pen</a>. Now, each day, I try to estimate the chances that Putin, one of the last orphans of the Soviet system, will spark a nuclear cataclysm in the name of his delusional attempt to turn the clock back 30 years. 



 As a boy in 1974, I delivered the newspaper that announced the resignation of Richard Nixon, who was driven from office in a political drama so wrenching that part of its name—Watergate—has become a suffix in our language for a scandal of any kind. Now the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination is a former president who is a walking Roman candle of racist kookery and unhinged conspiracy theories, who has defied the law with malicious glee, and who has supported mobs that wanted to kill his vice president. 
 



<p>Against all this, how can we not be overwhelmed? We stand in the middle of a flood of horrendous events, shouted down by the outsize voices of people such as Trump and his stooges, enervated and exhausted by the dark threats of dictators such as Putin. It’s just too much, especially when we already have plenty of other responsibilities, including our jobs and taking care of our loved ones. We think we are alone and helpless, because there is nothing to convince us otherwise. How can anyone fight the sense that “the center cannot hold”?</p>



<p>But we are not helpless. The center&nbsp;can&nbsp;hold—because&nbsp;we&nbsp;are the center. We are citizens of a democracy who can refuse to accept the threats of mob bosses, whether in Florida or in Russia. We can and must vote, but that’s not enough. We must also speak out. By temperament, I am not much for public demonstrations, but if that’s your preferred form of expression, then organize and march. The rest of us, however, can act, every day, on a small scale.</p>



<p>Speak up. Do not stay silent when our fellow citizens equivocate and rationalize. Defend what’s right, whether to a friend or a family member. Refuse to laugh along with the flip cynicism that makes a joke of everything. Stay informed so that the stink of a death threat from a former president or the rattle of a nuclear saber from a Russian autocrat does not simply rush past you as if you’ve just driven by a sewage plant.</p>



<p>None of this is easy to do. But we are entering a time of important choices, both at home at the ballot box and abroad on foreign battlefields, and the center—the confident and resolute defense of peace, freedom, and the rule of law—must hold.</p>



<p>*****</p>



<p>Amen.</p>

  <p>Summary: I started a new job!</p>



<p>
    I've been dark for a few weeks. Things have been busy. I'm retiring from BYU (after 29 years, albeit with some interruptions) and starting a new job with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The job is in AWS Identity, and involves automated reasoning (formal methods). <a>My Ph.D. dissertation</a> was on using <a>formal methods to verify the correctness of microprocessors</a>. So the new job combines two things I've spent a good portion of my professional life working on. I'm loving it. 
</p>

<p>
    The name of what I and the larger group (Automated Reasoning Group) are doing is "provable security." <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/"> AWS Provable Security</a> automatically generates mathematical proofs to assert universal statements about the security properties of your AWS application. For example, Access Analyzer uses automated reasoning to analyze all public and cross-account access paths to your resources and provides comprehensive analysis of those paths, making statements like "None of your S3 buckets are publicly available."
</p>

<p>
    To understand this better, and get a glimpse of where it could go, I recommend this talk from AWS re:inforce by Neha Rungta and Andrew Gacek.

<p>
    When I was doing formal methods, we dreamed of the day when automated reasoning would handle real problems for people without access to highly trained Ph.D. researchers. Now, that's possible and available in 1-click, for many problems. I'm excited to be working on it.

<p>Published by the Mobile Ecosystem Forum on <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/2022/09/29/aligning-the-3-pillars-of-the-personal-data-and-identity-marketplace/">September 29, 2022</a></p>
<p>For industry and society to function effectively, we need trust: “to have and maintain confidence in the honesty of another (an individual, system, service, or process) to meet their social, commercial and civic obligations.”. In the context of today’s digitally-driven society—with so many actors, systems, and processes in play with varying agendas—trust is hard to achieve, especially in light of the increasing sophistication, and losses as a result of cybercrime which according to one analyst are estimated to <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damages-6-trillion-by-2021/">cost the world $10.5 Trillion annually by 2025</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>To achieve trust, we must strive to align, and stay aligned, with the three personal data and identity marketplace pillars.</p>
 The Three Personal Data and Identity Marketplace Pillars 
<p>To understand the personal data and identity marketplace, it is helpful to first understand a handful of key concepts and their interplay—namely privacy, security, and compliance.</p>
 
 Privacy is a process related to an individual being in control of both their physical self (person, stewards, or property—house, cards, connected devices, etc.) and their digital self (i.e., their personal data). For an individual to have privacy they must be in a position to manage all five elements of privacy (the “5 Ws”). These are: who, what, when, where, and why. “Who” refers to the entity (e.g., another individual, enterprise, government, or machine) seeking to gain access to the individual. “What” refers to what an entity is looking to access, i.e., aspects of the individual’s physical or digital self. “When” refers to the timing of the access, i.e., when and for how long will the entity have physical or digital access to elements of the individual. “Where” refers to the location where the interaction, physical connection, or personal data exchange, will take place. 
 
<p>This could be in the real world, via mobile, in the cloud, locally on an individual’s device, etc. “Why” refers to requesting an entity’s intention and purpose for wanting access, e.g., what they are going to do with the individual’s data (and, to maintain trust, will they ensure there are no unauthorized secondary uses of the data).</p>
 
 Security, in the context of personal data and identity, refers to the state of a system or service being free from the threat of unauthorized access and ensuring all access control policies—also known as permissions and privileges—are fully operational. To put it another way, a system or service is considered secure when only authorized individuals can access it, i.e., login, and said individuals can only access content and services in accordance with the privileges bestowed upon them by the service administrator. Note: Systems and services administrators will have layers of identity management (i.e., authorization, identification, and verification) to assure, with the appropriate level of confidence (aka risk tolerance), that an individual (or at least the credentials the individual is using to access a system) is authorized and has not been compromised. 
 Compliance&nbsp;refers to the act of ensuring that all activities related to the legal (both commercial and civic) and regulatory (both industry self-regulatory and government regulatory) requirements are met by all actors involved in an exchange. 
 
<p>Two additional terms are relevant for this discussion: governance and cybersecurity.</p>
 
 Governance&nbsp;refers to the effort of providing oversight on the alignment and execution of all processes and actions necessary for adhering to compliance requirements and the delivery of services. 
 Cybersecurity&nbsp;refers to the efforts undertaken to protect a system or service from cyber-attacks. In other words, this is the effort to protect all aspects of a system (inc., data, storage, network, devices) from unauthorized access and the compromising of the system’s access and control policies so that systems processes are not overridden, systems are not physically damaged, and data is hacked or leaked. 
 
<p>The figure (Figure 1: 3 Pillars of the Personal Data and Identity Marketplace) below illustrates the interplay between these three pillars.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>Figure 1: 3 Pillars of the Personal Data and Identity Marketplace</p>
 
 Establishing and Maintaining Trust 
<p>When the three pillars of personal data and identity management are working in harmony, and continue to do so over time, all parties in a physical or digital exchange can build and maintain trust. This trust is reinforced by the interplay of the overlapping elements of the system: Faith (people have faith in systems to function properly), Ombudsman (people feel protected as there are institutions providing oversight of the systems on their behalf), and Accountability (public and private institutions are holding systems and their administrators accountable to complying to the law and regulations).</p>
<p>When any one of these pillars becomes unstable, trust is eroded, the marketplace becomes less efficient, and any number of harms can befall the various actors (individuals, private organizations, and public institutions).</p>
 Where Do We Go From Here? 
<p>Establishing and maintaining trust is paramount for a healthy society and economy. For the personal data and identity marketplace to continue to flourish, more is needed than what is depicted above.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>First, individuals, the people, need to take more personal accountability for the flow of their identity and personal data; they should not just rely on the ombudsman and faith. They should educate themselves on both the opportunities that can be generated from actively managing their data and the risks when they do not. They should learn to enact the digital rights afforded to them by the current and impending regulations. And, they should actively adopt passive and active technologies and services to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The enterprise must participate in the education and support of their constituents (aka prospects, users, customers, patients, voters, etc.), to continue to fortify their systems—which will include the adoption of emerging self-sovereign identity infrastructure, i.e., technology that will be individually in control of their data.</p>
<p>Finally, government and non-governmental bodies must become more fluent in today’s technology and continue with their efforts to help establish policies and guidelines that support and protect the agency of the individual while supporting and stimulating innovation and local, regional, federal, international, and global market competition.</p>

<p>Get ready; new and evolving personal data and identity management methods are causing a tsunami of change. In particular, two crucial areas driving change are the proper administration of the sale of age-restricted products and services and what businesses must do to responsibly and securely interact with children and other age-protected classes.</p>
<p>Do you have a view on how personal data and digital identity will evolve over the next 18-36 months, especially regarding age verification and age assurance?&nbsp;If you are working with and have insights into age verification and age assurance, we want to hear from you (message us on LinkedIn:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/privacyshaman/">Michael Becker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iaincorby/">Iain Corby</a>).</p>
<p>New Regulations and Technologies are Driving Change</p>
<p>Will big global platforms step into the market?&nbsp;Will users resist giving more personal data to the largest tech companies? Will they resist using a government-issued ID as they surf the net and interact with phygital experiences? Or will emerging people-centric approaches to identity and age verification and assurance lead the way?</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//avpassociation.com/%5D(https://avpassociation.com/)">Age Verification Providers Association (AVPA)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//mobileecosystemforum.com/personal-data-identity/%5D(https://mobileecosystemforum.com/personal-data-identity/)">Mobile Ecosystem Forum’s Personal Data &amp; Identity (PD&amp;I) Working Group</a>&nbsp;proposition is that age will be at the vanguard for digital identities execution and adoption.</p>

<p>Published by the Mobile Ecosyestem Forum&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/2022/09/22/inviting-people-to-the-table-sourcing-personal-data-from-individuals-offering-value-in-return/">September 22, 2022</a>.</p>
<p>September 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/privacyshaman/">Michael Becker</a>, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://identitypraxis.com/">Identity Praxis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/personal-data-identity/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF) PD&amp;I Working Group</a>&nbsp;Chair, held an engaging interview with Co-Founder, and CTO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyd.digital/">CYDigital</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rizzo/">John Rizzo</a>. The two delve into the inspiration behind Marteq.io, a personal information management system (PIMS) that helps brands connect and reconnect with their customers on the principles of transparency, accountability, and individual data empowerment.</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/sOoacmyVX-E">here</a>&nbsp;to see the interview on YouTube (43:15 min)</p>
<p></p>
 

 
 
 

 
<p>Marteq.io Primary Sourcing Personal Data</p>
<p></p>
 

 
 
 

 
<p>Brands are pivoting to sourcing data directly from the individual. Why? To empower individuals. Build trust. Comply with regulations. Reduce risk. And more. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyd.digital/">noted by CYDigital</a>, by 2023 brand spending on user-generated data will outpace their spending on 3rd party data.</p>
<p>Marteq.io gives people a seat at the commercial table for their data. CY Digital’s Marteq.io is both a marketing automation offer platform and PIMS, enabling brands to launch connect, communicate, conduct commerce with, and reward their prospects and customers, for sharing their data directly with the brand (a practice known as zero-party data sourcing).</p>
<p>Zero-party data helps regulate the transfer of personal data information, as the individual–the zero part–is the source of their own data. With an application and service like Marteq.io, the on-and-off switch for sharing clickstream data is now at the fingertips of the individual. This benefits both sides. Consumers can generate passive rewards by sharing their behavior with trusted brands. Brands build trust and will have access to the insights they need to personalize and serve the connected individual with personalized ads, offers, and promotions ultimately equating to increased revenues, reduced costs, and reduced regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>With Marteq.io, brands can invite consumers to share their browsing behavior and location with them, and in return, the brand can reward the individual with unique offers and promotions. What’s unique about Marteq.io, however, is that the individual is in control. Marteq.io gives people the power to securely and safely collect their desktop and mobile browsing behavior and then selectively give brands permission to access this data so that the brand can personalize their experience and offer them rewards. Again, the individual is in control. At any time, they can revoke the access permissions they’ve given a brand.</p>
<p>Side note:&nbsp;Marteq.io is not alone in this space; there are other players offering similar solutions, including dedicated browsers, mobile apps, and extensions. We’ll report on these laters.</p>
 Understanding Types of Personal Data 
<p>According to Rizzo, data can be classified into two categories declarative, and behavioral data. Rizzo notes, declarative data is collected from consumers submitting forms, and services, or sharing other interests and preferences. Whereas behavioral data is data history, e.g., sites visited, media consumed, etc.– that reflects an individual’s activities and can be used to infer their interests. Acquiring this data from the individual source can have exceptional benefits for brands. CYDigital, in one&nbsp;<a href="https://docsend.com/view/66t5an4gfwnvk6vh">study</a>, found that engaging people through Marteq led to an impressive 21% conversion rate and a 134% increase in average order value.</p>
<p>The True Value of a Consumer</p>
<p>The value of the data generated by each connected individual today is being consolidated by players like Google and Facebook. Rizzo points outs, that these firms are generating an average of $1,300-1,500 in advertising revenue from each user. Becker added to this point by sharing estimates from&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/23/opinion/data-privacy-jaron-lanier.html">Jaron Lanier,</a>&nbsp;who suggests that the annual value of an individual’s data to marketers is worth about $20,000. Using a tool like Marteq, brands increase the ROI of their marketing spend by redirecting to the individual.</p>
<p>Marteq.io December 2021 Adoption Study Results</p>
<p></p>
 

 
 
 

 
<p>In 2021, with Resondi, CYDigial conducted a&nbsp;<a href="https://docsend.com/view/xiajehdne7722rsw">Marteq.io adoption study</a>&nbsp;with a group of 25,000 UK adults. They found that people are absolutely willing to share data with brands in return for value, and not just a few people: 74.7% of the people exposed to the study’s message of empowerment around data downloaded the Marteq.io browser extension. Of those 62.6% activated their account, and 55.6% explicitly turned on data sharing. In the end, over 26% of the audience became active users of Marteq.io.</p>
<p>These results are backed up by other industry&nbsp;<a href="https://docsend.com/view/66t5an4gfwnvk6vh">research</a>&nbsp;which suggests that people are ready and willing to share data when they are empowered and given the right offer. 89% of people are willing to share data with those they trust and for value. 71% are willing to share personal information about their likes, preferences, needs, etc. for better recommendations for their needs, and 26% are likely to share their personal information. The skepticism lies in what exactly is being done with my data, but once consumers are aware they’re more likely to give companies their desired information.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>CYDigital’s values will last the test of time because unlike other companies Marteq.io intrusts personal data only to be handled by the software. The past has shown humans having access to data has caused many problems in terms of trust and control. Marteq.io and other PIMS will be the future of personal data collection. Marteq is an example for others to follow. Valuing the consumer brings benefits for all.</p>

<p>My business partner at <a href="http://digitaltrust.vc">Digital Trust Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-m-smith/">Dr. Samuel Smith</a>, happens to be the smartest human I’ve met, and through my line of work I’ve been fortunate to meet some smart&nbsp;ones.</p><p>In an email exchange during the last 72 hours, Sam opined about the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech">McKinsey Technology Trends Report for 2022</a> (the full report), which strongly touts both self-sovereign identity (SSI) — which I now believe should be considered as part of <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/what-is-web5-fb34f48d0b1b">Web5</a> — and <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">zero trust architecture</a> (ZTA). As happens often, I found Sam’s private comments insightful, but this time so much so that I’m making them immediately public, with his permission.</p><p>I’ve not changed a word, other than adding [Web5] and emphasis where appropriate.</p><blockquote>I think a useful insight with regards the McKinsey report is that the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">GLEIF vLEI</a> is leveraging a zero trust architecture (ZTA) to provide digital identity. This means that the benefits of both trends are realized in the vLEI. Moreover, once an enterprise adopts a ZTA for digital identity, using ZTA for adjacent functions to digital identity becomes easier. Indeed, fully decentralized ZTAs fall short unless they include a zero trust digital identity system as the basis for verification (which verification is essential to the function of ZTA). The two go hand-in-glove.</blockquote><blockquote>All forms of zero trust require some form of access control which in turn requires some form of digital identity. But centralized digital identity has large trust surfaces (things that must be trusted and therefore can’t be verified). But truly fully end-verifiable zero trust is the gold standard for ZTA and end-verifiable is largely incompatible with anything but decentralized digital identity. Decentralized digital identity makes zero trust more secure because it both increases the surface of what can be verified and decreases the surface of what must be trusted without verification.</blockquote><blockquote>Autonomous control over data and relationships [Web5] is best enabled by end-verifiable mechanisms where the parties involved in any interaction are enabled to choose their trust surfaces and trust anchors. GLEIF is an end-verifiable trust anchor. GLEIF vLEI credentials enable a party to an interaction to present trustworthy end-verifiable artifacts (AKA vLEIs) to bootstrap trust in a decentralized way.</blockquote><blockquote>Decentralized means control is diffuse. Control structures are distributed amongst parties. Autonomous control means each party picks its control structure. If my identifiers are portable across platforms and I get to pick what trust anchors I trust then I have a high degree of autonomous control. Each side of an interaction/transaction gets to decide what they will trust and what they will not trust without verification. The transaction is not finalized until both sides are satisfied with the other side’s trustworthiness according to each’s own criteria for sufficient trustworthiness.</blockquote><blockquote>I guess what I am saying is that ZTAs all require digital identity but end-verifiable digital identity requires a ZTA. But not all forms of digital identity require&nbsp;ZTAs.</blockquote><p>If you’re like most people, you might want (or need) to read what Sam writes at least twice, slowly. My opinion: Sam Smith is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">TBL</a> of “the authentic web”, and I believe his short missive above contains some critical insights about the surprisingly strong relationship between Web5, decentralization, and the globally recognized gold standard of cybersecurity, zero trust architecture.</p><p>Sam’s insights are worth paying close attention to. For those who don’t know, here’s a bit about Sam’s accomplishments in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>Sam is the originator of the blockchain-based issue-hold-verify model that the SSI/Web5 industry now embraces. Evernym hired Sam as a consultant in 2015, having discovered him from his early 2015 paper, <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/open-reputation-low-level-whitepaper.pdf">Open Reputation</a>. At the time he was the only one we could find who was talking (writing) smartly about how blockchain might be used for identity, and he happened to live 30 minutes&nbsp;away.</p><p>Sam and Jason Law, my co-founder at <a href="http://evernym.com">Evernym</a>, soon figured out how to “give people their stuff” through the use of digital wallets, rather than “put it on the blockchain” as everyone else was doing at the time (some still do!). Sam authored <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/Identity-System-Essentials.pdf">Identity System Essentials</a> along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khovratovich/">Dmitry Khovratovich</a>, a world-class cryptographer we’d engaged, and the issue-hold-verify model using blockchain was born, resulting in <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin</a>, with Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a>, and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Ursa</a> under the&nbsp;hood.</p><p>But that impressive innovation pales in comparison to what he’s invented since with <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI_Overview.web.pdf">KERI</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mO1EZa9BcjAjWEzw7DWi124uMfyNyDeM3HuajsGNoTo/edit#slide=id.g124effd16ae_0_164">ACDCs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/CESR_Overview.web.pdf">CESR</a> and more: making SSI possible (and better) without blockchain (KERI); solving decentralized (and centralized) key management by solving the key rotation dilemma (KERI); making verifiable credentials chain-able, highly secure, and ultra lightweight to implement (ACDCs); making event streaming ultra-compact and switchable between text and binary without sacrificing security (CESR); and&nbsp;more.</p><p>My advice: if you’re interested in digital trust, ZTA, digital identity, and all things Web5, when Sam writes or speaks: listen, learn, and act accordingly, and you’ll end up toward the front of this train rather than the caboose. His written and oral communication is often thick and technical, but hang in there and let us know what needs better ‘translation’ to simpler language, and we’ll do our&nbsp;best.</p><p>This short post is just a taste of what’s to come on these rich topics. We’ll be writing (and podcasting) much more about zero trust, the vLEI, and of course Web5 over the coming weeks and months, so stay&nbsp;tuned.</p>

<p>I can read much faster than I can listen, so I rarely listen to podcasts when I’m at home with screens on which to read. Instead I listen on long hikes when I want to shift gears, slow down, and absorb spoken words. Invariably some of those words strike me as particularly interesting, and I want to capture them. Yesterday, what stuck was these words from a <a href="https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/programs/muhammad-ali-discusses-his-book-greatest-my-own-story">1975 Studs Terkel interview with Muhammad Ali</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everybody’s watching me. I was rich. The world saw me, I had lawyers to fight it, I was getting credit for being a strong man. So that didn’t really mean nothing. What about, I admire the man that had to go to jail named Joe Brown or Sam Jones, who don’t nobody know who’s in the cell, you understand? Doing his time, he got no lawyers’ fees to pay. And when he get out, he won’t be praised for taking a stand. So he’s really stronger than me. I had the world watching me. I ain’t so great. I didn’t do nothing that’s so great. What about the little man don’t nobody know? He’s really the one.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I heard these words on an episode of <a href="https://radioopensource.org/sound-of-studs-terkel/">Radio OpenSource</a> about the <a href="https://studsterkel.wfmt.com">Studs Terkel Radio Archive</a>, an extraordinary compilation of (so far) about a third of his 5600 hours of interviews with nearly every notable person during the latter half of the twentieth century. </p>
<p>If you weren’t aware of him, the Radio OpenSource episode, entitled Studs Terkel’s Feeling Tone, is the perfect introduction. And it’s delightful to hear one great interviewer, Chris Lydon, discuss with his panel of experts the interviewing style of perhaps the greatest interviewer ever.</p>
<p>Because I’d heard Muhammad Ali’s words on Radio OpenSource, I could have captured them in the usual way. I always remember where I was when I heard a segment of interest. If that was 2/3 of the way through my hike, I’ll find the audio at the 2/3 mark on the timeline. I made a <a href="https://jonudell.info/av">tool</a> to help me capture and share a link to that segment, but it’s a clumsy solution.</p>
<p>What you’d really rather do is search for the words in a transcript, select surrounding context, use that selection to define an audio segment, and share a link to both text and audio. That’s exactly what I did to produce this <a href="https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/remixer?r=17006:1149.28,1181.49&amp;a=17006:EverWatcMe,RealTheOne">powerful link</a>, courtesy of WFMT’s brilliant remixer, which captures both the written words I quoted above and the spoken words synced to them.</p>
<p>That’s a dream come true. Thank you! It’s so wonderful that I hesitate to ask, but … WFMT, can you please make the archive downloadable? I would listen to a lot of those interviews if I could put them in my pocket and take them with me on hikes. Then I could use your remixer to help curate the archive. </p>

The Purpose is not wrong, but How is an interesting take on data ownership.&nbsp; Facebook's Purpose is “To connect every person in the world.”&nbsp; It does this by using your data to manipulate you and your network. The Purpose is not wrong, but How Facebook does it is an interesting take on control and the distribution of value?</p><p>Reviewing the world's top businesses' mission/ purpose statement, we will conclude that “in general, “purpose is good.”&nbsp; When we question “How” the purpose is implemented, we shine a light on the incentives, motivations and methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“How” provides insights into the means; however, we should not be too quick to judge how. Consider The Suffragette mission, Climate Change movements or Anti-Apartheid.&nbsp; Sometimes “how” is left with fewer choices or options?</p><p>Apple’s Purpose is “To bring the best personal computing experience to students, educators, creative professionals, and consumers around the world through its innovative hardware, software, and internet offerings.” How Apple does this is to make you dependent on them, their products, and their services.&nbsp; Apple now positions their devices <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/9/23344306/apple-watch-series-8-emergency-health-heart-monitor">(iwatch)</a>, meaning you might not make it out alive without one. &nbsp; The “How” is to exploit via lock-in users without them realising (they are not alone.)&nbsp;</p> We should question what Principles “How” aligns to <p>In political systems we see structural tensions. &nbsp; Different sides of political systems don’t demand worse security, degrading healthcare, more poverty or less education.&nbsp; Fundamentally everyones similar purpose is a better society for all and that is broadly accepted, however #how individuals believe a policy can be delivered creates tension, fractions and division.&nbsp; Along with the allocation and priority of resources created by scarcity. #decisions</p><p></p><p>The Peak Paradox framework positions different ideological purposes to expose the conflicts that we all face as we cannot optimise for one thing at the exclusion of others, but we have to find our place where we feel at peace, and even better if we can find a team who also find rest within the same compromises.&nbsp; That does not mean we have to agree or not be challenged, as the world will throw enough of those.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Take Away</p><p>As you move towards making decisions, the decisions become about details to realise your balanced purpose. The HOW implementation decisions need to align with principles, and this is where we see the gaps.&nbsp; The gap is not in the purpose but in the misalignment of the implementation to principles that we believe in if we were asked to deliver the purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>If we were asked to deliver the purpose, a gap appears at the misalignment of the implementation to principles between what we believe in and what others align to.</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

<p>Last week I published “<a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/web3-web5-ssi-3870c298c7b4">Web3, Web5, &amp; SSI</a>” which argued “why the SSI community should escape Web3 and follow Jack Dorsey and Block into a Web5 big tent, with a common singular goal: the autonomous control of authentic data and relationships”.</p><p>In this short post I’m proposing a definition for Web5 and providing an example list of Web5 Technologies that I think satisfy the definition. There is no naming authority to appeal to for WebX definitions, they materialize from how they’re used, so since Web5 is still quite new, a lasting definition is still to be determined (pun intended).</p> TBD’s Definition of&nbsp;Web5 <p>I should first give credit where it is due: the <a href="https://www.tbd.website/">TBD</a> initiative at Block, headed up by Daniel Buchner and initiated by Jack Dorsey, coined the term Web5. On the <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/">front page</a> of their website introducing Web5 to the world, here is how they define&nbsp;it:</p><blockquote>WEB5: AN EXTRA DECENTRALIZED WEB&nbsp;PLATFORM</blockquote><blockquote>Building an extra decentralized web that puts you in control of your data and identity.</blockquote><p>All true and all good, but I would aim for a definition that captures more of the desired results of Web5, not its implementation methods. To me, “an extra decentralized web” is foundational to Web5 but it is a means, not an end. The word and principle “decentralize” is a means toward the end of greater empowerment of individuals.</p><p>The phrase “puts you in control of your data and identity” is accurate and speaks to that empowerment, but IMO is lacking crucial references to “authenticity” and “relationships” that I think are equally important for the reasons explained in the next&nbsp;section.</p><p>Kudos to the TBD team for the phrase “data and identity”, because I also believe Web5 is about all authentic data, not just identity data. (In last week’s piece there’s a section titled “It’s Not Just About Identity” that elaborates on this&nbsp;point.)</p> My Proposed Definition of&nbsp;Web5 <p>After discussion with dozens of SSI pros (listed in last week’s <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/web3-web5-ssi-3870c298c7b4">post</a>), I’ve discovered a surprising amount of agreement — though not unanimity — with this proposed definition for&nbsp;Web5:</p><blockquote>The autonomous control of authentic data and relationships.</blockquote><p>It’s not perfect. It’s too long for some uses, too short for others, and undoubtedly some will take issue with my word choices (and already have). Sometimes there’s just not enough words in the dictionary for all this new tech, but I think this definition captures the key desired objectives of Web5 and meaningfully separates us from all other&nbsp;“Webs”.</p><p>Each word was chosen carefully for its depth, accuracy, and importance:</p><p>“<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/autonomous">Autonomous</a>” has a hint of “self-sovereign” but with more of an air of neutrality and independence than authority or defiance. It is accurate while less provocative than “self-sovereign”. It implies decentralization without using the word (which is also a tad provocative). It works well for IoT applications. Critically, autonomy is the element that makes it difficult for big tech platforms to be part of Web5, at least until they allow users to migrate their data and their relationships away to competing platforms.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/control">Control</a>” is also a neutral but accurate term, and important that those in the decentralization camp begin to use in place of “own” when referring to “our” data. Data ownership is a trickier topic than most realize, as expertly explained by Elizabeth Renieris in <a href="https://medium.com/@hackylawyER/do-we-really-want-to-sell-ourselves-the-risks-of-a-property-law-paradigm-for-data-ownership-b217e42edffa">this piece</a>¹. Having “control” in a Web5 context implies a right to control, regardless of where lines of literal ‘ownership’ may be drawn. When coupled with “autonomous”, “control” can be exercised without the invited involvement of or interference from third parties, which is precisely what’s intended. “Control” also means the power to delegate authority and/or tasks to other people, organizations and things, and to revoke delegation when&nbsp;desired.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/authentic">Authentic</a>” We simply cannot achieve the aim of individual autonomy without verifiable authenticity of our data and relationships, indeed it is that authenticity that can break the chains of our current captivity to Web2. The intermediaries of Web2 and even Web3 provide the trust mechanisms — within their walled gardens — that enable digital interactions to proceed. Without a comparable or superior means of authenticating data and relationships when interacting peer-to-peer, we’ll not be able to escape the confines of these ‘trusted’ intermediaries.</p><p>I propose that, in the context of Web5, the word “authentic” always means two&nbsp;things:</p><p>1. having verifiable provenance (who issued/signed it);</p><p>2. having verifiable integrity (it hasn’t been altered, revoked, or expired).</p><p>When a piece of data is authentic, I know who issued/signed it and I know it is still valid. Whether I choose to trust the signer and what I do with the signed content — it could be untrue, not useful, or gibberish — are separate, secondary decisions.</p><p>Authentic relationships are similar to data: I know who (or what) is on the other side of a connection and I know that my connection to them/it is still&nbsp;valid.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/data">Data</a>” conveys that we’re referring to digital things, not physical (though physical things will increasingly have their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin">digital twins</a>). With Web5 all data of import can be digitally, non-repudiably signed both in transit and at rest. Every person, organization and thing can digitally sign and every person, organization and thing can verify what others have signed. It’s ubiquitous Zero Trust computing. For privacy purposes, all the capabilities invented in the SSI community still apply: pseudonymity, pairwise relationships, and selective disclosure can minimize correlatability when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/relationship">Relationships</a>” means the secure, direct, digital connections between people, organizations, and things. Autonomous relationships are the ‘sleeper’ element of Web5, the thing that seems simple and innocuous at first glance but in time becomes most important of all. Authentic autonomous relationships will finally free people, organizations and things from the captivity of big tech platforms. (I’m working on a separate piece dedicated to Web5-enabled autonomous relationships, it’s an oxymoronic mind-bender and a very exciting topic for SSI enthusiasts).</p> Web5 Technologies <p>I originally grouped this list by tech stack (Ion, Aries, KERI, etc.), but since several items were used by more than one stack (VCs, DIDs, etc.), it’s now simply alphabetical.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri/blob/main/draft-ssmith-keri.md">Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs)</a></p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mO1EZa9BcjAjWEzw7DWi124uMfyNyDeM3HuajsGNoTo/edit#slide=id.g124effd16ae_0_164">Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs)</a></p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/crypto.html">BBS+ Signatures</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-cesr-00.html">Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR)</a></p><p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a></p><p><a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5/">Decentralized Web Apps&nbsp;(DWAs)</a></p><p><a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5/">Decentralized Web Nodes&nbsp;(DWNs)</a></p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SaHGyY9TjPg4a0VNLCsfchoVG1yU3ffTDsPRcU99H1E/edit#slide=id.g11d24dbeb84_0_7">Decentralized Web Platform&nbsp;(DWP)</a></p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">GLEIF Verifiable LEI&nbsp;(vLEI)</a></p><p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a></p><p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a></p><p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a></p><p><a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-keri/draft-ssmith-keri.html">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/out-of-band-introduction">Out-of-band Introduction (OOBI)</a></p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">Sidetree/Ion</a></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-soulbound-tokens-the-non-transferrable-nft-explained/">Soulbound Tokens&nbsp;(SBTs)</a></p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Universal Resolver</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a></p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallets</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero Knowledge Proofs&nbsp;(ZKPs)</a></p><p>Some of these things are not like the others, and the list is only representative, not exhaustive. The point is, each of these technologies exists to pursue some aspect of the endgame of autonomous control of authentic data and relationships.</p> What About Blockchain? <p>Blockchain can enable “autonomous control of authentic data and relationships”, which is why we used it when we conceived and wrote Hyperledger Indy, Aries, and Ursa and built <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>. Blockchain underpins most of the Web5 Technologies listed above, so it certainly has its place within Web5. That said, with Web3 — which I define as the decentralized transfer of value — blockchain technology is required due to its double-spend proof and immutability characteristics, whereas with Web5 blockchain is useful, but not required. Therefore, I consider blockchain to be primarily a Web3 technology because Web3 couldn’t exist without&nbsp;it.</p> It’s Up to&nbsp;You <p>Anyone who reads my last piece and this one will get the clear feeling that I like both the label and vision of Web5, and my affinity for it has only grown as I write about and use it in conversation. It just works well in conveying a nice grouping of all these abstract concepts, and in ways that the comparable mess of prior terms did&nbsp;not.</p><p>But it won’t go anywhere if TBD and I are the only ones using it, it needs to catch on to be used, and be used to catch on. If you like the basic definition I’ve proposed above, even with a tweak or two, I invite you to consider using “Web5” to describe your activities in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>¹When a doctor writes down a note about my condition, who ‘owns’ that note… me, the doctor, or the hospital who employs the doctor? The fact is that all three have rights to the data; no party singly ‘owns’&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>With the help of a few kind folks, we've made some updates to the OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps draft as discussed during the last IETF meeting in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>You can find the current version, draft 11, here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps-11.html">https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps-11.html</a></p>

<p>The major changes in this version are adding two new architecture patterns, the "Token Mediating Backend" pattern based on the TMI-BFF draft, and the "Service Worker" pattern of using a Service Worker as the OAuth client. I've also done a fair amount of rearranging of various parts of the document to hopefully make more sense.</p>

<p>Obviously there is no clear winner in terms of which architecture pattern is best, so instead of trying to make a blanket recommendation, the goal of this draft is to document the pros and cons of each. If you have any input into either benefits or drawbacks that aren't mentioned yet in any of the patterns discussed, please feel free to chime in so we can add them to the document! You're welcome to either <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/oauth">reply on the list</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-browser-based-apps/issues">open an issue on the GitHub repository</a>, or contact me directly. Keep in mind that only comments on the mailing list are part of the official record.</p>

   <p>I am aware that a human limitation is our understanding of time.&nbsp; Time itself is something that humans have created to help us comprehend the rules that govern us.&nbsp; Whilst society is exceptionally good at managing short-time frames (next minute, hour, day and week),&nbsp; it is well established that humans are very bad at comprehending longer time frames (decades, centuries and millenniums).&nbsp; Humans are proficient at overestimating what we can do in the next year and wildly under-estimate what we can achieve in 10 years.&nbsp; (Gates Law)</p><p>Therefore, I know there is a problem when we consider how we should value the next 50,000 years.&nbsp; However, we are left with fewer short-terms options each year and are left to consider longer and bigger - the very thing we are less capable of.&nbsp;</p><p>Why 50,000 years</p><p>The orange circle below represents the 6.75 trillion people (UN figure) who will be born in the next 50,000 years.&nbsp; The small grey circle represents the 100 billion dead who have already lived on earth in the past 50,000 years.&nbsp; The living today is 7.7 billion, the small dot between the grey and orange.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 100 billion dead lived on a small blue planet (below), which we have dug up, cut down, moved, built and created waste - in about equal measures.&nbsp; These activities have been the foundation of our economy and how we have created wealth thus far.&nbsp; We realise, in hindsight, that our activities have not always been done in a long-term sustainable way.&nbsp; Susutainble here should be interrupted as the avoidance of the depletion of natural resources in order to maintain an ecological balance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Should we wish for future generations also to enjoy the small blue planet, a wealth or value calculation based on time will not shift the current economic model. We need to move the existing financial model based on exploiting "free" resources to new models focused on rewarding reuse and renovation; how we use<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/if-one-number-decides-your-fate-what-should-you-know-about-that-number-3585197996a6"> discount rates</a> as a primary function for justifying financial decisions works in the short term but increasingly looks broken because it does not support long-term sustainability thinking as part of any justification.&nbsp; Time breaks the simplicity of the decision.</p><p>Therefore, we appear to face a choice; that can be summarised as follows:</p><p>If we frame #esg and #climate in the language of money and finance, the obvious question is how do we value the next 50,000 years, as this would change how we calculate value - in the hope that it would move the dial in terms of investment.&nbsp; We need to upgrade the existing tools to keep them relevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If we frame #esg, #climate and our role in caring for our habitat as a circular economy (a wicked problem) and not a highly efficient/ effective finance-driven supply chain, we need a different way to calculate value over time economically.</p> Should we search for the obvious over wicked complexity? <p>Many deeply intellectual and highly skilled disciplines instinctively favour complex explanations that make their voice sound more valuable and clever. (Accounting, AI, Quantum Physics, Data Analysts, Statisticians, human behaviours). A better solution may lie in something seemingly obvious or trivial, which is therefore perceived to have less value in the eyes of the experts. &nbsp; We can make #ESG and ecosystem thinking very complex, very quickly, but should we rather be asking better questions?&nbsp;</p><p>We know that better science and more data will not resolve the debate.<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/being-curious-will-not-kill-the-cdo-c7b30446add5"> When we use data and science in our arguments and explain the problem, individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the best insights and ideas are obvious, but only in retrospect as they have been pointed out, like the apocryphal story of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_of_Columbus">The Egg of Columbus</a>". Once revealed, they seem self-evident or absurdly simplistic, but that does not prevent their significance from being widely overlooked for years.&nbsp;</p> Can data lead to better humanity? <p>We are (currently) fixated on data, but "data'' has morphed from "useful information" to refer to that unrepresentative informational lake which happens to have a numerical expression for everything and hence capable of aggregation and manipulation into a model that predicts whatever outcome you want.&nbsp; It is very clever, as are the people who manage and propagate it.&nbsp;</p><p>ESG, climate and the valuation of nature has become "data" - hoping it will improve decision-making and outcomes.&nbsp; Using data, we have already been able to put a value on most of our available natural resources, including human life (life insurance). Whilst we can value risk and price in uncertainty, we have not found or agreed on how to measure or value "the quality of life".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, businesses can only decide based on their data and financial skills.&nbsp; This makes leadership look cleaver and capable in the eyes of an economist, but we are at risk of acting dumb in the eyes of an ecologist, anthropologist and biologist. Reliance on data can make you blind to the obvious. Jeff Bezos commented, "When the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right".&nbsp; Our climate challenge might not be about data but reframing to make the obvious - well, obvious. Perhaps we should stop asking leadership to decide everything based on data or value and instead demand they care for our natural world if it was their only job!</p><p>Perhaps we should stop asking leadership to decide everything based on data or value and instead demand they care for our natural world if it was their only job!</p><p>Imagine two models; in the first, you have one pen for life, and in the second, you have a new pen for every event.&nbsp; One model supports "growth", and the other a more sustainable ecology.&nbsp; One helps support secondary markets such as a gift economy and can make an individual feel valued.&nbsp; The other is a utility, where the pen has no instinct economic value beyond function but has an unmeasurable sentimental value.&nbsp;</p><p>If the framing is growth and profitability, then the former model appeals to investors as there is a growing demand for more pens.&nbsp; This also drives innovation and differentiation, and so emerges an entire pen industry.&nbsp; (<a href="https://youtu.be/KGwMECZNjJA">telegraph road - dire straits</a>) Employment and opportunity are abundant, but so is the consumption of the earth's resources, and no one cares if a pen is lost or thrown away.&nbsp; Related industries benefit from gifts to delivery - a thriving, interconnected economy.&nbsp;</p><p>If the framing is for a sustainable ecology, pens are just a means for an entire ecosystem to develop. One pen for life means it is maintained, treasured and repaired.&nbsp; There is no growth in the market, and innovation is hard; there are few suppliers with cartel-type controls.&nbsp; Transparency and costs might not be a priority.&nbsp; However, if those who made the pens could also benefit from the content/ value/ wealth created by the pen, such that the pen is no longer stand-alone but tiny incremental payments over life - everything changes.&nbsp; Value is created by what people do with the pen, not the pen itself. Pick axes in the wild west railways is a well-documented example, what would have happened if they were given a percentage of train ticket prices?&nbsp;</p><p>Where does this shine a light?</p><p>It appears that decision-making and the tools we need for a "sustainable" age are different from what we have today.&nbsp; First, we need to ask questions to realise the tools we have are broken; however, all our biases prevent us from asking questions we don't want the answer to.</p><p>Below are five typical questions we often utilise as aids to improve decision-making. What the commentary after each question suggests if that our framing means we don't ask the right questions, even though we are taught these are the right questions.</p><p>Have I considered all of the options or choices? Too often, we assume that there are no additional alternatives and, therefore, the decision has to be made from the choices you have right now.&nbsp; We also discount alternatives that appear more difficult. If the choice we want is available, we ignore others.&nbsp;</p><p>Do I have evidence from the past that could help me make an informed decision?&nbsp; We will never change if we depend on history because we reinforce past experiences as conformational guidance and reassurance.</p><p>Will I align with this decision in the future? To answer this, you need to have imagined and articulated your future and then tested it to check that it is still valid with how others see a future.&nbsp; It is far too easy to make wild assumptions and live a fantasy. &nbsp; How you see the future might be wildly different from those, you need support from to be able to deliver the future.&nbsp;</p><p>What does this decision require from me right now?&nbsp; This is a defence question to try and find the route of least resistance and lowest energy.&nbsp; We use this as a way to justify efficiency and effectiveness over efficacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Is this a decision or a judgement?&nbsp; We find some facts and data are preferable to a route we find too hard, so we ignore them and say it is a judgement call or a gut feeling.&nbsp; When data shows us a path we don't like, we tend to find reasons to take the path we want.&nbsp; (re-read that Jeff Bezos quote above)&nbsp;</p><p>These simple questions highlight that we have significant built-in path dependency, which makes asking new questions and seeing the limitation of our existing tools hard.&nbsp; A wicked problem emerges because our existing tools and questions largely frame outcomes to remain the same.&nbsp;</p><p>It follows that purpose should bound strategy, and both should frame structure.&nbsp; Without purpose, strategy is just a list of tasks and activities; determining what you do leads to a better outcome is somewhat impossible. &nbsp;We obviously value time, as it frames our strategy, outcomes and incentives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore the question to comment on is, "how should we measure the quality of life today, and how will our measures change over the next 100 years?"</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>Now that I’m not involved in DIDs and VCs full time, I tend not to find myself engaging with this space as much, but I definitely want to call <a href="https://identitywoman.net/being-real-about-hyperledger-indy-aries-anoncreds/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">this essay</a> at as a MUST read for those exploring the SSI space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya IdentityWoman Young</a> has really taken the time to break down the nuances of a very technical conversation and distill it to non technical readers in a honest and fair assessment of Hyperledger Indy, Aries, and more specifically Anoncreds.</p>

<p>I know and have been heavily involved with many of the people who have driven this work forward for years. When I was at Evernym I had the privilege of helping to build out the Aries stack and get that project running. I also, spent a small portion of time working on the token that was meant to be launched for the Sovrin network. I have a massive amount of respect for the work and commitment put in by various leaders in this portion of the community. Without their hard work to spread the word, spend millions of investment on shipping code, and drive the standards forward the SSI community wouldn’t exist in the form it does today.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I think it’s important that these points are raised so that good discussion of progress can occur. Some aspects of the Hyperledger SSI stack are useful and will exist in more useful forms than others. For example, the Sovrin ledger has been a well known implementation of SSI that has struggled in the past and with the immense amount of time and effort that ledger is now in a much better state compared to when I worked at Evernym. I’ve witnessed many of the changes, discussions, and late night efforts by many people to keep the Indy node codebase working in production and they’ve done an amazing job at it. It’s only when I started to take a step back that I realized that the architecture of Indy being a private, permissioned ledger leaves it heading in the same direction as many large corporations now extinct browser and intranet projects for many of the same reasons. Private networks lead to expensive costs that are hard to maintain (read expensive) and the means to maintain them often time don’t outweigh the value they create. It’s only through sharing in an open network that we can leverage economies of scales to make the value outweigh the costs because they become shared. That’s why the internet has filled the space where the corporate intranets have failed.</p>

<p>With respect to Anoncreds, there’s been some incredibly well intentioned desires to deploy private and secure solutions for VCs that can be enforced by cryptography. This was the original reason why CL-Signatures were chosen to my knowledge and it remains one of the most motivating factor for that community. They truly believe that privacy is a first class feature of any SSI system and I 100% agree with the principle, but not the method chosen (anymore - at one point I thought it was the best approach but with time comes wisdom). Privacy erosions aren’t going to happen because selective disclosure wasn’t enabled by the signature scheme chosen. They’re going to happen at the legal layer where terms of service and business risk is evaluated and enforced. The classic example of presenting a driver’s license to prove you’re over 21 is a perfect example of this. Sure, I could share only that I’m over 21 and that I had the driver’s license issued by a valid issuer. However, this opens up the possibility that I could be presenting someone elses credential so I also need to present additional correlatable information (such as a photo or a name) to prove I am the person who the credential was intended for. This is because authentication is inherently a correlatable event where with a greater correlation of information the risk of a false positive (e.g. authenticating the wrong person) are reduced. So, for businesses who are trying to validate a driver’s license they are naturally going to trend towards requiring a greater amount of information to reduce their legal risks. The same issues are even more pervasive in the KYC space. So, in my opinion selective disclosure is a useful optimization tool to assist, but it’s only with proper differential privacy analysis of the information gathered, legal enforcement and insurance to offset costs of risk that we’ll achieve better privacy with these systems.</p>

<p>All in all, I think this is an important discussion to be brought up. Especially as the VC v2 work begins underway and explores where it’s important to converge the options between a variety of different deployed systems. There’s bound to be tough discussions with some defenses resting on sunk costs fallacies, but for the best of the SSI community I think these things need to be discussed openly. It’s only when we start having the truly hard discussions about deciding what optional features and branches of code and specs can be cut that we can start to converge on an interoperable solution that’s useful for globally. Thank you Kaliya for resurfacing this discussion to a more public place!</p>

<p>Why the SSI community should escape Web3 and follow Jack Dorsey and Block into a Web5 big tent, with a common singular goal: the autonomous control of authentic data and relationships.</p> TL;DR   As a ten-year veteran of the SSI space, my initial reaction to Jack Dorsey’s (Block’s) announcement of <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1535314738078486533">Web5</a> — which is purely SSI tech — was allergic.  After further thought and discussion with SSI pros, I now see Web5 as an opportunity to improve adoption for all of SSI and Verifiable Credentials, not just for&nbsp;Block.  SSI adoption would benefit by separating from two things: 1. the controversies of Web3 (cryptocurrency, smart contracts, NFTs, Defi, blockchain); 2. the term “self-sovereign identity”.  Let ‘crypto’ have the “Web3” designation.  SSI will be bigger than crypto/Web3 anyway and deserves its own ‘WebX’&nbsp;bucket.  Web5 can be that bucket, bringing all SSI stacks — Ion, Aries, KERI, etc. — into one big&nbsp;tent.  Web5 should be about “autonomous control of authentic data and relationships” and it should welcome any and all technical approaches that aim for that&nbsp;goal.  I think a strong, inclusive and unifying designation is “Web5 technologies”.  I love the principle of self-sovereignty and will continue to use the term SSI in appropriate conversations, but will begin to use Web5 by default. I invite others to do the&nbsp;same.   Web5 Resistance <p>Jack Dorsey, of Twitter and Block (formerly Square) fame, has recently introduced to the world what he calls <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/">Web5</a>, which he <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1535314738078486533">predicts</a> will be “his most important contribution to the internet”. Web5 appears to be purely about SSI, and Dorsey’s favored approach to it. He leaves Web3 focused on crypto — cryptocurrencies, NFTs, Defi, etc. — and nothing more. Web5 separates SSI and verifiable credentials into their own, new bucket, along with the personal datastores and decentralized apps individuals will need to use&nbsp;them.</p><p>Sounds okay, but when I first heard about Web5 I had a rather allergic reaction…</p><p>Where’s Web4?</p><p>Isn’t SSI already part of Web3? What’s wrong with Web3, that SSI isn’t/shouldn’t be part of&nbsp;it?</p><p>The initial Web5 material is too centered around Block and their favored technical approach…</p><p>Web5 just sounds like a rebranding/marketing ploy for the <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">BlueSky</a> project Jack launched at&nbsp;Twitter…</p><p>And so on. I’ve since learned the thinking behind skipping Web4: Web2 + Web3 = Web5 (duh), but that question was the least of my concerns.</p><p>As I began to write this piece in a rather critical fashion, my desire to have a ‘<a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1477402781019525123?s=20&amp;t=X0xG2ERSlu4fhdbVwheMAA">Scout Mindset</a>’ kicked in and I started to think about Web5 in a new light. I floated my new perspectives by several people I respect greatly, including Sam Smith (DTV); Stephan Wolf (CEO of GLEIF); Daniel Hardman and Randy Warshaw (Provenant); Nick Ris, Jamie Smith, Richard Esplin and Drummond Reed (Avast); James Monaghan; Dr. Phil Windley; Doc and Joyce Searls; Nicky Hickman; Karyl Fowler and Orie Steele (Transmute); Riley Hughes (Trinsic); Andre Kudra (esatus); Dan Gisolfi (Discover); Fraser Edwards (cheqd); the verifiable credentials team at Salesforce; and dozens of fine folks at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>. Everyone seemed to nod heads in agreement with my key points — especially about the need for separation from the controversies of Web3 — without poking any meaningful holes. I also confirmed a few things with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbuchner/">Daniel Buchner</a>, the SSI pro Jack nabbed from Microsoft who leads the Block team that conceived the Web5 moniker, just to be sure I wasn’t missing anything significant.</p><p>The result is this post, and though it’s not what I originally intended — a takedown of Web5 — it presents something far more important: an opportunity for all SSI communities and technologies to remove major impediments to adoption and to unify around a clear, singular goal: the autonomous control of authentic data and relationships.</p> Controversies Inhibiting SSI&nbsp;Adoption <p>While I disagree with some of the specifics of Block’s announced Web5 technical approach to SSI, I really liked how they’d made a clean separation from two different controversies that I think have bogged down SSI adoption for&nbsp;years…</p> Controversy #1:&nbsp;“Crypto” <p>By “crypto” I mean all the new tech in the cryptocurrency (not cryptography) space: cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, NFTs, Defi, and… blockchain.</p><p>To be sure, what Satoshi Nakamato ushered in with his/her/their 2008 bitcoin white paper has changed the world forever. The tech is extraordinary and the concepts are liberating and intoxicating, there’s no doubt about that. But there is doubt about how far crypto could or should go in its current form, and about what threats it represents to security, both monetary and cyber, and the overall economic order of&nbsp;things.</p><p>I’m not arguing those points one way or the other, but I am asserting that cryptocurrency remains <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/three-arrows-capital-kyle-davies-su-zhu-crash.html">highly controversial</a> and NFTs and ‘Defi’ <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">are comparably so</a>. Even the underlying blockchain technology, once the darling of forward-thinking enterprises and governments the world over, has quietly fallen out of favor with many of those same institutions. IBM, which <a href="https://w2.darkreading.com/security-management/ibms-ginni-rometty-were-the-blockchain-and-quantum-computing-leader/a/d-id/746864">once</a> declared blockchain one of their three strategic priorities, has apparently <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-blockchain-shell-former-self-175818192.html">cut back 90% on it</a>, not seeing the promised benefits materialize.</p><p>The term Web3 itself is becoming <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/">increasingly toxic</a>, as even the ‘inventor of the word-wide-web’ prefers to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lee-screw-web3-my-decentralized-internet-doesnt-need-blockchain">distance himself</a> from&nbsp;it.</p><p>Again, I’m not jumping on the anti-crypto bandwagon or speculating about why these awesome technologies are now so controversial, I’m simply making the point that they are now controversial, which harms the adoption of associated technologies.</p> Controversy #2: “Self-Sovereign” <p>When properly defined, SSI shouldn’t be controversial to anyone: it’s the ability for individuals to create direct digital relationships with other people, organizations, and things and to carry and control digital artifacts (often about themselves) and disclose anything about those artifacts if, when, and however they please. The “sovereignty” means the ability to control and/or carry those artifacts plus the liberty to determine disclosure; it does not mean an ability to challenge the sovereignty of authority.</p><p>But many ears in authority never hear that clarification, and to those ears the words “self-sovereign identity” sound like a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement">challenge</a> to their authority, causing them to stop listening and become unwilling to learn further. In the EU, for example, critics use the term SSI literally in their attempts to scare those in authority from considering it seriously. Their critique is logical; the impetus behind Web3 has been decentralization, self-determination, and a lessening of governmental power and control. The raw fact that SSI technology doesn’t accomplish those ends — despite both its name and its association with Web3 implying that it attempts precisely that — becomes lost in the&nbsp;noise.</p><p>Large enterprises who’ve aggressively delved into SSI and VC technologies, such as IBM and Microsoft, have avoided the term altogether, preferring “decentralized identity”. Why? Because they perceive “self-sovereign identity” as benefitting the individual and not the enterprise, whereas “decentralized identity” leaves room for&nbsp;both.</p><p>Regardless of the specifics behind any controversy, if it’s controversial, it’s a problem. If broad adoption by the very places we’d want to accept our verifiable credentials — government and enterprise — is inhibited by a term they find distasteful, it’s time to look for another&nbsp;term.</p> It’s Not Just About&nbsp;Identity <p>Another issue I see with “SSI”, though more confusing than controversial, is the laser focus on identity. What does “identity” even mean? The word is harder to define than many realize. To some, identity is your driver’s license or passport, to others it’s your username and password or your certificates, achievements and other entitlements. Dr. Phil Windley, the co-founder of IIW, persuasively <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">argues</a> that identity includes all the relationships that it’s used with, because without relationships you don’t need identity.</p><p>Who am I to disagree with the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Identity-Unmasking-Management-Architecture/dp/0596008783/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3N5Y6S8O8QS2U&amp;keywords=digital+identity&amp;qid=1660945647&amp;sprefix=digital+identity%2Caps%2C115&amp;sr=8-3">Digital Identity</a>? He’s probably right, which kinda proves my first point: the definition of identity is an amorphous moving&nbsp;target.</p><p>My second and larger point is this: many use cases I now deal with have an element of identity but are more about other data that may be adjacent to it. Using SSI technologies, all data of import — identity and otherwise — can be digitally signed and provably authentic, both in transit and at rest, opening a broad swath of potential use cases that organizations would pay handsomely to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>One example: a digitally signed attestation that certain work has been performed. It could include full details about the work and every sub-task with separate sub-signatures from all involved parties, resulting in a digital, machine readable, auditable record that can be securely shared with other, outside parties. Even when shared via insecure means (e.g. the Internet), all parties can verify the provenance and integrity of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Other examples: invoices that are verifiably authentic, saving billions in fraud each year; digitally signed tickets, vouchers, coupons; proof-of-purchase receipts; etc. The list is practically unending. My bottom line: SSI tech is about all authentic data and relationships, not just identity.</p><p>(If you’re still thinking “SSI” technologies are only for individuals, think again… the technologies that underlie SSI enable authentic data and relationships everywhere, solving previously intractable problems and providing arguably more benefits for organizations than for individuals…)</p> Let ‘Crypto’ Have&nbsp;“Web3” <p>If you ask most people who’ve heard of Web3 what it is, they’ll likely mention something about cryptocurrency. A more informed person might mention smart contracts, NFTs, Defi and blockchain. A few might even mention guiding principles like “decentralization” or “individual control of digital assets”. Almost no one, outside of the SSI space, would mention SSI, decentralized identity, or verifiable credentials as part of Web3. Andreessen Horowitz, the largest Web3 investor with <a href="https://blockbuild.africa/vc-firm-a16z-4-5b-crypto-web3-investment/">$7.6 billion</a> invested so far, recently published their <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/17/what-web-3-means-to-andreessen-horowitz/">2022 outlook on Web3</a> without mentioning SSI or “identity” even&nbsp;once.</p><p>The bald truth: at present the SSI community is on the outside looking in on Web3, saying the equivalent of “hey, me too!” while Web3 crypto stalwarts sometimes respond with, “yes, you too, we do need identity.” But the situation is clear: SSI and VCs are second- or even third-class citizens of Web3, only mentioned as an afterthought upon the eventual realization of how critical accurate, secure attribution (sloppily, “identity”) really&nbsp;is.</p><p>Web5 says — and I now agree — let ’em have it. Let the crypto crowd own the Web3 moniker lock, stock, and barrel, and let’s instead use an entirely separate ‘WebX’ designation for all SSI technologies, which are more impactful anyway.</p> SSI is Bigger Than&nbsp;Crypto <p>If crypto is big enough to be worthy of its own WebX designation, SSI technologies (VCs, DIDs, KERI, etc.) are even more so; my crystal ball says that SSI will be bigger than crypto will be. It’s not a competition, but the comparison is relevant when considering whether SSI should be a part of crypto or separate from&nbsp;it.</p><p>Having SSI as a bolt-on to Web3 — or Web2 for that matter — severely under-appreciates SSI’s eventual impact on the world. One indicator of that eventual impact is that AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance will continue to be required in all significant financial transactions anywhere on the planet, crypto or otherwise; every industrialized nation in the world agrees on this. The only technologies I’m aware of that can elegantly balance the minimum required regulatory oversight with the maximum possible privacy are SSI technologies. Web3 simply cannot achieve its ultimate goals of ubiquity without SSI tech embedded pretty much everywhere.</p><p>Another, even larger reason why SSI will be more impactful than crypto: SSI technologies will pervade most if not all digital interactions in the future, not just those where money/value is transferred. In sum: Web3 is about the decentralized transfer of value; SSI/Web5 is about verifiable authenticity of all data and all digital interactions.</p> Enter Web5  “Web5 Technologies” <p>SSI is about autonomous control of authentic data and relationships; this is the endgame that Web5 should be about, regardless of which architecture is used to get&nbsp;there.</p><p>Block‘s preferred SSI/Web5 architecture relies on <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Ion/Sidetree</a>, which depends on the Bitcoin blockchain. Fine with me, as long as it results in the autonomous control of authentic data and relationships. My preferred approach does not rely on shared ledgers, it utilizes the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri">IETF KERI protocol</a> instead. As long as the result is self-sovereignty, the autonomous control of authentic data and relationships, Block should be all for&nbsp;it.</p><p>I’ve spoken with Daniel Buchner about this, twice, just to be sure; they&nbsp;are.</p><p>But Ion and KERI aren’t the only games in town; there are also Hyperledger Aries-based stacks that use W3C Verifiable Credentials and DIDs but eschew Decentralized Web Nodes, and use blockchains other than Bitcoin/Ion. I understand that other approaches are also emerging, each with their own tech and terminology. To each I say: if your aim is also the autonomous control of authentic data and relationships, Welcome! The point here is that every Web5 community would benefit from separation from Web3 and SSI controversies, and from closer association and collaboration with sibling communities with which they’ll eventually need to interoperate.</p> Can’t We All Just Get&nbsp;Along? <p>Though I’m not directly involved in the SSI standards communities, I’ve heard from several who are that tensions over technical differences are rather high right now. I’ve found in my life that when disagreements get heated, it helps to take a step back and rediscover common&nbsp;ground.</p><p>One big, overarching thing that unites the various approaches to SSI is the sincere desire for autonomous control of authentic data and relationships. Indeed, the different approaches to SSI are sibling technologies in that they aim for the same endgame, but with the added pressure that the endgame cannot be reached without ultimately achieving interoperability between competing actors.</p><p>Not only should we get along, we must get along to reach our common&nbsp;goal.</p><p>Sometimes families need reunions, to reconnect over shared goals and experiences. Perhaps reconvening under the guise of “Web5 Technologies” can help scratch that family itch, and reduce the temperature of conversation among friends a few&nbsp;degrees.</p> S̶S̶I̶ Web5 <p>As a word, I see Web5 as neutral and with little inherent meaning — just something newer and more advanced than Web3. I’m aware that Web5 was originally conceived as a meme, a troll-ish response from Jack to the Web3 community to convey his disappointment in what <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098?s=20&amp;t=Tv5QlbDnd3MMXX_qG0Ftqw">he asserts</a> is a takeover of Web3 by venture capitalists. Regardless of those light-hearted origins, Jack and company ran with Web5 in all seriousness, throwing their considerable weight and resources behind its launch and the development of their preferred architecture.</p><p>As an evolution, however, Web5 could represent something far more powerful than a catchy new label, it could help organize, distill, propel, and realize the ultimate aspirations of the SSI community. My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalin-nicolov/">Kalin Nicolov</a> defines Web5 forcefully, especially how he sees that it differs from Web1/2/3:</p><blockquote>“Web5 will be the first true evolution of the internet. Web3, like those before it, was seeking to build platforms on top of the internet — centralized walled gardens, owned and controlled by the few. Web5 is harking back to the true spirit of TimBL’s vision of the web. Having learned the hard way, the Web5 /digital trust/ community is trying to create protocols that are complementary and symbiotic, interoperable and composable.</blockquote><blockquote>While Web1/2/3 were web-as-a-platform, Web5 is the first to be web-as-interoperable-set-of-protocols, i.e. serving agency to the edge as opposed to the ridiculous concentration of Web2 (hello AWS) and the aspiring oligopoly of Web3 (hello CZ, hello Coinbase and third a16z&nbsp;fund)”</blockquote><p>To me, switching my default terminology to “Web5” is simply pragmatic; it creates useful separation from Web3/crypto technologies and controversies and the problematic perception of the phrase “self-sovereign identity”. Any term that doesn’t start with “Web” leaves the impression that SSI is still part of Web3; the only way to make a clean break is with a new WebX designation, so it might as well be Web5. A subtle switch to using Web5 won’t be some whiz-bang exciting change like an announcement from Jack or some new Web3 shiny thing, but greater industry clarity and collaboration could still be useful toward two critically important ends: adoption and interoperability.</p><p>So while I’ve used and loved the term SSI for the better part of a decade now, and will continue to use it in conversation, I’ll now begin to use the term “Web5 Technologies” instead more often than not. I’ll also use both terms in tandem — “SSI/Web5” — until it catches&nbsp;on.</p><p>A change in terminology can only happen through use, so I invite you to join me. Thanks to those who’ve already&nbsp;begun.</p>

<a href="https://www.kaleidoinsights.com/web3-use-cases-5-capabilities-people/">Web3 Use Cases: Five Capabilities Enabling People</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t think this post has gotten the attention it deserves. At the least,
it’s a good starting framework to understand why so many people are
attracted to the otherwise still quite underdefined
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">web3</a> idea. Hint: it’s not just
getting rich quick.</p>
<p>I want to riff on this list a bit, by interpreting some of the categories
just a tad differently, but mostly by comparing and contrasting to the
state of the art (“web2”) in consumer technology.</p>

 
  
   Empowerment promise
   State of the art ("web2")
   The promise ("web3")
  
 
 
  Governance
  How much say do you, the user, have in what the tech products do that
      you use? What about none! The developing companies do what they please,
      and very often the <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235266">opposite</a>
      of what their users want.
  Users are co-owners of the product, and have a vote through
      mechanisms such as <a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/202206-16-platform-dao/">DAOs</a>.
 
 
  Identity
  You generally need at least an e-mail address hosted by some big
      platform to sign up for anything. Should the platform decide to
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html">close your account</a>,
      even mistakenly, your identity effectively vanishes.
  Users are self-asserting their identity in a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">self-sovereign</a>
      manner. We used to call this "user-centric identity", with protocols such
      as my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-weight_Identity">LID</a> or
      <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a> before they were eviscerated or co-opted
      by the big platforms. Glad to see the idea is making a come-back.
 
 
  Content ownership
  Practically, you own very little to none of the content you put on-line.
      While theoretically, you keep copyright of your social media posts,
      for example, today it is practically impossible to quit social media
      accounts without losing at least some of your content. Similarly,
      you are severely limited in your options for privacy, meaning
      where your data goes and does not go.
  You, and only you, decide where and how to use your content and
      all other data. It is not locked into somebody else's system.
 
 
  Ability to build
  Ever tried to add a feature to Facebook? It's almost a ridiculous
      proposition. Of course they won't let you. Other companies are
      <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21059083/amazon-honey-browser-extension-security-risk-paypal-acquisition-competition">no better</a>.
  Everything is open, and composable, so everybody can build on each
      other's work.
 
 
  Exchange of value
  Today's mass consumer internet is largely financed through
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">Surveillance Capitalism</a>,
      in the form of targeted advertising, which has led to countless ills.
      Other models generally require subscriptions and credit cards and only
      work in <a href="https://substack.com/">special circumstances</a>.
  Exchange of value as fungible and non-fungible tokens is a core feature
      and available to anybody and any app. An entirely
      <a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">new</a> set of business
      models, in addition to established ones, have suddently become possible
      or even easy.
 

<p>As Jeremiah pointed out when we bumped into each other
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Palo-Alto-CryptoMondays-Meetup/">last night</a>,
public discussion of “web3” is almost completely focused on this last
item: tokens, and the many ill-begotten schemes that they have enabled.</p>
<p>But that is not web3’s lasting attraction. The other four promises –
participation in governance, self-sovereign identity, content ownership
and the freedom to build – are very appealing. In fact, it is hard to
see how anybody (other than an incumbent with a turf to defend) could
possible argue against any of them.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the token part? Just don’t use it. 4 out of the 5
web3 empowerment promises for people, ain’t bad. And worth supporting.</p>

I’ve long imagined a tool that would enable a teacher to help students learn how to write and edit. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2015/01/12/thoughts-in-motion/">Thoughts in motion</a> I explored what might be possible in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/tag/fedwiki/%22">Federated Wiki</a>, a writing tool that keeps version history for each paragraph. I thought it could be extended to enable the kind of didactic editing I have in mind, but never found a way forward.</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/08/13/how-to-rewrite-a-press-release-a-step-by-step-guide/">How to write a press release</a> I tried bending Google Docs to this purpose. To narrate the process of editing a press release, I dropped a sample release into a GDoc and captured a series of edits as named versions. Then I captured the versions as screenshots and combined them with narration, so the reader of the blog post can see each edit as a color-coded diff with an explanation.</p>
<p>
The key enabler is GDoc’s File -&gt; Version history -&gt; Name current version, along with File -&gt; See version history‘s click-driven navigation of the set of diffs. It’s easy to capture a sequence of editing steps that way. </p>
<p>
But it’s much harder to present those steps as I do in the post. That required me to make, name, and organize a set of images, then link them to chunks of narration. It’s tedious work. And if you want to build something like this for students, that’s work you shouldn’t be doing. You just want to do the edits, narrate them, and share the result.</p>
<p>
This week I tried a different approach when editing a document written by a colleague. Again the goal was not only to produce an edited version, but also to narrate the edits in a didactic way. In this case I tried bending GitHub to my purpose. I put the original doc in a repository, made step-by-step edits in a branch, and created a pull request. We were then able to review the pull request, step through the changes, and review each as a color-coded diff with an explanation. No screenshots had to be made, named, organized, or linked to the narration. I could focus all my attention on doing and narrating the edits. Perfect!</p>
<p>
Well, perfect for someone like me who uses GitHub every day. If that’s not you, could this technique possibly work?</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html">GitHub for the rest of us</a> I argued that GitHub’s superpowers could serve everyone, not just programmers. In retrospect I felt that I’d overstated the case. GitHub was, and remains, a tool that’s deeply optimized for programmers who create and review versioned source code. Other uses are possible, but awkward. </p>
<p>
As an experiment, though, let’s explore how awkward it would be to recreate my Google Docs example in GitHub. I will assume that you aren’t a programmer, have never used GitHub, and don’t know (or want to know) anything about branches or commits or pull requests. But you would like to be able to create a presentation that walks a learner though a sequence of edits, with step-by-step narration and color-coded diffs. At the end of this tutorial you’ll know how to do that. The method isn’t as straightforward as I wish it were. But I’ll describe it carefully, so you can try it for yourself and decide whether it’s practical.</p>
<p>
Here’s the final result of the technique I’ll describe.</p>
<p></p>  
<p>
If you want to replicate that, and don’t already have a GitHub account, create one now and log in.</p>
<p>
Ready to go? OK, let’s get started.</p>
 Step 1: Create a repository 
<p>
Click the + button in the top right corner, then click New repository.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Here’s the next screen. All you must do here is name the repository, e.g. editing-step-by-step, then click Create repository. I’ve ticked the Add a README file box, and chosen the Apache 2.0 license, but you could leave the defaults — box unchecked, license None — as neither matters for our purpose here.</p>
<p>
</p>
 Step 2: Create a new file 
<p>
On your GitHub home page, click the Repositories tab. Your new repo shows up first. Click its link to open it, then click the Add file dropdown and choose Create new file. Here’s where you land.</p>
<p>
</p>
 Step 3: Add the original text, create a new branch, commit the change, and create a pull request 
<p>
What happens on the next screen is bewildering, but I will spare you the details because I’m assuming you don’t want to know about branches or commits or pull requests, you just want to build the kind of presentation I’ve promised you can. So, just follow this recipe.</p>
 
 Name the file (e.g. sample-press-release.txt
  Copy/paste the text of the document into the edit box
  Select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request
  Name the branch (e.g. edits)
  Click Propose new file
  
<p>
</p>
<p>
On the next screen, title the pull request (e.g. edit the press release) and click Create pull request.</p>
<p>
</p>
 Step 4: Visit the new branch and begin editing 
<p>
On the home page of your repo, use the main dropdown to open the list of branches. There are now two: main and edits. Select edits</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Here’s the next screen. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Click the name of the document you created (e.g. sample-press-release.txt to open it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Click the pencil icon’s dropdown, and select Edit this file.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Make and preview your first edit. Here, that’s my initial rewrite of the headline. I’ve written a title for the commit (Step 1: revise headline), and I’ve added a detailed explanation in the box below the title. You can see the color-coded diff above, and the rationale for the change below. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Click Commit changes, and you’re back in the editor ready to make the next change.</p>
<p>
</p>
 Step 5: Visit the pull request to review the change 
<p>On your repo’s home page (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step">https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step</a>), click the Pull requests button. You’ll land here.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Click the name of the pull request (e.g. edit the press release) to open it. In the rightmost column you’ll see links with alphanumeric labels. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Click the first one of those to land here.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This is the first commit, the one that added the original text. Now click Next to review the first change.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This, finally, is the effect we want to create: a granular edit, with an explanation and a color-coded diff, encapsulated in a <a href="https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step/pull/1/commits/de67cf6b75f0de9da82b821e82ed1d8457fb7562">link</a> that you can give to a learner who can then click Next to step through a series of narrated edits.</p>
 Lather, rinse, repeat 
<p>
To continue building the presentation, repeat Step 4 (above) once per edit. I’m doing that now.</p>
<p>
… time passes …</p>
<p>
OK, done. Here’s the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/judell/editing-step-by-step/edits/sample-press-release.txt">final edited copy</a>. To step through the edits, start <a href="https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step/pull/1/commits/de67cf6b75f0de9da82b821e82ed1d8457fb7562">here</a> and use the Next button to advance step-by-step.</p>
<p>
If this were a software project you’d merge the edits branch into the main branch and close the pull request. But you don’t need to worry about any of that. The edits branch, with its open pull request, is the final product, and the link to the first commit in the pull request is how you make it available to a learner who wants to review the presentation.</p>
<p>
GitHub enables what I’ve shown here by wrapping the byzantine complexity of the underlying tool, Git, in a much friendlier interface. But what’s friendly to a programmer is still pretty overwhelming for an English teacher. I still envision another layer of packaging that would make this technique simpler for teachers and learners focused on the craft of writing and editing. Meanwhile, though, it’s possible to use GitHub to achieve a compelling result. Is it practical? That’s not for me to say, I’m way past being able to see this stuff through the eyes of a beginner. But if that’s you, and you’re motivated to give this a try, I would love to know whether you’re able to follow this recipe, and if so whether you think it could help you to help learners become better writers and editors.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Open networks provide the means for increased freedom and autonomy as more of our lives move to the digital realm. ONDC is an experiment launching in India that is hoping to bring these benefits to shoppers and merchants.</p>




<p>
    I read about the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) on Azeem Azhar's <a href="https://www.exponentialview.co/ev385/">Exponential View</a> this week and then saw a discussion of it on the VRM mailing list. I usually take multiple hits on the same thing as a sign I ought to dig in a little more. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Network_for_Digital_Commerce">Open Network for Digital Commerce</a> is a non-profit established by the Indian government to develop open ecommerce. The goal is to end platform monopolies in ecommerce using an open protocol called <a href="https://developers.becknprotocol.io/">Beckn</a>. I'd never heard of Beckn before. From the reaction on the VRM mailing list, not many there had either.
</p>

<p>
    This <a href="https://developers.becknprotocol.io/docs/introduction/video-overview/">series of videos by Ravi Prakash</a>, the architect of Beckn, is a pretty good introduction. The first two are largely tutorials on open networks and protocols and their application to commerce. The <a href="https://youtu.be/41RiBu6zT9Y?t=330">real discussion of Beckn starts about 5'30" into the second video</a>. One of Beckn's core features is a way for buyers to discover sellers and their catalogs. In my experience with decentralized systems, discovery is one of the things that has to work well. 
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications">README on the specifications</a> indicates that buyers (identified as BAPs) address a search to a Beckn gateway of their choice. If the search doesn't specify a specific seller, then the gateway broadcasts the request to multiple sellers (labeled BPPs) whose catalogs match the context of the request. Beckn's protocol routes these requests to the sellers who they believe can meet the intent of the search. Beckn also includes specifications for ordering, fulfillment, and post-fulfillment activities like ratings, returns, and support. 
</p>

<p>
    ONDC's goal is to allow small merchants to compete with large platforms like Amazon, Google, and Flipkart. Merchants would use one of several ONDC-compatible clients to list their catalogs. When a buyer searches, products from their catalog would show up in search results. Small and medium merchants have long held the advantage in being close to the buyer, but lacked ways to easily get their product offerings in front of online shoppers. Platforms <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">hold these merchants hostage</a> because of their reach, but often lack local options. ONDC wants to level that playing field.
</p>

<p>
    Will the big platforms play? The India Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/open-network-for-digital-commerce-a-fascinating-idea-excited-about-prospects-amazon-india-exec/articleshow/92481327.cms">interviewed Manish Tiwary, country Manager for Amazon's India Consumer Business</a>.  In the article he says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>I am focused on serving the next 500 million customers. Therefore, I look forward to innovations, which will lift all the boats in the ecosystem.</p>
    <p>At this stage, we are engaging very closely with the ONDC group, and we are quite committed to what the government is wanting to do, which is to digitize kiranas, local stores...I spoke about some of our initiatives, which are preceding even ONDC... So yes, excited by what it can do. It's a nascent industry, we will work closely with the government.</p>

     </blockquote>

<p>
    An open network for ecommerce would change how we shop online. There are adoption challenges. Not the least of which is getting small merchants to list what they have for sale and keep inventory up to date. Most small merchants don't have sophisticated software systems to interface for automatic updates—they'll do it by hand. If they don't see the sales, they'll not spend the time maintaining their catalog. Bringing the tens of millions of small merchants in India online will be a massive effort. 
</p>

<p>
    I'm fascinated by efforts like these. I spend most of my time right now writing about open networks for identity as I wrap up my forthcoming O'Reilly book. I'm not sure anyone really knows how to get them going, so it takes a lot of work with more misses than hits. But I remain optimistic that open networks will ultimately succeed. Don't ask me why. I'm not sure I can explain it.

  <p>I’ve been reading up on what is apparently called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture">information architecture</a>:
the “structural design of shared information environments”.</p>
<p>A quite fascinating discipline, and sorely needed as the amount of information we need
to interact with on a daily basis keeps growing.</p>
<p>I kind of think of it as “the structure
behind the design”. If design is the what you see when looking at something, information
architecture are the beams and struts and foundations etc that keeps the whole thing
standing and comprehensible.</p>
<p>Based on what I’ve read so far, however, it can be a bit myopic in terms of focusing
just on “what’s inside the app”. That’s most important, obviously, but insufficient in the age
of IoT – where some of the “app” is actually controllable and observable through physical
items – and the expected coming wave of AR applications. Even here and now many flows
start with QR codes printed on walls or scanned from other people’s phones, and we
miss something in the “design of shared information environments” if we don’t make those
in-scope.</p>
<p>So I propose this outermost framework to help us think about how to interact with shared
information environments:</p>
 
 Universe-level: 
 Focuses on where on the planet where a user could conceivably be, and how that changes
how they interact with the shared information environment. For example, functionality
may be different in different regions, use different languages or examples, or not be
available at all. 
 Environment-level: 
 Focuses on the space in which the user is currently located (like sitting on their
living room couch), or that they can easily reach, such as a bookshelf in the same room.
Here we can have a discussion about, say, whether the user will pick up their Apple
remote, run the virtual remote app on their iOS device, or walk over to the TV to
turn up the volume. 
 Device-level: 
 Once the user has decided which device to use (e.g. their mobile phone, their PC,
their AR goggles, a button on the wall etc), this level focuses on what they user
does on the top level of that device. On a mobile phone or PC, that would be the
operating-system level features such as which app to run (not the content of the app,
that’s the next level down), or home screen widgets. Here we can discuss how the
user interacts with the shared information space given that they also do other things
on their device; how to get back and forth; integrations and so forth. 
 App-level: 
 The top-level structure inside an app: For example, an app might have 5 major tabs
reflecting 5 different sets of features. 
 Page-level: 
 The structure of pages within an app. Do they have commonalities (such as all of them
have a title at the top, or a toolbox to the right) and how are they structured. 
 Mode-level: 
 Some apps have “modes” that change how the user interacts with what it shown on a
page. Most notably: drawing apps where the selected tool (like drawing a circle vs
erasing) determines different interaction styles. 
 
<p>I’m just writing this down for my own purposes, because I don’t want to forget it and
refer to it when thinking of design problems. And perhaps it is useful for you, the
reader, as well. If you think it can be improved, let me know!</p>

<p>As a teaching fellow in grad school I helped undergrads improve their expository writing. Some were engineers, and I invited them to think about writing and editing prose in the same ways they thought about writing and editing code. Similar rules apply, with different names. Strunk and White say “omit needless words”; coders say “DRY” (don’t repeat yourself.) Writers edit; coders refactor. I encouraged students to think about writing and editing prose not as a creative act (though it is one, as is coding) but rather as a method governed by rules that are straightforward to learn and mechanical to apply.</p>
<p>This week I applied those rules to an internal document that announces new software features. It’s been a long time since I’ve explained the method, and thanks to a prompt from <a href="https://twitter.com/gvwilson">Greg Wilson</a> I’ll give it a try using another tech announcement I picked at random. Here is the original version.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I captured the transformations in a series of steps, and named each step in the version history of a Google Doc. </p>
 Step 1 
<p></p>
<p>The rewritten headline applies the following rules.</p>
<p>Lead with key benefits. The release features two: support for diplex-matched antennas and faster workflow. The original headline mentions only the first, I added the second.</p>
<p>Clarify modifiers. A phrase like “diplex matched antennas” is ambiguous. Does “matched” modify “diplex” or “antennas”? The domain is unfamiliar to me, but I suspected it should be “diplex-matched” and a web search confirmed that hunch. </p>
<p>Omit needless words. The idea of faster workflow appears in the original first paragraph as “new efficiencies aimed at streamlining antenna design workflows and shortening design cycles.” That’s a long, complicated, yet vague way of saying “enables designers to work faster.”</p>
 Step 2 
<p></p>
<p>The original lead paragraph was now just a verbose recap of the headline. So poof, gone.</p>
 Step 3 
<p></p>
<p>The original second paragraph, now the lead, needed a bit of tightening. Rules in play here:</p>
<p>Strengthen verbs. “NOUN is a NOUN that VERBs” weakens the verb. “NOUN, a NOUN, VERBs” makes it stronger.</p>
<p>Clarify modifiers. “matching network analysis” -&gt; “matching-network analysis”. (As I look at it again now, I’d revise to “analysis of matching networks.”)</p>
<p>Break up long, weakly-linked sentences. The original was really two sentences linked weakly by “making it,” so I split them.</p>
<p>Omit needless words. A word that adds nothing, like “applications” here, weakens a sentence.</p>
<p>Strengthen parallelism. If you say “It’s ideal for X and Y” there’s no problem. But when X becomes “complex antenna designs that involve multi-state and multi-port aperture or impedance tuners,” and Y becomes “corporate feed networks with digital phase shifters,” then it helps to make the parallelism explicit: “It’s ideal for X and for Y.”</p>
 Step 4 
<p></p>
<p>Omit needless words. “builds on the previous framework with additional” -&gt; “adds”.</p>
<p>Simplify. “capability to connect” -&gt; “ability to connect”.</p>
<p>Show, don’t tell. A phrase like “time-saving options in the schematic editor’s interface” tells us that designers save time but doesn’t show us how. That comes next: “the capability to connect two voltage sources to a single antenna improves workflow efficiency.” The revision cites that as a shortcut.</p>
<p>Activate the sentence. “System and radiation efficiencies … can be effortlessly computed from a single schematic” makes efficiencies the subject and buries the agent (the designer) who computes them. The revision activates that passive construction. Similar rules govern the rewrite of the next paragraph.</p>
 Step 5 
<p></p>
<p>When I reread the original fourth paragraph I realized that the release wasn’t only touting faster workflow, but also better collaboration. So I adjusted the headline accordingly.</p>
 Step 6 
<p></p>
<p>Show, don’t tell. The original version tells, the new one shows.</p>
<p>Simplify. “streamline user input” -&gt; “saves keystrokes” (which I might further revise to “clicks and keystrokes”).</p>
 Final result 
<p>Here’s the result of these changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I haven’t fully explained each step, and because the domain is unfamiliar I’ve likely missed some nuance. But I’m certain that the final version is clearer and more effective. I hope this step-by-step narration helps you see how and why the method works.</p>

<p>What follows is a take on what I learned as Salesforce moved to require all of its customers to use MFA. There’s plenty more left on the cutting room floor but it will definitely give you a flavor for the experience. If you don’t want to read all this you can check out the version I delivered at Identiverse 2022.</p>



<p>i</p>



 

 



<p>Thank you.</p>



<p>It is an honor and a privilege to be here on the first day of Identiverse. I want to thank Andi and the entire program team for allowing me to speak to you today.</p>



<p>This talk is an unusual one for me. I have had the pleasure and privilege to be here on stage before. But in all the times that i have spoken to you, I have been wearing my IDPro hat. I have never had the opportunity to represent my day job and talk about what my amazing team does. So today I am here to talk to you as a Salesforce employee.</p>



<p>And because of that you’re going to note a different look and feel for this presentation. Very different. I get to use the corporate template and I am leaning in hard to that.</p>



<p>Salesforce is a very different kind of company and that shows in up many different ways. Including the fact that, yes, there’s a squirrel-like thing on this slide. That’s Astro – they are one of our mascots. Let’s just get one thing out of the way up front – yes, they have their own backstories and different pronouns; no, they do not all wear pants. Let’s move on.</p>



<p>So the reason why I am here today is to talk to you about Salesforce’s journey towards complete customer adoption of MFA. There are 2 key words in this: Customer and Journey.</p>



<p>‘Customer’ is a key word here because the journey we are on is to drive our customers’ users to use MFA. This is not going to be a talk about how we enable our workforce to use MFA. Parenthetically we did that a few years ago and got ~95% of all employees enrolled in MFA in under 48 hours. Different talk another time. We are focused on raising the security posture of our customers with their help.</p>



<p>Journey is the other key word here. The reason why I want to focus on the Journey is because I believe there is something for everyone to take away and apply in their own situations. And I want to tell this Journey as a way of sharing the lessons I have learned, my team has learned, to help avoid the mistakes we made along the way.</p>



 







 The Journey Begins 



<p>So the&nbsp;Journey&nbsp;towards complete&nbsp;customer&nbsp;MFA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It starts in the Fall of 2019. Our CISO at the time makes a pronouncement. Because MFA is the single most effective way our customers could protect themselves and their customers, we wanted to drive more use of MFA. So the pronouncement was simple: in 3 months time every one of our at the time 10 product groups (known as our Clouds) will adopt a common MFA service (which was still in development at the time btw) and by February 1 of 2021, 100% of end users of our well over 1500,000 customers will use MFA or SSO on every log in. Again this is Salesforce changing all of our customers’ and all of their users’ behavior across all of our products in roughly a year’s time.</p>



<p>That means in a year’s time we are going change the way every single person who logs into a Salesforce product. And let’s be honest with ourselves fellow identity nerds, this is what people think of MFA:</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.tuesdaynight.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-1.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>100% service adoption in 3 months. 100% user penetration within about 1 year.</p>



<p>100%</p>



<p>Of all end users.</p>



<p>All of them.</p>



<p>100%</p>



<p>There’s laughing from the audience. There’s some whispering to neighbors. I assume this is your reaction to the low bar that the CISO set for us… a trivial thing to achieve.</p>



<p>Oh wait no… the opposite. You, like I did at the time reacted to the absolute batshit nutsery of that goal. What the CISO is proposing is to tell customers, WHO PAY US, here is the minimum bar for your users’ security posture and you must change behaviors and potentially technologies if you don’t currently meet that bar and want to use our services.</p>



<p>100%… oh hell no.</p>



<p>I reacted like most 5 year olds would. I stomped my feet. I pulled the covers over my head thinking if the monsters couldn’t see me, they couldn’t get me. If I just didn’t acknowledge the CISO’s decree, it would somehow not apply. Super mature response. Lasted for about a week. Then I learned that the CISO committed all this to our Board of Directors. So… the chances of ignoring this were zero. But still, I fought against the tide. I was difficult. I was difficult to the program team and to my peer in Security. That was immature and just wasted time. I spent time rebuilding those relationships during the first 6 months of the program.</p>



 Step 0: Get a writer and a data person 



<p>What would you do hotshot?<br>If you got this decree what should be the first thing you’d do. Come on – shout them out! (Audience shout out answers.) All good ideas… but the first thing you should do is hire the best tech writer you can. Trust me you are going to need that person in the 2nd and 3rd acts and its gonna take them a bit of time to come up to speed… so get going, hire a writer!</p>



<p>(It’s also not a bad idea to get data people on the team. If you are going to target 100% rollout then you need good ways to measure your progress. And you’ll want to slice and dice that to better understand where you need more customer outreach and which regions or business are doing well.)</p>



 Step 1: Form a program with non-SMEs 



<p>Ok probably the next thing you’d do is get a program running which is what we did. That program was and is run by non-identity people. Honestly, my first reaction was that this was going to be a problem. What I foresaw was a lot of explaining the “basics” of identity and MFA and SSO to the program team and not a lot of time left to do the work.</p>



<p>I was right and I was wrong. I was correct in that I and my team did spend a lot of time explaining identity concepts to the program team. I was wrong in that the work of explaining was actually the work that needed to be done. The program team were not identity people and we were asking them to do identity stuff and this was just like the admins at our customers. They were not identity people and we were now asking them to do identity stuff.</p>



<p>So having a program team of non-subject matter experts was a great feature not a bug. As the SMEs, my team spent hours explaining so many things to the program team and it turned out that the time we spent there was a glimpse of what the entire program would need to do with our customers.</p>



<p>Not only did we have a program team staffed with non-subject matter experts, we also formed a steering committee staffed, in part, with non-subject matter experts. The Steerco was headed by a representative from Security, Customer Success, and Product. This triumvirate helped us to balance the desires of Security with the realities of the customers with our ability to deliver needed features.&nbsp;</p>



 Step 2: Find the highest ranking exec you can and use them as persuaders as needed 



<p>Next up – if we needed all of our clouds to use MFA, we need to actually get their commitment to do so. The program dutifully relayed the CISO’s decree to the general managers of all the clouds. Understand that Salesforce’s financial year starts Feb 1, so we were just entering Q4 and here comes the program team telling the GMs, “yeah on top of all your revenue goals for the year, you need to essentially drop everything and integrate with the MFA service,” which again wasn’t GA yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were asking the GMs to change their Q4 and next fiscal year plans by adding a significant Trust-related program. And at Salesforce Trust is our number 1 value which means that this program had to go to the top of every cloud’s backlog. As a product manager, if someone told me “hey Ian, this thing that you really had no plans to do now has to be done immediately” I would take it poorly. Luckily, we have our CISO with the support of our Co-CEOs and Board to persuade the GMs.</p>



 Step 3: Get, maintain, and measure alignment using cultural and operational norms 



<p>So we got GM commitments but needed a way to keep them committed in the forthcoming years of the program. We used our execs to help do this and we relied on a standard Salesforce planning mechanism: the V2MOM. V2MOM stands for Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measures. Essentially, where do you want to go, what is important to you in that journey, what are the things you are going to do get to that destination, what roadblocks do you expect, and how will you measure your progress. V2MOMs are ingrained in Salesforce culture and operations. Specific to MFA, we made sure that service adoption and customer MFA adoption measures were in the very first Method of every Cloud’s V2MOM and we used the regular review processes within Salesforce to monitor our progress.</p>



<p>Do not create someting new! Find whatever your organization uses to gain and monitor alignment and progress and use it!</p>



 Lesson 1: Service delivery without adoption is the same thing as no service delivery 



<p>Round about this time I made the first of many mistakes. We had just GA’ed the new MFA service and I wanted to publish a congratulatory note and get all the execs to pile on. Keep in mind that the release was an MVP release and exactly zero clouds had adopted it. My boss stoped me from sending the note. Instead of a congratulatory piling on from the execs, I got a piling on from the CISO for the lack of features and adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am a product manager and live in a product org… not an internal IT org, not the Security org. My world is about shipping features… my world was about to get rocked. I had lost sight of the most important thing, especially to the execs: adoption.</p>



<p>Thus service delivery without adoption is the same thing as no service delivery.</p>



 Lesson 2: Plan to replan 



<p>At this point it is roughly February 2020 and no clouds had adopted the MFA service and we had just started to get metrics from the clouds as to their existing MFA and SSO penetration. It wasn’t pretty but at least we knew where we stood. And where we stood made it pretty clear to see that we were not going to be in a position to drive customer adoption of MFA and certainly not achieve 100% user coverage within the original year’s time.</p>



<p>We needed to reset our timeline and in doing so we had to draw up a two new sets of plans: one for our clouds adopting the MFA service and one for our customer adoption. In that process, we moved the dates out for both. We gave our clouds more time to adopt the MFA service and moved the date for 100% customer end-user adoption to February 1 2022.</p>



<p>No matter how prepared you are at the beginning of a program like this, there will always be externalities that force you to adapt.&nbsp;</p>



 Continue onwards 



<p>So with our new plans in hand, a reasonably well-oiled program in place, we began to roll out communications to customers in April of 2020. We explained what we wanted them to do 100% MFA usage and why – MFA is the single best control they could employ to protect themselves, their customers, and their data against things like credential stuffing and password reuse. And we let them know about the deadline of February 1 2022. We did this in the clearest ways we knew how to express ourselves. We did it in multiple formats, languages, and media. We had teams of people calling customers and making them aware of the MFA requirements.</p>



<p>Remember when I said hire a writer early… yeah, that. Clear comms is crucial. Clear comms about identity stuff to non-identity people is really difficult and crucial to get as right as possible (and then iterate… a lot.)</p>



 Gain traction; get feedback 



<p>The program team we had formed was based on a template for a feature adoption team. Years ago, Salesforce released a fundament change to its UX tier which had profound impact to how our customers built and interacted with apps on our platform. To drive adoption for the new UX tier, we put together an adoption team… and we lifted heavily from that team and their approach.</p>



<p>Using the wisdom of those people, we knew that we were going to have to meet our customers where they were. First and foremost, we need a variety of ways to get the MFA message out. We used both email and in-app messages along with good ole’ fashion phone calls – yes we called our customer admins. Besides a microsite, we build ebooks and an FAQ. We put on multiple webinars and found space in our in-person events to spread the word. We even build some specialized apps in some of our products to drive MFA awareness.</p>



<p>And we listened… our Customer Success Group brought back copious notes from their interactions with customers. We opened a dedicated forum in our Trailblazer Community. We trained a small army of people to respond to customer questions. We tracked customer escalations and sentiment and reported all of this to the CISO and other senior execs.</p>



 Wobbler #1 



<p>In our leadership development courses at Salesforce, we do a business simulation. This simulation puts attendees in the shoes of executives of a mythical company and they are asked to make resource allocation and other decisions. Over the course of the classes, you compete with fellow attendees and get to see the impact of your decisions. It’s a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One consistent thing in all of the simulations is “The Wobbler.” The Wobbler is an externality thrown at you and your teammates. They can be intense; they can definitely knock a winning team out of contention. And so you can say to a colleague, “We were doing great until this wobbler” and they totally know what you mean.</p>



<p>Predictably, the MFA program was due for a wobbler. This one came in from a discrepancy in what we were communicating and the CISO noticed it first. Despite the many status briefings. Despite having one of his trusted deputies as part of the steering committee for the MFA program. There was a big disconnect. The MFA Program was telling our customers “By February 1 2022 you need to be doing MFA or SSO.” The CISO thought we were telling customers “MFA or SSO&nbsp;with MFA.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are probably a few MBA classes on executive communication that could be written about this “little” disconnect. There was going to be no changing the CISO’s mind; the program team simply needed to start communicating the requirement of MFA or SSO with MFA.</p>



<p>From our customers perspective, Salesforce was moving the goal posts. They were stressed enough as it is and this eroded trust. Our poor lead writer had a very bad week. The customer success teams doing outreach and talking to customers had very bad weeks. My teams had to redo their release plans to pull forward instrumentation to log and surface whether an SSO login used MFA upstream.</p>



 A word from our speaker 



<p>And now a word from a kinda popular SaaS Service Provider: “Hi, are you like me? Are you a service provider just trying to make the internet a safer place and increase the security posture of your customers but are thwarted by the lack of insight into the upstream authentication event? Isn’t that frustrating? But don’t worry we have standards and things like AuthNContext in SAML and AMR claims in OIDC. Now if only on-prem and IDaaS IDPs would populate those claims consistently as well as consistently use the same values in those claims. If we could do that, it would make the world a better place.&nbsp;Don’t let this guy down.”&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.tuesdaynight.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-2.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>Ok I know this isn’t sexy stuff but please please please! It is damn hard as an SP to consistently get any insight into the upstream user authentication event. I know my own services can do better here when we act as an IDP. Please, industry peers, please please make this data available to downstream SPs. And, standards nerds, I know it ain’t sexy but can we please standardize or at least normalize not only the values in those claims but the order and meaning of the order of values within those claims. Pretty please? (include scrolling spreadsheet of all the amr values we’ve seen)</p>



 Step 4: Accommodate the hard use case 



<p>The wheels had begun to gain traction so to speak. We heard from customer CISOs who were thrilled about our MFA requirements – it gave them the justification they were looking for to go much bigger with MFA. But we also heard from customers with hard use cases for whom there aren’t always great answers. For example, we have customers who use 3rd parties to administer and modify their Salesforce environments. Getting MFA into those peoples’ hands is tricky. Another example, people doing robotic process automation or have UX test suites struggle to meet the MFA requirements of MFA on every UI-based login. Those users look like “regular” human users and have access to customer data. They need MFA. And yet the support for MFA in those areas is spotty at best.</p>



<p>We had another source of challenging use cases – brought to us by our ISV and OEM partners. These vital parts of our business have a unique relationship with our products and our customers and the challenges that our customers feel are amplified for our ISVs and OEMs.</p>



<p>What we learned was that there are going to be use cases that are just damn hard to deal with. 3rd party call centers. RPA tools. Managed service providers. The lesson here is – it’s okay. Your teams are comprised of smart people and even still there is no way to know at the onset of such a program these use cases. Find the flexibility to meet the customers where they are… and that includes negotiated empathy with your executives and stakeholders. I truly believe there is always a path forward but it does require flexibility.</p>



 Wobbler #2 



<p>At this point we have clouds mostly adopted, people are rolling out MFA controls in their products. Customer adoption of MFA and SSO are climbing and we are feeling good. And, predictably, the universe decided to take us down a peg. Enter Wobbler #2 – outages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raise your hand if you know the people that maintain the DNS infrastructure at your company… if you don’t know them, find them. Bring them chocolate, whiskey, aspirin… DNS is hard. And when DNS goes squirrely it tends to have a massive blast radius. Salesforce had a DNS-related outage and the MFA service that most of our clouds had just adopted was impacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And a few weeks after we recovered from that, the MFA service suffered a second outage due to a regional failover process not failing over in a predicted manner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recovered, we learned, we strengthened the service, we strengthened ourselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So when things are going well, just assume that Admiral Ackbar is going to appear in your life… “It’s a trap.”&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.tuesdaynight.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image.png?ssl=1"></a>



 Step 5: Address the long tail 



<p>So where are we today? Well, while we found lots of MFA and SSO adoption in our largest customers – especially SSO, we have a lot of customers with less than 100 users and their adoption rates were low. One concerning thing about these customers is that the ratio of general users to those with admin rights is very high. Where privileged users might make up less than low single digits of the total user population in larger tenants, it was much much higher in smaller ones. Although we had a great outreach program there are literally tens of thousands of tenants and thus tens of thousands of customers whose login configurations and behaviors we had to change.</p>



<p>And here is where we learned that we had to enlist automation and that is where our teams are focused today. Building ways to ensure that new tenants have MFA turned on by default, customers have ways of opting out specific users such as their UX testing users, and means to turn on MFA for all customers, not just new ones without breaking those that put in the effort to do MFA previously. That takes time but it is well spent time – we are going to automatically change the behavior of the system which directly impacts our customers users – it is not something ones does lightly (one does not simply turn on mfa meme)</p>



    



 Lesson 3: Loving 100% percent 



<p>Standing here today, I can say that I really like the 100% goal. As I wrote this talk, I looked back at some of my email from the beginning of the project… and I am a little ashamed. I really fought the 100% goal hard… it wasn’t a good look. It wasn’t the right thing to do. The reason I like the goal is that although we are at roughly 80% of our monthly active users using mfa or sso, had we not made 100% the goal then we’d have achieved less and been fine with where we are. Without that goal we wouldn’t have pushed to address the long tail of customers; we would not have innovated to find better solutions for both our customers and ourselves. Would I have liked our CISO to deliver the goal in a different way? Sure. But I have become a fan of a seemingly impossible goal… so long as it is expressed with empathy and care.</p>



 Step 6: Re-remember the goal 



<p>We ended last fiscal year with about 14 million monthly active users of MFA or SSO with MFA. They represent 14M people who are habituated; the identity ceremonies they perform include MFA.</p>



<p>And that has a huge knock on effect. They bring that ceremony inclusive of MFA home with them. They bring the awareness of MFA to their families and friends. And this helps keep them safer in their business and their personal lives. The growth of MFA use in a business context is a huge deal professionally speaking. As I tell the extended team, what they have done and are doing is resume-building work: they rolled out and drove adoption of MFA across multiple lines of business at a 200 billion dollar company. That is no small feat!</p>



<p>But that knock on effect – that those same users are going to bring MFA home with them and look to use it in their family lives… that, as an identity practitioner, is just as big of a deal. That makes the journey worth it.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I originally wrote this on the ProjectVRM mailing list in January of 2020. I made some edits to fix errors and clunky phrasingI didn’t like. It is a rant and a series of observations and complaints derived from after dinner chats/walks with my significant other (who is also a nerd). This is a weak-tea attempt at the kind of amazing threads Cory Doctorow puts out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I still hold out hope (for privacy, for decentralized identity, for companies realizing their user trust is worth way more than this quarter’s numbers). But unless there are changes across the digital world (people, policy, corps, orgs), it is looking pretty dark. </p>



 TLDR:&nbsp; 



<p>There is a reason why AR is a favorite technology for Black Mirror screenwriters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where generally available augmented reality and anonymity in public is going is bad and it is going to happen unless the users start demanding better and the Bigs (GAMAM+) decide that treating customers better is a competitive priority.&nbsp;</p>



 My (Dark) Future of AR: 



<p>Generally available Augmented Reality will be a game changer for user experience, utility and engagement. The devices will be indistinguishable from glasses and everyone will wear them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The individual will wear their AR all the time, capturing sound, visuals, location and other data points at all times as they go about their day. They will only very rarely take it off (how often do you turn off your mobile phone?), capturing what they see, maybe what they hear, and everyone around them in the background, geolocated and timestamped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every user of this technology will have new capabilities (superpowers!):</p>



  Turn by turn directions in your field of view  Visually search their field of view during the time they were in a gallery a week ago (time travel!)  Find live performance details from a band’s billboard (image recognition!)  Product recognition on the shelves of the grocery store (computer-vision driven dynamic shopping lists!)&nbsp;  Know when someone from your LinkedIn connections is also in a room you are in, along with where they are working now (presence! status! social!).&nbsp;  



<p>Data (images, audio, location, direction, etc.) will be directly captured. Any data exhaust (metadata, timestamps, device data, sounds in the background, individuals and objects in the background) will be hoovered up by whoever is providing you the “service”. All of this data (direct and indirect) will probably be out of your control or awareness. Compare it to the real world: do you know every organization that has data *about* you right now? What happens when that is 1000x.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to all of this data being vacuumed up and processed and parsed and bought and sold, Police (state, fed, local, contract security, etc.) WILL get new superpowers too. They can and will request all of the feeds from Amazon and Google and Apple for a specific location at a specific time, Because your location is in public, all three will have a harder time resisting (no expectation of privacy, remember?). Most of these requests will be completely legitimate and focused on crime or public safety. There will definitely be requests that are unethical, invalid and illegal and citizens will rarely find out about these. Technology can and will be misused in banal and horrifying ways.</p>



<p>GAMAM* make significant revenue from advertising. AR puts commercial realtime data collection on steroids.</p>



<p>“What product did he look at? For how long? Where was he? Let’s offer him a discount in realtime!”</p>



<p>The negative impacts won’t be for everyone, though. If I had a million dollars I would definitely take the bet where Elon Musk, Eric Schmidt, the Collisons, Sergey, Larry, Bezos and Tim Cook and other celebrities will all have the ability to “opt out” of being captured and processed. The rest of us will not get to opt out unless we pay $$$ – continuing to bring the old prediction “it isn’t how much privacy you have a right to, it is how much privacy you can afford” to life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You won’t know who is recording you and have to assume it is happening all of the time.&nbsp;</p>



 We aren’t ready 



<p>Generally available augmented reality has societal / civil impacts we aren’t prepared for. We didn’t learn any lessons over the last 25 years regarding digital technology and privacy. AR isn’t the current online world where you can opt out, run an adblocker, run a VPN, not buy from Amazon, delete your a social media account, compartmentalize browsers (one for work, one for research, one for personal), etc. AR is an overlay onto the real world, where everyone will be indirectly watching everyone else… for someone else’s benefit. I used the following example discussing this challenge with a friend:</p>



  2 teens took a selfie on 37th street and 8th avenue in Manhattan to celebrate their trip to NYC.&nbsp;  In the background of their selfie a recovering heroin addict steps out of a methadone clinic on the block. His friends and coworkers don’t know he has a problem but he is working hard to get clean.&nbsp;  The teens posted the photo online  That vacation photo was scraped by ClearView AI or another company using similar tech with less public exposure  Once captured, it would be trivial to identify him  Months or years later (remember, there is no expiration date on this data and data gets cheaper and cheaper every day) he applies for a job and is rejected during the background check.&nbsp;  Why? Because the background check vendor used by his prospective employer pays for a service that compares his photo to an index of “questionable locations and times/dates” including protest marches, known drug locations, riots, and methadone clinics. That data is then processed by an algorithm that scores him as a risk and he doesn’t get the job.&nbsp;  



<p>“Redlining” isn’t a horrible practice of the past, with AR we can do it in new and awful ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indirect data leakage is real: we leak other people’s data all the time. With AR, the panopticon is us: you and me and everyone around us who will be using this tech in their daily lives. This isn’t the state or Google watching us – AR is tech where the surveillance is user generated from my being able to get turn by turn directions in my personal HeadsUp Display. GAFAM are downstream and will exploit all that sweet sweet data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is going from Surveillance to “Sous-veillance”… but on steroids because we can’t opt out of going to work, or walking down the street, or running to the grocery, or riding the subway to a job interview or, or going to a protest march, or going to an AA meeting, or, or, or living our lives. A&nbsp; rebuttal to the, “I don’t have to worry about surveillance because I have nothing to hide”is that&nbsp; *we all* have to fight for privacy and reduced surveillance, especially those who have nothing to hide because some of our fellow humans are in marginalized communities who cannot fight for themselves and because this data can and will impact us in ways we can’t identify. The convenience of reading emails while walking to work shouldn’t possibly out someone walking into an AA meeting, or walking out of a halfway house, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No consumer, once they get the PERSONAL, INTIMATE value and the utility out of AR, will want to have the functionality of their AR platform limited or taken away by any law about privacy – even one that protects *their* privacy. This very neatly turns everyone using generally available AR technology into a surveillance node.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panopticon is us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a reason AR is a favorite plot device in Black Mirror.&nbsp;</p>



 It is going to be up to us.&nbsp; 



<p>For me, AR is the most “oh crap” thing out there, right now. I love the potential of the technology, yet I am concerned about how it will be abused if we aren’t VERY careful and VERY proactive, and based on how things have been going for the last 20+ years. I have a hard time being positive on where this is going to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a ton of people working on privacy in AR/VR/XR. The industry is still working on the “grammar” or “vocabulary” for these new XR-driven futures and there are a lot of people and organized efforts to prevent some of the problems mentioned above. We don’t have societal-level agreements on what is and is not acceptable when it comes to personal data NOW. In a lot of cases the industry is looking forward to ham-handedly trying to stuff Web2, Web1 and pre-Web business models (advertising) into this very sleek, new, super-powered platform. Governments love personal data even though they are legislating on it (in some effective and not effective ways).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tech (fashion, infrastructure) is moving much faster than culture and governance can react.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My belief, in respect to generally available Augmented Reality and the potential negative impacts on the public, is we are all in this together and the solution isn’t a tech or policy or legislative or user solution but a collective one. We talk about privacy a lot and what THEY (govs, adtech, websites, hardware, iot, services, etc.) are doing to US, but what about what we are doing to each other? Yup, individuals need to claim control over their digital lives, selves and data. Yes, Self Sovereign Identity as default state would help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To prevent the potential dystopias mentioned above, we need aggressive engagement by Users. ALL of us need to act in ways that protect our privacy/identity/data/digital self as well as those around us. WE are leaking our friends’ identity, correlated attributes, and data every single day. Not intentionally, but via our own digital (and soon physical thanks to AR) data exhaust. We need to demand to be treated better by the companies, orgs and govs we interact with on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Governments need to get their act together in regards to policy and legislation. There needs to be real consequences for bad behavior and poor stewardship of users data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses need to start listening to their customers and treating them like customers and not sheep to be shorn. Maybe companies like AVAST can step up and bring their security/privacy-know how to help users level-up. Maybe a company like Facebook can pivot and “have the user’s back” in this future.</p>



<p>IIW, MyData, CustomerCommons, VRM, and the Decentralized/Self Soverign Identity communities are all working towards changing this for the good of everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the day, along with need a *Digital Spring* where people stand up and say “no more” to all the BS happening right now (adtech, lack of agency, abysmal data practices, lack of liberty for digital selves) before we get to a world where user generated surveillance is commonplace.</p>



<p>(Yes dear reader, algorithms are a big part of this issue and I am only focused on the AR part of the problem with this piece. The problem is a big awful venn diagram of issues and actors with different incentives).</p>The post <a href="https://www.seanbohan.com/the-panopticon-is-going-to-be-us/">The Panopticon is (going to be) Us</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.seanbohan.com">SeanBohan.com</a>.

<p>I’ve been working on a simple CRUD API at <a href="https://nytimes.com" title="The New York Times">work</a>, with an eye to make a
nicely-designed REST interface for managing a single type of resource. It’s not
a complicated API, following best practices recommended by <a href="https://pages.apigee.com/rs/apigee/images/api-design-ebook-2012-03.pdf" title="Web API Design: Crafting Interfaces that Developers Love">Apigee</a> and
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design" title="Azure Docs: “RESTful web API design”">Microsoft</a>. It features exactly the sorts for APIs you’d expect if you’re
familiar with REST, including:</p>
 
 <code>POST /users</code>: Create a new user resource 
 <code>GET /users/{uid}</code>: Read a user resource 
 <code>PUT /users/{uid}</code>: Update a user resource 
 <code>DELETE /users/{uid}</code>: Delete a user resource 
 <code>GET /users?{params}</code>: Search for user resources 
 
<p>If you’re familiar with REST, you get the idea.</p>
<p>There is one requirement that proved a bit of design challenge. We will be
creating canonical ID for all resources managed by the service, which will
function as the primary key. The APIs above reference that key by the <code>{uid}</code>
path variable. However, we also need to support fetching a single resource by a
number of existing identifiers, including multiple legacy IDs, and natural keys
like, sticking to the users example, usernames and email addresses. Unlike the
search API, which returns an array of resources, we need a nice single API like
<code>GET /users/{uid}</code> that returns a single resource, but for a secondary key. What
should it look like?</p>
<p>None of my initial proposals were great (using <code>username</code> as the sample
secondary key, though again, we need to support a bunch of these):</p>
 
 <code>GET /users?username={username}</code> — consistent with search, but does it
return a collection like search or just a single entry like <code>GET /users/{uid}</code>? Would be weird not to return an array or not based on which
parameters were used. 
 <code>GET /users/by/username/{username}</code> — bit weird to put a preposition in
the URL. Besides, it might conflict with a planned API to fetch subsets of
info for a single resource, e.g., <code>GET /users/{uid}/profile</code>, which might
return just the profile object. 
 <code>GET /user?username={username}</code> — Too subtle to have the singular rather
than plural, but perhaps the most REST-ish. 
 <code>GET /lookup?obj=user&amp;username={username}</code> Use special verb, not very
RESTful 
 
<p>I asked around a coding Slack, posting a few possibilities, and friendly API
designers suggested some others. We agreed it was an interesting problem, easily
solved if there was just one alternate that never conflicts with the primary key
ID, such as <code>GET /users/{uid || username}</code>. But of course that’s not the problem
we have: there are a bunch of these fields, and they may well overlap!</p>
<p>There was some interest in <code>GET /users/by/username/{username}</code> as an
aesthetically-pleasing URL, plus it allows for</p>
 
 <code>/by</code> =&gt; list of unique fields 
 <code>/by/username/</code> =&gt; list of all usernames? 
 
<p>But again, it runs up against the planned use of subdirectories to return
sub-objects of a resource. One other I played around with was: <code>GET /users/user?username={username}</code>: The <code>user</code> sub-path indicates we want just one
user much more than <code>/by</code> does, and it’s unlikely we’d ever use <code>user</code> to name
an object in a user resource. But still, it overloads the path to mean one thing
when it’s <code>user</code> and another when it’s a UID.</p>
<p>Looking back through the options, I realized that what we really want is an
API that is identical to <code>GET /users/{uid}</code> in its behaviors and response, just
with a different key. So what if we just keep using that, as originally
suggested by a colleague as <code>GET /users/{uid || username}</code> but instead of just
the raw value, we encode the key name in the URL. Turns out, colons (<code>:</code>) are
valid in paths, so I defined this route:</p>
 
 <code>GET /users/{key}:{value}</code>: Fetch a single resource by looking up the
<code>{key}</code> with the <code>{value}</code>. Supported <code>{key}</code> params are <code>legacy_id</code>,
<code>username</code>, <code>email_address</code>, and even <code>uid</code>. This then becomes the canonical
“look up a user resource by an ID” API. 
 
<p>The nice thing about this API is that it’s consistent: all keys are treated the
same, as long as no key name contains a colon. Best of all, we can keep the
original <code>GET /users/{uid}</code> API around as an alias for <code>GET /users/uid:{value}</code>.
Or, better, continue to refer to it as the canonical path, since the <code>PUT</code> and
<code>DELETE</code> actions map only to it, and document the <code>GET /users/{key}:{value}</code> API
as accessing an alias for symlink for <code>GET /users/{uid}</code>. Perhaps return a
<code>Location</code> header to the canonical URL, too?</p>
<p>In any event, as far as I can tell this is a unique design, so maybe it’s too
weird or not properly RESTful? Would love to know of any other patterns designed
to solve the problem of supporting arbitrarily-named secondary unique keys.
What do you think?</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://plasmasturm.org">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a> started a discussion on this pattern in <a href="https://gist.github.com/ap/325e44a3bd094629943586e922af780f" title="Re: RFC: Restful Secondary Key API">a

The building is now under active renovation and the installation won’t last much longer, so I photographed it today and made a <a href="https://jonudell.info/vb">slideshow</a>. </p>
<p>I like this image especially, though I have no idea what it means.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you would like to buy some of her work, it’s available <a href="https://www.thevelvetbandit.com/shop">here</a>. I gather sales have been brisk since l’affaire AOC!</p>

  <p>Context: We never built an open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_system">reputation system</a>
for the internet. This was a mistake, and that’s one of the reasons why we have so much spam
and fake news.</p>
<p>But now, as governance takes an ever-more <a href="https://future.com/building-and-running-a-dao-why-governance-matters/">prominent role</a>
in technology, such as for the ever-growing list of decentralized projects e.g.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">DAOs</a>,
we need to figure out how to give more power to “better” actors within a given
community or context, and disempower or keep out the detractors and direct
opponents. All without putting a centralized authority in place.</p>
<p>Proposal: Here is a quite simple, but as I think rather powerful proposal. We use
an on-line discussion group as an example, but this is a generic protocol that
should be applicable to many other applications that can use reputation
scores of some kind.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s call the participants in the reputation system Actors. As this
is a decentralized, non-hierarchical system without a central power, there
is only one class of Actor. In the discussion group example, each person
participating in the discussion group is an Actor.</p>
 
<p>An Actor is a person, or an account, or a bot, or anything really that
has some ability to act, and that can be uniquely identified with an
identifier of some kind within the system. No connection to the “real”
world is necessary, and it could be as simple as a public key. There is
no need for proving that each Actor is a distinct person, or that a
person controls only one Actor. In our example, all discussion group
user names identify Actors.</p>
  
 

 
 
<p>The reputation system manages two numbers for each Actor, called the
Reputation Score S, and the Rating Tokens Balance R.
It does this in a way that it is impossible for those numbers to be
changed outside of this protocol.</p>
 
<p>For example, these numbers could be managed by a smart contract on a
blockchain which cannot be modified except through the outlined protocol.</p>
  
 

 
 
<p>The Reputation Score S is the current reputation of some Actor A,
with respect to some subject. In the example discussion group, S
might express the quality of content that A is contributing to the
group.</p>
 
<p>If there is more than one reputation subject we care about, there will
be an instance of the reputation system for each subject, even if it
covers the same Actors. In the discussion group example, the
reputation of contributing good primary content might be different
from reputation for resolving heated disputes, for example, and would
be tracked in a separate instance of the reputation system.</p>
  
 

 
 
<p>The Reputation Score S of any Actor automatically decreases over time.
This means that Actors have a lower reputation if they were rated highly
in the past, than if they were rated highly recently.</p>
 
<p>There’s a parameter in the system, let’s call it αS,
which reflects S’s rate of decay, such as 1% per month.</p>
  
 

 
 
<p>Actors rate each other, which means that they take actions, as a
result of which the Reputation Score of another Actor changes.
Actors cannot rate themselves.</p>
 
<p>It is out of scope for this proposal to discuss what specifically
might cause an Actor to decide to rate another, and how. This tends
to be specific to the community. For example, in a discussion group,
ratings might often happen if somebody reads newly posted content and
reacts to it; but it could also happen if somebody does not post new
content because the community values community members who exercise
restraint.</p>
  
 

 
 
<p>The Rating Tokens Balance R is the set of tokens an Actor A currently has
at their disposal to rate other Actors. Each rating that A performs
decreases their Rating Tokens Balance R, and increases the Reputation
Score S of the rated Actor by the same amount.</p>
 
 
<p>Every Actor’s Rating Tokens Balance R gets replenished on a regular basis,
such as monthly. The regular increase in R is proportional to the
Actor’s current Reputation Score S.</p>
 
<p>In other words, Actors with high reputation have a high ability to
rate other Actors. Actors with a low reputation, or zero reputation,
have little or no ability to rate other Actors. This is a key
security feature inhibiting the ability for bad actors to take over.</p>
  
 

 
 
<p>The Rating Token Balance R is capped to some maximum value Rmax,
which is a percentage of the current reputation of the Actor.</p>
 
<p>This prevents passive accumulation of rating tokens that then could be
unleashed all at once.</p>
  
 

 
 
<p>The overall number of new Ratings Tokens that is injected into the
system on a regular basis as replenishment is determined as a function
of the desired average Reputation Score of Actors in the system. This
enables Actors’ average Reputation Scores to be relatively constant over
time, even as individual reputations increase and decrease, and Actors join
and leave the system.</p>
 
<p>For example, if the desired average Reputation Score is 100 in a
system with 1000 Actors, if the monthly decay reduced the sum of all
Reputation Scores by 1000, 10 new Actors joined over the month,
and 1000 Rating Tokens were eliminated because of the cap, 3000 new
Rating Tokens (or something like that, my math may be off – sorry)
would be distributed, proportional to their then-current Reputation
Scores, to all Actors.</p>
  
 

 
 
<p>Optionally, the system may allow downvotes. In this case, the
rater’s Rating Token Balance still decreases by the number of Rating
Tokens spent, while the rated Actor’s Reputation also decreases.
Downvotes may be more expensive than upvotes.</p>
 
<p>There appears to be a dispute among reputation experts on whether
downvotes are a good idea, or not. Some online services support them,
some don’t, and I assume for good reasons that depend on the
nature of the community and the subject. Here, we can model this
simply by introducing another coefficient between 0 and 1, which
reflects the decrease of reputation of the downvoted Actor given
the number of Rating Tokens spent by the downvoting Actor. In case of 1,
upvotes cost the same as downvotes; in case of 0, no amount of downvotes
can actually reduce somebody’s score.</p>
  
 

<p>To bootstrap the system, an initial set of Actors who share the same
core values about the to-be-created reputation each
gets allocated a bootstrap Reputation Score. This gives them the
ability to receive Rating Tokens with which they can rate each other
and newly entering Actors.</p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
 
 
<p>Once set up, this system can run autonomously. No oversight is required,
other than perhaps adjusting some of the numeric parameters before
enough experience is gained what those parameters should be in a
real-world operation.</p>
 
 
<p>Bad Actors cannot take over the system until they have played by the
rules long enough to have accumulated sufficiently high reputation scores.
Note they can only acquire reputation by being good Actors in the eyes
of already-good Actors. So in this respect this system favors the
status quo and community consensus over facilitating revolution,
which is probably desirable: we don’t want a reputation score for
“verified truth” to be easily hijackable by “fake news”, for example.</p>
 
 
<p>Anybody creating many accounts aka Actors has only very limited ability
to increase the total reputation they control across all of their Actors.</p>
 
 
<p>This system appears to be generally-applicable. We discussed the example of
rating “good” contributions to a discussion group, but it appears this
could also be applied to things such as “good governance”, where
Actors rate higher who consistently perform activities others believe
are good for governance; their governance reputation score could then
be used to get them more votes in governance votes (such as to adjust
the free numeric parameters, or other governance activities of the
community).</p>
 
 
<p>Known issues:</p>
 
 
<p>This system does not distinguish reputation on the desired value (like
posting good content) vs reputation in rating other Actors (e.g. the
difference between driving a car well, and being able to judge others'
driving ability, such as needed for driving instructors. I can imagine
that there are some bad drivers who are good at judging others’ driving
abilities, and vice versa). This could probably
be solved with two instances of the system that are suitable connected
(details tbd).</p>
 
 
<p>There is no privacy in this system. (This may be a feature or a problem
depending on where it is applied.) Everybody can see everybody else’s
Reputation Score, and who rated them how.</p>
 
 
<p>If implemented on a typical blockchain, the financial incentives are
backwards: it would cost to rate somebody (a modifying operation to
the blockchain) but it would be free to obtain somebody’s score (a
read-only operation, which is typically free). However, rating somebody
does not create immediate benefit, while having access to ratings
does. So a smart contract would have to be suitably wrapped to present
the right incentive structure.</p>
 
 
<p>I would love your feedback.</p>
<p>This proposal probably should have a name. Because it can run autonomously,
I’m going to call it Autorep. And this is version 0.5. I’ll create
new versions when needed.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Last week I spoke at the memorial service for Craig Burton, a giant of the tech industry and my close friend. Here are, slightly edited, my remarks.</p>

<p>
    When I got word that Craig Burton had died, the news wasn't unexpected. He'd been ill with brain cancer for a some time and we knew his time was limited. Craig is a great man, a good person, a valued advisor, and a fabulous friend. Craig's life is an amazing story of success, challenge, and overcoming. 
</p>

<p>
    I first met Craig when I was CIO for Utah and he was the storied co-founder of Novell and the Burton Group. Dave Politis <a href="https://newsroom.siliconslopes.com/news/silicon-slopes-loses-a-tech-industry-og-rip-craig-burton/">calls Craig "one of Utah's tech industry Original Gangsters"</a>. I was a bit intimidated. Craig was starting a new venture with his longtime friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artnevarez/?originalSubdomain=mx">Art Navarez</a>, and wanted to talk to me about it. That first meeting was where I came to appreciate his famous wit and sharp, insightful mind. Over time, our relationship grew and I came to rely him whenever I had a sticky problem to unravel. One of Craig's talents was throwing out the conventional thinking and starting over to reframe a problem in ways that made solutions tractable. That's what he'd done at Novell when he moved up the stack to avoid the tangle of competing network standards and create a market in network services. 
</p>

<p>
    When Steve Fulling and I started <a href="http://www.kynetx.com">Kynetx</a> in 2007 we knew we needed Craig as an advisor. He mentored us—sometimes gently and sometimes with a swift kick. He advised us. He dove into the technology and developed applications, even though he wasn't a developer. He introduced us to one of our most important investors, and now good friend, Roy Avondet. He was our biggest cheerleader and we were grateful for his friendship and help. Craig wasn't just an advisor. He was fully engaged.
</p>


<p>
    One of Craig's favorite words was "ubiquity" and he lived his life consistent with that philosophy. Let me share three stories about Craig from the Kynetx days that I hope show a little bit of his personality:
</p>

 
     
        Steve, Craig, and I had flown to Seattle to meet with Microsoft. Flying with Craig is always an adventure, but that's another story. We met with some people on Microsoft's identity team including <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/12/in_memory_of_kim_cameron.shtml">Kim Cameron</a>, Craig's longtime friend and Microsoft's Chief Identity Architect. During the meeting someone, a product manager, said something stupid and you could just see Craig come up in his chair. Kim, sitting in the corner, was trying not to laugh because he knew what was coming. Craig, very deliberately and logically, took the PM's argument apart. He wasn't mean; he was patient. But his logic cut like a knife. He could be direct. Craig always took charge of a room.

        We hosted a developer conference at Kynetx called <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/impact">Impact</a>. Naturally, Craig spoke. But Craig couldn't just give a standard presentation. He sat, in a big chair on the stage and "held forth". He even had his guitar with him and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m5r5sS2AZw">sang during the presentation</a>. Craig loved music. The singing was all Craig. He couldn't just speak, he had to entertain and make people laugh and smile.
     
    
	<a></a>
	Craig and me at Kynetx Impact in 2011 (click to enlarge)

     
        At Kynetx, we hosted Free Lunch Friday every week. We'd feed lunch to our team, developers using our product, and anyone else who wanted to come visit the office. We usually brought in something like Jimmy Johns, Costco pizza, or J Dawgs. Not Craig. He and Judith took over the entire break room (for the entire building), brought in portable burners, and cooked a multi-course meal. It was delicious and completely over the top. I can see him with his floppy hat and big, oversized glasses, flamboyant and happy. Ubiquity! 
     
 


	<a></a>

<p>
    I've been there with Craig in some of the highest points of his life and some of the lowest.  I've seen him meet his challenges head on and rise above them. Being his friend was hard sometimes. He demanded much of his friends. But he returned help, joy, and, above all, love. He regretted that his choices hurt others besides himself. Craig loved large and completely.
</p>

<p>
    The last decade of Craig's life was remarkable. Craig, in 2011, was a classic tragic hero: noble, virtuous, and basking in past success but with a seemingly fatal flaw. But Craig's story didn't end in 2011. Drummond Reed, a mutual friend and fellow traveler wrote this for Craig's service:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Ten years ago, when Craig was at one of the lowest points in his life, I had the chance to join a small group of his friends to help intervene and steer him back on an upward path. It was an extraordinary experience I will never forget, both because of what I learned about Craig's amazing life, and what it proved about the power of love to change someone's direction. In fact Craig went on from there not just to another phase of his storied career, but to reconnect and marry his high school sweetheart.
    </p>
    
	<a></a>

    <p>
        Craig found real happiness in those last years of his life—and he deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Craig Burton was a mountain of a man, and a mountain of mind. And he moved the mountains of the internet for all of us. The digital future will be safer, richer, and more rewarding for all of us because of the gifts he gave us.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    Starting with that intervention, Craig began a long, painful path to eventual happiness and redemption.
</p>
 
     
        Craig overcame his internal demons. This was a battle royale. He had help from friends and family (especially his sisters), but in the end, he had to make the change, tamp down his darkest urges, and face his problems head on. His natural optimism and ability to see things realistically helped. When he finally turned his insightful mind on himself, he began to make progress.
     
     
        Craig had to live and cope with chronic health challenges, many of which were the result of decisions he'd made earlier in his life. Despite the limitations they placed on him, he met them with his usual optimism and love of life.
     
     
        Craig refound his faith. I'm not sure he ever really lost it, but he couldn't reconcile some of his choices with what he believed his faith required of him. In 2016, he decided to rejoin the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I was privileged to be able to baptize him. A great honor, that he was kind enough to give me.
     
     
        Craig also refound love and his high school sweetheart, Paula. The timing couldn't have been more perfect. Earlier and Craig wouldn't have been ready. Later and it likely would have been too late. They were married in 2017 and later had the marriage sealed in the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/seoul-korea-temple?lang=eng">Seoul Korea Temple</a>. Craig and Paula were living in Seoul at the time, engaged in another adventure. While Craig loved large, I believe he may have come to doubt that he was worthy of love himself. Paula gave him love and a reason to strive for a little more in the last years of his life.
     
    
	<a></a>
	Craig and Paula (click to enlarge)

 

<p>
    As I think about the last decade of Craig's life and his hard work to set himself straight, I'm reminded of the parable of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/20?lang=eng">Laborers in the Vineyard</a>. In that parable, Jesus compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a man hiring laborers for his vineyard. He goes to the marketplace and hires some, promising them a penny. He goes back later, at the 6th and 9th hours, and hires more. Finally he hires more laborers in the 11th hour. When it comes time to pay them, he gives everyone the same wage—a penny. The point of the parable is that it doesn't matter so much when you start the journey, but where you end up. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/my_faith">I'm a believer</a> in Jesus Christ and the power of his atonement and resurrection. I know Craig was too. He told me once that belief had given him the courage and hope to keep striving when all seemed lost. Craig knew the highest of the highs. He knew the lowest of the lows. The last few years of his life were among the happiest I ever saw him experience. He was a new man. In the end, Craig ended up in a good place.
</p>

<p>
    I will miss my friend, but I'm eternally grateful for his life and example.

<p>People who don’t listen to podcasts often ask people who do: “When do you find time to listen?” For me it’s always on long walks or hikes. (I do a lot of cycling too, and have thought about listening then, but wind makes that impractical and cars make it dangerous.) For many years my trusty podcast player was one or another version of the Creative Labs MuVo which, as the ad says, is “ideal for dynamic environments.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>At some point I opted for the convenience of just using my phone. Why carry an extra, single-purpose device when the multi-purpose phone can do everything? That was OK until my Quixotic attachment to Windows Phone became untenable. Not crazy about either of the alternatives, I flipped a coin and wound up with an iPhone. Which, of course, lacks a 3.5mm audio jack. So I got an adapter, but now the setup was hardly “ideal for dynamic environments.” My headset’s connection to the phone was unreliable, and I’d often have to stop walking, reseat it, and restart the podcast.</p>
<p>If you are gadget-minded you are now thinking: “Wireless earbuds!” But no thanks. The last thing I need in my life is more devices to keep track of, charge, and sync with other devices. </p>
<p>I was about to order a new MuVo, and I might still; it’s one of my favorite gadgets ever. But on a recent hike, in a remote area with nobody else around, I suddenly realized I didn’t need the headset at all. I yanked it out, stuck the phone in my pocket, and could hear perfectly well. Bonus: Nothing jammed into my ears. </p>
<p>It’s a bit weird when I do encounter other hikers. Should I pause the audio or not when we cross paths? So far I mostly do, but I don’t think it’s a big deal one way or another.</p>
<p>Adding more devices to solve a device problem amounts to doing the same thing and expecting a different result. I want to remain alert to the possibility that subtracting devices may be the right answer.</p>
<p>There’s a humorous coda to this story. It wasn’t just the headset that was failing to seat securely in the Lightning port. Charging cables were also becoming problematic. A friend suggested a low-tech solution: use a toothpick to pull lint out of the socket. It worked! I suppose I could now go back to using my wired headset on hikes. But I don’t think I will.</p>

  This week at IETF 114 in Philadelphia, we held a Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session on JSON Web Proofs (JWPs). JSON Web Proofs are a JSON-based representation of cryptographic inputs and outputs that enable use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), selective disclosure for minimal disclosure, and non-correlatable presentation.

<p>This week at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/114/">IETF 114 in Philadelphia</a>, we held a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-miller-json-web-proofs/">Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session on JSON Web Proofs (JWPs)</a>.  JSON Web Proofs are a JSON-based representation of cryptographic inputs and outputs that enable use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), selective disclosure for minimal disclosure, and non-correlatable presentation.  JWPs use the three-party model of Issuer, Holder, and Verifier utilized by Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>The BoF asked to reinstate the IETF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/">JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) working group</a>.  We asked for this because the JOSE working group participants already have expertise creating simple, widely-adopted JSON-based cryptographic formats, such as JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Key (JWK).  The JWP format would be a peer to JWS and JWE, reusing elements that make sense, while enabling use of new cryptographic algorithms whose inputs and outputs are not representable in the existing JOSE formats.</p>
<p>Presentations given at the BoF were:</p>

<p>You can view the BoF minutes at <a href="https://notes.ietf.org/notes-ietf-114-jwp">https://notes.ietf.org/notes-ietf-114-jwp</a>.  A useful discussion ensued after the presentations.  Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to finish the BoF in the one-hour slot. The BoF questions unanswered in the time allotted would have been along the lines of “Is the work appropriate for the IETF?”, “Is there interest in the work?”, and “Do we want to adopt the <a href="https://github.com/json-web-proofs/json-web-proofs/blob/main/charter-ietf-jose-03.md">proposed charter</a>?”.  Discussion of those topics is now happening on the jose@ietf.org mailing list.  Join it at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/jose to participate.  Roman Danyliw, the Security Area Director who sponsored the BoF, had suggested that we hold a virtual interim BoF to complete the BoF process before IETF 115 in London.  Hope to see you there!</p>

   <p>I have the deepest respect and high regard for <a href="https://www.wardleymaps.com/">Wardley Maps</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework">Cynefin framework</a>.&nbsp; They share much of the same background and evolution. Both are extremely helpful and modern frameworks for understanding, much like Porter’s five forces model was back in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br><p>I adopted the same terminology (novel, emergent, good and best) when writing about the development of governance for 2050. In the article <a href="https://opengovernance.net/revising-the-s-curve-in-an-age-of-emergence-6b3a637a66c5">Revising the S-Curve in an age of emergence</a>, I used the S-curve as it has helped us on several previous journeys. It supported our understanding of adoption and growth; it can now be critical in helping us understand the development and evolution of governance towards a sustainable future. An evolutionary S-curve is more applicable than ever as we enter a new phase of emergence. Our actions and behaviours emerge when we grasp that all parts of our ecosystem interact as a more comprehensive whole.</p><p></p><p>A governance S-curve can help us unpack new risks in this dependent ecosystem so that we can make better judgments that lead to better outcomes. What is evident is that we need far more than proof, lineage and provenance of data from a wide ecosystem if we are going to create better judgement environments, we need a new platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The image below takes the same terminology again but moves the Cynefin framework from the four quadrant domains to consider what happens when you have to optimise for more things - as in the <a href="https://peakparadox.com">Peak Paradox</a> model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>The yellow outer disc is about optimising for single outcomes and purposes.&nbsp; In so many ways, this is simple as there is only one driving force, incentive or purpose, which means the relationship between cause and effect is obvious.&nbsp;</p><p>The first inner purple ring recognises that some decision-making has a limited number of dependent variables.&nbsp; System thinking is required to unpick, but it is possible to come up with an optimal outcome.</p><p>The pink inner ring is the first level where the relationship between cause and effect requires analysis or some form of investigation and/ or the application of expert knowledge.&nbsp; This is difficult and requires assumptions, often leading to tension and conflict. &nbsp; Optimising is not easy, if at all possible.</p><p>The inner black circle - where peak paradox exists.&nbsp; Complexity thrives as the relationship between cause and effect can only be perceived in hindsight.&nbsp; Models can post-justify outcomes but are unlikely to scale or be repeatable.&nbsp; There is a paradox because the same information can have two (or more) meaning and outcomes.</p><p>The joy of any good framework is that it can always give new understanding and insight. What a Wardley Map then adds is movement, changing of position from where you are to where you will be.&nbsp;</p> Why does this matter? <p>Because what we choose to optimise for is different from what a team of humans or a company will optimise for. Note I use “optimise”, but equality could be “maximise”. These are the yin/yan of effectiveness and efficiency, a continual movement. The purpose ideals are like efficacy - are you doing the right thing?</p><p>What we choose to optimise for is different from what a team of humans or a company will optimise for.</p><p>We know that it is far easier to make a decision when there is clarity of purpose.&nbsp; However, when we have to optimise for different interests that are both dependent and independent - decision-making enters zones that are hard and difficult. It requires judgement.&nbsp; In complexity is where leadership can shine as they can move from simple and obvious decision-making in the outer circle to utilising collective intelligence of the wider team as the decisions become more complex. Asking “what is going on here” and understanding it is outside a single person's reach.&nbsp; High functions and diverse teams are critical for decisions where paradoxes may exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>When it gets towards the difficult areas, leadership will first determine if they are being asked to optimise for a policy or to align to an incentive; this shines the first spotlight on a zone where they need to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark last week as the end of the social networking era, which began with the rise of
Friendster in 2003, shaped two decades of internet growth, and now closes with
Facebook’s rollout of a sweeping TikTok-like redesign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sweeping statement. But I think he’s right:</p>
<p>Facebook is fundamentally an advertising machine. Like other Meta products are. There
aren’t really about “technologies that bring the world closer together”, as the
<a href="https://about.facebook.com/technologies/">Meta homepage</a> has it. At least not
primarily.</p>
<p>This advertising machine has been amazingly successful, leading to a recent quarterly revenue
of over $50 per user in North America
(<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/">source</a>).
And Meta certainly has driven this hard, otherwise it would not have been in
the news for overstepping the consent of its users year after year, scandal
after scandal.</p>
<p>But now a better advertising machine is in town: TikTok. This new advertising machine
is powered not by friends and family, but by an addiction algorithm. This addiction
algorithm figures out your points of least resistance, and pours down one advertisement
after another down your throat. And as soon as you have swalled one more, you scroll a
bit more, and by doing so, you are asking for more advertisements, because of the
addiction. This addiction-based advertising machine is probably close to the
theoretical maximum of how many advertisements one can pour down somebody’s throat.
An amazing work of art, as an engineer I have to admire it. (Of course that admiration
quickly changes into some other emotion of the disgusting sort, if you have any kind
of morals.)</p>
<p>So Facebook adjusts, and transitions into another addiction-based advertising machine.
Which does not really surprise anybody I would think.</p>
<p>And because it was never about “bring[ing] the world closer together”, they drop that mission
as if they never cared. (That’s because they didn’t. At least MarkZ didn’t, and
he is the sole, unaccountable overlord of the Meta empire. A two-class stock structure gives
you that.)</p>
<p>With the giant putting their attention elsewhere, where does this leave social networking?
Because the needs and the wants to “bring[ing] the world closer together”, and to
catch up with friends and family are still there.</p>
<p>I think it leaves social networking, or what will replace it, in a much better place.
What about this time around we build products whose primary focus is actually
the stated mission? Share with friends and family and the world, to bring it
together (not divide it)! Instead of something unrelated, like making lots of
ad revenue! What a concept!</p>
<p>Imagine what social networking could be!! The best days of social networking
are still ahead. Now that the pretenders are leaving, we can actually start
solving the problem. Social networking is dead. Long live what will emerge
from the ashes. It might not be called social networking, but it will be,
just better.</p>

how the term is used these days. Might as well post what I found: 
 
 better, fairer internet

 no censorship (content, finance etc) 
 democratized content creation 
 crypto-verified information correctness 
 privacy 
 decentralization 
 composability 
 collaboration 
 human-centered

<p>Some of this is clearly aspirational, perhaps on the other side of likely.
Also not exactly what I would say if asked. But nevertheless an interesting list.</p>

<p>It’s been a year since my last post… Overwhelmed by trying to keep up with the fast flows of information, and my own internal processes, I took a break from social media, stopped working on most of the projects I had begun, and turned inward.</p>

<p>So what exactly have I doing with all that time?</p>



 Developing the backend for a sustainable weekly newsletter 

<p>I’d been chatting with <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Identity Woman</a> for around a year, after contacting her about the potential for our collaborating on decentralized identity. At some point, she proposed the idea of writing a newsletter together, under the <a href="https://identosphere.net">Identosphere.net</a> domain.</p>

<p>Instead of jumping in head first, like I usually do, we’ve spent a lot of time figuring out how to run a newsletter, sustainably, with as few third party services as possible, while I’m learning my way around various web-tools.</p>

<p>We’re tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with. But this problem of fast-moving information streams isn’t unique to digital identity, and I’d like to share this process for others to benefit from.</p>

 GitHub Pages 

<p>I started in Decentralized ID creating freelance content, and ended up building an Awsome List, to organize my findings. Once that list outgrew the Awesome format, I began learning to create static web-sites with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

 
   <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack</a>  (a resource I’ve created along that journey) 
 

<p>Static Websites are great for security and easy to set up, but if you’re trying to create any type of business online, you’re gonna want some forms so you can begin collecting e-mail subscribers! Forms are not supported natively through Jekyll or GitHub Pages.</p>

 Enter Staticman 

<p><a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman">Staticman</a> is a comments engine for static websites, but can be used for any kind of form, with the proper precautions.</p>

<p>It can be deployed to Heroku with a click of a button, made into a GitHub App, or run on your own server.  Once set up, it will submit a pull-request to your repository with the form details (and an optional <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">mailgun</a> integration).</p>

<p>I set it up on my own server and created a <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">bot account on GitHub</a> with permissions to a private repository for the Staticman app to update with subscriptions e-mails to.</p>

<p>Made the form, and a <code>staticman.yml</code> config file in the root of the private repository where I’m collecting e-mail addresses.</p>

 The Subscription Form 

   <code>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subscribe for Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;form class="staticman" method="POST" action="https://identosphere.net/staticman/v2/entry/infominer33/subscribe/master/subscribe"&gt;
    &lt;input name="options[redirect]" type="hidden" value="https://infominer.xyz/subscribed"&gt;
    &lt;input name="options[slug]" type="hidden" value="infohub"&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[name]" type="text" placeholder="Name (optional)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[email]" type="email" placeholder="Email"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[message]" type="text" placeholder="Areas of Interest (optional)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="links" type="hidden" placeholder="links"&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
</code>   
 The staticman.yml config in the root of my private subscribe repo 

   <code>subscribe:
  allowedFields: ["name", "email", "message"]
  allowedOrigins: ["infominer.xyz","identosphere.net"]
  branch: "master"
  commitMessage: "New subscriber: {fields.name}"
  filename: "subscribe-{@timestamp}"
  format: "yaml"
  generatedFields:
    date:
      type: "date"
      options:
        format: "iso8601" 
  moderation: false
  name: "infominer.xyz"
  path: "{options.slug}" 
  requiredFields: ["email"]
</code>   

<p>It seems to be <a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/366#issuecomment-726016008">struggling with GitHub’s recent move</a> to change the name of your default branch from master to main (for new repositories). So, unfortunately, I had to re-create a master branch to get it running.</p>

 Planet Pluto Feed Reader 

<p>Trying to keep up with Self-Sovereign Identity, kaliya and I started out with Feedly, but the pricing for collaborative feed creation is nearly <a href="https://feedly.com/i/pro/welcome">$50 a month</a> for two users. There was no way I could go with that for very long.</p>

<p>One of the most promising projects I found, in pursuit of keeping up with all the info, is <a href="https://github.com/web-work-tools/awesome-planet-pluto">Planet Pluto Feed Reader</a>, by Gerald Bauer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet (Software)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the uninitiated, I should add that websites generate RSS feeds that can be read by a newsreader, allowing users to keep up with posts from multiple locations without needing to visit each site individually. You very likely use RSS all the time without knowing, for example, your podcast player depends on RSS feeds to bring episodes directly to your phone.</p>

<p>What <a href="https://github.com/feedreader/">Pluto Feed reader</a> does is just like your podcast app, except, instead of an application on your phone that only you can browse, it builds a simple webpage from the feeds you add to it, that can be published on GitHub, your favorite static web-hosting service, or on your own server in the cloud.</p>

<p><a href="http://planet-templates.github.io/"></a></p>

<p>Pluto is built with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, using the <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/">ERB templating</a> language for <a href="https://github.com/planet-templates">web-page design</a>.</p>

<p>One of the cool things about ERB is it lets you use any ruby function in your web-page template, supporting any capability you might want to enable while rendering your feed. This project has greatly helped me to learn the basics of Ruby while customizing its templates to suit my needs.</p>

 Feed Search 

<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub-Radar">RSSHub Radar</a> browser extension to find feeds for sites while I’m browsing. However, this would be a lot of work when I want to get feeds for a number of sites at once.</p>

<p>I found a few simple python apps that find feeds for me. They aren’t perfect, but they do allow me to find feeds for multiple sites at the same time, all I have to do is format the query and hit enter.</p>

<p>As you can see below, these are not fully formed applications, just a few lines of code. To run them, it’s necessary to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>, install the package with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> (<code>pip install feedsearch-crawler</code>), and type <code>python</code> at the command prompt, which takes you to a Python terminal that will recognize these commands.</p>

<p>From there you can type\paste python commands for demonstration, practice, or for simple scripts like this. I could also put the following scripts into their own feedsearch.py file and type <code>python feedsearch.py</code>,  but I haven’t gotten around to doing anything like that.</p>

<p>Depending on the site, and the features you’re interested in, either of these feed seekers has their merits.</p>

 Feedsearch Crawler 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/DBeath/feedsearch-crawler">DBeath/feedsearch-crawler</a> 
 

   <code>from feedsearch_crawler import search
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.DEBUG)
import output_opml
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    feeds = search(items)
    output_opml(feeds).decode()
    logger = logging.getLogger("feedsearch_crawler")
</code>   

 Feed seeker 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker">mitmedialab/feed_seeker</a> 
 

   <code>from feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    for url in generate_feed_urls(items):
        print(url)
</code>   

 GitHub Actions 

<p>Pluto Feed Reader is great, but I needed to find a way for it to run a regular schedule, so I wouldn’t have to run the command every time I wanted to check for new feeds. For this, I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a>.</p>

<p>This is an incredible feature of GitHub that allows you to spin up a virtual machine, install an operating system, dependencies supporting your application, and whatever commands you’d like to run, on a schedule.</p>

   <code>name: Build BlogCatcher

  schedule:
    # This action runs 4x a day.
    - cron:  '0/60 */4 * * *'
  push:
    paths:

    - 'planetid.ini'

 Identosphere Blogcatcher 

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher">Identosphere Blogcatcher</a> (<a href="https://github.com/identosphere/planetid-reboot">source</a>) is a feed aggregator for personal blogs of people who’ve been working on digital identity through the years, inspired by the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/">Planet Identity</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a page for <a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/companies/">companies</a>, and another for <a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/organizations/">organizations</a> working in the field.</p>

 Identosphere Weekly Highlights 

<p>Last month, <a href="https://twitter.com/identitywoman">Kaliya</a> suggested that since we have these pages up and running smoothly, we were ready to start our newsletter. This is just a small piece of the backend information portal we’re working towards, and not enough to make this project as painless and comprehensive as possible, but we had enough to get started.</p>

<p>Every weekend we get together, browse the BlogCatcher, and share essential content others in our field will appreciate.</p>

<p>We’ll be publishing our 6th edition, at the start of next week, and our numbers are doing well!</p>

<p></p>

<p>This newsletter is free, and a great opportunity for us to work together on something consistent while developing a few other ideas.</p>

 <a href="https://identosphere.substack.com/">identosphere.substack.com</a> 

<p>Setting up a newsletter without third-party intermediaries is more of a challenge than I’m currently up for, so we’ve settled on Substack for now, which seems to be a trending platform for tech newsletters.</p>

<p>It has a variety of options for both paid and free content, and you can read our content before subscribing.</p>

 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">Support us on Patreon</a> 

<p>While keeping the newsletter free, we are accepting contributions via Patreon. (yes another intermediary, but we can draw upon a large existing userbase, and it’s definitely easier than setting up a self-hosted alternative.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere"></a></p>

<p>So far, we have enough to cover a bit more than server costs, and this will ideally grow to support our efforts, and enable us to sustainably continue developing these open informational projects.</p>

 Python, Twitter Api, and GitHub Actions 

<p>Since we’re publishing this newsletter, and I’ve gotten a better handle on my inner state, I decided it was time to come back to twitter. However, I knew I couldn’t do it the old way, where I manually re-tweeted everything of interest, spending hours a day scrolling multiple accounts trying to stay abreast of important developments.</p>

<p>Instead, I dove into the twitter api. The benefits of using twitter programmatically can’t be understated. For my first project, I decided to try an auto-poster, which could enable me to keep an active twitter account, without having to regularly pay attention to twitter.</p>

<p>I found a simple guide <a href="https://dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/">How To Write a Twitter Bot with Python and tweepy</a> composed of a dozen lines of python. That simple script posts a tweet to your account, but I wanted to post from a pre-made list, and so figured out how to read from a <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml</a> file, and then used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a> to run the script on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>While that didn’t result in anything I’m ready to share here, quite yet, somewhere during that process I realized that I could write python. After playing around with Ruby, in ERB, to build the BlogCatcher, and running various python scripts that other people wrote, tinkering where necessary, eventually I had pieced together enough knowledge I could actually write my own code!</p>

 Decentralized ID Weekly Twitter Collections 

<p>With that experience as a foundation I knew I was ready to come <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/">back to Twitter</a>, begin trying to make more efficient use of its wealth of knowledge, and see about keeping up my accounts without losing too much hair.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://gist.github.com/vickyqian/f70e9ab3910c7c290d9d715491cde44c">a script that searches twitter</a> for a variety of keywords related to decentralized identity, and write the tweet text and some other attributes to a csv file. From there, I can sort through those tweets, and save only the most relevant, and publish a few hundred tweets about decentralized identity to a weekly <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-a-twitter-collection-via-api-1378ecfe20df">twitter collection</a>, that make our job a lot easier than going to 100’s of websites to find out what’s happening. :D</p>

<p>Soon, these will be regularly published to <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">decentralized-id.com</a>, which I found out is an approved method of re-publishing tweets, unlike the ad hoc method I was using before, sharing them to discord channels (which grabs metadata and displays the preview image \ text), exporting their contents and re-publishing that.</p>

<p>I do intend to share my source for all that after I’ve gotten the kinks worked out, and set it running on an action.</p>

 Twitter collections I’ve made so far 

 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322735918386733057">Self Sovereign ID 101</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322785746915307520">October Week 5 #SSI #DID</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1325219075463712769">November Week 1 #SSI #DID</a> 
 

 Decentralized-ID.com 

<p>Now we have a newsletter, and are seeking patrons, it seemed appropriate to work on developing <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/posts/">decentralized-id.com</a>, cleaning up some of its hastily thrown together parts, and adding a bunch of content to better represent the decentralized identity space.</p>

<p>That said, I’ve not given up on <a href="https://bitcoinfo.xyz">Bitcoin</a>, or <a href="https://sourcecrypto.pub">Crypto</a>. On the contrary, I’m sure this work is only expanding my future capacity to continue working to fulfil the original vision of those resources.</p>

 Web-Work.Tools 

<p>With the information and skills i’ve gathered over the past year, <a href="https://web-work.tools">web-work.tools</a> was starting to look pretty out of date, relative to the growth of my understanding.</p>

<p>I updated <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack \ Extended Resources</a> quite a lot to reflect those learnings, and separate the wheat from the chaff of the links I gathered when I was first figuring out how to use GitHub pages.</p>

 Thanks for stopping by!
